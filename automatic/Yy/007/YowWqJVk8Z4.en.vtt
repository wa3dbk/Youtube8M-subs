00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 who were the superstars of the olympic 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.839
 Play the Winter Games in Calgary now 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 it was never known to martin 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.580
 was the triple gold medalist 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.620
 it from German view marina kiehl or 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.070
 which may be a very complete 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 another 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.680
 the eagle the darling of the masses 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 the hearts always so so 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 Shortsighted is that he does not see 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 what's up to him when he turns on now 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.180
 the starting track goes down and with 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.739
 about 100 km per hour over the bakken 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.739
 goes the adwords 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.780
 kavai he good the second jump 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.200
 survived 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.420
 look what's going on 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.430
 everywhere are the newspapers in the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.320
 tv stations of calgary 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.940
 Canada will be over some states 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.750
 reports when he is among the very 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.300
 great 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.570
 this sports party the canon has barely 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.860
 less headlines for the first time 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.260
 playing with us in germany 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.260
 Michael called the adwords 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.630
 I have to say there was hardly one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.340
 athlete who has brought more sympathies 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.880
 in these olympic games in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.649
 calgary 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 i know that even people even 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.159
 nothing with sport on hat had said 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.860
 when the boy comes call me 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.970
 quickly get out of the kitchen again as 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.610
 she then went back now 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.500
 were you a national hero or 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.030
 they took that over people 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.030
 they did not land further up front 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:07.830
 a welcome at home but more real 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.970
 steinlehner overwhelming than me two 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.190
 weeks two weeks 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.780
 I really did not know what at home 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.170
 proceed and the atmosphere was at home 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.910
 all would have seen me all 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.790
 wanted to know how it would go 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.630
 and then she came home 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.030
 after seeing a new British 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.030
 had set a record was the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.350
 Welcoming fantastic they stood one 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.269
 One hundred percent behind me 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.890
 if you're in england somewhere today 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.600
 The road will go immediately 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.109
 Hundreds of people are immediately recognized 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.150
 I just have to shoulder my shoulder 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.790
 Make animals and crowd the people 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 They want autographs to have photos 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.650
 brendel kusst will be all that is 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.600
 really amazing how do you explain 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.160
 that's because normally you want to 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.269
 always only the winners look after 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.269
 no rooster crows no cock 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:14.319
 I think that has something to do with it 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.840
 How should I be expression of my door 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:23.550
 with my attitude times his attitude 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.550
 just a bit to my sport 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.959
 I could not win at all 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.510
 only for two years 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.280
 I wanted to go there too 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.130
 Enjoy and that's what I did 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.330
 The crowd behind me I would like to 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.640
 and it was born and also my fight 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.910
 to come back was important people 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.440
 have me on as a fighter I jump 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.810
 after all, he has been for two years 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.150
 Everyone said you need eight years 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 you really can jump and I have 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.110
 used only five months 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.940
 my whole spasm last two 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.390
 years should just be admitted 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.880
 people have watched and they have 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.769
 my fighting spirit admires people like that 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.290
 Martini knows everything cleared up 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.959
 has brought three gold medals has been talking 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.880
 he actually is with them or is he 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:27.430
 so arrogant that basically says what 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:29.320
 Does he really want to be the first? 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.590
 Therefore , we do not welcome, we laugh 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.590
 together 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.370
 Unfortunately, we speak very little English 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:45.210
 do not come so into the conversation 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:45.210
 otherwise a good relationship 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.130
 he does not like that people in photography 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.039
 and us but to the others 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.900
 jump very nice keyword press in 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.030
 a british newspaper stood over her 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.590
 that they basically do not jump further 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:10.860
 as a dog when you call chocolate 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:10.860
 she does not really go there 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.690
 I have to learn and I had 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.470
 No money at all 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.750
 training opportunities uk 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.830
 nothing at all 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.670
 Last summer as in Switzerland 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:32.310
 I did not have any equipment 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.360
 no corresponding sports nutrition 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.890
 Anyway, I should have just come 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.730
 now I have money that I can 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.919
 Do a good trainer and everyone 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.240
 look forward to it now and hope 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.770
 that I jump as far as 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.230
 martin corners i hope in three to four 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.810
 I am also as far as years is then 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.000
 that actually with eddie and the women 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.070
 there is one mean one 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.860
 Schreiberling said she saw 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:03.669
 like an unfinished study from the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:05.110
 Workshop of evolution is the way it is now 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:08.140
 So that the girls after them 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.340
 inside and they make the front door 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.610
 must just as they have just described 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.610
 to have 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:27.820
 not really I am already 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:31.060
 worse was called in run too 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.700
 not in women 's women but like that 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.650
 is it fair so i believe if you can 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.700
 a man it can be that he 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.860
 next gold medal in ski jumping 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.229
 wins at the next play then 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:52.410
 Are you that I am looking forward to it 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:55.150
 she is doing it now draw now 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.870
 the money together on one 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.200
 Trainer 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.060
 I can go there 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.460
 where the snow is where the art pave 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.590
 There is really no reason now 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.680
 more why I do not land at the top 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.630
 can only have of me now if 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.400
 I accordingly premiere then I come 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.930
 also there in germany if you are in 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.550
 many treat that they win gold 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.550
 All the best, thank you the answer
