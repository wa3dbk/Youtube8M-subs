 Windows 10 is coming this is today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:11.519
 topic worth knowing and therefore cordial 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:13.500
 welcome to fairrank tv with windows 10 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.509
 microsoft recently presented the new one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 windows version and skips it 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.130
 a complete version number windows 9 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.820
 there will probably be no more 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.769
 microsoft offers developers the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
 possibility of windows 10 already 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.140
 via the microsoft insider program too 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 use 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.920
 what should be considered here and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
 which updates Windows 10 brings 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.669
 we introduce you in this video for 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.649
 Windows 10 is supposed to be a common one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.640
 platform for pcs tablets and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.710
 create smartphones 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.379
 with that the worried children have windows 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.910
 phone and windows rt disused this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.050
 both systems were exclusive 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 pre-installed with the corresponding ones 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 mobile devices available and could 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 can not be bought individually 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.239
 rt equipped with windows 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.770
 tablet were not bestsellers and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.890
 Thus, the distribution of the most 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 Manufacturers promptly set windows 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 10 should be a variety of devices 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 support and is on it 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 various displays and input 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 types such as keyboard mouse 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.439
 or touchscreen should be designed 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.939
 the system is the respective one 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.159
 adapt conditions flexibly 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.630
 Thus, apps are on all windows 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.200
 devices are installed and used 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.080
 can 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.520
 new startup windows 10 comes with 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960
 a mixture of the start menus 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.970
 windows 7 and windows 8 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.130
 this is where the classic view changes 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.869
 The tile surface expands the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.729
 tiles or the apps should 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.100
 can be freely adapted by the user 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.200
 the search function is now in the start menu 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.210
 and is integrated in the task bar 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.540
 shows hits from the local device 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.640
 as well as from the internet 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.170
 apps are running in windows the apps are running 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.909
 now like traditional software in 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.740
 windows and thus are not like 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.350
 so far under windows 8 in full screen mode 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 open the biggest advantage here is 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.710
 that the app window is finally here too 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.020
 over the known three buttons 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.460
 maximizes minimized and closed 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.870
 become 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.490
 In addition, windows 10 is said to be manifold 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.280
 ways to arrange the app 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.470
 provide windows on the desktop 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 new task view button and several 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.240
 desktops windows 10 offers a new one 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.280
 task view button for the change 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.890
 between open folder files as well 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.440
 So apps are actually what's been over 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.020
 the key combination alt + tab 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 possible is still available now 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 several desktops on those then too 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 different programs can run 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.630
 and of course with different ones 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.130
 links can be provided 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.740
 last edited files better 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 find in the file explorer like windows 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.660
 10 now the last used files and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.160
 folder prominently displayed so that one 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.050
 Faster access to this possible 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.880
 is of course also possible as before 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.010
 favorites for the commonly used 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.810
 folders and files are created 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 who is already looking up now 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.680
 Want to throw windows 10 can 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.000
 participate in windows insider program and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.370
 thus become a beta tester 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.780
 But beware the operating system should 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 definitely on a separate 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.800
 The computer will not be installed in 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.340
 involved in a productive environment 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.440
 is 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.660
 namely, together with windows 10 will be 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.030
 various loose installed all the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.280
 Inputs are via the keyboard or 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.540
 even record by language and on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880
 transmit microsoft 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.260
 continue to be information too 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.060
 all others installed 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.750
 programs on the respective device 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.030
 transmitted 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.400
 Information about the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.260
 loading times of programs as well as too 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.570
 the time to open folders 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.100
 needed is transmitted 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.690
 it also records which files with 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.180
 which programs are opened 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.680
 So everything is recorded one 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.540
 deinstallation of the loose is loud 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.459
 Microsoft only through a complete 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.350
 Reinstall an official 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.330
 available windows version currently 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.390
 For example, windows 8 possible 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.510
 a nightmare for everyone 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.070
 Data protection officer 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.810
 certainly this is the procedure 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.640
 not with german data protection law 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.450
 compatible 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.130
 However, microsoft points in the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.480
 privacy policy to the insider 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.459
 program on the loose 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.140
 Of course, these provisions must be of 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.760
 accepted by the participants of the program 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.530
 become 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.910
