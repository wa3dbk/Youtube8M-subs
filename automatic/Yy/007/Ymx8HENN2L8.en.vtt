it's up oh boy does that open

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.259 
it's up oh boy does that open
no<00:03:06.379> of<00:03:06.500> opportunity<00:03:07.159> I<00:03:07.310> just<00:03:07.700> wouldn't<00:03:08.030> set

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
no of opportunity I just wouldn't set

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.149

this<00:03:08.450> one<00:03:08.659> up<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.080> kicker<00:03:09.319> I'd<00:03:09.890> be

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
this one up for the kicker I'd be

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.710 
this one up for the kicker I'd be
looking<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> end<00:03:10.909> zone<00:03:11.030> yeah<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.510> think

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
looking for the end zone yeah I think

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720 
looking for the end zone yeah I think
teams<00:03:12.200> get<00:03:12.439> too<00:03:12.650> conservative<00:03:13.430> when<00:03:13.579> they

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
teams get too conservative when they

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.130 
teams get too conservative when they
know<00:03:13.970> that<00:03:14.180> they<00:03:14.329> just<00:03:14.569> heard<00:03:14.720> down<00:03:14.900> and<00:03:15.049> they

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
know that they just heard down and they

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.539 
know that they just heard down and they
need<00:03:15.319> to<00:03:15.439> get<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.890> 15<00:03:18.310> empty<00:03:19.310> backfield
