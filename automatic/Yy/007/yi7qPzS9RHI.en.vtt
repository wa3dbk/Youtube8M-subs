 Speak up, everybody, how are you? 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.759
 They are imagining that they are everyone. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 well and I came to make another video because 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.320
 I'm on the job so straight saw all 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.099
 doing tatá week then deserves 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.350
 less a Celtic an incentive type like that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 because such 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.400
 Anyway, how are you today I came? 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.100
 talk a little bit about making a video 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.939
 where I have video conversation and heard of 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.529
 today it's about who does not want to love who does not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.510
 wants to like someone is clear who 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
 the machine does not want to live who does not want 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.829
 feel a full trust in the link you 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 It's on the side that is not your family, right? 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.200
 another person to see you do life 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 things is the gostosudas means is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.940
 tasty or should be remains unknown 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.950
 Anyway, these days, people are so 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.170
 afraid to love the love is something so 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.059
 this thing of detachment and not 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.579
 I know it's such a cold thing, it's one thing. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.800
 so silly that we lose our spirit 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:07.020
 of the delicious things that life has all 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.570
 world suffers from pain and does not believe in 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.310
 in love and in things because until sometimes 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.869
 people get the hopes that the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 We have other people 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.360
 sometimes we like someone that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 person and for reasons 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 happens and we take the trust of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.659
 all other people because of a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.580
 person or two people 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.009
 so this is a bad thing and then we 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.560
 begins to work differently and 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 begins to realize that we will not 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.329
 donate half of the people who want the 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.579
 another gives himself entirely and creates all 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 this case is detachment because I did it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.520
 I personally donated one hour to arrive. 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:50.490
 What about the life you 're proud of? 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 so softened that what is pride is not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 I am confident and calm happy 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.619
 you 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.479
 You are Maria Natalia Luiza. 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.850
 I do not know Bruna 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.640
 morgana If you're there I like you and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.280
 I am confident that I can me 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.400
 donate all talk 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.810
 the r movies i did what i had 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.959
 to do that I had to donate myself 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.090
 I had to be happy, I understood then 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.250
 I think it's people these days. 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.020
 should like to like the 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.819
 people are less afraid of surrendering 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.319
 I also think you should not 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.200
 deliver on hu 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.180
 but I do not think you should stop 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.770
 believe I think your big bid 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.330
 of everything is not just to deliver any 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.400
 person who appears but does not 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.020
 believe because you can not find the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.239
 Corner understood 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.320
 everyone always meets someone and 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.209
 people only find someone when we 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.570
 his eyes open wide enough to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.700
 let this person find people right 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.110
 I believe that things happen and I 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.780
 Does not have a girlfriend, does he have anything? 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.630
 here alone has ciabatta néné bread 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.430
 I'm happy, I'm not. I do not think so. 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.769
 have trouble worrying there are problems 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.290
 that we can solve everything right 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.450
 So what to worry about if people 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.430
 can solve legal problems that the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.269
 people can not solve it so that 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.739
 to worry 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.319
 It does not give me not to do what I love 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.220
 make this energy my weapons I know 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.459
 but it's not enough 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 relax lets roll look with other eyes 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.470
 understood this will bring such a thing 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.209
 good is I took a philosophical part of the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.860
 Life I'm talking because I like 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.310
 to keep talking, there's only that thing 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.019
 to say they're just gonna keep talking 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.459
 to stay traveling from Mariana I think 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.680
 fun and it seems that we are 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.590
 talking on a boat also understood 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.590
 who has no drink here but has me then 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.049
 but anyway 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.609
 then people should donate more 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.900
 know that behind each one there is a 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.340
 story that we are going to fall in love with 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.380
 day will like someone will succeed 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.140
 deliver find someone and case 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.850
 Happen life lets life guide 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.920
 You know what you do for more than maybe 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.320
 people do not believe the fate that life 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.670
 makes them feel appeased because the 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.880
 people play in the hand of a superior thing 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.609
 who do not have time then let her do 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.020
 There I am doing my part here of the 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.830
 Allied huff nam 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.570
 ana néviton then lets roll in the background 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.810
 who does not want 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.290
 like somebody knows it 's sad, it's not 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.120
 to like anyone is to be alone and no 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.710
 have to talk about the dream to remember 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.530
 knows how to grieve and remember to remember is to stay with 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.590
 longing and healthy and delicious served 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.500
 understood we obviously keep our 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.810
 but this feeling of sadness and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.730
 Happiness is cool and must have 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.890
 because that's what we value 1 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.780
 on down that we gain 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:52.620
 people turn landscape 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:56.400
 So, you suffer, you know, cry, remember. 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.740
 Believe if you do not believe the end leaves 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.570
 rolling does not lose hope a person 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.910
 can not come to the hope of all 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.690
 other people in the world everyone has 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.760
 what to love 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.310
 I think this search for wanting to love that 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.690
 do not be a thing and incessant sandro and 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.880
 that is not a needy thing but a 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.190
 healthy thing I understand something that 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.240
 hold love but one thing you like 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:22.380
 Keep it happy, you understand. 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.230
 then remem- 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.630
 friends or should suffer and remember to cry 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.180
 is to know has stories to tell this is 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.640
 healthy and tasty if the life sad 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.180
 invasive that I do not want to speak do not suffer 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.930
 do not live in the end know then go do 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.140
 life 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:44.310
 The guide to life helps the dreams and 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.990
 loves will always cooperate with 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.480
 our distractions then we are 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.190
 distracted and calm is what makes the 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.650
 positive things come to understand your 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.419
 you love your work for things then 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:06:00.000
 How do I say who does not want to love? 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:01.560
 not want to be glad we did not want but only 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.200
 who is afraid to love 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.330
 I know that scares us sometimes 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:11.250
 lose hope but it will pass 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.400
 He says he believes in love, that's why. 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.139
 knows your doubts is one thing 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.599
 transient happens 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.669
 but you have to believe in him that exists 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.069
 always a vital thing is one thing 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.650
 important then it will pass on time 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:30.620
 For sure, then everyone will find 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.939
 Someone and I say it can be a dog. 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:38.009
 I think it's very cool, our partner. 

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:40.949
 but life but anyway that's what I wanted 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:43.080
 remember that I miss you 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.819
 I do not know why I feel this, I guess. 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.050
 that's what makes getting so excited but 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.629
 I always say that, but when I go 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.639
 stop talking that is to remember that the 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:52.229
 book was leaving soon after the 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.750

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.090
 that I'll let you know when 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.120
 I'll let you know I'm warning you. 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.870
 and everything is centralized then stay 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.210
 quiet 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.569
 Something else, remembering, I wanted to warn you. 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.279
