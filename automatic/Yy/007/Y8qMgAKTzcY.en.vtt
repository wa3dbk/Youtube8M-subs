hi this is dan from pool and spa and
today<00:00:06.960> we're<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> do<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.410> short<00:00:07.680> how-to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
today we're going to do a short how-to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.640 
today we're going to do a short how-to
video<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:09.179> how<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> drain<00:00:09.840> water<00:00:10.110> from<00:00:10.290> an

video about how to drain water from an

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.470 
video about how to drain water from an
in-ground<00:00:11.010> pool<00:00:11.340> with<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> drain<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.420> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
in-ground pool with the drain at the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
in-ground pool with the drain at the
bottom<00:00:12.719> most<00:00:13.410> pools<00:00:13.830> have<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> main<00:00:14.670> drain

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
bottom most pools have a main drain

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.420 
bottom most pools have a main drain
built<00:00:15.630> into<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.740> usually<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
built into them it's usually at the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.880 
built into them it's usually at the
bottom<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.210> deepest<00:00:18.690> point<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.680> pool

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
bottom of the deepest point of the pool

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.519 
bottom of the deepest point of the pool
and<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.609> plumbed<00:00:20.970> right<00:00:21.539> up<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.320> pool

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and it's plumbed right up to the pool

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.710 
and it's plumbed right up to the pool
pump<00:00:22.859> with<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> valve<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.300> actually

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
pump with the valve this is actually

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.140 
pump with the valve this is actually
what<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.170> main<00:00:25.619> drain<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.369> an<00:00:26.490> in-ground<00:00:26.789> pool

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
what a main drain for an in-ground pool

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.080 
what a main drain for an in-ground pool
looks<00:00:27.570> like<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.439> part<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.429> sort<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
looks like this part here is sort of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
looks like this part here is sort of
buried<00:00:30.480> under<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> ground<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.219> have

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
buried under the ground and if you have

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.639 
buried under the ground and if you have
a<00:00:32.430> liner<00:00:32.759> it'll<00:00:33.420> come<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.469> if

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a liner it'll come right up to here if

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.680 
a liner it'll come right up to here if
you<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.219> cement<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:35.790> marble<00:00:36.239> dust<00:00:36.420> or

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you have cement or marble dust or

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
you have cement or marble dust or
whatever<00:00:36.809> it'll<00:00:37.500> come<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.760> it'll<00:00:38.879> be

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
whatever it'll come right up so it'll be

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
whatever it'll come right up so it'll be
even<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.600> then<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> suction<00:00:41.070> cover

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
even and then this is the suction cover

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.200 
even and then this is the suction cover
that<00:00:42.090> goes<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:44.100> pipe<00:00:44.760> here

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that goes on top of it so this pipe here

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
that goes on top of it so this pipe here
is<00:00:45.450> usually<00:00:46.200> plumbed<00:00:46.530> right<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> front

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
is usually plumbed right into the front

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.990 
is usually plumbed right into the front
of<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.660> filter<00:00:49.500> system<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.399> order<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
of your filter system so in order to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
of your filter system so in order to
drain<00:00:51.690> out<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> pool<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.160> thing<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
drain out a pool the first thing you

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.240 
drain out a pool the first thing you
would<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:54.000> locate<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.930> valve<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
would do is locate your valve and this

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.510 
would do is locate your valve and this
valve<00:00:56.579> right<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:56.940> has<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.230> suction<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
valve right here has a suction for the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
valve right here has a suction for the
skimmer<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.000> well<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.899> suction<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
skimmer as well as a suction for the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.270 
skimmer as well as a suction for the
main<00:01:02.129> drain<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.609> well<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.320> position<00:01:04.830> so

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
main drain as well as an off position so

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
main drain as well as an off position so
what<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> first<00:01:06.030> want<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.780> turn<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
what you first want to do is turn the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
what you first want to do is turn the
system<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.790> sure<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
system on and you want to make sure that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.090 
system on and you want to make sure that
you're<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.630> sucking<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> water<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you're only sucking the water out of the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.090 
you're only sucking the water out of the
pool<00:01:11.369> from<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.479> main<00:01:12.659> drain<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
pool from the main drain and not the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.219 
pool from the main drain and not the
skimmer<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.610> you're<00:01:15.119> lucky<00:01:15.540> people<00:01:15.869> have

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
skimmer if you're lucky people have

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.010 
skimmer if you're lucky people have
labeled<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.009> fittings<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> valve<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.540> lot

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
labeled the fittings and the valve a lot

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.840 
labeled the fittings and the valve a lot
of<00:01:19.140> times<00:01:19.380> you're<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.640> know

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
of times you're not and you don't know

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.929 
of times you're not and you don't know
to<00:01:21.360> basically<00:01:21.860> turn<00:01:22.860> your<00:01:23.009> pump<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.400> put<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to basically turn your pump on put it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
to basically turn your pump on put it
into<00:01:24.210> one<00:01:24.360> position<00:01:24.570> run<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.979> check<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> make

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
into one position run over check to make

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.330 
into one position run over check to make
sure<00:01:27.030> your<00:01:27.180> skimmers<00:01:27.689> aren't<00:01:28.380> sucking<00:01:29.040> water

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
sure your skimmers aren't sucking water

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
sure your skimmers aren't sucking water
if<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:30.030> are<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.659> back<00:01:30.869> put<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> into<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
if they are go back put it into the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
if they are go back put it into the
other<00:01:31.829> position<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.000> have

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
other position and you know you have

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.990 
other position and you know you have
just<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> main<00:01:34.049> drain<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:35.340> you're<00:01:35.820> going<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just the main drain then you're going to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.149 
just the main drain then you're going to
do<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.990> over<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.680> swimming<00:01:38.040> pool

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
do is go over to your swimming pool

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
do is go over to your swimming pool
filter<00:01:38.790> generally<00:01:39.540> they<00:01:39.750> always<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
filter generally they always have a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.940 
filter generally they always have a
position<00:01:40.920> that'll<00:01:41.520> say<00:01:41.759> drain<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.899> waste<00:01:43.500> or

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
position that'll say drain or waste or

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.130 
position that'll say drain or waste or
if<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.610> doesn't<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.750> use

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
if it doesn't have that you can just use

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
if it doesn't have that you can just use
the<00:01:46.350> position<00:01:46.829> backwash

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
the position backwash

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.950 
the position backwash
so<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> take<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so you're going to want to take the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.249
