i<00:00:33.809> made<00:00:33.989> these<00:00:34.140> videos<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.590> because<00:00:34.980> i<00:00:35.160> know

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
i made these videos is because i know

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.190 
i made these videos is because i know
that<00:00:35.460> budgets<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.390> tight<00:00:36.480> right<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:36.840> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that budgets really tight right now and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
that budgets really tight right now and
the<00:00:37.739> teachers<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.969> budgets

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the teachers don't have the budgets

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
thought what better way than to kind of

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.840 
thought what better way than to kind of
create<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.270> virtual<00:00:45.320> school<00:00:46.320> visit<00:00:46.760> where<00:00:47.760> I'm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
try to base it on basically is on

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.010 
try to base it on basically is on
availability<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.720> lot<00:02:43.840> of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
availability because I do do a lot of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020 
availability because I do do a lot of
books<00:02:44.980> i'm<00:02:45.160> working<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.460> books<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.970> i'm

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
books i'm working on books and i'm

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.970 
books i'm working on books and i'm
actually<00:02:46.360> teaching<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:46.960> my<00:02:47.080> local<00:02:47.410> university

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
actually teaching at my local university

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.840 
actually teaching at my local university
and<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.320> more<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.860> question<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.520> timing

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
and so it's more a question of timing

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.300 
and so it's more a question of timing
rather<00:02:52.180> than<00:02:52.330> money<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:53.380> don't<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.070> set

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
rather than money I don't have a set

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.620 
rather than money I don't have a set
price<00:02:54.460> I<00:02:54.730> try<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.910> work<00:02:55.120> within<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.480> budget

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
price I try to work within the budget

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.660 
price I try to work within the budget
constraints<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.100> what<00:02:57.220> makes<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.520> really

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
constraints but what makes it really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.670 
constraints but what makes it really
easy<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.240> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.540> get<00:02:58.690> like<00:02:58.840> three<00:02:59.170> or<00:02:59.350> four<00:02:59.380> or

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
easy is if you get like three or four or

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.640 
easy is if you get like three or four or
five<00:02:59.830> schools<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.970> one<00:03:01.180> week<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:02.170> agree<00:03:02.620> to

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
five schools in one week to agree to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.200 
five schools in one week to agree to
kind<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.130> join<00:03:03.340> together<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.700> share<00:03:03.940> costs

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
kind of join together and share costs

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.390 
kind of join together and share costs
then<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.870> know<00:03:04.960> the<00:03:05.140> airfare<00:03:05.770> split<00:03:06.190> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
then you know the airfare split the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.980 
then you know the airfare split the
hotel<00:03:06.490> split<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.210> all<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.390> good<00:03:07.510> stuff<00:03:07.570> okay

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
hotel split and all that good stuff okay

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.440 
hotel split and all that good stuff okay
