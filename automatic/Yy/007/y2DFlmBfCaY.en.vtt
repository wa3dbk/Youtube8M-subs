whole<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.060> rollers<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.360> are

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
whole lot of rollers that are

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
whole lot of rollers that are
using<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.860> traditional<00:02:05.070> mobile<00:02:05.820> based

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
using the traditional mobile based

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.660 
using the traditional mobile based
socket<00:02:06.509> type<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:06.899> bulbs<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.670> simply

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
socket type of bulbs like these simply

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
socket type of bulbs like these simply
because<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> our<00:02:09.390> rating<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.649> amount<00:02:10.920> of

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
because of our rating the amount of

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
because of our rating the amount of
light<00:02:11.190> intensity<00:02:11.790> all<00:02:12.060> those<00:02:12.270> things<00:02:12.599> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
light intensity all those things that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930 
light intensity all those things that
you<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.440> one<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.739> these<00:02:13.860> bulbs<00:02:14.220> are<00:02:14.520> so

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
you get from one of these bulbs are so

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.550 
you get from one of these bulbs are so
much<00:02:15.150> greater<00:02:15.569> than<00:02:15.870> their<00:02:16.020> thousand<00:02:16.440> watt

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
much greater than their thousand watt

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.979 
much greater than their thousand watt
counterparts<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.000> high-pressure<00:02:18.690> sodium

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
counterparts be it high-pressure sodium

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.860 
counterparts be it high-pressure sodium
or<00:02:19.500> metal<00:02:19.890> halide<00:02:20.250> these<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.209> put<00:02:21.420> off<00:02:21.540> so

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
or metal halide these just put off so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.809 
or metal halide these just put off so
much<00:02:22.050> more<00:02:22.230> power<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.280> much<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.640> light

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
much more power so much more light

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.630 
much more power so much more light
intensity<00:02:24.360> equaling<00:02:25.290> bigger<00:02:25.590> yields<00:02:26.040> better

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
intensity equaling bigger yields better

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.720 
intensity equaling bigger yields better
quality<00:02:27.300> better<00:02:27.810> product<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.430> believe

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
quality better product so we believe

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.100 
quality better product so we believe
definitely<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:30.780> are<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.959> wave<00:02:31.080> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
definitely that these are the wave of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.690 
definitely that these are the wave of
the<00:02:31.290> future<00:02:31.319> that's<00:02:31.800> why<00:02:31.920> we've<00:02:32.160> been<00:02:32.340> selling

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
the future that's why we've been selling

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.430 
the future that's why we've been selling
them<00:02:32.819> for<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.030> past<00:02:33.209> three<00:02:33.569> years<00:02:33.599> to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
them for the past three years to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.289 
them for the past three years to
commercial<00:02:34.920> growers<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.000> these<00:02:36.120> are

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
commercial growers now that these are

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.330 
commercial growers now that these are
available<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> residential<00:02:37.470> grower<00:02:37.890> we

these two plastic clips here and that's
actually<00:02:52.019> what's<00:02:52.380> responsible<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.280> holding

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
actually what's responsible for holding

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.830 
actually what's responsible for holding
the<00:02:53.610> bolt<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.030> place<00:02:56.120> you'll<00:02:57.120> notice<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.660> there

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
the bolt in place you'll notice it there

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.470 
the bolt in place you'll notice it there
are<00:02:58.019> two<00:02:58.290> wires<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.910> bulb

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
are two wires on this bulb

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.930 
are two wires on this bulb
the<00:03:01.930> wires<00:03:02.170> stick<00:03:02.620> out<00:03:02.800> so<00:03:03.430> that<00:03:03.580> they<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.819> go

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
the wires stick out so that they can go

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.290 
the wires stick out so that they can go
into<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.240> terminals<00:03:04.750> now<00:03:04.990> on<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.400> de<00:03:06.880> Vos

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300

into the terminals now on the de Vos
here<00:03:07.720> what<00:03:08.230> ended<00:03:08.440> up<00:03:08.560> happening<00:03:08.620> was<00:03:09.069> they

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
here what ended up happening was they

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.449 
here what ended up happening was they
couldn't<00:03:09.670> get<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.830> make<00:03:11.830> connection

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
couldn't get it to make connection

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.370 
couldn't get it to make connection
sitting<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.270> in<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.630> horizontal<00:03:13.959> position

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
sitting in a in a horizontal position

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.260 
sitting in a in a horizontal position
like<00:03:14.800> this<00:03:15.010> our<00:03:15.370> vertical<00:03:15.730> position<00:03:16.180> I'm

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
like this our vertical position I'm

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.780 
like this our vertical position I'm
sorry<00:03:16.480> like<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.739> they<00:03:17.920> actually<00:03:18.430> bent

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
sorry like this so they actually bent

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.090 
sorry like this so they actually bent
the<00:03:18.970> wires<00:03:19.209> down<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.590> then<00:03:20.739> they<00:03:20.830> would<00:03:20.950> make

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
the wires down so then they would make

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.449 
the wires down so then they would make
contact<00:03:21.670> inside<00:03:22.090> of<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.390> reflector

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
contact inside of the reflector

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.440 
contact inside of the reflector
obviously<00:03:24.459> if<00:03:24.580> you're<00:03:24.730> having<00:03:24.910> to<00:03:25.090> bend<00:03:25.300> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
obviously if you're having to bend the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.000 
obviously if you're having to bend the
wires<00:03:25.660> or<00:03:25.900> something<00:03:26.260> like<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:26.620> there's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
wires or something like that there's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.600 
wires or something like that there's
something<00:03:27.430> wrong<00:03:28.080> so<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:30.160> correct

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
something wrong so this is the correct

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.570 
something wrong so this is the correct
way<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:31.150> install<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.690> double-ended<00:03:32.140> wall<00:03:32.580> make

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
way to install a double-ended wall make

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.210 
way to install a double-ended wall make
sure<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.940> wires<00:03:34.120> are<00:03:34.239> straight<00:03:35.050> they<00:03:36.040> go

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
sure that the wires are straight they go

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.190 
sure that the wires are straight they go
down<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.760> contacts<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.840> you'll<00:03:37.959> feel

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
down to the contacts and you'll feel

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.840 
down to the contacts and you'll feel
that<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.470> bulb<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.860> firmly<00:03:39.130> seated<00:03:39.519> at<00:03:39.760> the

left<00:03:43.900> and<00:03:44.080> right<00:03:44.220> make<00:03:45.220> sure<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.519> bulb<00:03:45.670> is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
left and right make sure the bulb is

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.210 
left and right make sure the bulb is
secure<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.450> you're<00:03:46.780> done<00:03:47.019> it<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:48.010> much

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
secure and you're done it is so much

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.949 
secure and you're done it is so much
