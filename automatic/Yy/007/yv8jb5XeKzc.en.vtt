the final review with the buffalo a link
station<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.540> basically<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
station and basically what this is is a

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
station and basically what this is is a
basically<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> storage<00:00:19.230> device<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:20.340> works<00:00:20.730> on

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
basically a storage device but works on

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.779 
basically a storage device but works on
the<00:00:20.970> cloud<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:22.560> call<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the cloud and what we call it is it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.040 
the cloud and what we call it is it
basically<00:00:24.000> allows<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.510> access<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> online

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
basically allows you to access it online

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
basically allows you to access it online
and<00:00:25.590> then<00:00:25.800> which<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.130> pretty<00:00:26.369> cool<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and then which is pretty cool because it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.859 
and then which is pretty cool because it
kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.910> works<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.210> like<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> mini<00:00:27.570> kind<00:00:27.810> of

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
kind of works is like a mini kind of

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
kind of works is like a mini kind of
server<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:29.010> one<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.519> two<00:00:29.939> terabyte

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
server now this one is the two terabyte

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
server now this one is the two terabyte
version<00:00:30.510> but<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.439> believe<00:00:31.710> they<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.130> up<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
version but I do believe they do up to

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
version but I do believe they do up to
an<00:00:32.700> eight<00:00:32.969> terabyte<00:00:33.450> version<00:00:33.480> -<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.290> ice<00:00:34.469> will

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
an eight terabyte version - the ice will

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410 
an eight terabyte version - the ice will
hold<00:00:34.890> pretty<00:00:35.219> much<00:00:35.399> anything<00:00:35.700> you<00:00:36.000> need

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
hold pretty much anything you need

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
hold pretty much anything you need
but<00:00:36.719> basically<00:00:37.079> works<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> mini

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
but basically works as a kind of mini

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.490 
but basically works as a kind of mini
server<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.700> basically<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.870> locking<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.320> but

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
server and basically is locking this but

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
server and basically is locking this but
raid<00:00:40.710> 1<00:00:40.950> days<00:00:41.160> protection<00:00:41.840> basically<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.899> can

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
raid 1 days protection basically you can

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
raid 1 days protection basically you can
access<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.950> web<00:00:44.070> access<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
access it it's what web access to a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.090 
access it it's what web access to a
personal<00:00:44.879> cloud<00:00:45.149> space<00:00:45.480> key<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.800> use<00:00:46.950> my

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
personal cloud space key you can use my

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.889 
personal cloud space key you can use my

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you know you have little preview in the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.530 
you know you have little preview in the
top<00:01:49.799> right<00:01:49.950> corner<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.430> instance<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.420> you

SD<00:02:02.969> card<00:02:03.210> in<00:02:03.299> there<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.600> they're<00:02:03.689> trying<00:02:03.780> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
SD card in there and they're trying to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870 
SD card in there and they're trying to
edit<00:02:04.110> stuff<00:02:04.439> whilst<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> actual<00:02:05.460> files<00:02:05.640> on

edit stuff whilst the actual files on
the<00:02:05.969> SD<00:02:06.000> card<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.619> smart

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the SD card it was really really smart

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080 
the SD card it was really really smart
in<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.129> preview<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> top<00:02:08.910> right<00:02:09.060> corner

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
in the preview at the top right corner

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.180 
in the preview at the top right corner
was<00:02:09.360> horrible<00:02:09.869> but<00:02:10.259> friends<00:02:10.560> still<00:02:10.709> move<00:02:11.009> that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
was horrible but friends still move that

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.240 
was horrible but friends still move that
across<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.000> bet

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
across and you bet

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
across and you bet
put<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.520> onto<00:02:12.670> your<00:02:12.820> SSD<00:02:13.270> or<00:02:13.300> main<00:02:13.600> operate

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
put that onto your SSD or main operate

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.780 
put that onto your SSD or main operate

this this ring is very very very very

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520 
this this ring is very very very very
quick<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.450> know<00:02:22.510> it's<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> one<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.080> had<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> lot<00:02:23.500> of

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
quick I know it's the one I had a lot of

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.350 
quick I know it's the one I had a lot of
stuff<00:02:23.710> on<00:02:23.830> there<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:24.100> work<00:02:24.580> on<00:02:24.760> my<00:02:24.850> files<00:02:25.120> under

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
stuff on there I work on my files under

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.770 
stuff on there I work on my files under
there

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
there

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.450 
there
and<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:26.650> basically<00:02:26.920> what<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.130> do<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.400> not

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
and then basically what I do it's not

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.950 
and then basically what I do it's not
edited<00:02:27.880> whilst<00:02:28.150> they're<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.510> there<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:28.840> they

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
edited whilst they're on there so they

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.080 
edited whilst they're on there so they
kind<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.170> work<00:02:29.350> in<00:02:29.530> comes<00:02:30.430> out<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.880> kind<00:02:31.060> of

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
kind of work in comes out so the kind of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.760 
kind of work in comes out so the kind of
transfers<00:02:31.480> kind<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.870> speed<00:02:32.050> has<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.380> be<00:02:32.470> very

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
transfers kind of speed has to be very

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.160 
transfers kind of speed has to be very
very<00:02:33.160> good<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.210> basically<00:02:34.900> what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
very good and then basically what

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.090 
very good and then basically what

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
speeds whatever you want to call it and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.360 
speeds whatever you want to call it and
trust<00:02:45.160> me<00:02:45.310> that<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.230> quick<00:02:47.620> because<00:02:48.190> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
trust me that that is quick because a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.810 
trust me that that is quick because a
standard<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:50.459> basically<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.520> standard

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
standard kind of basically a standard

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.420 
standard kind of basically a standard
Naas<00:02:52.390> device<00:02:52.720> basically<00:02:53.680> transfers<00:02:54.220> around

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
Naas device basically transfers around

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
Naas device basically transfers around
like<00:02:54.580> twenty<00:02:54.910> four<00:02:55.090> point<00:02:55.300> five<00:02:55.450> milliseconds

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
like twenty four point five milliseconds

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.910 
like twenty four point five milliseconds
a<00:02:56.440> standard<00:02:57.070> USB<00:02:57.340> 2.0<00:02:58.330> hard<00:02:58.660> drive<00:02:58.959> only<00:02:59.560> works

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
a standard USB 2.0 hard drive only works

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.040 
a standard USB 2.0 hard drive only works
about<00:03:00.220> twenty<00:03:00.520> seven<00:03:00.850> twenty<00:03:01.570> seven<00:03:01.930> point

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
about twenty seven twenty seven point

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.750 
about twenty seven twenty seven point
six<00:03:02.380> megabytes<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:02.920> second<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> be<00:03:03.280> specific

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
six megabytes a second to be specific

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.570 
six megabytes a second to be specific
and<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.630> thing<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.080> 2.8<00:03:05.800> times<00:03:06.010> faster

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
and this thing this is 2.8 times faster

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.120 
and this thing this is 2.8 times faster
this<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.180> 80<00:03:07.480> megabytes<00:03:08.290> second<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:08.860> it's<00:03:09.010> very

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is 80 megabytes second so it's very

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.730 
this is 80 megabytes second so it's very
very<00:03:09.459> quick<00:03:09.700> look<00:03:10.510> basically<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.350> don't<00:03:11.470> think

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
very quick look basically I don't think

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.860 
very quick look basically I don't think
as<00:03:11.920> quick<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.520> an<00:03:12.610> SSD<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.270> instance<00:03:13.570> but

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
as quick as an SSD for instance but

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.240 
as quick as an SSD for instance but
considering<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.410> basically<00:03:14.680> got<00:03:14.830> two<00:03:15.010> hard

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
considering this basically got two hard

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.009 
considering this basically got two hard
drives<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.700> finished<00:03:16.180> open<00:03:16.720> up<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.870> front

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
drives in it finished open up the front

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.900 
drives in it finished open up the front
now<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.560> can<00:03:17.739> see<00:03:18.040> it's<00:03:18.190> got<00:03:18.280> two<00:03:18.489> hard<00:03:18.790> drives

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
now you can see it's got two hard drives

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.190 
now you can see it's got two hard drives
in<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.390> yeah<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.750> kind<00:03:19.900> of<00:03:20.019> moving

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
in there so yeah but to kind of moving

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.020 
in there so yeah but to kind of moving
the<00:03:20.380> hard<00:03:20.530> drives<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.890> there<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.220> basically

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
the hard drives in there and basically

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.729 
the hard drives in there and basically
it<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:22.239> works<00:03:22.450> like<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:22.930> inside<00:03:23.440> like<00:03:23.709> that

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
it all works like so inside like that

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.710 
it all works like so inside like that
and<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:24.850> something<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.209> be<00:03:25.300> an<00:03:25.360> actual<00:03:25.600> normal

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
and for something to be an actual normal

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.490 
and for something to be an actual normal
hard<00:03:26.110> drive<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:27.430> is<00:03:27.550> very<00:03:27.880> very<00:03:28.420> quick<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
hard drive that is very very quick so to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.780 
hard drive that is very very quick so to
get<00:03:29.680> any<00:03:29.800> sort<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.010> speeds<00:03:30.340> are<00:03:30.550> gonna<00:03:30.670> be

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
get any sort of speeds are gonna be

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.640 
get any sort of speeds are gonna be
anywhere<00:03:31.150> near<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.750> an<00:03:31.930> SSD<00:03:32.260> and

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
anywhere near that of an SSD and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.870 
anywhere near that of an SSD and
something<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.100> you<00:03:33.220> best<00:03:33.400> want<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.760> use

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
something that you best want to use

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.610 
something that you best want to use
quickly<00:03:34.330> and<00:03:34.480> fast<00:03:34.690> it's<00:03:34.959> kind<00:03:35.080> of<00:03:35.170> hard<00:03:35.380> drive

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
quickly and fast it's kind of hard drive

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.560 
quickly and fast it's kind of hard drive
versus<00:03:35.890> external<00:03:36.280> hard<00:03:36.580> drive<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:37.209> is<00:03:37.360> very

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
versus external hard drive this is very

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.670 
versus external hard drive this is very
very<00:03:37.810> quick<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.170> also<00:03:38.290> allows<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.560> to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
very quick and it also allows you to

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.550 
very quick and it also allows you to
access<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.550> rule<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.540> also<00:03:40.840> products<00:03:41.290> and<00:03:41.380> also

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
access a rule and also products and also

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.470 
access a rule and also products and also
make<00:03:41.739> it<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.430> there<00:03:42.970> we<00:03:43.030> go<00:03:43.150> cause<00:03:43.299> that's

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
make it so there we go cause that's

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.430
