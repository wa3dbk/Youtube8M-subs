00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
because I did shout him out a long time

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.179 
because I did shout him out a long time
ago<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.049> think<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.320> was<00:02:03.470> a<00:02:03.500> couple<00:02:03.770> months<00:02:03.890> ago

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
ago I think this was a couple months ago

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.460 
ago I think this was a couple months ago
but<00:02:04.759> they<00:02:04.970> actually<00:02:05.180> ended<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.810> ending<00:02:06.320> which

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
but they actually ended up ending which

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.650 
but they actually ended up ending which
kind<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:06.799> sucks<00:02:07.130> because<00:02:07.460> they<00:02:08.149> were<00:02:08.479> really

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
kind of sucks because they were really

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.999 
kind of sucks because they were really
good<00:02:08.869> they're<00:02:09.080> one<00:02:09.229> of<00:02:09.259> my<00:02:09.410> favorite<00:02:09.770> teams

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
and they ended up coming back with an

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.870 
and they ended up coming back with an
awesome<00:02:12.650> team<00:02:12.800> guys<00:02:13.010> now<00:02:13.190> usually<00:02:13.400> when<00:02:13.670> teams

so<00:02:54.210> these<00:02:54.300> guys<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.720> still<00:02:55.050> be<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.470> I

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so these guys can still be in this I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
so these guys can still be in this I
think<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.520> sick<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.000> actually

think it's so sick this is actually

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.390 
think it's so sick this is actually
their<00:02:57.540> clash<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.050> clans<00:02:58.410> response<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.100> if
