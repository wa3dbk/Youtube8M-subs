00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
because I can unlike last time Logan's

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.470

wig<00:02:01.920> had<00:02:02.160> like<00:02:02.340> hairs<00:02:02.640> going<00:02:02.910> everywhere<00:02:03.330> and

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
wig had like hairs going everywhere and

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.910 
wig had like hairs going everywhere and
it<00:02:03.540> was<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.750> falling<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.560> I'll<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.860> able

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
it was like falling out so I'll be able

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.470 
it was like falling out so I'll be able
to<00:02:05.130> use<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.370> account<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.760> is<00:02:05.880> awesome<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
to use this account which is awesome and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.330 
to use this account which is awesome and
the<00:02:06.750> reason<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.050> was<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.200> easy<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.890> off<00:02:08.070> was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the reason it was so easy to get off was

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.400 
the reason it was so easy to get off was
because<00:02:08.369> when<00:02:08.850> Morgan<00:02:09.149> put<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.050> wig<00:02:10.230> on

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because when Morgan put the wig on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.230 
because when Morgan put the wig on
originally<00:02:10.980> she<00:02:11.160> used<00:02:11.310> tacky<00:02:11.670> glue<00:02:11.940> and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
originally she used tacky glue and

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.810 
originally she used tacky glue and
