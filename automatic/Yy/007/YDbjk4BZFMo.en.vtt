00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.789
 there people say everything to mari and people 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.529
 will make someone else's hint of how 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.000
 make your hair grow and also the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.130
 daily care has to be so for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.410
 to leave healthy but only in March I 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 I cut my hair and I cut here and so 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 now it 's here so i grew up well 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.860
 more important than being healthy and not 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.239
 that brigade brooms 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 this time but much more careful 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.750
 when she stopped growing and coming back 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 with their care were these a piece 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.200
 by simple with everyone can 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.149
 doing does not require much time or much 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.739
 money or anything then if you too 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 Do you want to let your hair grow? 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.890
 I would leave a poll I usually 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 watch this video and I noticed it here 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.379
 underneath to help the video has to abide 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.730
 the hair on each block fear is my myth 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.489
 story that should not cut hair 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 This is going to make it spoiled so 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.430
 enough time for 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.430
 grow and still is healthy 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.610
 the second tip to get away with the shower 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.880
 and not that I because everyone here is 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 so it's safe to pass the shampoo 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 Remember to massage well and scalp 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.759
 and this facilitates circulation what is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.470
 great when the fall just know what will be 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.420
 President remembers avoid rubbing 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.400
 the ends of the hair that only left the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 dry though do not worry no 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.799
 leave your hair dirty because it's not you 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 to wash 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.369
 it will drain and then wash the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.110
 accounts anyway 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.759
 at least once a week to 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 improve your day to make hydration 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.689
 in the hair can be any crime that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
 you like or even coconut water 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.520
 Then you pick up the pass, I learned. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.620
 put on a night cap a little more 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.580
 My toque is danilo quÃª so 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.290
 targeting an afternoon band and if you want 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.870
 This half an hour you can stay in your 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.730
 false and holiday can watch on youtube 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.940
 It would also be a good idea. 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.410
 and then she called her hair the fourth tip is 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.270
 prevent his hair with the same 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.730
 worked because it breaks the hair 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.830
 until if, however, you get a 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.750
 half an hour and when you have 80 per cent and 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.000
 with more or less and can hairstyle 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.400
 be careful to avoid 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.460
 The more extreme two weeks you will see 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.990
 as he becomes much healthier and richer 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.060
 sleep wet hair this will 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.100
 leave within the court that russia 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.870
 Do you want to grow up? 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.570
 damaging dryer that damages 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.010
 hair but if you will use 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.840
 do not forget to pass the thermal protector 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.730
 because it helps protect the hair when 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 the heat at the time of passing protector 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.710
 also tried from others because the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.780
 part is more damaged 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.240
 before giving me an air of treatment 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 of accounts this goes to the hair and 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 prevent it from being so disconnected 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.580
 The last tip is to listen to your voice with 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.440
 a lot of fruit because it has several 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.180
 vitamins and this is great to be finding 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.030
 that will happen because you need to base 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.220
 female is that there in the video
