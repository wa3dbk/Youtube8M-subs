00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.220
 do not 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.679
 you know that the old man nelson him 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.780
 he likes controversy a lot 

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:12.209
 make statements that make noise in 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.969
 this time says xbox one has not been 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.820
 done with haste defends the delay in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.090
 some countries of this major console 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.460
 nelson wanted to defend xbox one from 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 those comments that ensured that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.580
 had done with haste that is a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.160
 console that has been done quickly and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.160
 running and that this had caused the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.400
 delay in some countries among which 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.730
 Incidentally, you can not find 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.610
 Spain or Mexico less bad than Xbox One 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.100
 we get to Spain in Mexico the same 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.200
 launch day good attentive to the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 words of the elderly gentleman next the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.540
 xbox one program takes years in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.030
 development so to say that it has been done 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.880
 in a hurry is wrong is what 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.910
 commented this important executive of 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.489
 microsoft eye because they say more things than 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.619
 we had some setbacks between May 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.870
 and August of course but we're 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.400
 working against our clock not 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.470
 against nobody's 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.780
 james with all the games of the stand of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.410
 xbox were running on hardware 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 end of xbox one each and every one of 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.110
 they think that's not precisely 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.720
 do things in a hurry so that's how 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.000
 he finished his major speech nelson already 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 you know how we commented here that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.390
 many people complained in the e3 of titles 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.640
 as dead rising with a frame rate 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.980
 disastrous in xbox one so good 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.080
 Maybe that's why people say it's a 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.490
 console also made with haste and 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.770
 we will see what happens with all this I think 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.869
 that really the problem that xbox has 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.960
 one is that it has changed so much since 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.720
 his initial idea at the request of the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.490
 users that I believe that neither their 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 creators nor the users know 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 exactly where that console is going 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.250
 but good good looking, of course 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.590
 we will have to be attentive to more 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.479
 information because I think that major 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.479
 nelson does not think to close his mouth
