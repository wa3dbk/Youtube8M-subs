there

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
there

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.609 
there
that's<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.060> easy<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.420> that<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.869> there's<00:00:25.560> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that's as easy as that is there's a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
that's as easy as that is there's a
torque<00:00:25.890> screw<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.550> I'm<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.090> too<00:00:27.240> sure<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
torque screw there I'm not too sure the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.050 
torque screw there I'm not too sure the
size<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.170> there's<00:00:28.500> another<00:00:28.769> one<00:00:28.980> there

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
size of it there's another one there

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.900 
size of it there's another one there
there's<00:00:30.060> one<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.480> end<00:00:30.720> here<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.579> undo

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
there's one at the end here and to undo

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.400 
there's one at the end here and to undo
it<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.180> can't<00:00:33.510> remember<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.260> down

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
it I can't remember if there's one down

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.139 
it I can't remember if there's one down
there<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.950> don't<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.670> actually<00:00:35.820> need<00:00:35.969> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
there I don't think you actually need to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.549 
there I don't think you actually need to
do<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> ones<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.079> literally<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
do the ones here so it's literally the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.190 
do the ones here so it's literally the
one<00:00:37.800> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> end<00:00:38.129> there<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.670> undo<00:00:39.200> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
one at the end there that you undo you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.410 
one at the end there that you undo you
might<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.590> pull<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.920> out<00:00:41.270> again<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
might want to pull this out again that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
might want to pull this out again that
you<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:42.780> put<00:00:42.960> your<00:00:43.050> fingers<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
you just put your fingers in there and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.580 
you just put your fingers in there and
just<00:00:44.129> pull<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.520> hell<00:00:44.930> because<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.289> screws

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
just pull the hell because that screws

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.049 
just pull the hell because that screws
really<00:00:46.890> difficult<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> end

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
really difficult to take out at the end

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.940 
really difficult to take out at the end
it<00:00:48.270> actually<00:00:48.600> sticks<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.500> you'll<00:00:49.680> break

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it actually sticks in and you'll break

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.740 
it actually sticks in and you'll break
the<00:00:50.190> -<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.239> -<00:00:51.300> pull<00:00:51.660> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the - if you don't do it so - pull that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.170 
the - if you don't do it so - pull that
out<00:00:51.930> literally<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.920> pulls<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
out literally that pulls out take this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.959 
out literally that pulls out take this
side<00:00:54.420> off<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.949> need<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> pull<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.640> again

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
side off you need to pull this out again

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
side off you need to pull this out again
put<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> screwdriver<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:59.219> cover<00:00:59.550> or

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
put a screwdriver with a cover or

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.720 
put a screwdriver with a cover or
something<00:01:00.270> around<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> edge<00:01:01.170> there<00:01:01.730> that

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
something around the edge there that

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.179 
something around the edge there that
will<00:01:02.940> leave<00:01:03.719> her<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> behind<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
will leave her out and behind there and

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.830 
will leave her out and behind there and
then<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.820> literally<00:01:06.119> do<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.240> all<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
then you can literally do that all in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.570 
then you can literally do that all in
fact<00:01:07.170> you'd<00:01:07.830> probably<00:01:07.979> get<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.280> finger

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
fact you'd probably get your finger

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.399 
fact you'd probably get your finger
underneath<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.119> problem<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.960> pull

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
underneath the problem there and pull

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
underneath the problem there and pull
out<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.799> every<00:01:11.400> time<00:01:11.520> I've<00:01:11.670> done<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:11.970> taken

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
out but every time I've done I've taken

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.859 
out but every time I've done I've taken
the<00:01:12.570> actual<00:01:12.900> bends<00:01:13.260> down<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.869> it's

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the actual bends down to do and it's

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.450 
the actual bends down to do and it's
pretty<00:01:16.080> easy<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> screwdrivers<00:01:17.280> around

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
pretty easy so the screwdrivers around

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.590 
pretty easy so the screwdrivers around
there<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.790> cloth<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
there with a cloth on it so that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.960 
there with a cloth on it so that
actually<00:01:18.930> just<00:01:19.140> leavers<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.850> there's<00:01:20.850> no

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
actually just leavers out there's no

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.570 
actually just leavers out there's no
screws<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.630> side<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.950> other<00:01:22.979> side<00:01:23.310> there

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
screws on this side the other side there

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
screws on this side the other side there
you<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.299> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> take<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:24.930> screwdriver

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you do want to take that out screwdriver

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.899 
you do want to take that out screwdriver
so<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.070> actually<00:01:26.340> pull<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> screw

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
so you can actually pull the screw

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.520 
so you can actually pull the screw
that's<00:01:27.150> underneath<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:27.810> through<00:01:28.320> because

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
that's underneath there through because

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's underneath there through because
it<00:01:28.650> doesn't<00:01:28.890> come<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.340> its<00:01:29.369> own<00:01:29.610> very

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it doesn't come out on its own very

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.600 
it doesn't come out on its own very
easily<00:01:30.200> but<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.290> Latorre<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> five<00:01:32.280> minute<00:01:32.579> job

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
easily but in Latorre is five minute job

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
easily but in Latorre is five minute job
to<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.119> once<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> put<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.350> back<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.700> put<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to do once you put it back on put the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
to do once you put it back on put the
screws<00:01:36.060> back<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:39.409> push<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.590> back<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:42.500> make

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
screws back on push this back in make

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.370 
screws back on push this back in make
sure<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.920> things<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.340> lined<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:45.380> that's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
sure all the things are lined up that's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.429 
sure all the things are lined up that's
it<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.520> much<00:01:49.340> should<00:01:51.049> all<00:01:52.049> work<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
it and it pretty much should all work so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.620
