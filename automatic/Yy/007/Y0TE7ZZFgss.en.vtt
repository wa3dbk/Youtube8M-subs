Dylan Dylan what I would suggest is a
little<00:06:05.919> less<00:06:06.039> ice<00:06:06.599> probably<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.690> way<00:06:07.750> you

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
little less ice probably the way you

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.300 
little less ice probably the way you

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.150 
make it as suppose the way I just did
just<00:06:09.520> because<00:06:09.669> it's<00:06:09.820> a

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
just because it's a

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.660 
just because it's a
to<00:06:10.850> handle<00:06:11.300> but<00:06:11.810> then<00:06:12.440> again<00:06:12.560> if<00:06:12.980> you<00:06:13.370> want<00:06:13.400> to

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670 
to handle but then again if you want to

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.950
