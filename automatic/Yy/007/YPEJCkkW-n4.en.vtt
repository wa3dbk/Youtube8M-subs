always approach down win now what this

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.170 
always approach down win now what this
is<00:00:25.349> going<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> big<00:00:26.849> gust<00:00:27.029> of

wind if it's windy day by being downwind
you<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.939> stay<00:00:30.179> away<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.720> structure

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you can stay away from that structure

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.720 
you can stay away from that structure
that<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.500> want<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> fish<00:00:32.040> not<00:00:32.279> get<00:00:32.460> blown

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that you want to fish not get blown

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
that you want to fish not get blown
right<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.330> a<00:00:33.420> lot<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> guys<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.960> see<00:00:34.140> out<00:00:34.230> on

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
right into it a lot of guys I see out on

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470 
right into it a lot of guys I see out on
the<00:00:34.410> lakes<00:00:34.620> approach<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.970> wind<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the lakes approach it up wind and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.079 
the lakes approach it up wind and
they're<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.350> either<00:00:37.650> flying<00:00:38.129> by<00:00:38.339> the<00:00:38.400> by

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.089 
they're actually either flying by the by

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.460 
they're actually either flying by the by
the<00:00:39.150> dock<00:00:39.420> too<00:00:39.629> fast<00:00:39.900> before<00:00:40.199> they<00:00:40.410> could

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
the dock too fast before they could

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.350 
the dock too fast before they could
effectively<00:00:40.890> fish<00:00:41.220> it<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.580> number<00:00:41.909> one<00:00:42.150> tip

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
effectively fish it so number one tip

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.479 
effectively fish it so number one tip
down<00:00:42.839> win<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.379> secondly<00:00:43.890> when<00:00:44.370> you're

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
down win now secondly when you're

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
down win now secondly when you're
approaching<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.909> dock<00:00:45.150> where<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.720> fish

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
approaching a dock where should you fish

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
approaching a dock where should you fish
first<00:00:46.229> now<00:00:46.500> there's<00:00:47.040> a<00:00:47.070> few<00:00:47.250> ideas<00:00:47.369> about<00:00:47.670> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
first now there's a few ideas about that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.750 
first now there's a few ideas about that
but<00:00:48.239> what<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.869> is<00:00:48.900> actually<00:00:49.080> fish

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
but what I like to do is actually fish

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460 
but what I like to do is actually fish
spots<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.970> are<00:00:51.089> closest<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.900> you<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
spots that are closest to you so you can

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.590 
spots that are closest to you so you can
see<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.830> this<00:00:52.920> dock<00:00:53.159> right<00:00:53.369> here<00:00:53.699> I'm<00:00:54.420> always

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
see on this dock right here I'm always

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.119 
see on this dock right here I'm always
going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.839> hit<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.080> corners<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.769> front

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
going to hit the corners and the front

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.950 
going to hit the corners and the front
area<00:00:56.309> first<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.269> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.479> throw<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.690> flip

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
area first so I'm going to throw a flip

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.910 
area first so I'm going to throw a flip
in<00:00:58.110> there<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.979> corner<00:00:59.369> work<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.439> and<00:01:01.439> then

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
in there to the corner work it and then

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
in there to the corner work it and then
just<00:01:01.949> gradually<00:01:02.309> work<00:01:02.729> it<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.540> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
just gradually work it that way now the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
just gradually work it that way now the
reason<00:01:03.780> why<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.229> fish<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> spots<00:01:05.159> closest<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
reason why I fish the spots closest to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
reason why I fish the spots closest to
me<00:01:05.939> first<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:07.080> there's<00:01:07.260> multiple<00:01:07.710> fish

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
me first is if there's multiple fish

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
me first is if there's multiple fish
underneath<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.610> dock<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> those

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
underneath that dock I can get those

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
underneath that dock I can get those
ones<00:01:10.380> closest<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:10.979> me<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.909> away<00:01:12.000> from

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
ones closest to me get them away from

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.819 
ones closest to me get them away from
the<00:01:12.390> dock<00:01:12.600> generally<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> won't<00:01:13.380> spook<00:01:13.649> the

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
the dock generally it won't spook the

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:15.289 
the dock generally it won't spook the
other<00:01:13.950> ones<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.399> can<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.789> can<00:01:14.909> often<00:01:15.179> get

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
other ones and you can you can often get

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
other ones and you can you can often get
one<00:01:15.539> or<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:15.689> fish<00:01:15.990> from<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.409> dock<00:01:16.649> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
one or two fish from the same dock so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
one or two fish from the same dock so
what<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.789> do<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.359> can<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.840> gentle

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
what you want to do is you can do gentle

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.539 
what you want to do is you can do gentle
flips<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.979> pitches<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:22.039> cover<00:01:23.039> that<00:01:23.280> dock

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
flips or pitches and cover that dock

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.830 
flips or pitches and cover that dock
thoroughly<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.270> then<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> work

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
thoroughly so then I'm going to work

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.389 
thoroughly so then I'm going to work
here<00:01:27.229> another<00:01:28.229> key<00:01:28.499> aspect<00:01:28.679> for<00:01:29.070> fishing

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
here another key aspect for fishing

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.450 
here another key aspect for fishing
docks<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.969> to<00:01:30.390> multiple<00:01:31.380> flips<00:01:31.829> into<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.249> same

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
docks is to multiple flips into the same

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
docks is to multiple flips into the same
spot<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.179> these<00:01:33.270> fish<00:01:33.570> depending<00:01:34.020> on

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
spot a lot of these fish depending on

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
spot a lot of these fish depending on
what<00:01:34.350> mood<00:01:34.740> or<00:01:35.100> activity<00:01:35.670> level<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.060> are

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
what mood or activity level they are

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.639 
what mood or activity level they are
they're<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.780> always<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> hit<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.499> that

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
they're not always going to hit on that

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.419 
they're not always going to hit on that
first<00:01:37.859> flip<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.670> I'd<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> do<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:40.429> drop

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
first flip in so I'd like to do is drop

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.969 
first flip in so I'd like to do is drop
it<00:01:41.609> down<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.819> little<00:01:42.090> pitch<00:01:42.359> or<00:01:42.539> a<00:01:42.569> flip<00:01:42.929> let<00:01:43.859> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
it down a little pitch or a flip let it
