00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.489

 add it with the remote control that is 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.490
 a keyboard on it is what we can 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.700
 very easily low and add 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 a tweet tweet is self since his 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 TV set and remote control 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.130
 or re tweeted a message that we appreciate 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.290
 particularly 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.630
 okay what did you feel 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.490
 just take off from this service 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.940
 you said 10% of users who are 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.970
 serve 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.049
 iliad there are events like this or 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.820
 news or entertainment that 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.280
 do that well here's this service is 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 more used then yes so we see that 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.869
 it's more and more used especially 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.270
 for reality shows where we 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.740
 sees a vision a little different from this 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.810
 that we can see first degree to 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.939
 the screen we have the comments that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.469
 some times are rather humorous 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.700
 viewers they are sometimes 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.009
 funnier than the program we 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.649
 look at this living room there are several angles 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.149
 vision of a reality TV program 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.799
 so for laterality that's for what 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.479
 is we are going to say light but for 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.859
 the news there it makes sense 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.179
 not for example that it is for a 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.469
 election where a sporting event 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.649
 we can see that it was indeed 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.170
 the most tweeted events this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.310
 year have been matches of 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.100
 football for example where obviously 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.180
 the presidential election a word about the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.890
 new service that you launch 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.769
 and that you share with us 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.519
 preview always linked to twitter and 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.829
 to the television 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:28.670
 what is it then the new 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:31.129
 service that starts these days and the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.870
 screenshot tv we went 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.790
 that what the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.159
 Internet users were first 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.900
 share the title of the show the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.129
 program he was watching so this 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.939
 something we will be able to do very 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.609
 simply by adding the stop image 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.010
 the screenshot of the image of a simple 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.989
 button pressed a button we can 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.349
 share a stop on pictures of 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.519
 the issue 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.379
 so I'm watching a 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.930
 program is there what am I doing 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.489
 I can still picture it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.870
 that then full on screen as we 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.519
 says we're taking a screenshot in 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.349
 pressing the pause button that makes a 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.319
 freeze and then we can 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.510
 send this picture on twitter 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.319
 from his account and you think 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.879
 that this is something that people 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.639
 do people ask this kind of 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.569
 service to precisely identify the 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.209
 program that is watching 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.530
 that's where we see today the 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.150
 comments that there is on twitter his 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.560
 TV show there is already 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.930
 a lot of screenshots that are 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.180
 rather made by smartphones so there 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.769
 we integrate the camera function 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.690
 directly in the television 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.000
 yes that could be relevant especially for 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.439
 the 10 france so we can send 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 see the picture of his 10 french say 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.760
 prefer in pictures of his favorite miss 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.540
 the jury vote the congratulations 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.579
 from alain delon why not we are 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.739
 that at the first the first step to your 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.470
 notice of the arrival of the social network 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.759
 on TV we can once again 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.159
 to further implement the networks 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:53.979
 social in television we see who 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.359
 is a growth of finally that is 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.729
 exponential of social networks on the 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.579
 television and we see that the chains of 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.169
 television obviously is positioned in 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.609
 a world where the audience is fragmented 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.019
 it's just a way for 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.349
 television channels to consolidate 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.879
 the hearing 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.009
 so I think we really have 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.019
 very early here is a very nice function 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.669
 following your twitter thread and 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.290
 watch TV on the same screen it's 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.900
 rather quite a lot then numericable on the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.250
 May 1st 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.180
 we can tell you right now that the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.739
 other operators will go 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.889
 especially orange with his new 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:26.110
 livebox which is scheduled for February 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.220
 next techno channel it's all 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.669
 days the high tech news we get 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.150
 find tomorrow 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.150
