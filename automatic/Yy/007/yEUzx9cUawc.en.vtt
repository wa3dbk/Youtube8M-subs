you<00:00:07.880> most<00:00:08.880> times<00:00:09.179> we're<00:00:09.389> like<00:00:09.570> just<00:00:09.900> like<00:00:10.050> this

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
you most times we're like just like this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.180 
you most times we're like just like this
two<00:00:11.700> guards<00:00:12.950> two<00:00:13.950> forwards<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.179> center

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
two guards two forwards and the center

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.590 
two guards two forwards and the center
now<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.980> we<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:21.420> one

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
now just like that we can be in our one

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.340 
now just like that we can be in our one
two<00:00:21.810> two<00:00:22.020> spots<00:00:22.430> all<00:00:23.430> right<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.350> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
two two spots all right but the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.370 
two two spots all right but the
foundation<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.990> it's<00:00:27.990> hard<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
foundation here is that it's hard to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.880 
foundation here is that it's hard to
guard<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.859> guy<00:00:29.330> here<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:32.030> also<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.890> right

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
guard a guy here and also there right

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.010 
guard a guy here and also there right
the<00:00:35.309> basket

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
the basket

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.920 
the basket
that's<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> rescore<00:00:37.590> all<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.750> we

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that's a rescore all right so if we

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.540 
that's a rescore all right so if we
start<00:00:40.230> here<00:00:40.320> rather<00:00:40.800> than<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:43.079> know<00:00:43.550> just

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
start here rather than you know just

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
start here rather than you know just
right<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.239> area

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
right in this area

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
right in this area
then<00:00:46.590> you're<00:00:47.070> making<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> team<00:00:48.000> decide<00:00:48.450> how

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then you're making the team decide how

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.790 
then you're making the team decide how
they're<00:00:48.899> gonna<00:00:48.960> guard<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:49.469> nobody

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
they're gonna guard you now nobody

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
they're gonna guard you now nobody
making<00:00:50.070> this<00:00:50.190> shot<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> realize<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
making this shot I realize that but the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
making this shot I realize that but the
space<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> movement<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> help

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
space and the movement is going to help

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.959 
space and the movement is going to help
us<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.649> moving<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> reacting<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> us

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
us to get them moving and reacting to us

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
us to get them moving and reacting to us
more<00:00:57.719> quickly<00:00:58.039> okay<00:00:59.539> so<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.320> want<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.620> show

more quickly okay so what I want to show
you<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:03.239> gold

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you first here is just gold

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.850 
you first here is just gold
okay<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.830> gold<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.170> basically<00:01:07.170> straight<00:01:07.650> -

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
okay and gold is basically straight -

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
okay and gold is basically straight -
one<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.220> -<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.700> there's<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.510> ways<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.900> you

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
one two - now there's two ways that you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.210 
one two - now there's two ways that you
can<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.530> start<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
can you can start it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.120 
can you can start it
Lance<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.610> throw<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.900> Jordan<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> same

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
Lance can throw it to Jordan and same

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.620 
Lance can throw it to Jordan and same
corner<00:01:14.490> cut<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> kcl<00:01:15.420> same<00:01:15.630> corner<00:01:15.960> cut<00:01:17.630> Shane

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
corner cut and kcl same corner cut Shane

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
corner cut and kcl same corner cut Shane
is<00:01:18.780> going<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.200> high<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.770> we're<00:01:20.369> we're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
is going to come high and we're we're

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.460 
is going to come high and we're we're
basically<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> five<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.049> around<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
basically in five out around the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.050 
basically in five out around the
perimeter<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:23.430> two<00:01:23.729> -<00:01:24.000> okay<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.490> believe<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
perimeter one two - okay I believe that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.090 
perimeter one two - okay I believe that
the<00:01:27.150> better<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.710> started

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the better way to to get it started

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
the better way to to get it started
because<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.340> movement<00:01:29.670> especially<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.450> our

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because a movement especially at our

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.740 
because a movement especially at our
level<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.710> cross<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> court<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.509> one

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
level is the cross the court to get one

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
level is the cross the court to get one
two<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> start<00:01:34.500> gold<00:01:34.829> started<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.150> would

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
two to start gold started so we would

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.160 
two to start gold started so we would
send<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.750> through<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.140> gold<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.650> which<00:01:38.460> case

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
send them through to gold in which case

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
send them through to gold in which case
Casey<00:01:40.170> would<00:01:40.470> cut<00:01:40.740> through<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.630> to<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
Casey would cut through and to the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.770 
Casey would cut through and to the
opposite<00:01:43.170> corner<00:01:43.409> Lance<00:01:44.009> would<00:01:44.250> dribble<00:01:44.430> off

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
opposite corner Lance would dribble off

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.810 
opposite corner Lance would dribble off
and<00:01:46.100> hit<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.310> same<00:01:48.270> corner<00:01:48.689> cut<00:01:49.640> Shane<00:01:50.640> would

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
and hit and same corner cut Shane would

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.960 
and hit and same corner cut Shane would
come<00:01:51.030> hi<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.979> we're<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.250> our<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.549> two<00:01:53.759> two

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
come hi and now we're in our one two two

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.969 
come hi and now we're in our one two two
spots<00:01:54.360> okay<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.909> wings<00:01:57.469> the<00:01:58.469> forwards

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
spots okay the the wings the forwards

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.330 
spots okay the the wings the forwards
which<00:01:59.909> began<00:02:00.329> wide<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:01.680> example<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.189> we

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
which began wide for example if we

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.120 
which began wide for example if we
called<00:02:02.610> gold<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.500> we're<00:02:04.500> starting<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:04.950> that

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
called gold and we're starting on that

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.559 
called gold and we're starting on that
side<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.299> he's<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.780> toward

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
side you know like he's going toward

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.380 
side you know like he's going toward
Jake<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:11.009> past<00:02:11.310> Jordans<00:02:11.879> walking<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
Jake on that past Jordans walking in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.850 
Jake on that past Jordans walking in
right<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> three-point<00:02:13.319> line<00:02:13.470> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
right to the three-point line and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
right to the three-point line and
on<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.250> pass<00:02:14.430> back<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.940> top<00:02:15.150> he's<00:02:15.390> walking

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
on the pass back to the top he's walking

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.840 
on the pass back to the top he's walking
in<00:02:15.930> now<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.470> kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.490> where<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.820> need

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
in now we're right kind of where we need

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.320 
in now we're right kind of where we need
to<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.470> okay<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.160> foundation<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.940> one<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
to be okay now the foundation of one to
