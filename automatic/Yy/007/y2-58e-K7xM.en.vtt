hello and welcome to my testing world
this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.060> first<00:00:18.300> video<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:19.050> record

a chess Murray or however you pronounce

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.630 
a chess Murray or however you pronounce
it<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:45.050> basically<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.829> does<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.309> you

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it and basically what it does is you

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.939 
it and basically what it does is you
throw<00:00:48.239> an<00:00:48.300> ender<00:00:48.660> pearl<00:00:50.300> over<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.949> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
throw an ender pearl over here and the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.470 
throw an ender pearl over here and the
slime<00:00:53.219> blocks<00:00:53.520> cause<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.539> ender<00:00:54.809> pearl<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
slime blocks cause the ender pearl to

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.160 
slime blocks cause the ender pearl to
throw<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.750> go<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:59.039> further<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.730> fact<00:01:00.090> 75<00:01:00.840> blocks

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
throw a go way further in fact 75 blocks

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.799 
throw a go way further in fact 75 blocks
which<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.680> 50%<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.600> from

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which is 50% more then you get from

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.580 
which is 50% more then you get from
normal<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> perf<00:01:04.650> Pro<00:01:05.450> and<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.170> people<00:01:07.500> in

the<00:01:07.650> comment<00:01:07.950> section<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.520> ham<00:01:08.880> like

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
the comment section we're going ham like

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
the comment section we're going ham like
couldn't<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.490> make<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.240> more

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
couldn't you go and make some more

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.090 
couldn't you go and make some more
platforms<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.650> extend<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.310> jump<00:01:16.100> infinitely

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
platforms to extend your jump infinitely

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
platforms to extend your jump infinitely
or<00:01:17.700> how<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> yeah<00:01:21.090> as<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
or how does this work so yeah as you can

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.130 
or how does this work so yeah as you can
see<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.799> went<00:01:23.159> ahead<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.750> tested<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:25.020> out

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
see here I went ahead and tested it out

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
see here I went ahead and tested it out
and<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> actually<00:01:27.720> found<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:29.310> very

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and what I actually found out was very

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.480 
and what I actually found out was very
interesting<00:01:31.400> because<00:01:32.689> yes<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.619> actually<00:01:34.890> does

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
interesting because yes it actually does

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.200 
interesting because yes it actually does
work<00:01:36.049> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:38.840> rebound<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.799> ender<00:01:41.070> pearl

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.710 

from<00:01:45.210> different<00:01:46.460> bouncing<00:01:47.460> platforms<00:01:49.670> but

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
from different bouncing platforms but

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.319 
from different bouncing platforms but
somehow<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.320> seems<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.130> velocity<00:01:54.030> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
somehow it seems that the velocity of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.780 
somehow it seems that the velocity of
the<00:01:54.600> end<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.869> pearl<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:56.040> getting<00:01:56.310> lost<00:01:56.520> over

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the end of pearl is getting lost over

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.880 
the end of pearl is getting lost over
the<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.850> can<00:01:59.850> just<00:02:00.030> show<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.710> how<00:02:01.710> this

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the way so I can just show you how this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.020 
the way so I can just show you how this
thing<00:02:02.430> works<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.619> stand<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:04.939> in<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
thing works you stand right in the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.749 
thing works you stand right in the
middle<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.479> line<00:02:06.899> yourself<00:02:07.489> into<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.610> edge

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
middle here line yourself into the edge

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.820 
middle here line yourself into the edge
so<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.090> you're<00:02:09.420> really<00:02:10.050> walking<00:02:10.410> straight

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
so that you're really walking straight

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.040 
so that you're really walking straight
forward

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
forward

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.560 
forward
point<00:02:12.710> at<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.580> most<00:02:14.300> center<00:02:14.750> as<00:02:15.290> possible<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
point at the most center as possible and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.560 
point at the most center as possible and
bit<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> top<00:02:18.910> then<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.150> hold<00:02:20.360> right

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
bit to the top then just hold right

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.020 
bit to the top then just hold right
click<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.860> walk<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.640> pressure<00:02:22.910> plates

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
click and walk on to the pressure plates

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:36.960 
click and walk on to the pressure plates
easygoing<00:02:26.030> right<00:02:27.790> why<00:02:28.790> doesn't<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.510> good<00:02:29.780> oh

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.320 

yeah<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.240> course<00:02:38.510> because<00:02:38.840> I'm<00:02:39.200> creative<00:02:39.920> mode

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.470 

okay

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
okay

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.280 
okay
now<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.080> should<00:02:45.200> work<00:02:45.670> let's<00:02:46.670> see<00:02:47.290> Linus

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
now it should work let's see Linus

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:56.200 
now it should work let's see Linus
yourself<00:02:49.210> put<00:02:50.210> yourself<00:02:50.660> right<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.000> see

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
yourself put yourself right and you see

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.860 
yourself put yourself right and you see
the<00:02:56.390> end<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.630> phone's<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.230> flying<00:02:58.870> over

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
the end the phone's going flying over

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.050 
the end the phone's going flying over
and<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.290> just<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.770> see<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.520> all<00:03:01.790> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
and and just you see that all the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.940 
and and just you see that all the
tapping<00:03:03.020> Pat's<00:03:03.350> extending<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.260> we<00:03:06.590> are<00:03:06.680> slant

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
tapping Pat's extending and we are slant

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.080 
tapping Pat's extending and we are slant
right<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:08.650> over<00:03:09.650> here<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.340> you<00:03:10.580> see<00:03:10.820> we

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
right now over here so we you see we

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.620 
right now over here so we you see we
traveled<00:03:11.480> just<00:03:11.980> very<00:03:12.980> far<00:03:13.580> distance<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.720> just

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
traveled just very far distance and just

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.300 
traveled just very far distance and just
with<00:03:17.630> just<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.110> in<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:18.380> pearl<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:21.800> as<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.160> can

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
with just one in the pearl so as you can

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.449 
with just one in the pearl so as you can
see<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:24.709> actually<00:03:25.810> works<00:03:27.160> going<00:03:28.160> on

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
see that it actually works going on

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.199 
see that it actually works going on
throwing<00:03:29.530> rebounding<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.680> ender<00:03:31.220> pearl<00:03:31.430> but

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
throwing rebounding the ender pearl but

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.000 
throwing rebounding the ender pearl but
it<00:03:32.890> isn't<00:03:33.890> very<00:03:33.950> practical<00:03:35.260> nor<00:03:36.260> very

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
it isn't very practical nor very

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.229 
it isn't very practical nor very
cost-efficient<00:03:39.040> since<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.810> lounge<00:03:41.810> less

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
cost-efficient since you lounge less

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.229 
cost-efficient since you lounge less
than<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:46.340> amount<00:03:46.580> of<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.820> first<00:03:47.120> throw<00:03:47.600> with

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
than the amount of the first throw with

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.800 
than the amount of the first throw with
three<00:03:50.239> more<00:03:50.930> platforms<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.760> if<00:03:52.910> you're<00:03:53.120> really

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
three more platforms so if you're really

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.449 
three more platforms so if you're really
short<00:03:54.440> on<00:03:55.720> these<00:03:56.830> bouncy<00:03:57.830> blocks<00:03:58.430> just<00:04:00.459> don't

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
short on these bouncy blocks just don't

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.449 
short on these bouncy blocks just don't
build<00:04:01.670> this<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:03.260> actually<00:04:03.680> only<00:04:04.100> built<00:04:04.340> it

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
build this I actually only built it

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.229 
build this I actually only built it
because<00:04:04.760> people<00:04:05.209> were<00:04:05.480> screaming<00:04:06.170> for

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
because people were screaming for

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.620 
because people were screaming for
information<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:09.519> well<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.550> also<00:04:11.030> myself

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
information and well I also myself

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.540 
information and well I also myself
thought<00:04:12.260> about<00:04:12.530> this<00:04:12.709> when<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:12.950> saw<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.250> first

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
thought about this when I saw this first

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:21.000 
thought about this when I saw this first
but<00:04:14.450> as<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.739> see<00:04:16.010> here<00:04:16.870> we<00:04:17.870> have<00:04:18.880> the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
but as you can see here we have the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.070 
but as you can see here we have the
range<00:04:22.010> of<00:04:22.280> each<00:04:22.610> of<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
range of each of the

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.140 
range of each of the
bouncing<00:04:25.680> platforms<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.610> see<00:04:26.849> that<00:04:27.030> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
bouncing platforms and you see that it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.490 
bouncing platforms and you see that it
goes<00:04:27.180> down<00:04:27.840> all<00:04:28.740> the<00:04:29.310> time<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.289> all<00:04:31.470> of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
goes down all the time and for all of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.290 
goes down all the time and for all of
you<00:04:31.800> who<00:04:32.039> want<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> test<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:32.879> out<00:04:33.060> for

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
you who want to test this out for

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.629 
you who want to test this out for
yourself<00:04:34.610> I'll<00:04:35.930> show<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.710> amount<00:04:38.430> of

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
yourself I'll show you the amount of

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.749 
yourself I'll show you the amount of
ticks<00:04:38.909> that<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.300> need<00:04:39.509> to<00:04:40.669> rebound<00:04:42.110> your<00:04:43.110> and

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
ticks that you need to rebound your and

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.320 
ticks that you need to rebound your and
the<00:04:44.759> PO<00:04:46.039> one<00:04:47.039> thing<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:47.759> thing<00:04:47.789> to<00:04:48.120> notice

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
the PO one thing one thing to notice

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.480 
the PO one thing one thing to notice
though<00:04:48.719> is<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:50.509> have<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.689> lower<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
though is that you have to lower the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.300 
though is that you have to lower the
third<00:04:55.189> bouncer<00:04:56.189> well<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:57.180> second<00:04:58.219> depends<00:04:59.219> on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
third bouncer well the second depends on

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.969 
third bouncer well the second depends on
how<00:04:59.430> you<00:04:59.490> count<00:04:59.780> you<00:05:00.780> have<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.080> lower<00:05:01.259> it<00:05:01.379> one

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
how you count you have to lower it one

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.950 
how you count you have to lower it one
into<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.370> ground<00:05:03.830> just<00:05:05.030> because<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.389> timings

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
into the ground just because the timings

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.260 
into the ground just because the timings
wouldn't<00:05:07.319> fit<00:05:07.560> and<00:05:07.800> you<00:05:08.370> would<00:05:08.840> either<00:05:11.270> land

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270 
wouldn't fit and you would either land

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270 
wouldn't fit and you would either land
on<00:05:12.509> the<00:05:12.750> platform<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.440> then<00:05:13.560> get<00:05:13.740> bounced<00:05:13.979> up

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
on the platform and then get bounced up

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.050 
on the platform and then get bounced up
or<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.669> could<00:05:15.210> glitch<00:05:15.569> through<00:05:16.409> it<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:17.060> land

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
or you could glitch through it and land

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.749 
or you could glitch through it and land
underneath<00:05:18.479> it<00:05:19.039> something<00:05:20.039> and<00:05:20.279> that<00:05:20.460> you

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
underneath it something and that you

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.149 
underneath it something and that you
don't<00:05:21.300> want<00:05:21.479> that<00:05:21.919> so<00:05:23.479> yeah<00:05:24.830> that's<00:05:25.830> all<00:05:25.979> up

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
don't want that so yeah that's all up

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.939 
don't want that so yeah that's all up
that's<00:05:26.639> all<00:05:26.879> there<00:05:27.270> is<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:27.629> it<00:05:27.779> and<00:05:27.930> thank<00:05:28.889> you

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949
