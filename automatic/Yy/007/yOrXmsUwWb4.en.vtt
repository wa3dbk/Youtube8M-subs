rather be they tricks into their
particular<00:00:40.129> pattern<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> do

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
particular pattern and the way you do

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.600 
particular pattern and the way you do
that<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.850> using<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.059> jeep<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.800> looks<00:00:47.010> like

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
that is using a jeep and this looks like

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.540 
that is using a jeep and this looks like
a<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:48.000> crude<00:00:48.809> sort<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.289> jig<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.129> what<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> do

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
a very crude sort of jig but what you do

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.270 
a very crude sort of jig but what you do
is<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.570> put<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.559> drink<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> top<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
is you put your drink over the top of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.650 
is you put your drink over the top of
your<00:00:53.579> piece<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.480> wood<00:00:54.710> run<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.829> router<00:00:56.120> up<00:00:57.120> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
your piece of wood run your router up to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.160 
your piece of wood run your router up to
create<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.199> treads<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
create the treads and and then the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:11.899 
create the treads and and then the
trench<00:01:02.840> fit<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> then

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
trench fit in there in like so and then

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.630 
trench fit in there in like so and then
gluing<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.270> lot<00:01:12.420> together<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
gluing a lot together so it's not so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.289 
gluing a lot together so it's not so
hard<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.830> are<00:01:16.890> being<00:01:17.759> routed<00:01:17.909> at<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
hard so these are being routed at the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
hard so these are being routed at the
moment<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> trends<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:20.009> you've<00:01:20.939> got<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
moment for the trends but you've got the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.499 
moment for the trends but you've got the
rises<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.950> cut<00:01:23.100> yet<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
rises to cut yet and you can see on this

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190 
rises to cut yet and you can see on this
one<00:01:25.189> we<00:01:26.189> marked<00:01:26.610> where<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> risers<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> going

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
one we marked where the risers are going

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.850 
one we marked where the risers are going
to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:29.340> fitted<00:01:29.670> we're<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:31.170> nine<00:01:31.650> millimeter

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to be fitted we're out a nine millimeter

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.819 
to be fitted we're out a nine millimeter
slot<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.549> them<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> they'll<00:01:33.659> create<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
slot for them and they'll create the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.910 
slot for them and they'll create the
risers<00:01:35.600> this<00:01:36.600> particular<00:01:36.930> staircases<00:01:37.619> got

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
risers this particular staircases got

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.710 
risers this particular staircases got
six<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.930> then<00:01:39.930> it's<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.369> landing

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
six going up then it's got a landing

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
six going up then it's got a landing
staircase<00:01:42.720> turns<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.470> goes<00:01:43.500> up<00:01:44.130> another<00:01:44.549> six

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
staircase turns and goes up another six

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.130 
staircase turns and goes up another six
and<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> lens<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.250> somewhere<00:01:48.060> underneath<00:01:48.450> the

and and lens up somewhere underneath the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.389 
and and lens up somewhere underneath the
apex<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> roof<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:52.220> that's<00:01:53.220> an
