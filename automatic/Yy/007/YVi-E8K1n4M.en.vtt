00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
letters to be permanent you could either

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.020 
letters to be permanent you could either
put<00:02:22.760> a<00:02:22.820> reposition<00:02:23.630> ille<00:02:24.190> adhesive<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.400> or

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
put a reposition ille adhesive on it or

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.000

if<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:26.270> do<00:02:26.390> want<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.630> keep<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:27.050> which<00:02:27.800> would<00:02:27.980> be

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
if you do want to keep it which would be

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.520 
if you do want to keep it which would be
kind<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.370> nice<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.930> leave<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.290> there

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
kind of nice you just leave it on there

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300 
kind of nice you just leave it on there
but<00:02:30.800> just<00:02:31.010> remember<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.930> leave<00:02:32.930> space<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.530> a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
but just remember to leave space for a

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.880 
but just remember to leave space for a
photo<00:02:37.209> I'll<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.450> put<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.750> there<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.680> that's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
photo I'll just put that there so that's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.500 
photo I'll just put that there so that's
what<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.370> would<00:02:40.610> have<00:02:40.640> looked<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:41.360> it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
what it would have looked like if it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.490 
what it would have looked like if it
were<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.990> banner<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:45.050> if<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.200> look<00:02:45.350> like

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
were to be a banner so if you look like

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.520 
were to be a banner so if you look like
that<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.600> think<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.930> would<00:02:48.050> be<00:02:48.140> actually<00:02:48.290> a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
that and I think it would be actually a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.350 
that and I think it would be actually a
cute<00:02:48.739> idea<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.250> just<00:02:49.489> actually<00:02:49.730> just<00:02:50.150> leave

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
cute idea to just actually just leave

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360 
cute idea to just actually just leave
the<00:02:50.480> letters<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.170> then<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.220> you're<00:02:52.310> done

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
the letters and then when you're done

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.190 
the letters and then when you're done
using<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> banner<00:02:54.080> you<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.959> I'll<00:02:56.959> just

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
using it as a banner you know I'll just

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.240 
using it as a banner you know I'll just
take<00:02:57.350> these<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:57.830> are<00:02:57.890> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.070> fall

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
take these out because are going to fall

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.560 
take these out because are going to fall
off<00:02:58.280> anyway<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.940> just<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:02.540> know

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570

again the same trim that you bind on the
banner<00:03:10.310> with<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.970> then<00:03:11.810> just<00:03:12.200> take<00:03:12.530> your
