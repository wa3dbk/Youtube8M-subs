busking<00:00:07.589> with<00:00:07.830> sweet<00:00:08.160> J<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.760> got<00:00:09.690> my<00:00:09.840> rolling

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
busking with sweet J I got my rolling

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.879 
busking with sweet J I got my rolling
few<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.550> was<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> use<00:00:12.360> my<00:00:12.889> electric

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
few and I was going to use my electric

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.980 
few and I was going to use my electric
stomp<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:15.680> tried<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.859> out<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.400> problem<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
stomp to tried it out the problem is the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.990 
stomp to tried it out the problem is the
rolling<00:00:19.380> cube<00:00:19.710> really<00:00:20.130> doesn't<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> bass

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
rolling cube really doesn't have a bass

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.620 
rolling cube really doesn't have a bass
frequency<00:00:21.660> response<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.619> great

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
frequency response it's a great

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.900 
frequency response it's a great
battery-powered<00:00:24.630> dam<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.550> cannot

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
battery-powered dam but it just cannot

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.419 
battery-powered dam but it just cannot
produce<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> bass<00:00:27.900> thumping<00:00:28.470> sounds<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
produce the bass thumping sounds that

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.870 
produce the bass thumping sounds that
the<00:00:29.730> electric<00:00:30.359> stomp<00:00:30.630> too<00:00:30.900> produces<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.700> had

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
the electric stomp too produces so I had

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.280 
the electric stomp too produces so I had
to<00:00:32.969> come<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.360> another<00:00:33.600> approach<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
to come up with another approach so I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.310 
to come up with another approach so I
figured<00:00:34.770> I'll<00:00:35.489> try<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:36.149> straight<00:00:36.780> acoustic

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
figured I'll try a straight acoustic

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
figured I'll try a straight acoustic
approach<00:00:37.620> no<00:00:37.829> electronics<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.670> time<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
approach no electronics this time and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.560 
approach no electronics this time and
let<00:00:39.870> me<00:00:39.989> show<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> came<00:00:40.530> up<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
let me show you what I came up with I

treading in between to acts as a hinge
and<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:18.119> goes<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.050> I<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:19.950> push<00:01:20.160> down

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
and that goes up here so I can push down

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.840 
and that goes up here so I can push down
like<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.259> over<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.550> an<00:01:23.670> old

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
that gives me the tension as this goes

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.940 
that gives me the tension as this goes
up<00:01:29.789> this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> dowel<00:01:32.119> here<00:01:33.289> that<00:01:34.289> serves<00:01:34.649> as

piece of dowel or a piece of square wood

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
piece of dowel or a piece of square wood
whatever<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.080> want<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> use<00:01:49.850> with<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> hole

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
whatever you want to use with a hole

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.639 
whatever you want to use with a hole
through<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.690> this<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> screwed<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:54.649> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
through it and this is screwed in and to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.940 
through it and this is screwed in and to
attach<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.340> two<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:57.380> just<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> piece<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
attach the two I just have a piece of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.640 
attach the two I just have a piece of
wood<00:01:59.189> one<00:02:00.150> screwed<00:02:00.479> into<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.900> beater<00:02:01.170> holder

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
wood one screwed into the beater holder

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.560 
wood one screwed into the beater holder
and<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.310> other<00:02:02.460> screwed<00:02:03.000> into<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:04.409> pedal<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and the other screwed into the pedal and

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.449 
and the other screwed into the pedal and
that<00:02:06.570> acts<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:08.030> link<00:02:09.030> between<00:02:09.119> those<00:02:09.690> two<00:02:10.459> so

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
that acts as a link between those two so

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.560 
that acts as a link between those two so
when<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.640> go<00:02:12.329> down<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.780> this<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.269> link

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
when I go down like this that the link

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.590 
when I go down like this that the link
moves<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.709> batter<00:02:16.890> holder<00:02:17.370> down<00:02:17.579> and<00:02:18.299> moves

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
moves the batter holder down and moves

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.810 
moves the batter holder down and moves
the<00:02:18.750> batter<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.260> hit<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.620> drum<00:02:19.950> surface<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
the batter to hit the drum surface to

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.340 
the batter to hit the drum surface to
ensure<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.329> doesn't<00:02:21.570> put<00:02:22.079> a<00:02:22.110> hole

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
pieces here are support so that when I

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.870 
pieces here are support so that when I
beat<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.760> crap<00:02:38.790> out<00:02:39.299> of<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.600> this<00:02:40.410> drum<00:02:41.100> it
