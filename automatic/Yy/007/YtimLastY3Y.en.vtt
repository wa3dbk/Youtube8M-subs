00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.150
 the only way I found for 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.269
 help kill it is a serious 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.049
 mistake you make there 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.320
 but less severe than yours I 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.320
 fear 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:25.869
 no ceremony between us sir 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.869
 wayne 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.100
 these accessories in sap and your strength of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.100
 victory has deserted you 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.329
 at 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.640
 theater at the haye the subterfuges in 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.609
 imposes on the uninitiated but we 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.770
 have been initiated is not it bruce to 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:02:00.609
 in the league of shadows and you 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.609
 a trail 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.030
 no 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 a 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:16.750
 I'm at the Shadow League and I 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.959
 just completed the destiny of ra's al 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.959
 ghul 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.420
 you fight like a young man you do not 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.819
 not admirable household 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:47.630
 but misguided you believe that darkness 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.489
 your tone to read you only adopted the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.700
 twilight 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.400
 I was born in I was fashioned 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.709
 by she 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 I only saw the light at the age of man 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.620
 and then she just seemed to me to plants 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.220
 the darkness does not betray because they are 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.610
 I will show you the place that served me 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.220
 from you 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.250
 when I was preparing to make the 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.250
 justice 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.560
 and then I'll break you 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:41.010
 whose precious arsenal accepted with joy 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 we will need it 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.350
 certainly I was wondering what 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 would break first 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.400
 your wish 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.930
 August yet
