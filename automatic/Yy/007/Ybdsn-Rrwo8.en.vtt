about<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.170> game<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.590> that<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:01.010> lacks

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
about this game is that it lacks

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.250 
about this game is that it lacks
customizations<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.750> can<00:02:02.930> change<00:02:03.140> the

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
customizations so you can change the

look of the car to a certain extent but
you<00:02:05.270> cannot<00:02:05.450> actually<00:02:05.720> customize<00:02:06.410> the<00:02:06.440> parts

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
within the car that actually effects the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.710 
within the car that actually effects the
performance<00:02:10.040> during<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.820> game<00:02:16.390> overall<00:02:17.390> I

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
performance during the game overall I

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.340
