00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.650
 and now I have something 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.490
 really unusual 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.610
 in my hands the most may not be the most 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.200
 but one of the thinnest smartphones and 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.320
 unusual smartphones on today 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.320
 mobile market 6 half millimeters 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.599
 the thickness of this lenovo smartphone and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.930
 him a giant screen five and a half 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:38.230
 inches full resolution where it is 1920 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.809
 at 1080 points already working on android 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.740
 4.2 Ie she has all the new chips 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.480
 type of photo sphere and other other other 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.670
 inside 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.930
 intel atom processor running on 2 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.930
 frequency 2 gigahertz 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.630
 he has a 13 megapixel camera 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.600
 there is naturally a flash 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.979
 stainless steel 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 front 2 megapixel camera can 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.810
 shoot full hd 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.180
 Here is such an unusual interface 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.159
 why is he just so incomprehensible I 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.119
 asked how much this thing could cost 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.100
 In Russia they said that in the second quarter 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.430
 approximately will appear and that's how much will be 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.950
 cost is still not clear here 2 gigabytes 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.619
 RAM and 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.250
 main unfortunately in any way and expand 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.890
 fail because slots on the ends 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.890
 nowhere and the back cover is fixed 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.140
 16 gigs only such a configuration 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.740
 compare for example this with the new fifth 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 iphone and 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.260
 in general, it becomes clear that all these 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.270
 talk on iphone 5 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.650
 too big is rubbish because 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.650
 what's the real big phone 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.540
 so here it all look 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.800
 why does the screen constantly turn off 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.110
 change a bit annoying 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.730
 but the less dean I am suspecting 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.880
 the cop is not set to the maximum 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.880
 brightness 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.250
 now oh my goodness a bunch of different interesting 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.769
 widgets and toggle switches 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.190
 here it all moves like this 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.510
 include 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.610
 Wi-Fi and bluetooth data transfer all 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.850
 all smartphone functions can 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 to manage 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.680
 in a couple of clicks from the panel 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.819
 tasks when pulled down from above 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.819
 here is such a smartphone lenovo 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.400
 no, he is a website
