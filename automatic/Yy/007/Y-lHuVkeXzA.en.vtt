hi this is Jared from motion sound

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.680 
hi this is Jared from motion sound
studios<00:00:06.710> in<00:00:06.890> Los<00:00:07.040> Angeles<00:00:07.279> California<00:00:07.690> today

studios in Los Angeles California today

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.759 
studios in Los Angeles California today
we're<00:00:08.900> going<00:00:08.990> to<00:00:09.080> talk<00:00:09.290> about<00:00:09.320> how<00:00:09.710> to

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
we're going to talk about how to

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.560 
we're going to talk about how to
determine<00:00:10.070> a<00:00:10.490> guitar<00:00:10.849> chord<00:00:11.180> from<00:00:11.330> just

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
determine a guitar chord from just

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.780 
determine a guitar chord from just
listening<00:00:11.990> to<00:00:12.019> it<00:00:12.200> now<00:00:13.010> this<00:00:13.219> is<00:00:13.370> a<00:00:13.400> skill<00:00:13.760> that

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:13.790 
listening to it now this is a skill that

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.759 
listening to it now this is a skill that
like<00:00:14.420> most<00:00:14.690> skills<00:00:14.960> has<00:00:15.290> to<00:00:15.410> be<00:00:15.530> developed

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
like most skills has to be developed

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.460 
like most skills has to be developed
over<00:00:16.039> time<00:00:16.160> it<00:00:16.550> really<00:00:16.699> just<00:00:16.940> takes<00:00:17.090> practice

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
over time it really just takes practice

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470 
over time it really just takes practice
listening<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:19.130> aural<00:00:19.640> theory<00:00:20.119> is<00:00:20.420> just

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
listening and aural theory is just

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.779 
listening and aural theory is just
something<00:00:21.380> like<00:00:21.830> any<00:00:22.010> muscle<00:00:22.430> you<00:00:22.550> have<00:00:22.580> to

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
something like any muscle you have to

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.890 
something like any muscle you have to
practice<00:00:23.330> a<00:00:23.449> lot<00:00:23.480> and<00:00:24.820> there<00:00:25.820> are<00:00:26.000> some<00:00:26.390> chords

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
practice a lot and there are some chords

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.450 
practice a lot and there are some chords
on<00:00:27.050> guitar<00:00:27.080> that<00:00:27.619> are<00:00:27.710> a<00:00:27.740> little<00:00:27.890> easier<00:00:28.130> to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
on guitar that are a little easier to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.009 
on guitar that are a little easier to
tell<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:28.939> what<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:29.210> should<00:00:29.269> start<00:00:29.630> with<00:00:29.779> those

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
tell so what we should start with those

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.839 
tell so what we should start with those
once<00:00:30.710> you<00:00:30.859> start<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.220> be<00:00:31.310> able<00:00:31.369> to<00:00:31.550> hear<00:00:31.730> what

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
once you start to be able to hear what

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.340 
once you start to be able to hear what
those<00:00:32.029> chords<00:00:32.419> sound<00:00:32.629> like<00:00:32.839> you'll<00:00:33.109> start

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
those chords sound like you'll start

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.840 
those chords sound like you'll start
being<00:00:33.589> able<00:00:33.710> to<00:00:33.920> kind<00:00:34.129> of<00:00:34.190> hear<00:00:34.819> what

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
being able to kind of hear what

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.910 
being able to kind of hear what
everything<00:00:35.389> sounds<00:00:35.690> like<00:00:35.870> so<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.559> easiest

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
everything sounds like so the easiest

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.309 
everything sounds like so the easiest
ones<00:00:37.249> to<00:00:37.429> tell<00:00:37.699> what<00:00:37.879> they<00:00:38.030> are<00:00:38.059> are<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.960> open

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:39.319 
ones to tell what they are are the open

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:40.599 
ones to tell what they are are the open
chords<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:39.859> that's<00:00:40.010> because<00:00:40.309> they<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.579> a

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
chords and that's because they have a

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.759 
chords and that's because they have a
very<00:00:40.819> distinct<00:00:41.359> sound<00:00:41.569> and<00:00:41.960> they<00:00:42.379> can't<00:00:42.620> be

00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:42.769 
very distinct sound and they can't be

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.619 
very distinct sound and they can't be
shifted<00:00:43.339> up<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.670> down<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:43.940> neck<00:00:43.969> like<00:00:44.359> bar

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
shifted up and down the neck like bar

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.410 
shifted up and down the neck like bar
chords<00:00:45.109> for<00:00:45.799> example<00:00:46.219> the<00:00:46.370> G<00:00:46.670> chord

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
chords for example the G chord

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
chords for example the G chord
that's<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.100> distinct

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that's one that has a very distinct

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910 
that's one that has a very distinct
sound<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.450> hear<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.470> three

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
sound because you can hear the three

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
sound because you can hear the three
right<00:00:53.220> there<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> bass<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.540> a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
right there and the bass and then a

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
right there and the bass and then a
bunch<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> these<00:00:55.170> open<00:00:55.710> notes<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.190> can

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bunch of these open notes so you can

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
bunch of these open notes so you can
relate<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> each<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.840> that's

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
relate them to each other and that's

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.630 
relate them to each other and that's
really<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.710> key<00:00:58.920> when<00:00:59.190> you're<00:00:59.280> trying<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
really the key when you're trying to

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.189 
really the key when you're trying to
figure<00:00:59.879> out<00:00:59.910> chords<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.540> guitar<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
figure out chords on the guitar is you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.720 
figure out chords on the guitar is you
got<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> hear<00:01:01.559> those<00:01:01.710> intervals<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.370> between

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
got to hear those intervals in between

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.370 
got to hear those intervals in between
them<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.989> hear<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:06.630> hearing<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
them so when you hear that hearing this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.950 
them so when you hear that hearing this
the<00:01:08.280> fifth<00:01:08.580> at<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.820> beginning<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:09.720> kind

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the fifth at the beginning and then kind

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.420 
the fifth at the beginning and then kind
of<00:01:10.020> hearing<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.410> chord<00:01:10.680> develop<00:01:11.190> has<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of hearing the chord develop has a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.999 
of hearing the chord develop has a
unique<00:01:11.880> sound<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.450> D<00:01:12.630> major<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
unique sound for D major there so the

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.499 
unique sound for D major there so the
best<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> practice<00:01:14.759> when<00:01:15.119> doing<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
best things to practice when doing that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.649 
best things to practice when doing that
are<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:15.990> at<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> intervals<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.659> which

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
are looking at the intervals and which

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
are looking at the intervals and which
open<00:01:19.140> notes<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.890> being<00:01:20.310> used<00:01:20.550> in<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> chord

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
open notes are being used in the chord

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
open notes are being used in the chord
which<00:01:21.270> ones<00:01:21.479> you're<00:01:21.660> not<00:01:21.720> putting<00:01:22.289> your

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
which ones you're not putting your

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.889 
which ones you're not putting your
fingers<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.860> frets<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> best

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:24.899 
fingers on frets on and that's the best

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.540 
fingers on frets on and that's the best
way<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.050> figure<00:01:25.289> out<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> chords<00:01:25.950> also<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
way to figure out the chords also if you

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.060 
way to figure out the chords also if you
know<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.119> key<00:01:27.300> of<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> song<00:01:27.770> being<00:01:28.770> able<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
know the key of the song being able to

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
know the key of the song being able to
listen<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> relative<00:01:30.060> pitch<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> is

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
listen to the relative pitch of that is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
listen to the relative pitch of that is
something<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.500> help<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.800> a<00:01:31.830> lot<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.520> if

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
something that can help you a lot so if

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
something that can help you a lot so if
you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> song<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.539> G<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> hear

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
you know the song is in G and you hear

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.820 
you know the song is in G and you hear
this<00:01:34.710> kind<00:01:35.039> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.600> minor<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> goes<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
this kind of the minor that it goes to

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.710 
this kind of the minor that it goes to
naturally<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:39.000> going<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.330> e<00:01:39.360> minor

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720

plain be impossible to tell which chord
it<00:01:47.910> is<00:01:48.000> unless<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.420> perfect<00:01:48.840> pitch<00:01:49.020> and

it is unless you have perfect pitch and
that's<00:01:49.860> because<00:01:50.130> people<00:01:50.429> will<00:01:50.580> use<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> capo

that's because people will use a capo
and<00:01:51.479> that'll<00:01:51.720> put<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.970> frets<00:01:53.970> down<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and that'll put the frets down at a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.469 
and that'll put the frets down at a
certain<00:01:54.869> level<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:56.310> they<00:01:57.000> can<00:01:57.150> play<00:01:57.299> an

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
certain level and then they can play an

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.390 
certain level and then they can play an
