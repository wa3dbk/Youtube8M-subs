00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
hi I would like to show you today how to

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.940 
hi I would like to show you today how to
use<00:00:02.909> a<00:00:02.939> male<00:00:03.629> trainer<00:00:04.080> hand<00:00:04.350> for<00:00:04.859> your

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
use a male trainer hand for your

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.540 
use a male trainer hand for your
training<00:00:05.310> if<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.930> are<00:00:07.109> using<00:00:07.350> tips<00:00:08.040> like<00:00:08.250> mine

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
training if you are using tips like mine

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.860 
training if you are using tips like mine
with<00:00:09.559> precut<00:00:10.559> well<00:00:10.800> amia<00:00:11.240> all<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.420> need<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.690> do

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
with precut well amia all you need to do

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.650 
with precut well amia all you need to do
with<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.950> cut<00:00:14.160> those<00:00:14.370> corners<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.420> fit

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
with this is to cut those corners to fit

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.939 
with this is to cut those corners to fit
the<00:00:16.020> rounded<00:00:16.710> shape<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.060> finger<00:00:18.449> I

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
the rounded shape on the finger I

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
the rounded shape on the finger I
usually<00:00:19.949> use<00:00:20.160> very<00:00:20.910> sharp<00:00:21.180> scissors<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.840> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
usually use very sharp scissors for that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.650 
usually use very sharp scissors for that
I<00:00:22.640> simply<00:00:23.640> cut<00:00:23.880> around<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.960> plastic<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.650> very

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
I simply cut around the plastic is very

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.370 
I simply cut around the plastic is very
soft<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.529> easy<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:29.670> do<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:31.109> hand

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
soft so it's easy to do that the hand

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.590 
soft so it's easy to do that the hand
has<00:00:31.650> very<00:00:31.949> flexible<00:00:32.550> fingers<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.360> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
has very flexible fingers so you can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
has very flexible fingers so you can
basically<00:00:33.809> vent<00:00:34.620> them<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:36.690> make<00:00:36.950> work<00:00:37.950> easier

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
basically vent them to make work easier

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.420 
basically vent them to make work easier
for<00:00:39.180> yourself<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> need<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.190> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
for yourself so what you need to do is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.959 
for yourself so what you need to do is
when<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.000> cut<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:43.440> check<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.730> size

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
when you cut it just check if the size

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.650 
when you cut it just check if the size
and<00:00:45.420> shape<00:00:45.960> fits<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> finger<00:00:47.250> like<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
and shape fits the finger like this and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.279 
and shape fits the finger like this and
then<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> tip<00:00:50.730> glue<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:52.020> very

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
then I use the tip glue it's very

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.920 
then I use the tip glue it's very
important<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.059> glue<00:00:54.300> on<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
important that you put the glue on the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.299 
important that you put the glue on the
edges<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.449> all<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.780> around<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
edges here and all the way around and a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.810 
edges here and all the way around and a
little<00:00:59.430> bit<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.910> top<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.809> glue<00:01:01.199> on

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
little bit on the top so it glue on

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
little bit on the top so it glue on
perfectly<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:03.660> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:04.110> make<00:01:04.470> sure

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
perfectly you need to also make sure

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
perfectly you need to also make sure
that<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.220> tip<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.960> sit<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.590> nail<00:01:08.310> bed<00:01:08.720> very

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that the tip will sit on nail bed very

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.980 
that the tip will sit on nail bed very
flat<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> edges<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.479> will

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
flat so actually the edges here will

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.060 
flat so actually the edges here will
touch<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:14.100> nail<00:01:14.280> bed<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> will

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
touch the nail bed in here so I will

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.620 
touch the nail bed in here so I will
show<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> now<00:01:17.610> how<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:20.420> use<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
show you now how to do that I use the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:36.149 
show you now how to do that I use the
glue<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.610> around

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.760 

you<00:01:36.759> need<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:37.149> press<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.659> for<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:37.960> few<00:01:38.289> seconds

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
you need to press it for a few seconds

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.529 
you need to press it for a few seconds
the<00:01:39.219> glue<00:01:39.520> will<00:01:39.909> bond<00:01:40.179> quite<00:01:40.810> quickly<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:43.450> a

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
the glue will bond quite quickly it's a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.899 
the glue will bond quite quickly it's a
very<00:01:43.719> strong<00:01:44.079> glue<00:01:44.289> so<00:01:45.039> if<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.520> don't<00:01:45.729> have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
very strong glue so if you don't have

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.279 
very strong glue so if you don't have
experience<00:01:46.479> with<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:46.899> need<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.170> be

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
experience with that you need to be

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.260 
experience with that you need to be
careful<00:01:47.799> because<00:01:47.979> you<00:01:48.310> could<00:01:49.209> actually

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
careful because you could actually

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.559 
careful because you could actually
accidentally<00:01:50.170> glue<00:01:50.469> yourself<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.249> a<00:01:51.280> tip<00:01:51.609> so

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
accidentally glue yourself to a tip so

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.279 
accidentally glue yourself to a tip so
be<00:01:53.079> careful<00:01:53.469> with<00:01:53.590> that<00:01:53.649> if<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:55.630> anything<00:01:56.140> like

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
be careful with that if if anything like

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.099 
be careful with that if if anything like
this<00:01:56.319> happen<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:57.819> can<00:01:58.000> use<00:01:58.270> acetone<00:01:58.840> to

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
this happen you can use acetone to

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.609 
this happen you can use acetone to
remove<00:01:59.789> the<00:02:00.789> glue<00:02:01.030> from<00:02:01.329> your<00:02:01.569> skin<00:02:01.869> it's<00:02:02.380> not

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
remove the glue from your skin it's not

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:10.410 
remove the glue from your skin it's not
a<00:02:02.649> problem<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:08.200> as<00:02:08.829> you<00:02:09.009> see<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.579> old<00:02:09.910> fingers

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
a problem so as you see the old fingers

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
a problem so as you see the old fingers
are<00:02:10.629> very<00:02:10.660> flexible<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.769> it's<00:02:12.010> easy<00:02:12.250> to<00:02:12.370> use

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
are very flexible and it's easy to use

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.390 
are very flexible and it's easy to use
the<00:02:14.890> hand<00:02:15.129> has<00:02:15.400> also<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.879> flexible<00:02:16.420> arm<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.400> a

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the hand has also a flexible arm and a

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:27.839 
the hand has also a flexible arm and a
clamp<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.500> fix<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.739> onto<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.310> table<00:02:23.879> okay<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> you

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
clamp to fix it onto a table okay so you

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.900 
clamp to fix it onto a table okay so you
could<00:02:28.000> move<00:02:28.239> all<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.720> fingers<00:02:29.079> around<00:02:29.910> to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
could move all the fingers around to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.550 
could move all the fingers around to
make<00:02:31.090> work<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.629> little<00:02:31.900> bit<00:02:32.019> easier<00:02:32.500> for

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
make work a little bit easier for

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:42.360 
make work a little bit easier for
yourself

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.320 

so<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.239> blew<00:02:43.480> all<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.720> emails<00:02:44.290> on<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.970> after

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
so I blew all the emails on and after

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.890 
so I blew all the emails on and after
this<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.870> can<00:02:47.050> use<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.730> hand<00:02:48.730> before<00:02:49.150> any<00:02:49.629> type

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
this you can use a hand before any type

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.259 
this you can use a hand before any type
of<00:02:49.930> training<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.680> can<00:02:51.190> use<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.849> nail

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
of training you can use it for nail

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
design I always do it on a hand instead

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.960 
design I always do it on a hand instead
of<00:03:27.910> doing<00:03:28.150> it<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.360> myself<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:30.040> saves<00:03:30.400> my<00:03:30.670> nails

and<00:03:31.920> this<00:03:32.920> way<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.099> can<00:03:33.250> show<00:03:33.430> my<00:03:34.239> students<00:03:34.980> you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
and this way I can show my students you

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.300 
and this way I can show my students you
know<00:03:36.129> how<00:03:36.489> things<00:03:37.090> look<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.160> last

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
know how things look so that is the last

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:58.530 
know how things look so that is the last
one

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.199 

if<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.290> leave<00:03:59.470> nails<00:03:59.830> like<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.700> and<00:04:01.060> don't

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
if you leave nails like this and don't

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.839 
if you leave nails like this and don't
touch<00:04:01.480> them<00:04:01.689> for<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:01.989> little<00:04:02.439> bit<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.159> glue<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
touch them for a little bit the glue the

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.910 
touch them for a little bit the glue the
glue<00:04:04.120> will<00:04:04.450> actually<00:04:04.840> bond<00:04:05.079> stronger<00:04:05.799> and

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
glue will actually bond stronger and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.670 
glue will actually bond stronger and
stronger<00:04:06.189> within<00:04:06.909> you<00:04:07.780> know<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.930> minute<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:10.680> it

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
stronger within you know a minute and it

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.830 
stronger within you know a minute and it
will<00:04:11.890> sit<00:04:12.129> on<00:04:12.250> quite<00:04:12.849> well<00:04:12.879> as<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.540> see<00:04:13.689> the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
will sit on quite well as you see the

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.229 
will sit on quite well as you see the
first<00:04:14.049> one<00:04:14.319> is<00:04:14.500> actually<00:04:15.010> already<00:04:15.250> glue<00:04:16.060> on

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
first one is actually already glue on

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.340 
first one is actually already glue on
properly<00:04:16.690> now<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:17.799> you<00:04:17.979> would<00:04:18.130> like<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.340> use

properly now if you would like to use

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.219 
properly now if you would like to use
this<00:04:20.350> for<00:04:21.090> any<00:04:22.090> type<00:04:22.330> of<00:04:22.360> training<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.020> can

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
this for any type of training you can

this for any type of training you can
you<00:04:23.770> can<00:04:23.919> basically<00:04:24.360> file<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.979> a<00:04:27.400> shape<00:04:27.910> or

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
you can basically file it to a shape or

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.659 
you can basically file it to a shape or
a<00:04:28.889> size<00:04:30.120> unless<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.600> want<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:33.130> can<00:04:33.310> buff<00:04:33.490> it

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
a size unless you want you can buff it

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.140 
a size unless you want you can buff it
over<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.150> top<00:04:34.389> with<00:04:35.229> the<00:04:35.350> buffer<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:38.680> prepare

this tip for any application you would
like<00:04:44.729> you<00:04:45.729> can<00:04:45.880> also<00:04:46.060> very<00:04:46.870> easy

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
like you can also very easy

like you can also very easy
we<00:04:47.919> use<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.370> for<00:04:50.160> extensions<00:04:51.160> in<00:04:52.090> acrylic

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
we use this for extensions in acrylic

we use this for extensions in acrylic
sculpting<00:04:53.169> what<00:04:53.949> I<00:04:53.979> usually<00:04:54.370> do<00:04:54.699> I<00:04:55.030> take<00:04:55.900> the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
sculpting what I usually do I take the

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.790 
sculpting what I usually do I take the
tip<00:04:57.280> cutter<00:04:57.520> like<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:59.139> can<00:04:59.289> bend<00:04:59.530> all

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
tip cutter like this you can bend all

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:08.100 
tip cutter like this you can bend all
the<00:04:59.949> fingers<00:05:00.340> down<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:04.080> cut<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.680> tip<00:05:06.990> just<00:05:07.990> like

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
the fingers down I cut the tip just like

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.670 
the fingers down I cut the tip just like
that<00:05:08.820> then<00:05:09.820> I<00:05:10.440> usually<00:05:12.150> file<00:05:13.150> it<00:05:13.389> down

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
that then I usually file it down

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:28.490 
that then I usually file it down
slightly<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:24.370> then<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.880> take<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.570> nail<00:05:25.750> form

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:39.350

and<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:40.169> stick<00:05:40.470> it<00:05:40.590> onto<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.979> finger<00:05:42.020> so<00:05:43.020> correct

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:43.439 
and I stick it onto a finger so correct

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:50.600 
and I stick it onto a finger so correct
shape<00:05:46.819> just<00:05:47.819> like<00:05:47.969> this<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.949> you<00:05:50.250> can<00:05:50.430> use

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
shape just like this and you can use

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.740 
shape just like this and you can use
this<00:05:50.849> hand<00:05:51.150> for<00:05:51.689> acrylic<00:05:52.050> sculpting<00:05:52.740> or<00:05:52.979> for

the tip from than hand what you normally

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.390 
the tip from than hand what you normally
do<00:06:05.520> is<00:06:05.699> just<00:06:06.030> pull<00:06:06.419> it<00:06:06.539> away<00:06:06.770> it's<00:06:07.770> quite<00:06:08.129> easy

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
do is just pull it away it's quite easy

do is just pull it away it's quite easy
after<00:06:09.389> some<00:06:09.870> times<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.439> glue<00:06:11.009> will<00:06:11.280> go<00:06:11.490> on

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
after some times the glue will go on

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.909 
after some times the glue will go on
strike<00:06:11.909> the<00:06:12.120> it's<00:06:12.539> most<00:06:12.719> likely<00:06:12.840> stronger<00:06:13.620> but

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
strike the it's most likely stronger but

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.439 
strike the it's most likely stronger but
it's<00:06:14.099> still<00:06:14.250> not<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.550> problem<00:06:14.819> you<00:06:15.090> just<00:06:15.120> pull

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
it's still not a problem you just pull
