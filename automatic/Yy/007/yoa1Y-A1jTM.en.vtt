00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 hi brice martin johnson at launch 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.859
 from htc one to new york with the device in 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.570
 question of buying if one then this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 call these the next phone by 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 htc and that's really in my opinion a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.680
 great success of its sales in america 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.250
 if we focus on design first 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.029
 is entirely made of aluminum and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.039
 placements a dance is felt very 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.609
 nice I have in hand it's light 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.760
 the size it's bad it goes 4 mm on 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:38.520
 the sides to 9 be very interests 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.800
 high-end very successful at the level of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.950
 internal features and and we have a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.149
 spent Saturday at six gan so one of the 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 builders one must earn a new 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 generation one of the very large swamps 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.340
 more in question in the market 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 now 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.020
 obviously we are also a screen here 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 in the 4.7-inch sandstone with a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.719
 full hd resolution at 04 68 then the one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.780
 per inch is still rules at the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.409
 level of internal capacity we had to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.240
 stay internal 32 gigabytes 64 south a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.040
 unfortunately capture there is no 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.720
 microsd card slot but who with 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.869
 64 it's still ok 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.180
 we also have a shape so his side the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.600
 second we make it here for the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.790
 map 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.689
 besides also so I took a little 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.390
 little of the software side of htc one then this 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.030
 that we see here if the home screen of the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.820
 new htc what we actually see is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.430
 big if this big son of information 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.380
 who can display information from 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.789
 his facebook but also different 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.100
 known media blogs so that will be put 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.380
 automatically and so we can 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.090
 access to like the here at present at 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.850
 the highlights the best of my films 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.630
 I can also have some 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.130
 some tell me directly the water just 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.649
 facebook and others so far ago 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.990
 about 1400 must do it content 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.789
 who works with this movie to buy 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.100
 here for canada we have nothing announced 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.450
 but we say we are already in discussion 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.700
 with the main risks so had 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.519
 almost immediate would know so that 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 will be ready for canada for the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.060
 launch that runs from late March or 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.950
 instructor and bold if you are afraid 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.590
 this home screen there is a problem 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.920
 who just wants to go as on his 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 side and there you have your screen 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.130
 with the widgets with you your menus your 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.650
 applications and others that's a 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.859
 htc beauty senses in north enormously 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.450
 other htc for example tivi allows for 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.390
 to have a space of accompaniment 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.670
 in his TV look so too 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.280
 all applications 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.560
 because we succeed and ashley quoted 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.700
 winogrand for four years to launch 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.769
 dice emissions to be able to d 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.790
 information society currently has to 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:14.629
 the screen and other novelty of htc 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.650
 ounce and his camera so the camera of 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.540
 important details firstly this is 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.590
 a technological one to this one calls the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.220
 ultra pixels 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.470
 so these are pixels a more sensor 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.459
 big of them the htc one sensor 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.319
 and 40 percent bigger than him from 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.420
 latest iphone and it allows for that 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.180
 the chic at around 300 % more light 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.030
 who are going to the sensor then he 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.940
 know that one of the cases interested 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.799
 than pixels when we think and 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.140
 zoe mode which allows a lot of 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.700
 rage and features among others 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.579
 the only picture like that the device by 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.620
 also a two- second video 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.850
 So this video out what is it that 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.829
 some things clear what we 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.750
 look at pictures we also have a small 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:10.920
 more element but also zoÃ© allows 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.680
 several large 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.169
 many of them depending on there I 'm going 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.669
 not in the gallery so I would have when 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.260
 even to make small videos on 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.900
 dismantling it also allows women and 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.570
 adjustments thanks to this video there 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:31.889
 for example I will show you here 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.160
 I have here in photo so here as a 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.340
 photo only that is also a so the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.980
 short video and well thanks to attract one 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.500
 can edit this readership and keep 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.910
 many of the elements of the same picture 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.970
 so we can see if that's going to happen 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.889
 effects the time we can also change that 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.540
 change and that in some ways for 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.260
 remove for example to choose 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.910
 only 2 have good friends to her 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.520
 features there are others in 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.010
 done one can also for example when 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.470
 have fears when you pass in front of 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.450
 a photo you can choose from 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.700
 the environment commission sees I have two 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:13.310
 people in the picture so I say 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.600
 so I asked to adjust the photo 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:21.600
 so I have not blamed incidents 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:24.930
 so we're escaping you here 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.450
 to analyze the costs so not here at 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.789
 other piano so I'm so object 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.729
 of our suitcases and so I'm going 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.110
 so choose the device so tell me 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.200
 can remove these two objects there so these 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.780
 two people there you went and here are the 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.360
 two people disappear 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.350
 normally any case and 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.080
 currently it works bad putting everything 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.330
 so it works so that removes the 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.520
 people who's going to picture one 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.100
 can you reassure that someone mouse 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.140
 and others as we name with the with the 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.990
 block 800 m we see it android is a 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.060
 druid 4.1.2 know how to act naturally 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.830
 to 4 points where the changes 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.750
 it's still pretty enough 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.540
 everything I read in apps 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:10.660
 here I can easily adjusted anyway 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.550
 in the way that I adjust all that and we 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.280
 is also the waters so everything and the 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.050
 ged htc sense applications the htc one 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.910
