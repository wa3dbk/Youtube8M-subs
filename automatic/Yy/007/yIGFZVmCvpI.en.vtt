00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi everyone had the room in this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.240
 video I was talking about gta 5 and the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.519
 racism in gt5 it's been several months 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 that I hear these rumors and there is a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.170
 big American youtube channel that has 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.839
 decided to test precisely if in gta 5 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.190
 the police were racist or not and there is 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.850
 a French article that relayed 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.740
 information 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.390
 so I read you the article directly 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.980
 few games caused so many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
 polemics as those of the big series 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.010
 theft self common sense knew it known for 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.300
 throw the player into the shoes of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.920
 unsavory characters who 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.869
 constantly rub shoulders with violence the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 drugs and prostitution one of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.450
 many controversies fueled 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.219
 permanence by the American news 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 was born shortly after the release of the last 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.719
 episode in date throws to 5 in September 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.760
 2013 according to some of the three 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 main characters including two are 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 white and a black would not be treated 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 in the same way by the accused police 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.329
 even racism 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.770
 the creators of the series known for 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.570
 their sense of provocation had 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 yet denied the rumor at the time 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.960
 so that's what they said them 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 police are programmed to interact 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 in the same way with the three 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.000
 protagonists had responded a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 representative of rockstar the publisher of the 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.019
 playing game I noticed they get 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 involve in a very aggressive way that 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.720
 that you are 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.939
 which perhaps explains these rumors 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 in this world the simple fact of area and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.840
 is liable to immediate execution 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.430
 alone speaks volumes about the depth of 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.930
 world that rockstar has created if players 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.580
 are starting to have that kind of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.799
 behavior even if they are not there 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 so there are three characters in gta 5 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.009
 so this is me who tells you them the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 three main franklin characters 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.869
 michael is just trevor people 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 end some people say there are some 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.650
 rumors that the police are not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 would not behave the same way with 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 franklin with the other two so 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.740
 with trevor and michael why everything 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.900
 simply because franklin and black 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.490
 so as I wanted to say the great 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.570
 youtube american channel so I you 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.340
 put the link in the description of the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.259
 video one obviously for you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.369
 see how the police behave with 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 the three protagonists 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.869
 they did a very good experience 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 serious about it so that's where it's 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.340
 really 100% reliable it's very 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.219
 seriously to actually see if the police 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 was really racist or not towards the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.180
 three protagonists so there have been 27 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.759
 different possibilities with the three 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.009
 characters so 27 interactions 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.509
 different with the police for each 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.250
 of the three police stations since 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.989
 precisely the experience was made 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.630
 in front of the three gta police stations 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.310
 5 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.570
 so to every character that has been tested 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.170
 five times in three situations 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.810
 different to see exactly if the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.020
 police had the same attitude so more 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.030
 aggressive or less aggressive with each 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.400
 protagonists and they did a 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.170
 point system so I'm telling you so 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.140
 what came out of it franklin he 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.850
 got the highest score so there we 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.620
 could say that the police were racist 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.480
 but nan because he was equal with 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.110
 trevor so they had 23 points each 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.790
 and michael got him 16 points so that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.130
 means that the police are not 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.080
 racist it's just that the police 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.390
 she reacts differently with franklin 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.060
 and trevor that with michael necessarily the 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.000
 know michael it's the most finally it's 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.330
 the one who seems the least gangster 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.780
 strait franklin he has the quickdraw he has 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.400
 also the clothes trevor him good 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.630
 well when we see him he really 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
 the psychopathic lover 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.440
 so obviously both there attracts more 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.690
 police attention that michael him 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.850
 he is always well cared for most 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.500
 time cost so necessarily they 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.150
 draw less attention to him 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.460
 so that's why he gets the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.500
 lowest score in addition to that the 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.600
 testers obviously seen that it was 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.790
 a very serious thing that has not been 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.210
 made to larach they flatly proposed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.940
 a socio-economic explanation by 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.710
 relationship to the places where the experiment was 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.810
 made with respect to the character too 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.870
 short end it's really a trick of 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.480
 crazy and so they concluded that the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.730
 font in gt5 is not racist but 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.900
 responds simply differently to 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.570
 player function besides 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.640
 fortunately that franklin and trevor have 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.830
 had the same score if not so franklin 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.020
 he had a slightly higher score 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.930
 well that would have to people would have 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.670
 thought that precisely in gta 5 the police 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.760
 is racist so that means those 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.980
 who created the game wanted the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.360
 police be racist so that would have created 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.160
 other polemics it might be 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.630
 a bit dangerous for the game while 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.300
 luckily we get the same score 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.370
 for franklin and for trevor and me 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.010
 I would go so far as to say that we would have 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.900
 very well could get the highest score 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.090
 for franklin without the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.740
 police either racist because inevitably 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.300
 they are three 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.220
 that's when you're 3 you have a 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.620
 luck on three to have the biggest 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.870
 score so one chance out of three that's 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.750
 still not bad what franklin so he 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.180
 could have had the most 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.940
 points without necessarily the police being 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.130
 racist it's a bit complicated like by 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.020
 example michael could have had the most 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.000
 big score like trevor could have had 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.360
 the biggest score without 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.380
 the police be against psychopaths 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.569
 more particularly 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.190
 finally here you understand me so 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.389
 this is the police is not racist I 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.919
 you put reading in the description of the 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.750
 video for you to see for yourself 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.490
 the reactions of the police with the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.139
 three protagonists that's all for 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.380
 this video and I tell you everything at 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.830
 time 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.830
 ciao ciao
