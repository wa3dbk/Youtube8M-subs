00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 sometimes all the fun in the little things 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 and these little things so cute feature 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.840
 eye and are visible but they have 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.240
 crucial precisely because of them we 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.790
 choose one or the other product they 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.379
 make this very product truly 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.379
 special and outstanding 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.160
 hello to you with Katya and in this review 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.340
 from the company hello I will introduce you to 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.470
 very special tv elji 43 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.629
 yu.f. 640 what is it so special 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.699
 outwardly this is the most ordinary TV 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.680
 no menacing looking ahead 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.290
 speakers or any system 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.210
 creating a three-dimensional projection 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.059
 images here no no touch 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.220
 the screen is not shockproof glass there 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.410
 strong calm exterior 2 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.110
 standard to most toji models 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.050
 legs strict black matte body 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.260
 plastic and maybe smart 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.160
 platform yes no this is already familiar 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.660
 us operating system vbs 20 as you 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.030
 she hasn't met yet 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.180
 then follow this link and 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.310
 get acquainted in more detail think maybe 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:22.479
 he manages himself somehow 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:24.909
 opportunity by force we are by no means what 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.520
 Jedi ARISING included all the usual 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.810
 classic remote without frills and 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 you can buy 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.280
 separate magic repair which tv 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.180
 compatible 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 giant kilowatt subwoofer 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.710
 there is absolutely no sound at the TV traditionally 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.390
 for lg quality but responsible for it 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.509
 two integrated total speakers 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.540
 20 watts or maybe back 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.240
 the panel is stuck with thousands of all kinds of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.000
 ports and connectors 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.100
 This is not their quite enough but such 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 dialing connection basically beyond 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 The standard does not come out probably the case 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 some kind of wireless protocol despite 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.910
 on the set of all interfaces is not that 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.720
 aha i thought up he eats not from children 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.840
 from three finger batteries it is already 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.239
 so much the burn method of elimination we 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.030
 approached the key features and she 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.000
 lies in the image peering into 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.000
 permission yes no you did not think 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.930
 it's all the same 4k resolution 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.080
 ultra hd okay good guessing 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.370
 meet 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.950
 white pixel soup goes I do not see and he 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.319
 eats here and white su pixel at first 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.170
 look not visible to him 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.069
 see we arm ourselves with serious optics for 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.569
 multiple increase what do we see 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.170
 it is located not in the excel itself and in 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.239
 matrix 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.730
 i.e. excel structure and not broken 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.130
 for those who do not know the whole image 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.040
 on the TV consists of tiny 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.410
 pixel points each this point is still from 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.140
 three smaller red lanterns 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.810
 green and blue is a pixel garden in 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.820
 depending on the intensity of their glow 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.790
 individually we see one or another 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.880
 Flowers pixel that gives us a general 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.120
 4 white su pixel firstly more 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.670
 natural white color secondly very 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.180
 and very tangible energy savings 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.910
 up to 35 percent many can ask 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.280
 question logically it means between 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.739
 pixels there is one more pixel soup 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.440
 which means resolution is less than ultra 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.750
 hd no she just ultra x dimm 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 Now I will explain how to calculate 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.579
 TV resolution on one simple and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.579
 clear formula and better by 3 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.650
 on 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.930
 Well, that's simple and clear that it is not clear 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.090
 translate into language available on TV 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.370
 An image consisting of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.130
 black and white horizontal lines 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.950
 each white line is 1 pixel wide 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.010
 alternate with black of the same width and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.710
 it turns out such a black and white vest 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.260
 white stripe should shine brighter than 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.180
 black three or more times if 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.250
 the requirement is met and then produced 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.590
 counting lines of horizontal and 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.020
 vertical counts them of course not 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.990
 just someone there as a serious 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.910
 organizations that claim it 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.210
 permission with a certificate 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.760
 and TV with this technology got 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.640
 there are as many as five of them 4 documents 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:44.080
 from super serious organizations such as 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:46.420
 jure si es ip pi jay and 5th interference 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.460
 two adjacent pixels uses 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.590
 together one soup pixel at least 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.520
 due to the special 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:58.300
 the algorithm so the resolution is exactly 3840 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.340
 by 2160 and not a single excel and less 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.770
 if the image quality in this 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.170
 TV is different from other 4k 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.810
 tv auto only in one aspect 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.270
 This model produces a more natural 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.520
 white color and no loss in 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.720
 detail you can make sure 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.330
 by myself 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.300
 here is this TV with white su pixel a 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.540
 this one without him I see no 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.910
 difference the detail is equally high on 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.980
 both TV features may be 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.530
 are not visible at first sight well, they 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.860
 do some seemingly familiar things 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.930
 to exclude 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.439
 and in this review from the company allo with you 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.060
 There was Kate and special TV Aldzhi 43
