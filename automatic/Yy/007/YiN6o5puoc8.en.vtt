00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.639
 expensive the amount of good to speak 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.889
 a small product that was sent to me 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.480
 for review and in fact I found the 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.740
 great product so I decided to you 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.220
 make a short video for you in 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.890
 speak 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.880
 what is it really about 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.760
 a mascara 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.500
 finally rather two products that we 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.730
 will apply on the eyelashes for the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.110
 make long thick finally provides everything 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.579
 I love and everything I do not have 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.039
 of course that's why 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:39.220
 I was very interested in testing this and 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:43.030
 so we have on one side the mascara and 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:47.310
 on the other side it's called infinito and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:50.860
 they are natural plant fibers 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.930
 black and I see you right now 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.149
 to arrive yes girls we know 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.000
 the one who was in a kind of thing 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.200
 white there that was stuck on the lashes then 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.820
 as it was white had to pass 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.010
 behind with a black thing well everything 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.659
 cover but no it's not that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.310
 all so if you want to know more 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.310
 stay with me that comes right away 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.780
 then these products are from the h &amp; m brand 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.240
 which is an Italian brand and therefore 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.490
 here is the mascara called mass 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.450
 terror is done to volumes so well 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.000
 sure mascara to give volume and the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.150
 infinito fibers is found in a small 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.120
 bottle like that and actually when I 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.650
 open I was very surprised because 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.500
 hop there I have not if you saw them 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.830
 fall have complained of any small 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.990
 book but not in a product not one 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.440
 it is not mascara in a kind of glÃ¼ck 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 white 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.720
 the fibers are finally laying his lesson on 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.040
 the brush there like that alone and so 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.730
 take a look to show a little bit 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.110
 common sancerre and to show you 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.110
 especially the result 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.990
 so I'll start with the eye 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.610
 law 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.040
 I take mascara and I go 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.510
 put well everywhere then we can even 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.410
 master above for those 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.550
 the habit of doing that so when I 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.140
 read everywhere it's not like that 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.600
 I like to do at the moment we are not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.920
 obliged to 100 meters on himself and once 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.870
 we have a masquerade we do not wait 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.239
 that it dries we take the small fibers 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.480
 so on or delicately to avoid in 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.530
 our everywhere we will come to be everything 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.600
 along so you'll see that it's going 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.600
 actually stick to mascara 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.560
 so we do not hesitate well went well 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.560
 in place and wherever you want 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.099
 and once we are satisfied with this 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.959
 we have on the eyelashes we take the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.959
 mascara and we come to work all that 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.980
 it will allow to fix a good time 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:15.900
 for all the little girls 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:18.830
 how many meters is also to do 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.830
 a little more natural 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.900
 so the only thing you need to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.880
 to be careful is not to 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.180
 not doing his complexion before his eyes 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.920
 because as you can see 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.930
 small fibers at the time of the break have 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.520
 trend of course stole a small 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.810
 little everywhere but that's okay 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.160
 because after I do not see if you 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.300
 see the result so compared to 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.470
 the other eye I do not know what you 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.030
 do you think about it but I find that the 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.880
 difference it's just flagrant 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.830
 I have rather short eyelashes rather 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.290
 not very provided there I find that 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.540
 I really do not know what it is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.640
 it's almost magical we almost have 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.790
 the impression that I put false eyelashes 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.860
 so for having tested his already twice 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.180
 over two full days that I can 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.900
 tell you is that the fibers do not fall 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.880
 I did not have any loss hole 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.860
 foam he declared throughout the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.079
 day so it's really good no 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.910
 worry as I told you the only little 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.970
 downside is to think well to do his 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.290
 dyed after placing his massara because 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.940
 that otherwise you will have plenty of 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.860
 small islands that may stick on 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.120
 your other foundation powder but 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.440
 that's me, I'm always used to 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.870
 to make time after anyway it's 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.760
 rare that I do the reverse and otherwise 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.280
 what can i tell you apart 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.350
 that these products frankly well I 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.150
 did not know at all and I am 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.800
 really happy to have accepted 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.510
 to test because ben in fact since 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.400
 I put every day that's because 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.070
 I like big eyelashes very very 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.930
 long and very dark and I think it has 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.789
 it's great anyway so if you 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.410
 also you have already tested these two 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.960
 small products that we find so 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.590
 at google.com especially do not hesitate to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.690
 let me know 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.120
 under the video as usual for me 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.830
 give your opinion is shared with us this 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.120
 that you think about it and then in the meantime 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.160
 I hope this little discovery 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.810
 package will have been helpful I tell you to 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.340
 soon for a next video there you 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.340
 embrace 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.340
 and 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.280
 and incidentally I was going to make a 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.280
 second offense
