figured<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.870> my<00:02:15.930> mind

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
figured out in my mind

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.430 
figured out in my mind
how<00:02:17.550> God<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:19.050> supposed<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:20.010> do<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.080> if<00:02:22.410> he

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
how God is supposed to do it and if he

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.300 
how God is supposed to do it and if he
doesn't<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:24.360> way<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.630> we<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.319> he

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
doesn't do it the way that we think he

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.839 
doesn't do it the way that we think he
ought<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.930> becomes<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.860> problem<00:02:29.220> for

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
ought to do it it becomes a problem for

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.420 
ought to do it it becomes a problem for
us<00:02:29.880> because<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.989> allow<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.319> enemy<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.890> tell<00:02:32.220> us

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
us because we allow the enemy to tell us

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.430 
us because we allow the enemy to tell us
well<00:02:32.849> I<00:02:32.880> guess<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.569> ain't<00:02:33.870> gonna<00:02:34.140> never<00:02:34.470> happen

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
well I guess it ain't gonna never happen

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.740 
well I guess it ain't gonna never happen
he<00:02:37.440> meant<00:02:37.739> somebody<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:39.209> how<00:02:39.360> many<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.630> you

he meant somebody but how many of you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.160 
he meant somebody but how many of you
know<00:02:39.930> God<00:02:40.319> does<00:02:40.830> not<00:02:41.030> have<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.300> work<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.959> way

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170

you<00:02:43.200> want<00:02:43.800> him<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.880> work<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.670> most<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you want him to work and most of the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.229 
you want him to work and most of the
time<00:02:48.269> he<00:02:48.870> doesn't<00:02:49.580> because<00:02:50.580> he<00:02:50.940> had<00:02:51.060> already

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
time he doesn't because he had already

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.800 
time he doesn't because he had already
