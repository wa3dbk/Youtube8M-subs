00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.030 
knife terminology video today we're
talking<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.980> knife<00:00:05.339> choil<00:00:06.120> that's<00:00:06.810> CH<00:00:07.770> Oh

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
talking about a knife choil that's CH Oh

talking about a knife choil that's CH Oh
il<00:00:08.760> knife<00:00:09.240> choil<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.679> we'll<00:00:10.950> use<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.400> little

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
il knife choil now we'll use this little

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.419 
il knife choil now we'll use this little
bench<00:00:12.240> made<00:00:12.509> fixed<00:00:13.349> blade<00:00:13.590> as<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> little

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
bench made fixed blade as a little

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.970 
bench made fixed blade as a little
demonstration<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.480> my<00:00:15.599> understanding

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
demonstration and for my understanding

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.570 
demonstration and for my understanding
the<00:00:16.980> definition<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.570> knife<00:00:18.840> choil<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the definition of a knife choil is the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.009 
the definition of a knife choil is the
unsharpened<00:00:21.480> section<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.369> blade<00:00:24.019> in

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
unsharpened section of the blade in

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.519 
unsharpened section of the blade in
between<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.619> sharp<00:00:25.890> part<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.760> handle<00:00:27.529> so

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
between the sharp part and the handle so

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.720 
between the sharp part and the handle so
if<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> thicker<00:00:29.130> blade<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.609> might

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
if you have a thicker blade you might

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460 
if you have a thicker blade you might
have<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.480> from<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> knife<00:00:31.080> design

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
have you just from the knife design

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.030 
have you just from the knife design
itself<00:00:31.920> creates<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.210> knife<00:00:33.960> choil<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
itself creates a knife choil so this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.180 
itself creates a knife choil so this
section<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:35.610> here<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:36.690> pointing<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
section right here that I'm pointing to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
section right here that I'm pointing to
would<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.219> considered<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> knife<00:00:39.600> coil<00:00:40.079> now

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
would be considered the knife coil now

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.170 
would be considered the knife coil now
I'm<00:00:40.950> sure<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
I'm sure this is you know kind of a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.340 
I'm sure this is you know kind of a
loose<00:00:42.329> term<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.690> could<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.870> back<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.079> forth

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
loose term you could go back and forth

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
loose term you could go back and forth
of<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.190> isn't<00:00:44.309> actual<00:00:44.700> I'll<00:00:45.030> just

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of what is and isn't actual I'll just

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.670 
of what is and isn't actual I'll just
give<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.930> definition<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.530> then

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
give you kind of my definition of then

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
give you kind of my definition of then
obviously<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> comment<00:00:47.460> down<00:00:47.700> below<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
obviously you can comment down below and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
obviously you can comment down below and
we<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.840> talk<00:00:48.989> about<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.350> some<00:00:49.379> more<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:49.860> from

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we can talk about it some more so from

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
we can talk about it some more so from
my<00:00:50.700> understanding<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.329> actually<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
my understanding this is actually a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
my understanding this is actually a
finger<00:00:52.530> groove<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.879> your<00:00:54.000> hand<00:00:54.239> would<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
finger groove that your hand would be in

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
finger groove that your hand would be in
now<00:00:55.140> some<00:00:55.440> knives<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.399> actually<00:00:56.940> push<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
now some knives will actually push the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.080 
now some knives will actually push the
choil<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.620> bit<00:00:58.739> farther<00:00:58.949> forward<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
choil a little bit farther forward so it

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.209 
choil a little bit farther forward so it
will<00:01:00.270> actually<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.750> right<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:02.010> we'll

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
will actually be right here now we'll

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.009 
will actually be right here now we'll
have<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.370> other<00:01:02.640> knives<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.449> demonstrate

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have some other knives to demonstrate

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
have some other knives to demonstrate
and<00:01:04.199> we'll<00:01:04.290> talk<00:01:04.500> about<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.369> example<00:01:05.790> this

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and we'll talk about it for example this

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.870 
and we'll talk about it for example this
bench<00:01:06.450> made<00:01:06.689> 710<00:01:07.409> doesn't<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
bench made 710 doesn't really have a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
bench made 710 doesn't really have a
choice<00:01:09.360> there's<00:01:09.869> no<00:01:10.080> real<00:01:10.400> unsharpened

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
choice there's no real unsharpened

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.980 
choice there's no real unsharpened
section<00:01:11.880> between<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> handle<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.960> blade

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
section between the handle and the blade

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.800 
section between the handle and the blade
now<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.280> consider<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.509> part

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now I just consider this you know part

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.160 
now I just consider this you know part
of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> handle<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.920> groove<00:01:17.570> now<00:01:18.570> we'll

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
of the handle and a groove now we'll

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.140 
of the handle and a groove now we'll
switch<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.950> good<00:01:20.130> example<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.850> tool

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
switch to a very good example of a tool

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
switch to a very good example of a tool
that<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.990> finger<00:01:22.500> groove<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> finger

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that is a finger groove or a finger

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.020 
that is a finger groove or a finger
choil<00:01:23.909> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> call<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
choil if you want to call it we have the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.719 
choil if you want to call it we have the
sage<00:01:27.320> Spyderco<00:01:28.320> sage<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:29.009> titanium<00:01:29.369> version

the<00:01:30.450> unsharpened<00:01:31.110> section<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:32.490> below<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
the unsharpened section just below the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.120 
the unsharpened section just below the
sharp<00:01:33.780> part<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> blade<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.740> here

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
sharp part of the blade is right here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.200 
sharp part of the blade is right here
now<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.299> designer<00:01:36.720> has<00:01:37.470> integrated<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
now the designer has integrated that to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.660 
now the designer has integrated that to
be<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> Fink<00:01:39.630> finger<00:01:39.930> groove<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.520> want

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
be a Fink finger groove or if you want

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
be a Fink finger groove or if you want
to<00:01:41.729> call<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.240> finger<00:01:43.170> choil

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to call it a finger choil

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
to call it a finger choil
the<00:01:44.430> finger<00:01:45.390> choil<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> call<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
the finger choil if you want to call it

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.639 
the finger choil if you want to call it
on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> sage<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.210> aids<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.810> grip<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.470> also

on the sage it aids in grip and it also
aids<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.549> you're<00:01:50.759> doing<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.119> finer<00:01:51.420> cutting

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.300 
you can also you know obviously move
your<00:01:53.490> hand<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.720> using<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.829> finger

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
your hand back here but using the finger

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
choil

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.749 
choil
is<00:01:56.909> very<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:58.020> useful<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:59.189> let's<00:01:59.399> talk<00:01:59.520> about

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
is very very useful now let's talk about

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.100 
is very very useful now let's talk about
some<00:01:59.939> of<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> other<00:02:00.210> knives<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.810> here

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
some of the other knives we have here

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.929 
some of the other knives we have here
and

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
and

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.870 
and
we'll<00:02:02.600> find<00:02:02.840> out<00:02:02.960> if<00:02:03.110> it's<00:02:03.320> H<00:02:03.560> or<00:02:03.829> not<00:02:04.130> now<00:02:04.549> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
we'll find out if it's H or not now the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.789 
we'll find out if it's H or not now the
exact<00:02:05.210> definition<00:02:05.360> is<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.229> unsharpened

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
exact definition is the unsharpened

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.630 
exact definition is the unsharpened
section<00:02:07.310> below<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.770> sharp<00:02:10.250> part<00:02:10.550> of<00:02:10.580> the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
section below the the sharp part of the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.120 
section below the the sharp part of the
blade<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.209> is<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.930> toil<00:02:12.380> or<00:02:12.650> or<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.040> this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
blade so is this the toil or or is this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.400 
blade so is this the toil or or is this
the<00:02:13.310> finger<00:02:13.610> groove<00:02:13.880> I<00:02:14.150> don't<00:02:14.599> know<00:02:14.750> but<00:02:15.019> this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the finger groove I don't know but this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.220 
the finger groove I don't know but this
knife<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.130> spine<00:02:16.940> clipper<00:02:17.360> becomes<00:02:17.810> kind<00:02:18.140> of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
knife the spine clipper becomes kind of

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.960 
knife the spine clipper becomes kind of
the<00:02:18.319> finger<00:02:18.680> guard<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.640> don't<00:02:19.819> know<00:02:19.880> if

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the finger guard so I don't know if

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.150 
the finger guard so I don't know if
we're<00:02:20.120> calling<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.900> finger<00:02:21.739> choil<00:02:21.950> but

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
we're calling this the finger choil but

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.339 
we're calling this the finger choil but
I<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.280> believe<00:02:22.819> that's<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.750> case<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.200> that's

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
I do believe that's the case and that's

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.970 
I do believe that's the case and that's
like<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.680> finger<00:02:25.400> groove<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.709> very

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
like a finger groove and this is very

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.640 
like a finger groove and this is very
similar<00:02:28.340> on<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.940> new<00:02:29.349> Benchmade<00:02:30.380> axis<00:02:31.190> folder

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
similar on the new Benchmade axis folder

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.820 
similar on the new Benchmade axis folder
the<00:02:33.650> spine<00:02:34.310> flipper<00:02:34.760> becomes<00:02:35.330> part<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the spine flipper becomes part of the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.190 
the spine flipper becomes part of the
first<00:02:37.549> finger<00:02:37.790> groove<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.840> still<00:02:39.170> believe

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
first finger groove and I still believe

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.100 
first finger groove and I still believe
that<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.890> by<00:02:40.549> exact<00:02:41.090> definition<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
that this by exact definition is the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.660 
that this by exact definition is the
finger<00:02:42.799> choil<00:02:43.010> now<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:44.030> also<00:02:44.209> have<00:02:44.510> the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
finger choil now we also have the

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.140 
finger choil now we also have the
Microtech<00:02:46.690> select-fire<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:48.489> i<00:02:49.489> believe<00:02:49.880> this

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
Microtech select-fire and i believe this

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.289 
Microtech select-fire and i believe this
is<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.450> finger<00:02:51.080> choil<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.650> first<00:02:52.640> part<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.180> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
is a finger choil the first part of the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.120 
is a finger choil the first part of the
blade<00:02:53.569> that<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.930> unsharpened<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.829> finger

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
blade that is unsharpened your finger

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.670 
blade that is unsharpened your finger
goes<00:02:55.340> right<00:02:55.579> there<00:02:55.790> very<00:02:56.750> nice<00:02:57.049> for<00:02:57.319> grip<00:02:57.500> on

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
goes right there very nice for grip on

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.789 
goes right there very nice for grip on
this<00:02:57.799> blade<00:02:58.209> and<00:02:59.209> smaller<00:03:00.019> tasks<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.739> you

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
this blade and smaller tasks and you

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.319 
this blade and smaller tasks and you
have<00:03:00.950> kind<00:03:01.130> of<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.340> long<00:03:01.549> travel<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.239> the

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
have kind of that long travel on the

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.809 
have kind of that long travel on the
handle<00:03:02.750> gives<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.440> some<00:03:03.650> more<00:03:03.680> reach<00:03:03.980> now

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
handle gives you some more reach now

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.059 
handle gives you some more reach now
we'll<00:03:04.970> talk<00:03:05.120> about<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.569> little<00:03:06.069> inexpensive

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
we'll talk about this little inexpensive

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.210 
we'll talk about this little inexpensive
neck<00:03:07.670> knife<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.150> we<00:03:08.269> have<00:03:08.480> here<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.019> just

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
neck knife that we have here and just

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.160 
neck knife that we have here and just
below<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.400> sharp<00:03:10.670> part<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.180> blade<00:03:11.299> you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
below the sharp part of the blade you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.500 
below the sharp part of the blade you
have<00:03:12.200> an<00:03:12.530> unsharpened<00:03:13.100> section<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.299> little

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
have an unsharpened section and a little

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.660 
have an unsharpened section and a little
indentation<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.440> would<00:03:15.859> definitely<00:03:16.250> call<00:03:16.430> this

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
indentation I would definitely call this

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.410 
indentation I would definitely call this
a<00:03:16.850> finger<00:03:17.450> choil<00:03:17.889> now<00:03:18.889> what<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.819> does<00:03:19.850> for<00:03:20.329> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
a finger choil now what it does for the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.390 
a finger choil now what it does for the
knife<00:03:20.600> besides<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.319> design<00:03:21.620> factor<00:03:22.130> if<00:03:22.280> it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
knife besides the design factor if it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.520 
knife besides the design factor if it
didn't<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.000> if<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.989> knife<00:03:24.139> were<00:03:24.319> just

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
didn't have that if the knife were just

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.559 
didn't have that if the knife were just
to<00:03:24.650> go<00:03:24.680> straight<00:03:24.829> across<00:03:25.340> right<00:03:25.700> here<00:03:26.030> I<00:03:26.209> would

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
to go straight across right here I would

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.420 
to go straight across right here I would
get<00:03:26.690> about<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.139> much<00:03:27.350> grip<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.829> it<00:03:27.950> not<00:03:28.100> a<00:03:28.160> ton

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
get about that much grip on it not a ton

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.729 
get about that much grip on it not a ton
of<00:03:28.459> control<00:03:28.850> but<00:03:29.540> since<00:03:29.810> they've<00:03:30.019> put<00:03:30.620> this

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
of control but since they've put this

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.860 
of control but since they've put this
finger<00:03:31.160> choil<00:03:31.370> in<00:03:31.579> here<00:03:31.790> when<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.239> grip<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.600> I

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
finger choil in here when I grip it I

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.140 
finger choil in here when I grip it I
feel<00:03:33.049> like<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.260> have<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.470> ton<00:03:33.829> of<00:03:33.859> control<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.700> lot

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
feel like I have a ton of control a lot

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.759 
feel like I have a ton of control a lot
more<00:03:35.299> power<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.290> whole<00:03:36.470> lot<00:03:36.650> more

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
more power and just a whole lot more

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.440 
more power and just a whole lot more
cutting<00:03:37.160> force<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.970> that's<00:03:38.150> just<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.420> little

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
cutting force so that's just a little

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.690 
cutting force so that's just a little
bit<00:03:38.750> about<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.530> knife<00:03:39.859> choil

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
bit about the knife choil

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.759 
bit about the knife choil
and<00:03:41.450> also<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> finger<00:03:42.109> choil<00:03:42.319> those<00:03:42.590> two

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
and also the finger choil those two

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.590 
and also the finger choil those two
terms<00:03:43.040> kind<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.760> go<00:03:43.819> hand<00:03:43.970> in<00:03:44.120> hand<00:03:44.180> depending

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
terms kind of go hand in hand depending
