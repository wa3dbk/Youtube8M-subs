00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.090
 The main characteristic is that the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.200
 River Lempa is the largest river the 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.470
 longest savior has 257 kilometers 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.080
 in its total length between mountains and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.379
 hillside is the longest river in El Salvador 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:37.829
 he travels his lands from north to south until 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:39.780
 arrive at your destination the pacific ocean 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.809
 of the rivers that drain to the ocean 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.940
 Pacific is the longest in all of America 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.379
 those that drain the peaceful oceans 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.359
 Of course there are others that drain to the ocean 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.989
 Atlantic that are longer as the 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.420
 amazon etcetera this old river has 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.899
 its origins in the volcanic mountains 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.729
 of the central plateaus of the region 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:03.689
 located between guatemala honduras and the 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:07.729
 savior the river is born at a height of 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:11.610
 1,500 meters above sea level the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.530
 49 to 50% of the area of ​​the basin is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.140
 finds in El Salvador the other 40% 50% 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.450
 It is located in Guatemala and Honduras. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.280
 upper parts of the river lempa let's say 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 that offers a fast-flowing environment 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.170
 then the upper course of the river offers 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.530
 a fast-flowing environment with so much 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.200
 of waters a little more crystalline 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.000
 and reaching the middle and lower part of the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 sunset on the side of san vicente 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.820
 the speed of the waters begins 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 get dim 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.970
 Y 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.520
 why 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.490
 according to investigations the ancient past 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.310
 of the river lempa dates from more than 5 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.980
 millions of years his birth had 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.290
 place along several processes that 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.170
 started with the existence of two lakes 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.490
 located in the northwestern and northern part 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.960
 From Salvador 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.200
 called lake metapán and slow lake 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.150
 geography in general has its 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.970
 origins in a very different way it 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.160
 what we have now 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.190
 if we had for example in the area of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 metapán in the belly area had 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:38.030
 true water and it is very possible that there 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.030
 had origins from one side 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.379
 Y 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.220
 and as is natural in a river of 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.620
 dimensions of the great river lempa its waters 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.530
 and its environment are home to several species 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.670
 of flora and fauna that enrich the environment 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.670
 environment of the region 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 good about what wildlife is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.380
 and the flora the truth is that the river lempa 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.069
 It offers a very high weights 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.130
 here commonly in summer in the chimbera 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.530
 the father the sea bass and the red mouth 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.709
 are the species that predominate in 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.880
 which is the river in the winter because what 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.880
 disappears in the chimbera 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.900
 there is a diversity of birds and people 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.690
 can come and go at 3 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.730
 to see the amount of pelican 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:54.390
 javi ruiz visites art better than he left 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.600
 joaquin all this kind of birds that 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 they come because there are let's say as food 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.450
 for them besides being a source of water 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.450
 for many cities of the country the force 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.270
 natural of this river makes the 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.180
 Hydroelectric Dams November 5 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.690
 closed a big September 15 and the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.810
 rennet me 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.299
 of the river lempa supplies most of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.790
 of the metropolitan area of San Salvador 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 with a true drinking water and also 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.610
 we have everything known that in the river 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.470
 lempa are the four central 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.090
 hydroelectric plants that generate the most 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.270
 part of the electricity for the country 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.910
 However the modernization of man 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.190
 and the arrival of industrialization does not 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.900
 have gone unnoticed by health 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.470
 environmental of the river lempa 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.630
 the whole industry contributes heavy metals 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.670
 industry dyeing industry 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.890
 everything that is the industrial zone contributes 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.270
 quite enough pollution in 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.640
 any of the activities that 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.220
 we develop in the basin of 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.500
 River Lempa will affect the resource 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.240
 so what we have to 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.750
 concentrate precisely is on 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.350
 protect or in which our actions 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.850
 of production or use of recreation not 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.790
 impact the river so much because we are that 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.680
 let 's say it 's the water source for 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.130
 the future the savior also they are 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.320
 doing many actions to be able 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.920
 develop that better and keep it 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:32.130
 the ecology despite this situation 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.470
 organized communities take advantage 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.690
 the natural beauty of the lempa river for 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.960
 promote tourism projects that help 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.990
 to the development of the area 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.389
 meanwhile the river lempa continues 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.729
 flowing to the sea with the pride of 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.099
 be the most important of the rivers 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.650
 Salvadorans and being a source of life 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:55.569
 for thousands of animal species and 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.569
 vegetables as well as for the human being
