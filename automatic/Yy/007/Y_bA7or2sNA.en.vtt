00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
specialized case it does require some

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.930 
specialized case it does require some
level<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.790> care<00:00:15.440> when<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> install<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.220> in

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940

this video I hope to show you some other
points<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.080> install<00:00:22.439> it

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
points so that you can install it

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
points so that you can install it
successfully<00:00:23.810> so<00:00:24.810> open<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> box<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.119> this

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
successfully so open up the box and this

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.419 
successfully so open up the box and this
is<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.480> case<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.050> you'll<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.800> it's

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
is your case and you'll see that it's

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.220 
is your case and you'll see that it's
retained<00:00:30.090> by<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.920> very<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.640> thin<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.840> tiny

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
retained by for very very thin and tiny

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.520 
retained by for very very thin and tiny
screws<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.190> also<00:00:35.730> take<00:00:36.090> care<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> twist

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
screws and also take care not to twist

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.970 
screws and also take care not to twist
the<00:00:38.430> corners<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> modules<00:00:39.809> otherwise<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
the corners of the modules otherwise the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
the corners of the modules otherwise the
entire<00:00:42.469> assemblies<00:00:43.469> will<00:00:43.680> twist<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:44.360> one

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
entire assemblies will twist off one

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
entire assemblies will twist off one
thing<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.719> will<00:00:46.020> note<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> screw<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
thing I will note about this screw is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
thing I will note about this screw is
that<00:00:47.430> even<00:00:47.850> though<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.239> try<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> make<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> as

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that even though we try to make it as

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.060 
that even though we try to make it as
hard<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.649> possible<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.700> actually<00:00:51.270> in

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
hard as possible and it's actually in

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.700 
hard as possible and it's actually in
stainless<00:00:53.070> screws<00:00:53.370> they<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.420> also<00:00:54.660> very<00:00:54.899> very

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
stainless screws they are also very very

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.450 
stainless screws they are also very very
fragile<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.289> right<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:59.070> you

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
fragile so I will say right now that you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.080 
fragile so I will say right now that you
can<00:00:59.699> only<00:01:00.260> turn<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.949> allen<00:01:02.340> wrench<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
can only turn your allen wrench which is

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.219 
can only turn your allen wrench which is
provided<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:05.060> to<00:01:06.439> just<00:01:07.439> about<00:01:09.229> enough

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
provided here to just about enough

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
provided here to just about enough
tightness<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.250> not<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:12.000> tighten<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
tightness as to not to over tighten I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
tightness as to not to over tighten I
would<00:01:13.020> say<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> couple<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> turn

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
would say just do it in a couple of turn

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.999 
would say just do it in a couple of turn
even<00:01:15.600> before<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.140> feel<00:01:16.380> any<00:01:16.590> kind<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
even before you feel any kind of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.730 
even before you feel any kind of
resistance<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.909> was<00:01:18.210> trying<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> see<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.560> it's

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
resistance I was trying to see if it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.950 
resistance I was trying to see if it's
tight<00:01:20.040> enough<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.549> if<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.180> already<00:01:21.479> is

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
tight enough and if it already is

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
tight enough and if it already is
I<00:01:21.990> will<00:01:22.200> stop<00:01:22.890> trying<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> over<00:01:23.729> tighten<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
I will stop trying to over tighten I

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.260 
I will stop trying to over tighten I
have<00:01:24.720> received<00:01:25.170> some<00:01:25.530> feedback<00:01:25.759> from<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
have received some feedback from some of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
have received some feedback from some of
you<00:01:27.600> saying<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.500> school<00:01:28.829> twist<00:01:29.100> twist

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you saying that the school twist twist

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
you saying that the school twist twist
off<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.240> expected<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> happen<00:01:31.170> which

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
off and we expected that to happen which

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.969 
off and we expected that to happen which
is<00:01:31.920> why<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.340> provided<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> spare<00:01:33.659> screws<00:01:34.409> over

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
is why we provided the spare screws over

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.490 
is why we provided the spare screws over
here<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.549> still<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.390> very<00:01:36.540> hard<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> get<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
here but still it's very hard to get the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.649 
here but still it's very hard to get the
screws<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.040> especially<00:01:38.759> when<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> twist<00:01:39.360> off

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
screws out especially when you twist off

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.050 
screws out especially when you twist off
the<00:01:39.689> head<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.280> some<00:01:41.610> kind

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the head you will have to get some kind

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.889 
the head you will have to get some kind
of<00:01:42.180> tweezer<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.770> pop<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.899> the

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
of tweezer and then pop the the

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.170 
of tweezer and then pop the the
remaining<00:01:46.740> screw<00:01:47.670> away<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:50.060> from<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
remaining screw away from your from the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.590 
remaining screw away from your from the
modules<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.710> go<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.820> per<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
modules so here we go so as per the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.770 
modules so here we go so as per the
instruction<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> back<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> box

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
instruction at the back of the box

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.230 
instruction at the back of the box
right<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.799> would<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.130> off<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.969> two

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
right here you would take off these two

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.280 
right here you would take off these two
bottom<00:02:00.600> corners<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.820> go

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
bottom corners right here so here I go

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.630 
bottom corners right here so here I go
so<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:05.040> allen<00:02:05.700> wrench<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.390> got<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:08.369> very

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so the allen wrench that we got is very

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.119 
so the allen wrench that we got is very
tiny<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.810> would<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.099> kind

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
tiny so you would have to have some kind

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.830 
tiny so you would have to have some kind
of<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.760> patience<00:02:12.360> working<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.470> it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of a patience working with it

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:24.150 
of a patience working with it
so<00:02:14.290> that's<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:14.800> corner<00:02:15.160> off<00:02:18.870> two<00:02:19.870> corner<00:02:23.160> take

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
so that's one corner off two corner take

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.780 
so that's one corner off two corner take
your<00:02:24.340> phone<00:02:24.580> make<00:02:24.819> sure<00:02:24.940> it's<00:02:25.090> clean<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
your phone make sure it's clean and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.309 
your phone make sure it's clean and
slide<00:02:27.790> it<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.800> carefully<00:02:29.800> now<00:02:30.790> that's<00:02:31.319> when

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
slide it in carefully now that's when

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.770 
slide it in carefully now that's when
you<00:02:32.440> see<00:02:32.709> these<00:02:32.920> two<00:02:33.220> corners<00:02:33.550> snapped<00:02:34.209> in<00:02:34.450> you

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
you see these two corners snapped in you

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.400 
you see these two corners snapped in you
got<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:37.390> X<00:02:37.690> frames<00:02:38.140> right

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
got it there and these X frames right

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.930 
got it there and these X frames right
here<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.860> we<00:02:38.980> got<00:02:39.250> from<00:02:39.430> some<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.849> the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
here that we got from some of the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.710 
here that we got from some of the
analyzer<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.959> some<00:02:41.200> reason<00:02:41.680> they<00:02:42.250> are<00:02:42.459> not<00:02:42.819> as

analyzer for some reason they are not as

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.320 
analyzer for some reason they are not as
precisely<00:02:44.440> aligned<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.610> holes<00:02:45.880> as<00:02:46.150> we

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
precisely aligned to the holes as we

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.270 
precisely aligned to the holes as we
would<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.930> if<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.470> receive<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.950> few

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
would like so if you do receive a few

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.210 
would like so if you do receive a few
units<00:02:48.700> where<00:02:49.330> these<00:02:49.569> X<00:02:49.840> corners<00:02:50.500> are<00:02:50.799> kind<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
units where these X corners are kind of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.870 
units where these X corners are kind of
out<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:51.850> please<00:02:52.890> accept<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:54.040> apology<00:02:54.610> and

out here please accept my apology and
kind<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:56.130> wiggle<00:02:57.130> them<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.850> they're<00:02:58.000> more

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
kind of wiggle them so that they're more

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.089 
kind of wiggle them so that they're more
aligned<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.140> then<00:02:59.290> we'll<00:02:59.560> fit<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.799> phone

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
aligned and then we'll fit the phone

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.640 
aligned and then we'll fit the phone
more<00:03:00.310> precisely<00:03:00.819> those<00:03:01.540> are<00:03:01.810> only<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
more precisely those are only for the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.100 
more precisely those are only for the
earlier<00:03:03.040> patches<00:03:03.549> for<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.000> later<00:03:04.269> batches<00:03:04.780> we

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
earlier patches for the later batches we

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.699 
earlier patches for the later batches we
have<00:03:05.319> control<00:03:05.769> problems<00:03:06.450> control<00:03:07.709> mechanisms

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
have control problems control mechanisms

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.259 
have control problems control mechanisms
that<00:03:09.130> have<00:03:09.280> taken<00:03:09.489> care<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:09.880> that

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
that have taken care of that

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.690 
that have taken care of that
so<00:03:10.690> align<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.519> modules<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.620> X<00:03:15.310> frame

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
so align the modules with the X frame

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.100 
so align the modules with the X frame
there<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.299> can<00:03:16.480> see<00:03:16.690> there<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:16.959> then

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
there and you can see there and then

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.250 
there and you can see there and then
just<00:03:17.500> use<00:03:17.880> your<00:03:18.880> two<00:03:19.180> fingers<00:03:19.570> to<00:03:19.750> pick<00:03:19.930> up<00:03:20.109> the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
just use your two fingers to pick up the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.220 
just use your two fingers to pick up the
screws<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.040> then<00:03:21.430> put<00:03:22.299> one<00:03:22.329> corner<00:03:22.840> there

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
screws and then put one corner there

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.390 
screws and then put one corner there
take<00:03:24.070> your<00:03:24.250> teeny<00:03:24.730> tiny<00:03:25.030> little<00:03:25.269> allen<00:03:25.630> wrench

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
take your teeny tiny little allen wrench

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:35.309 
take your teeny tiny little allen wrench
and<00:03:27.780> very<00:03:28.780> carefully<00:03:29.910> feel<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:33.310> thread<00:03:34.319> going

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
and very carefully feel the thread going

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.580 
and very carefully feel the thread going
into<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:37.239> modules<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:40.569> process<00:03:40.989> again

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
into the modules and this process again

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.940 
into the modules and this process again
I<00:03:41.769> will<00:03:41.980> stress<00:03:42.250> one<00:03:42.430> more<00:03:42.579> time<00:03:42.819> do<00:03:43.810> not<00:03:43.950> over

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
I will stress one more time do not over

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.050 
I will stress one more time do not over
tighten<00:03:44.980> because<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.530> screws<00:03:48.250> will<00:03:48.670> break

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
tighten because the screws will break

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.500 
tighten because the screws will break
off<00:03:50.370> okay<00:03:51.600> let's<00:03:52.600> give<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:52.930> one<00:03:53.109> more<00:03:53.260> try

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
off okay let's give it one more try

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:06.080 
off okay let's give it one more try
you'll<00:03:55.510> take<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.780> couple<00:03:56.079> of<00:03:56.260> tries<00:03:56.470> here

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.330 

it's<00:04:06.630> much<00:04:06.810> easier<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.560> pick<00:04:07.770> up<00:04:07.920> your<00:04:08.100> phone

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
it's much easier to pick up your phone

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.000 
it's much easier to pick up your phone
run<00:04:08.670> it<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:08.910> have<00:04:09.090> it<00:04:09.120> laying<00:04:09.420> down<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.860> way

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
run it and have it laying down that way

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.430 
run it and have it laying down that way
you<00:04:11.069> can<00:04:11.400> get<00:04:11.580> a<00:04:11.640> better<00:04:11.850> view<00:04:12.150> -<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.780> how<00:04:13.080> many

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you can get a better view - of how many

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.000 
you can get a better view - of how many
turns<00:04:13.770> you<00:04:14.069> haven't<00:04:14.310> gotten<00:04:14.490> it<00:04:14.640> no<00:04:15.300> I<00:04:16.010> would

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
turns you haven't gotten it no I would

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.920 
turns you haven't gotten it no I would
say<00:04:17.250> don't<00:04:17.639> even<00:04:18.299> try<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.810> tighten<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.859> beyond

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
say don't even try to tighten it beyond

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.629 
say don't even try to tighten it beyond
seeing<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.169> screw<00:04:22.440> sitting<00:04:22.860> flush<00:04:23.220> because

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
seeing the screw sitting flush because

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.409 
seeing the screw sitting flush because
that<00:04:24.120> will<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.680> round<00:04:25.680> off<00:04:25.919> make<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.910> allen

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
that will just round off make the allen

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.010 
that will just round off make the allen
wrench<00:04:27.750> round<00:04:28.500> off<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.980> hex<00:04:29.910> there<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.450> also

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
wrench round off the hex there and also

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.960 
wrench round off the hex there and also
twist<00:04:31.500> off<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.889> head<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.280> would<00:04:32.430> say<00:04:32.550> just<00:04:32.700> try

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
twist off the head I would say just try

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.360 
twist off the head I would say just try
to<00:04:33.090> feel<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.600> tiny<00:04:33.990> even<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.800> tiny<00:04:35.010> bit<00:04:35.130> of

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
to feel it a tiny even a tiny bit of

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.450 
to feel it a tiny even a tiny bit of
resistance<00:04:36.050> should<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.230> should<00:04:37.740> be<00:04:37.889> enough<00:04:38.220> to

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
resistance should be should be enough to

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.750 
resistance should be should be enough to
tighten<00:04:38.790> your<00:04:39.230> your<00:04:40.230> walk<00:04:40.919> your<00:04:41.070> one<00:04:41.280> module

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
tighten your your walk your one module

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.790 
tighten your your walk your one module
there<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.450> come<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.320> check<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
there so you just come and check in the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.740 
there so you just come and check in the
front<00:04:44.070> see<00:04:44.430> how<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.669> kind<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.240> grips<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:47.750> bezel

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
front see how it kind of grips the bezel

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.140 
front see how it kind of grips the bezel
of<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.990> iPhone<00:04:49.350> already<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:49.980> then<00:04:50.400> let's

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
of the iPhone already and then let's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.780 
of the iPhone already and then let's
move<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.810> other<00:04:51.930> corner<00:04:52.520> same<00:04:53.520> thing

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
move on to the other corner same thing

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.110 
move on to the other corner same thing

here line it with the hole between the
module<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.780> X<00:04:59.120> and<00:05:02.810> here

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:16.840 

okay<00:05:09.310> here<00:05:09.669> we<00:05:09.789> go

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:28.300 

checking<00:05:17.630> out<00:05:17.780> your<00:05:17.900> linemen<00:05:26.290> so<00:05:27.290> again<00:05:28.070> I

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
checking out your linemen so again I

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.330 
checking out your linemen so again I
make<00:05:28.580> like<00:05:28.790> about<00:05:29.170> two<00:05:30.170> to<00:05:30.650> two<00:05:30.680> and<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:31.130> half

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
make like about two to two and a half

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.840 
make like about two to two and a half
turns<00:05:31.940> before<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:33.200> screw<00:05:33.560> sits<00:05:34.130> flush<00:05:34.520> with

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
turns before the screw sits flush with

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.890 
turns before the screw sits flush with
the<00:05:35.920> with<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.010> X<00:05:37.190> frame<00:05:37.550> here<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.240> that's

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
the with the X frame here and that's

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.620 
the with the X frame here and that's
that's<00:05:39.550> maybe<00:05:40.550> I<00:05:40.640> would<00:05:40.820> say<00:05:40.850> maybe<00:05:41.360> another

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
that's maybe I would say maybe another

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.900 
that's maybe I would say maybe another
half<00:05:42.470> a<00:05:42.650> turn<00:05:44.020> and<00:05:45.020> then<00:05:45.830> once<00:05:46.220> you<00:05:46.370> feel<00:05:46.670> a

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
half a turn and then once you feel a

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.400 
half a turn and then once you feel a
slight<00:05:47.390> resistance<00:05:47.810> a<00:05:49.690> very<00:05:50.690> tiny<00:05:51.080> slight

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
slight resistance a very tiny slight

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.110 
slight resistance a very tiny slight
resistance<00:05:51.650> I<00:05:52.010> would<00:05:52.250> stop<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.700> turn<00:05:52.940> the

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
resistance I would stop and turn the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.260 
resistance I would stop and turn the
phone<00:05:53.300> over<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:55.130> have<00:05:55.340> completed<00:05:56.120> the

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
phone over and you have completed the

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.800 
phone over and you have completed the
installations<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:58.330> one<00:05:59.330> more<00:05:59.510> thing<00:05:59.630> I<00:05:59.750> would

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
sharp corners all around because of the

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.110 
sharp corners all around because of the
precision<00:06:17.710> CNC<00:06:18.710> machining<00:06:19.310> so<00:06:19.550> just<00:06:19.910> take

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
precision CNC machining so just take
