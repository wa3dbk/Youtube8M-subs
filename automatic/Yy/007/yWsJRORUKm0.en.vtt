00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
I'm going to find the bladder point the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600 
I'm going to find the bladder point the
bladder<00:01:39.210> hole<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.259> ball<00:01:40.439> every<00:01:41.189> ball<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bladder hole of the ball every ball is

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.819 
bladder hole of the ball every ball is
constructed<00:01:42.360> obviously<00:01:42.840> with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> ability

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
constructed obviously with the ability

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.889 
constructed obviously with the ability
to<00:01:43.860> take<00:01:44.159> air<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.579> or<00:01:44.759> put<00:01:44.939> air<00:01:45.060> take<00:01:45.540> care<00:01:45.689> out

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
to take air in or put air take care out

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.200

put area under take air out of the ball

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
put area under take air out of the ball
and<00:01:48.299> at<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.540> point<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.290> bladder<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
and at that point the bladder is

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
and at that point the bladder is
constructed<00:01:50.430> almost<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> point<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> that's

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
constructed almost to a point and that's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.499 
constructed almost to a point and that's
probably<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.530> least<00:01:52.740> true<00:01:53.159> spot<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.329> ball

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
probably the least true spot on the ball

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.630 
probably the least true spot on the ball

have the bladder point pointed away from
my<00:02:00.299> foot<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.409> meet<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.829> ball

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
my foot so that when I do meet the ball

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.550 
my foot so that when I do meet the ball
I<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.479> I'm<00:02:03.570> hitting<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.930> true<00:02:04.170> area<00:02:04.469> of

the ball where the ball will go

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.620 
the ball where the ball will go

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
wanted to go the next thing is to make

distance from the ball to make contact

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.789 
distance from the ball to make contact
and<00:03:07.760> every<00:03:08.030> goalkeeper<00:03:08.419> has<00:03:08.780> their<00:03:09.769> own

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
and every goalkeeper has their own

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.369 
and every goalkeeper has their own
distance<00:03:10.549> which<00:03:10.669> is<00:03:10.699> proper<00:03:11.209> for<00:03:11.389> them<00:03:11.540> some

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
distance which is proper for them some

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.229

on a longer run-up I believe in going
about<00:03:16.669> six<00:03:16.970> yards<00:03:17.269> back<00:03:17.449> which<00:03:17.959> the<00:03:18.079> distance

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
about six yards back which the distance

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.979 
about six yards back which the distance
from<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.859> line<00:03:19.099> to<00:03:19.729> the<00:03:19.849> six<00:03:20.090> yards<00:03:20.389> you're

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
from the in line to the six yards you're

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.009 
from the in line to the six yards you're
six<00:03:21.290> yard<00:03:21.500> box<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:22.250> meet<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.519> ball<00:03:22.699> in<00:03:23.419> that
