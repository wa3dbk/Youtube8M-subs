00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hey it's Chelsea and today I'm making a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.749 
hey it's Chelsea and today I'm making a
tutorial<00:00:02.970> video<00:00:03.890> because<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.920> was<00:00:05.130> requested

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
tutorial video because I was requested

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.009 
tutorial video because I was requested
to<00:00:05.790> make<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.330> tutorial<00:00:06.839> video<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:08.210> I<00:00:09.210> wasn't

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to make a tutorial video and I wasn't

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.660 
to make a tutorial video and I wasn't
quite<00:00:10.349> sure<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.950> at<00:00:11.070> first<00:00:11.099> that's

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
quite sure what to do at first that's

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.910 
quite sure what to do at first that's
why<00:00:11.820> it's<00:00:12.000> taken<00:00:12.330> so<00:00:12.360> long<00:00:12.509> but<00:00:13.080> I've<00:00:13.469> decided

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
why it's taken so long but I've decided

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.859 
why it's taken so long but I've decided

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
I'm going to teach you how to make a

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
I'm going to teach you how to make a
cootie<00:00:18.869> catcher<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.410> fortune-teller<00:00:20.039> if<00:00:20.400> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
cootie catcher or fortune-teller if you

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.639 
scissors right now so you should fold
the<00:00:33.960> paper<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:35.329> this<00:00:36.380> way

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the paper in this way

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
the paper in this way
so<00:00:38.719> yeah<00:00:46.700> okay<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.210> folded<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> paper

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
so yeah okay so you folded the paper

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.459 
so yeah okay so you folded the paper
like<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.440> oh<00:00:50.539> this<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> product

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
like this oh this is what the product

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.220 
like this oh this is what the product
should<00:00:52.590> look<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:54.110> you're<00:00:55.110> going

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
should look like and then you're going

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
should look like and then you're going
to<00:00:55.410> cut<00:00:55.739> along<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> line<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.489> it's<00:00:59.489> not<00:00:59.640> too

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
to cut along this line so it's not too

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:16.140 
to cut along this line so it's not too
easy<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.449> do<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:01.609> like<00:01:02.609> that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.240 

sorry<00:01:17.150> my<00:01:17.630> cat<00:01:17.870> just<00:01:17.900> made<00:01:18.290> an<00:01:18.410> appearance<00:01:18.740> to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
sorry my cat just made an appearance to

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:29.710 
sorry my cat just made an appearance to
the<00:01:19.370> video<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:24.200> Nate<00:01:24.560> was<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:28.450> okay<00:01:29.480> and

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the video and Nate was not you okay and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.150 
the video and Nate was not you okay and
so<00:01:30.200> now<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:32.180> square<00:01:33.080> or<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.590> perfect

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
so now you have a square or a perfect

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.490 
so now you have a square or a perfect
square<00:01:34.340> if<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:35.530> cut<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.560> cut<00:01:37.160> neatly<00:01:38.230> but<00:01:39.230> I'm

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
square if you cut it cut neatly but I'm

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.859 
square if you cut it cut neatly but I'm
not<00:01:39.710> very<00:01:39.950> good<00:01:40.040> at<00:01:40.190> cutting<00:01:40.430> so<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.510> not<00:01:41.660> as

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
not very good at cutting so it's not as

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.930 
not very good at cutting so it's not as
perfect<00:01:42.080> but<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.710> next<00:01:42.950> step<00:01:43.160> is<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.580> fold<00:01:43.760> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
perfect but the next step is to fold it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.859 
perfect but the next step is to fold it
in<00:01:44.060> half<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.600> diagonal<00:01:44.930> way<00:01:45.229> like<00:01:45.590> this<00:01:45.740> and

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
in half the diagonal way like this and

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.210 
in half the diagonal way like this and
once<00:01:47.869> you're<00:01:48.020> done<00:01:48.050> doing<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.710> you're<00:01:49.070> going

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
once you're done doing this you're going

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.210 
once you're done doing this you're going
to<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:50.830> four<00:01:51.830> new<00:01:52.490> triangles<00:01:53.030> see<00:01:54.040> one<00:01:55.040> two

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
to have four new triangles see one two

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.480 
to have four new triangles see one two
three<00:01:55.250> four<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.930> next<00:01:57.170> step<00:01:57.350> is<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:58.009> after

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
three four and the next step is to after

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.830 
three four and the next step is to after
you<00:01:58.580> have<00:01:58.700> your<00:01:58.790> four<00:01:58.970> trying<00:01:59.240> new<00:01:59.360> triangles

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
you have your four trying new triangles

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.710 
you have your four trying new triangles
is<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.229> fold<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.650> half<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:01.570> hamburger<00:02:02.570> way

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
is to fold it in half the hamburger way

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.469 
is to fold it in half the hamburger way
or<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.830> hotdog<00:02:04.160> way<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.580> square<00:02:04.850> is<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.210> same

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
or the hotdog way the square is the same

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:14.050 
or the hotdog way the square is the same
and<00:02:05.890> then<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:09.009> opposite<00:02:10.009> way<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:13.060> you're

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and then the opposite way so you're

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750 
and then the opposite way so you're
folding<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.570> half<00:02:14.600> twice<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:16.190> will

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
folding it in half twice and this will

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.199 
folding it in half twice and this will
now<00:02:17.540> make<00:02:17.840> your<00:02:18.110> four<00:02:18.470> triangles<00:02:19.209> four

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
now make your four triangles four

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.449 
now make your four triangles four
squares<00:02:20.600> you'll<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.560> eight<00:02:21.739> triangles<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
squares you'll have eight triangles so

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.690 
squares you'll have eight triangles so
one<00:02:22.700> two<00:02:22.910> three<00:02:22.940> four<00:02:23.239> squares<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:24.190> then<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
one two three four squares and then the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.990 
one two three four squares and then the
next<00:02:26.060> step<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:27.110> fold<00:02:27.470> each<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.580> every

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
next step is to fold each and every

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.770 
next step is to fold each and every
little<00:02:29.300> corner<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.690> like<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:37.780> each

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
little corner in like this so each

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:55.619 
little corner in like this so each
little<00:02:41.320> triangle<00:02:43.540> matches<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.750> to<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.019> center

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.869 

sorry<00:02:56.629> I'm<00:02:56.959> not<00:02:57.170> very<00:02:57.859> good<00:02:57.980> at<00:02:58.340> doing<00:02:58.609> this

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
sorry I'm not very good at doing this

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:08.619 
sorry I'm not very good at doing this
and<00:02:59.150> holding<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.450> camera<00:02:59.709> down<00:03:05.829> yeah<00:03:07.629> this

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
and holding a camera down yeah this

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.129 
and holding a camera down yeah this
would<00:03:08.810> probably<00:03:08.959> be<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.319> little<00:03:09.500> bit<00:03:09.650> more<00:03:09.889> even

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
would probably be a little bit more even

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:18.099 
would probably be a little bit more even
if<00:03:12.139> I<00:03:12.230> was<00:03:12.409> taking<00:03:12.769> my<00:03:12.889> time<00:03:13.069> but<00:03:14.060> yeah<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:17.109> so

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
if I was taking my time but yeah and so

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.929 
if I was taking my time but yeah and so
we<00:03:18.469> have<00:03:19.840> four<00:03:20.840> triangles<00:03:21.349> again<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.340> a

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
we have four triangles again and a

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.440 
we have four triangles again and a
smaller<00:03:23.299> square<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:27.470> next<00:03:27.889> step<00:03:28.069> is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
smaller square and the next step is

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.659 
smaller square and the next step is
similar<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.599> what<00:03:29.750> you<00:03:29.870> just<00:03:30.079> did<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:30.669> the

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
similar to what you just did but the

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.429 
similar to what you just did but the
thing<00:03:31.849> you<00:03:31.939> need<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.180> do<00:03:32.329> is<00:03:32.569> flip<00:03:32.870> over<00:03:33.169> so

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 
thing you need to do is flip over so

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.879 
thing you need to do is flip over so
once<00:03:33.829> again<00:03:33.980> we<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.370> four<00:03:34.939> squares<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.889> once

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
once again we have four squares and once

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.490 
once again we have four squares and once
again<00:03:37.069> you're<00:03:37.430> going<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.730> fold<00:03:38.540> back<00:03:40.150> your

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
again you're going to fold back your

00:03:41.500 --> 00:04:12.550 
again you're going to fold back your
triangles<00:04:09.489> this<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:11.079> kind<00:04:12.079> of<00:04:12.199> what<00:04:12.409> it<00:04:12.530> should

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
triangles this is kind of what it should

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.050 
triangles this is kind of what it should
look<00:04:12.889> like<00:04:15.459> essentially<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:16.669> what<00:04:16.789> it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
look like essentially this is what it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.949 
look like essentially this is what it
should<00:04:17.150> look<00:04:17.329> like<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.599> shouldn't<00:04:17.870> matter

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
should look like it shouldn't matter

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.810 
should look like it shouldn't matter
because<00:04:18.289> if<00:04:18.560> this<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.889> pretty<00:04:19.220> decent<00:04:19.669> one

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
because if this is a pretty decent one

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.879 
because if this is a pretty decent one
it's<00:04:20.570> not<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.900> best<00:04:21.079> because<00:04:21.320> I'm<00:04:21.440> kind<00:04:21.829> of

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
it's not the best because I'm kind of

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.659 
it's not the best because I'm kind of
doing<00:04:22.159> it<00:04:22.250> with<00:04:22.340> one<00:04:22.520> hand<00:04:23.169> but<00:04:24.460> that's<00:04:25.460> what

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
doing it with one hand but that's what

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.100 
doing it with one hand but that's what
it<00:04:25.729> looks<00:04:25.880> like<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.509> next<00:04:26.900> step

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
it looks like and then the next step

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.740 
it looks like and then the next step
after<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.460> fold<00:04:28.699> it<00:04:28.849> all<00:04:29.090> your<00:04:29.240> triangles<00:04:29.630> in

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
after you fold it all your triangles in

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.920 
after you fold it all your triangles in
is<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:31.250> fold<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.060> in<00:04:32.509> half<00:04:33.099> both<00:04:34.099> weights<00:04:34.400> again

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
is to fold it in half both weights again

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.900 
is to fold it in half both weights again
like<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.050> did<00:04:36.169> previously

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.370 

and<00:04:42.910> then<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.720> have<00:04:44.460> these<00:04:46.110> four<00:04:47.110> little

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
and then you have these four little

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.070 
and then you have these four little
triangle<00:04:47.830> things<00:04:48.070> which<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.610> will<00:04:49.080> stick

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
triangle things which you will stick

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.620 
triangle things which you will stick
your<00:04:50.160> fingers<00:04:51.160> into<00:04:51.370> and<00:04:51.820> then<00:04:52.030> push<00:04:52.480> them

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
your fingers into and then push them

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.240 
your fingers into and then push them
together<00:04:52.750> so<00:04:53.320> it's<00:04:53.950> like<00:04:54.130> this<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:56.250> push

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
together so it's like this and then push

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.850 
together so it's like this and then push
together<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:58.060> you<00:04:58.240> have<00:04:58.420> a<00:04:58.690> poison<00:04:59.050> teller<00:04:59.230> so

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
together and you have a poison teller so

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.260 
together and you have a poison teller so
you<00:04:59.950> can<00:05:00.600> open<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.900> up<00:05:01.990> and<00:05:02.170> write<00:05:02.680> your<00:05:03.270> little

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
you can open it up and write your little

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.790 
you can open it up and write your little
fortunes<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.570> I<00:05:07.960> hope<00:05:08.260> this<00:05:08.440> video<00:05:08.620> was

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
fortunes and so I hope this video was

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.210 
fortunes and so I hope this video was

Chelsea<00:05:12.820> 2:8<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.450> normally<00:05:14.110> post<00:05:14.260> my<00:05:14.500> videos

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
Chelsea 2:8 I normally post my videos

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.910 
Chelsea 2:8 I normally post my videos
there<00:05:15.040> but<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.490> once<00:05:15.670> I<00:05:15.790> felt<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.690> I<00:05:16.990> don't

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:17.920 
there but for once I felt like I don't

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.500 
there but for once I felt like I don't
have<00:05:18.070> very<00:05:18.100> many<00:05:18.370> videos<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:19.030> there<00:05:19.180> anyway<00:05:19.390> so

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
have very many videos on there anyway so

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.450 
have very many videos on there anyway so
just<00:05:19.720> doesn't<00:05:20.290> really<00:05:20.410> matter<00:05:20.650> but<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.160> felt

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
just doesn't really matter but I felt

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.190 
just doesn't really matter but I felt
like<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.730> wanted<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:22.060> post<00:05:22.390> something<00:05:22.630> on<00:05:22.900> my
