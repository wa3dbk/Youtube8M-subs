00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
 equal to all combined and today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.980
 Sample of the mod constructor for the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.960
 version 1.7 point 2 of minecraft and what 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.980
 system so in this way what we 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.139
 is that if it is an entity of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 Character is OK but backwards 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.380
 instead of character discard what he wants 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.680
 say this as you see I have here a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.930
 diamond sword worth is enchanted 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.810
 and then let's see how to get the 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.840
 enchantment that has done not but 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.600
 As you can see, it gives us 2 diamond and a 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.480
 little stick is ok but what happens if the gun 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.379
 it's worn out here I have swords of 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:47.260
 stone worth the full sword has two 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.420
 of stone and the stick plus the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.960
 enchantment is worth that then ya 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.610
 I show how it is started but 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.520
 He takes one stone from us and gives us a 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.220
 stone and a stick then you see that 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.050
 we have this stone sword with a 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.839
 little spent but you 're not alone anymore 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.120
 stick and is that it is very worn then 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.040
 he gives us another stick simply but 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.140
 that we have our book of 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810
 rewind enchantment 2 we have 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.710
 our sword and we have spent it the 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.680
 spell is worth in this sword 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.600
 and it's not just just the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.010
 materials the enchantment does not stop 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.060
 get the enchantment 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 we will need to put a book here and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.310
 get the objects as you see gives us 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.290
 the enchanted book with recoil 2 what 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.010
 same as he had the sword 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.100
 and well as treat this visit as 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.170
 what we will need to create it will be 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.990
 wooden boards 5 doing as if 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.950
 it was a boat worth in the center a 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.720
 craft table eo an iron up to the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.120
 left and an iron up to the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 right and in the top center 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.760
 the beige diamond so I teach it so that 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 come back to see it 5 wooden table 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.290
 2 character of iron and diamond and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.179
 this will give us this discard plateau or 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.550

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.590
 of utility and good guys now we're going to 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.680
 go through the installation is worth remembering 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.959
 that the download link in this way 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 will be in the description worth so 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.430
 to install this mode we will need 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.380
 this file is worth it is the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.840
 builder is worth the 1.7 version 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.540
 point 2 and the minecraft with the force I've 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.810
 installed in version 1.7 point two 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.190
 OK 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.470
 once we have these two things 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.200
 we will simply have to go to our 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.420
 start button or on our keyboard the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.099
 icon that makes the button that appears on the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.230
 windows icon we just press it 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.230
 and this screen will appear here 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.599
 we will write so much percent to pepe 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.390
 dates so much percent 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.269
 we come to roaming while roaming 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.310
 point minecraft and here to mons 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.540
 we simply take the file that you 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.370
 you will have downloaded in the description 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.299
 deconstruction worth 1.7 point two is worth 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.180
 and we paste it here as is and we close and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.400
 when we get into our minecraft and 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.930
 we can play him without any problem 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.190
 It is worth remembering what 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.030
 here in the launcher you will have to have 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.430

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.380

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.330
 vouchers and have a previous one you will have to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.160
 change it in the profile of the way it's worth 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:37.380
 you come here in profile edit the profile and 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 in versions you will have to put it to 1.7 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.720

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.610
