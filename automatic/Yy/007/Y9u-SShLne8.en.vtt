00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.480 
actually built an XP farm and you know
this<00:04:45.840> is<00:04:45.960> fully<00:04:46.170> functional<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.860> thing<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.250> a

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
this is fully functional this thing is a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.220 
this is fully functional this thing is a
well-oiled<00:04:48.000> machine<00:04:48.030> basically<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.080> hit

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
well-oiled machine basically if you hit

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.670 
well-oiled machine basically if you hit
this<00:04:49.320> button<00:04:50.780> basically<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> skeleton<00:04:52.620> is
