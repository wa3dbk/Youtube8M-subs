ML 430 and I have this infamous leaked
oil<00:00:12.330> leak<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> couldn't<00:00:13.799> find<00:00:14.059> the<00:00:15.059> source

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
oil leak that I couldn't find the source

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.179 
oil leak that I couldn't find the source
off<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:17.240> finally<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> found<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.869> source<00:00:19.189> what

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
off and finally I found the source what

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.990 
off and finally I found the source what
I<00:00:20.220> can

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
I can

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
I can
it's<00:00:21.119> leaking<00:00:21.750> from<00:00:21.779> under<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.650> little

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
it's leaking from under this little

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.650 
it's leaking from under this little
cover<00:00:23.369> right<00:00:23.820> over<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:25.550> as<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.390> see

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
cover right over here as you can see

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.650 
cover right over here as you can see
this<00:00:27.900> lots<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.680> oil<00:00:28.949> under<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.349> it's<00:00:31.349> leaking

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
this lots of oil under and it's leaking

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
this lots of oil under and it's leaking
when<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> motor<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> running<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.920> doesn't

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
when the motor is running it doesn't

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.660 
when the motor is running it doesn't
leak<00:00:35.489> when<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.850> off<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.920> only<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.520> it's

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
leak when it's off but only when it's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.220 
leak when it's off but only when it's
running<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:41.510> that's<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.809> reason<00:00:42.960> why<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
running so that's the reason why I

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.310 
running so that's the reason why I
couldn't<00:00:43.500> find<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:45.480> fan<00:00:45.899> over

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
couldn't find it because I have fan over

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.940 
couldn't find it because I have fan over
here<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.840> shroud<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.590> all<00:00:49.739> that

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
here and and the the shroud and all that

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.350 
here and and the the shroud and all that
stuff<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.430> front<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.030> couldn't

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
stuff in front of it so I couldn't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.420 
stuff in front of it so I couldn't
really<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:52.379> exactly<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.100> coming<00:00:53.309> from

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
really see exactly what it's coming from

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.790 
really see exactly what it's coming from
but<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.149> always<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.629> under<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.590> look

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
but it was always what under if you look

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.299 
but it was always what under if you look
here<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.570> see<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.199> oil<00:00:58.309> residue

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
here you can see there's oil residue

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.810 
here you can see there's oil residue
under<00:00:59.660> as<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:02.160> behind<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.290> actual

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.289 
under as well as all behind the actual
cover<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:07.100> at<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.640> thought<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.060> power

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
cover and at first I thought my power

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
cover and at first I thought my power
steering<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.930> leaking<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.650> apparently<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
steering is leaking but apparently it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you can see parts to air conditioner

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.480 
you can see parts to air conditioner
compressor<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:18.500> just<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.799> because

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
compressor is or what just all because

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.109 
compressor is or what just all because
of<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.740> cover<00:01:22.740> Legion<00:01:25.040> pepper<00:01:26.119> all

look<00:02:46.010> clearly<00:02:46.370> right<00:02:47.030> over<00:02:47.510> here<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.080> see

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
look clearly right over here you can see

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.190 
look clearly right over here you can see
the<00:02:48.530> cracking<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.340> rubber<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.360> bulging<00:02:51.080> of

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
the cracking in rubber and bulging of

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.089 
the cracking in rubber and bulging of
rubber<00:02:52.010> piece<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:53.510> that's

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.890 

it's<00:02:57.099> going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.430> see<00:02:58.090> right<00:02:58.270> here<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.660> good

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it's going to see right here is a good

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.460 
it's going to see right here is a good
example<00:02:58.959> there<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.560> a<00:02:59.590> bulge<00:03:00.959> in<00:03:01.959> Denton

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
example there is a bulge in Denton

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.880 
example there is a bulge in Denton
rather<00:03:03.120> into<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.209> rubber<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.620> piece<00:03:05.860> is

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
rather into the rubber and this piece is

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.890 
rather into the rubber and this piece is
bulging<00:03:06.250> out<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.120> has<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.450> be<00:03:07.480> replaced

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
bulging out so that has to be replaced

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900 
bulging out so that has to be replaced
so<00:03:08.170> if<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.010> have<00:03:09.099> a<00:03:09.130> cover<00:03:09.430> if<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.700> have<00:03:09.880> a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so if you have a cover if you have a

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.720 
so if you have a cover if you have a
leak<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.480> oil<00:03:10.690> leak<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:11.370> look<00:03:12.370> into<00:03:12.640> this

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
leak the oil leak I look into this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.930 
leak the oil leak I look into this
little<00:03:13.030> cover<00:03:13.150> right<00:03:13.420> here<00:03:14.489> with<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.640> engine

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
little cover right here with the engine

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.180 
little cover right here with the engine
running<00:03:16.140> first<00:03:17.140> of<00:03:17.290> all<00:03:17.410> clean<00:03:17.800> it<00:03:17.920> all<00:03:18.040> off

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
running first of all clean it all off

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.479 
running first of all clean it all off
without<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:19.510> clean<00:03:20.440> up<00:03:20.590> clean<00:03:20.980> up<00:03:21.190> all<00:03:21.400> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
without to clean up clean up all the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.220 
without to clean up clean up all the
residue<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.319> see<00:03:23.319> if<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:23.709> sippin<00:03:25.230> around

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
residue and see if it's sippin around

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.989 
residue and see if it's sippin around
the<00:03:26.410> edges<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:28.450> right
