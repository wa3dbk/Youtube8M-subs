00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
so I'd say from day one people have to

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980 
so I'd say from day one people have to
be<00:01:28.710> thinking<00:01:28.950> about<00:01:29.130> safety<00:01:30.060> strength

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
be thinking about safety strength

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.550 
be thinking about safety strength
financial<00:01:31.920> security<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.640> being<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.689> key<00:01:33.930> metric

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
financial security as being a key metric

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.870 
financial security as being a key metric
and<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:37.100> incredibly<00:01:38.100> important

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and and that is incredibly important

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.920 
and and that is incredibly important
especially<00:01:39.060> today<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.500> safety<00:01:41.930> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
especially today so I think safety the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.139 
especially today so I think safety the
second<00:01:43.229> thing<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.640> running<00:01:44.939> the

every year during that cycle and came

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.629 
every year during that cycle and came
out<00:03:19.349> of<00:03:19.379> it<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.680> higher<00:03:19.889> market<00:03:20.310> share<00:03:20.340> than

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
we went in so protecting technology and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.879 
we went in so protecting technology and
it's<00:03:24.120> also<00:03:24.269> about<00:03:24.479> going<00:03:25.259> out<00:03:25.439> and<00:03:25.470> making
