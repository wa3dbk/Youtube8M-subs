00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
like it's more about when they give us a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.590 
like it's more about when they give us a
character<00:01:13.439> they<00:01:13.740> say<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> how<00:01:14.790> would<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
character they say this is how would to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
character they say this is how would to
portray<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:17.009> necessarily<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.729> where

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
portray like not necessarily to where

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
portray like not necessarily to where
you're<00:01:18.060> being<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.659> person<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.229> just

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you're being the same person but just

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.899 
you're being the same person but just
some<00:01:19.590> people<00:01:19.710> take<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.189> different<00:01:20.520> emotions

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
some people take in different emotions

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
some people take in different emotions
differently<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.930> say<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
differently so they say you you're a

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.649 
differently so they say you you're a
happy<00:01:23.400> character<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.479> happy

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
happy character and like you're happy

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.270 
happy character and like you're happy
may<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:24.930> different<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.710> happy<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
may be different from a happy that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
may be different from a happy that
someone<00:01:26.460> else<00:01:26.700> may<00:01:27.270> perceive<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.869> but<00:01:28.439> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
someone else may perceive it but it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
someone else may perceive it but it
still<00:01:28.710> reads<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> same<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> want<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
still reads the same all you want you to

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.179 
still reads the same all you want you to
