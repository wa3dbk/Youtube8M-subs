the 2007 the w221

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.030 
the 2007 the w221
I<00:03:31.910> always<00:03:32.600> thought<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> s500<00:03:33.739> looked<00:03:33.950> a

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
I always thought the s500 looked a

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.069 
I always thought the s500 looked a
little<00:03:34.130> too<00:03:34.400> plain<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:34.940> never<00:03:35.269> liked<00:03:35.840> it

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
little too plain and I never liked it

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.710 
little too plain and I never liked it
but<00:03:36.560> when<00:03:36.739> they<00:03:36.889> made<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.420> s550<00:03:38.420> I<00:03:38.450> thought

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
but when they made that s550 I thought

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.090 
but when they made that s550 I thought
that<00:03:38.840> was<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.019> most<00:03:39.170> beautiful<00:03:39.650> car<00:03:39.829> in<00:03:39.859> the

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
that was the most beautiful car in the

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.879 
that was the most beautiful car in the
road<00:03:40.630> those<00:03:41.630> arches<00:03:41.989> made<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.500> look<00:03:42.650> like<00:03:42.859> a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
road those arches made it look like a

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.069 
road those arches made it look like a
snake<00:03:43.280> it<00:03:43.609> looked<00:03:43.790> like<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:43.940> king<00:03:44.269> cobra<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.930> me

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
snake it looked like a king cobra to me

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.020 
snake it looked like a king cobra to me
and<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:45.500> that's<00:03:45.709> why<00:03:45.950> I<00:03:45.980> fell<00:03:46.430> in<00:03:46.459> love<00:03:46.819> with

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
and that that's why I fell in love with

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.759 
and that that's why I fell in love with
it<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.359> I'm<00:03:47.900> pretty<00:03:48.049> sure<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.350> lot<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
it and I'm pretty sure a lot of the

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.309 
it and I'm pretty sure a lot of the
people<00:03:49.100> buying<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.670> when<00:03:50.150> they<00:03:50.299> look<00:03:50.959> at<00:03:51.109> their

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
get something a little bit smaller and

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.730

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
car thanks to the aluminum construction

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.520 
car thanks to the aluminum construction
and<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.310> handles<00:05:13.730> extremely<00:05:13.820> well<00:05:14.750> way<00:05:15.320> better

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
and it handles extremely well way better

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.820 
and it handles extremely well way better
than<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.830> s550<00:05:16.400> years<00:05:16.790> -<00:05:16.910> it<00:05:17.030> -<00:05:17.990> 550<00:05:18.320> handled

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
than the s550 years - it - 550 handled

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.160 
than the s550 years - it - 550 handled
like<00:05:18.920> a<00:05:18.980> boat<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.520> XJ<00:05:20.060> handles<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.630> lot<00:05:20.870> better

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170

like a boat that XJ handles a lot better
but<00:05:21.680> hopefully<00:05:22.160> this<00:05:22.370> new<00:05:22.550> s550<00:05:23.090> will<00:05:23.360> be<00:05:23.480> even

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
but hopefully this new s550 will be even

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.140 
but hopefully this new s550 will be even
better<00:05:23.840> than<00:05:24.110> that

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
better than that

vents I'm not a big fan of that but this
car<00:06:21.620> really<00:06:22.220> really<00:06:22.490> is<00:06:23.000> looking<00:06:23.360> good<00:06:23.720> thus

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290

far<00:06:24.620> and<00:06:25.070> even<00:06:25.970> though<00:06:26.120> I<00:06:26.150> guess<00:06:26.810> some<00:06:27.020> people

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
far and even though I guess some people

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.290 
far and even though I guess some people
are<00:06:27.500> you<00:06:27.830> know<00:06:27.950> they<00:06:28.310> don't<00:06:28.430> adapt<00:06:28.820> well<00:06:29.270> to

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.430 
are you know they don't adapt well to
change<00:06:29.540> and<00:06:30.580> I<00:06:31.580> guess<00:06:32.000> ultimately<00:06:32.240> what's<00:06:32.960> you

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
change and I guess ultimately what's you

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.230 
change and I guess ultimately what's you
know<00:06:33.560> I'm<00:06:34.010> pretty<00:06:34.340> sure<00:06:34.550> this<00:06:34.850> car<00:06:35.060> is<00:06:35.150> gonna

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:04.860 
really looking forward to it hopefully

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.470 
really looking forward to it hopefully
it<00:07:05.400> blows<00:07:05.730> me<00:07:05.970> away

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
it blows me away

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.690 
it blows me away
because<00:07:07.140> so<00:07:07.800> far<00:07:08.010> from<00:07:08.160> the<00:07:08.250> pictures<00:07:08.580> it

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
because so far from the pictures it

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.570 
because so far from the pictures it
looks<00:07:08.760> like<00:07:09.060> a<00:07:09.090> great<00:07:09.450> new<00:07:09.990> model<00:07:10.440> but<00:07:11.430> um

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
looks like a great new model but um

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.910 
looks like a great new model but um
until<00:07:12.360> it<00:07:12.660> does<00:07:12.960> something<00:07:13.350> that<00:07:13.710> just

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.920 
until it does something that just

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.520 
until it does something that just
completely<00:07:14.460> blows<00:07:14.700> me<00:07:14.970> away<00:07:15.000> I'm<00:07:15.510> right<00:07:16.350> now

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
completely blows me away I'm right now

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.600 
completely blows me away I'm right now
I'm<00:07:16.620> looking<00:07:16.890> at<00:07:17.010> it<00:07:17.100> just<00:07:17.280> like<00:07:17.400> it's<00:07:17.550> a

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
I'm looking at it just like it's a

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.940 
I'm looking at it just like it's a
regular<00:07:17.910> car<00:07:18.120> so<00:07:18.480> in<00:07:18.840> any<00:07:19.080> event<00:07:19.200> stay<00:07:19.650> tuned

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:19.950 
regular car so in any event stay tuned

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.410 
regular car so in any event stay tuned

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:21.420 
because I'm definitely gonna have a test

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.930 
because I'm definitely gonna have a test
drive<00:07:21.630> video<00:07:21.900> hopefully<00:07:22.650> I'll<00:07:23.070> be<00:07:23.640> able<00:07:23.760> to

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
drive video hopefully I'll be able to

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.790 
drive video hopefully I'll be able to
get<00:07:24.150> the<00:07:24.270> same<00:07:24.510> dealer<00:07:24.810> who<00:07:25.170> sold<00:07:25.470> to<00:07:25.620> me<00:07:25.710> in

the<00:07:25.920> past<00:07:26.190> so<00:07:27.120> this<00:07:27.660> way<00:07:27.810> maybe<00:07:28.140> you'll<00:07:28.320> just

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
the past so this way maybe you'll just

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.560 
the past so this way maybe you'll just
let<00:07:28.620> me<00:07:28.740> take<00:07:28.890> it<00:07:29.070> out<00:07:29.160> by<00:07:29.310> myself<00:07:29.520> or<00:07:30.240> whatever
