terrain<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.190> bit<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.489> we<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
terrain a little bit here we do have a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.869 
terrain a little bit here we do have a
very<00:00:39.210> nice<00:00:39.420> natural<00:00:40.020> expansion<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.760> looks

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
very nice natural expansion and it looks

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.340 
very nice natural expansion and it looks
like<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> natural<00:00:42.239> has<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.750> openings<00:00:42.989> here

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like the natural has two openings here

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.920 
like the natural has two openings here
one<00:00:43.649> towards<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> mean<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> main<00:00:45.510> center

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
one towards the mean of the main center

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
one towards the mean of the main center
and<00:00:46.140> then<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.219> other<00:00:47.370> opening

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and then the kind of the other opening

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
and then the kind of the other opening
going<00:00:47.940> down<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.239> another<00:00:48.480> expansion<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.800> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
going down to another expansion so this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.830 
going down to another expansion so this
is<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.399> looks<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> pretty<00:00:51.149> small

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
is actually looks to be a pretty small

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.889 
is actually looks to be a pretty small
map<00:00:52.140> not<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.949> small<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> steppes<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> war<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
map not as small as a steppes of war but

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
map not as small as a steppes of war but
maybe<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> size<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.949> blistering<00:00:56.340> sands

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
maybe about the size of blistering sands

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.520 
maybe about the size of blistering sands
so<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.570> excited<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> see<00:00:58.079> what's<00:00:58.350> going<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
so I'm excited to see what's going to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.619 
so I'm excited to see what's going to
happen<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> map<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> do<00:01:00.180> want<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> say<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
happen on this map I do want to say that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.869 
happen on this map I do want to say that
I<00:01:00.960> didn't<00:01:01.289> get<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> chance<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:02.070> look<00:01:02.430> over<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I didn't get a chance to look over the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.600 
I didn't get a chance to look over the
maps<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> gsl<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
maps for the gsl very well which the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.080 
maps for the gsl very well which the
ones<00:01:05.909> i<00:01:06.000> casted<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.510> were<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:08.760> towel

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ones i casted which were the towel

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
ones i casted which were the towel
doreen<00:01:09.390> temple<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> other<00:01:10.350> map<00:01:10.710> i

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
doreen temple and then the other map i

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
doreen temple and then the other map i
think<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.430> was<00:01:11.689> something<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.810> ending<00:01:13.229> an

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
think it was something with ending an

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.690 
think it was something with ending an
aria<00:01:13.680> as<00:01:13.740> well<00:01:13.890> as<00:01:13.979> something<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> remake

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
aria as well as something with a remake

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.890 
aria as well as something with a remake
i<00:01:14.820> didn't<00:01:15.030> actually<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:15.810> those

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
i didn't actually get to look over those

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
i didn't actually get to look over those
maps<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> next<00:01:17.369> time<00:01:17.430> i<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
maps very much but the next time i get a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.310 
maps very much but the next time i get a
chance<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.090> cast<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.450> games<00:01:18.659> i<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:19.110> go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
chance to cast those games i will go

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.749 
chance to cast those games i will go

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
looks like a little bit more of the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.929 
looks like a little bit more of the
terrain<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.500> things<00:01:22.770> are<00:01:22.920> featured<00:01:23.280> but

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
terrain and how things are featured but

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.820 
terrain and how things are featured but
anyways<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.229> i<00:01:25.500> seek<00:01:25.680> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the probes because these probes can run

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.190 
the probes because these probes can run
in<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.299> harass<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> SCB<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
in there they can harass the SCB that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
in there they can harass the SCB that
can<00:01:58.320> go<00:01:58.530> away<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> shield's<00:01:59.250> deplete

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
can go away when the shield's deplete

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.770 
can go away when the shield's deplete
and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.030> back<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> little<00:02:00.659> bit

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
and then come back to do a little bit

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.569 
and then come back to do a little bit
more<00:02:00.930> damage<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.219> something<00:02:02.369> that

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
more damage so it's something that

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.819 
more damage so it's something that
Terran<00:02:02.820> players<00:02:03.000> absolutely<00:02:03.899> despise<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
Terran players absolutely despise and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.190 
Terran players absolutely despise and
hate<00:02:04.969> but<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.060> looks<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.630> probe<00:02:06.930> will

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
hate but it looks like that probe will

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.809 
hate but it looks like that probe will
probably<00:02:07.860> not<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.069> able<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.459> much<00:02:08.670> more

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
probably not be able to do much more

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.520 
probably not be able to do much more

you allow your supply depots to be

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.490 
you allow your supply depots to be
exposed<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.959> were<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.170> game<00:02:31.380> number

like white refinishing this warp gate
research<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.770> time<00:04:32.010> and<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:32.580> think<00:04:32.670> he's

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
research just in time and I think he's

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.740 
research just in time and I think he's
going<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.060> be<00:04:33.150> able<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.360> deal<00:04:33.510> with<00:04:33.570> this

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
going to be able to deal with this

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.400 
going to be able to deal with this
Marauder<00:04:34.110> finally<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.090> what<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.450> great<00:04:36.960> defense

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
Marauder finally so what a great defense

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.070 
Marauder finally so what a great defense
by<00:04:37.530> white<00:04:37.950> row<00:04:38.160> even<00:04:38.820> after<00:04:39.300> he<00:04:39.510> was<00:04:39.690> forced<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
by white row even after he was forced to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.960 
by white row even after he was forced to
sacrifice<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.590> couple<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.160> probes<00:04:41.430> to<00:04:41.610> defend

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
sacrifice a couple of probes to defend

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.670 
sacrifice a couple of probes to defend
it<00:04:42.150> looks<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:42.810> he<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.080> going<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.380> be<00:04:43.470> able<00:04:43.530> to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
it looks like he is going to be able to

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.310 
it looks like he is going to be able to
save<00:04:43.890> his<00:04:44.130> uh<00:04:44.160> his<00:04:44.580> mineral<00:04:45.390> line<00:04:45.570> from

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
save his uh his mineral line from

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.540 
save his uh his mineral line from
further<00:04:46.530> damage<00:04:46.650> look<00:04:47.100> at<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.310> he<00:04:47.460> even

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
further damage look at that he even

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.280 
further damage look at that he even
pulled<00:04:47.910> this<00:04:48.090> probe<00:04:48.390> away<00:04:48.540> which<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.170> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
pulled this probe away which is in the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.410 
pulled this probe away which is in the
orange<00:04:49.710> because<00:04:50.160> he<00:04:50.370> who<00:04:50.580> that<00:04:50.730> Marauder<00:04:51.030> was

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
orange because he who that Marauder was

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.810 
orange because he who that Marauder was
coming<00:04:51.780> for<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.950> only<00:04:53.220> we<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.520> probe<00:04:53.730> in

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
coming for it the only we can probe in

coming for it the only we can probe in
the<00:04:53.910> mineral<00:04:54.060> line<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.480> very<00:04:54.840> nice<00:04:55.110> play<00:04:55.470> and

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770

work and white right now is looking to
take<00:05:38.700> this<00:05:38.910> game<00:05:39.120> away<00:05:39.180> he<00:05:39.990> has<00:05:40.200> about<00:05:40.650> the

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
take this game away he has about the

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.950 
take this game away he has about the
same<00:05:40.830> amount<00:05:41.040> of<00:05:41.340> economy<00:05:41.850> but<00:05:42.210> he<00:05:42.330> has<00:05:42.480> a<00:05:42.510> much

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
same amount of economy but he has a much

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.260 
same amount of economy but he has a much
stronger<00:05:43.380> army<00:05:43.890> with<00:05:44.070> this<00:05:44.250> expensive<00:05:44.820> and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
stronger army with this expensive and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.050 
stronger army with this expensive and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
very very powerful void ray he may

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.540 
very very powerful void ray he may
actually<00:05:48.300> opted<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.870> wait<00:05:48.900> for<00:05:49.260> 22<00:05:50.160> void<00:05:50.400> rays

actually opted to wait for 22 void rays

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.550 
actually opted to wait for 22 void rays
is<00:05:50.730> so<00:05:51.330> much<00:05:51.540> more<00:05:51.570> deadlier<00:05:52.050> than<00:05:52.110> one<00:05:52.410> it

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
is so much more deadlier than one it

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.430 
is so much more deadlier than one it
requires<00:05:52.890> like<00:05:53.520> triple<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.150> amount<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:54.630> anti

but<00:06:05.970> also<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.930> very<00:06:07.260> powerful<00:06:07.770> void<00:06:07.980> ray<00:06:08.190> and

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
but also the very powerful void ray and

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.550 
but also the very powerful void ray and
right<00:06:08.790> now<00:06:08.940> he<00:06:09.000> just<00:06:09.150> does<00:06:09.630> not<00:06:10.020> have<00:06:10.380> the

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
right now he just does not have the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.200 
right now he just does not have the
anti-air<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.220> deal<00:06:11.400> with<00:06:11.520> it<00:06:11.640> and<00:06:11.700> he<00:06:11.790> built<00:06:12.030> a

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
anti-air to deal with it and he built a

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.240 
anti-air to deal with it and he built a
dropship<00:06:12.840> out<00:06:13.050> of<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.440> bub<00:06:13.680> out<00:06:13.980> of<00:06:14.160> the

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
dropship out of the bub out of the

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.970 
dropship out of the bub out of the
starport<00:06:14.730> first<00:06:15.030> rather<00:06:15.780> than<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:16.110> Viking<00:06:16.530> so

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
starport first rather than a Viking so

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.100 
starport first rather than a Viking so
he's<00:06:17.220> in<00:06:17.400> so<00:06:17.670> much<00:06:17.850> trouble<00:06:18.120> right<00:06:18.420> now<00:06:18.450> white

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
he's in so much trouble right now white

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.780 
he's in so much trouble right now white
rod<00:06:19.350> is<00:06:19.500> about<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.860> take<00:06:20.010> this<00:06:20.160> game<00:06:20.340> away<00:06:20.400> with

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
rod is about to take this game away with

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.310 
rod is about to take this game away with
these<00:06:20.880> two<00:06:21.090> void<00:06:21.300> rays<00:06:21.480> unless<00:06:21.870> a<00:06:22.050> miracle

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
these two void rays unless a miracle

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.440 
these two void rays unless a miracle
happens<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:23.430> boy<00:06:23.610> is<00:06:23.850> going<00:06:23.940> to<00:06:24.000> go<00:06:24.150> ahead<00:06:24.270> and

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
happens the boy is going to go ahead and

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.060 
happens the boy is going to go ahead and
get<00:06:24.750> a<00:06:24.780> free<00:06:25.140> charge<00:06:25.470> on<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.710> supply<00:06:26.010> depot

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
get a free charge on the supply depot

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.370 
get a free charge on the supply depot
and<00:06:26.520> this<00:06:26.820> is<00:06:26.940> exactly<00:06:26.970> why<00:06:27.690> walling<00:06:28.230> off

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
and this is exactly why walling off

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.800 
and this is exactly why walling off
against<00:06:28.710> protoss<00:06:29.070> can<00:06:29.430> be<00:06:29.580> so<00:06:29.910> devastating

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
against protoss can be so devastating

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.360 
against protoss can be so devastating
because<00:06:31.140> these<00:06:31.440> void<00:06:31.680> rays<00:06:31.860> get<00:06:32.010> a<00:06:32.040> full

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
because these void rays get a full

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.130 
because these void rays get a full
charge<00:06:32.669> they<00:06:33.120> can<00:06:33.270> pick<00:06:33.480> off<00:06:33.630> these<00:06:33.810> buildings

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
charge they can pick off these buildings

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.210 
charge they can pick off these buildings
so<00:06:34.320> easily<00:06:34.560> now<00:06:35.100> all<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.490> marines<00:06:35.730> heights

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
so easily now all the marines heights

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.980 
so easily now all the marines heights
into<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.730> bunker<00:06:37.060> but<00:06:37.240> even<00:06:37.570> inside<00:06:37.930> the

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
into the bunker but even inside the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.140 
into the bunker but even inside the
bunker<00:06:38.290> they<00:06:38.980> are<00:06:39.130> not<00:06:39.340> protected<00:06:39.550> against

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
bunker they are not protected against

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.540 
bunker they are not protected against
his<00:06:40.300> massive<00:06:40.690> Protoss<00:06:41.230> firepower<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:42.220> tank

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
his massive Protoss firepower the tank

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.550 
his massive Protoss firepower the tank
gets<00:06:42.730> picked<00:06:43.090> off<00:06:43.210> Marines<00:06:43.990> starting<00:06:44.380> to<00:06:44.440> go

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
gets picked off Marines starting to go

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.230 
gets picked off Marines starting to go
down<00:06:44.770> now<00:06:44.800> looks<00:06:45.400> like<00:06:45.520> one<00:06:45.730> boyfriend<00:06:45.940> gets

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
down now looks like one boyfriend gets

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
picked up and that is not gonna be

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.620

enough one boy ray still stands it has

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.590 
enough one boy ray still stands it has
five<00:06:50.050> kills<00:06:50.530> now<00:06:50.800> and<00:06:51.040> this<00:06:51.370> is<00:06:51.580> sure<00:06:52.090> to<00:06:52.270> be<00:06:52.360> GG
