00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.050
 and this all elected to any split into 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.030
 direct from london to the finals 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.500
 call of duty championship 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 I am in the company of tony jaa player 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.680
 emblematic of the team of hyper games 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 who will face in a few 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 moments the players of the orks your opinion 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.109
 quickly and what is your condition 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.430
 of spirit for this match then we are 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.490
 confident we trained a lot 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.560
 online so I think it's going great 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.840
 to be well in our heads it's 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.149
 is one of us favorite is the only 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.309
 point that can happen it would be that 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.559
 the fact that they are a pick-up not 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 the benefits but puts them less of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.430
 pressure and blow wants to be confident 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.719
 for the game what are we going to follow that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430
 in a few moments and we end up 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.980
 just after for the hot reactions 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.360
 from maxi to just now 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.860
 that's it, it's official we know 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.540
 now the hyper games have 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.700
 qualified on the score of 3 0 you go 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.270
 represent our team in France 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.550
 angeles 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.820
 maxis long a normal victory and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.430
 deserved or a little snatched victory 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.840
 deserved I think in the whole 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.610
 very good preparation from 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.020
 the whole team very good cohesion we have 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.100
 posted a good level of play I find 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.180
 his side in their pocket we had 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.590
 some small moments of weakness 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 but it was the first card is 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.980
 then happily we have very very good 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.440
 played during the snb and we ended up on a 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.090
 quite cool hub link with 18 to 2 years 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.170
 final score a 3-0 win in 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.210
 All together I am very proud of my 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.229
 team is as delicate that tony dejak has 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.510
 does a very, very big performance 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.920
 so the first goal in any case has 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.060
 been reached that was to qualify for 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.170
 los angeles now there is a new 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.570
 goal looming 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.100
 on this next day it's 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.660
 to have a good side and possibly 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.930
 leave with why not a little bit of 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.880
 change 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.440
 what is your goal on what 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 james to the European fire parcel but 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.500
 of course as you said it's already there 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.550
 first of all to get a very good side for 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.020
 los angeles we know that this is a 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 competition of even greater scope 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.470
 big and of a higher difficulty than 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.790
 this one is aware of that but 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.530
 here we will try to do the maximum 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.759
 to hang a podium the entire 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.320
 the team will be will agree with me I 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.140
 think to say that we set ourselves this 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.430
 goal in collective and that's it for 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.430
 the moment i am i am very happy 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.899
 because the preparation bears fruit and 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.950
 and I hope we're going to make a big 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.399
 performance tomorrow at least we get 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.649
 gives the means 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.970
 so there's a month left to go to 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.170
 los angeles to face the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.520
 best world teams 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.190
 what is your schedule during this month 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.600
 This is a pretty similar schedule 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.160
 preparation we had the advanced then 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.480
 this event so a lot 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.280
 many tournaments 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 we will try to face a maximum of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.670
 big teams here we have maybe a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.950
 little surprise who by reserve games 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.690
 for in order to be able to promote our 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.739
 training but here we will tell you 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.390
 more when we know more 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.890
 and here we are going to try to do the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.209
 maximum during this preparation 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.190
 we know it's the event of the year 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.780
 accompanied by the sw it is of course that 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.220
 remains the two major of the year and we 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.410
 will try to do already to make the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.290
 France proud of us and is proud of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.269
 level of play in his country 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.530
 so after the simple coach the year does not 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.359
 do not stop there we will also talk about the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 sw knows what are your today 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.930
 goals knowing that 0 may be going 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.670
 join join a new team 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.750
 or does today azox satisfied 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.920
 fully your expectations 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.799
 how is it going to be a 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.870
 little bit after the coach m so since then 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.819
 the non-participation of 2.0 due to his 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.370
 age we all agreed to say 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.959
 that the zero and she was part of the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.609
 the team and that the rule will remain 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.010
 so azox very nicely 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.939
 wanted pika for the coach in peace and 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.590
 stop right away very well 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.730
 but here are 0 remains a very member 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.090
 important of this hyper guen team 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.530
 know and we will continue with him after 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.760
 after the benchikha coach 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.079
 but I 'm going I just wanted to do a 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 little clarification regarding let the 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.819
 so we're officially registered 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.040
 lan event sauce and we will participate with 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.419
 azox because it stays in the in the 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.290
 in the as part of a preparation 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.829
 because championship 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.419
 so here is in case of qualification 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.900
 was going to raise it's with asoke this will be 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.879
 zero keira make the finals at 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.560
 india mail on paris how is that 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.120
 the zone takes it is what there are 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.739
 tensions that appear or not at all 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.849
 he takes it pretty well no haddock 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.540
 it's a player for those who 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.340
 know who has always had a 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.840
 very professional behavior 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.949
 it's someone who is aware of this 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.120
 that he does he knows that it fits in the 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.370
 part of the preparation he also knows 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.180
 that 0 always hits part of the teams 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.319
 after the coach likes it more cheap it's 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.750
 really dull things that have been decided 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.409
 before all that happens so that's it 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.849
 was done very 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.959
 professional and I want to thank 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.669
 thomas dayer compared to that because 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.349
 it is not know how players 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.180
 who are as serious and as clear 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.040
 in their intentions so maxi that makes 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.970
 a few years now when we see 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.530
 evolve on the French scene 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.729
 European and global 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.680
 do you think the age of the 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.849
 retreat is fast approaching where you 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.180
 leaves a few more years before 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.310
 think 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.060
 well let's say that at the moment I 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.709
 think I found motivation 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.060
 this year that I may have lost 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.079
 his two three kids year I give and 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.240
 obviously the best of myself 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.500
 but it's not that I did not believe it but 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.849
 Here sing I was just 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.870
 maybe to weaken from a point of view 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.220
 from a personal point of view 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.599
 and then here I have things that go 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.590
 not unhappy motivated in my life in 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.300
 my life lately and who will me 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.280
 pushes to give the best of myself 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.110
 everyday and is for now if I 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.130
 think if I can keep this 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.900
 trust in me that I have right now 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.159
 as well as as well as little guys who 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.620
 are also as understandable is 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.729
 as cool I think I think he 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.800
 there is way that I still continue a little 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.370
 moment in any case maxime thank you very much 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.560
 we hope again to have to shine 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.240
 europe why not even on the coach 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.560
 championship directly to her and we get 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.240
