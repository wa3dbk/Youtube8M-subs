00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 carnival at war this is a 

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 institution is something that lasts 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.690
 since time immemorial 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.250
 we can not calculate it exactly because 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.440
 that we do not have the traces but 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.469
 that downstream to dunkerque has continued 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
 I believe in my opinion thanks to the fishing 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.450
 Iceland 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.949
 because carnival exists everywhere 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 in the world there is a clue he 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 exists at rio he existing in germany he 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.980
 exists in munich it exists everywhere 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.840
 but to dunkirk he has endured thanks to the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.240
 fishing in iceland and i believe we 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.609
 let's do this carnival also part to have 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.590
 of memory that we have towards our 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.750
 ancestors who did this fishing and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.360
 that's why the dakar band 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 is called the band of fishermen and so 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 his fishermen who suffered that they have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.629
 been really they lived the hard way 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.090
 because he was leaving for six months 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.879
 and when he left he often left 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.739
 at the time of the dates of the beginning of Lent 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.840
 because in fact when laval it has a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 relationship with religion given that 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 the term carnival sadistic notebook 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 lévaré means we remove the meat 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.789
 so it was at the time of the Wednesday of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.710
 ashes and that's so this carnival has 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.619
 lost rada case thanks to that it became 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.299
 something important has become 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 something that should not be 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.650
 tourist carnival did you do 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.979
 come not see that downstream 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.570
 the public must collaborate at the party and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.220
 the dunkirk party at this 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.159
 characteristic that she is very 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.450
 spontaneous it is dunkerquois who 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.030
 is having a party on their own 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 there are very few things organized apart 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.729
 the music and the route that is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.500
 provided by the municipality 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.450
 it's the dunkerquois who do the rest 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.680
 there is no subsidized group he has 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.369
 person who is paid to do the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.229
 gang 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 it's really very spontaneous 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.000
 there is an extraordinary anecdote it's 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.470
 in 1991 during the Gulf War 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.170
 all the demonstration had been 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 banned by the terrorist's apkin and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.470
 all dunkerquois the day of the band 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 from dunkerque went out into the street and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.700
 all the musicians were volunteers and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 the itinerary was extraordinary because 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 that all these people not being organized 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.729
 were partying they offered themselves 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.820
 to themselves when I told you everything 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.820
 on time 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.740
 m 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.530
 to mark its sides and I edge 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.530
 Okay
