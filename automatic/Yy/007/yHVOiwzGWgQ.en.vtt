00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 already the blog lands back in this 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.189
 Hmm 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 since the blog has been my race finish 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.649
 like this 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.299
 for me it's perfect andrÃ© ayew that 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.759
 I knew or did not know 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.820
 I made the best time tomorrow, I'll take the lead 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:09.319
 and I will try to be fast and consistent and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.410
 try to raise my goal to the end 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.989
 that I leave here with a winner 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.970
 if I can get five happy if not 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.970
 We 'll get the next one. 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:49.650
 wrong motive just a curve that went badly 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.170
 done and got interested I was almost 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 nothing behind but it's okay, the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.420
 itself was a bit different from what 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.359
 I thought it was too slippery 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.530
 but by the end I liked it, it's basically 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:07.680
 will have almost the same proof of two years already 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.139
 The day was already milder and we could 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.060
 use too good to have none 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.849
 road city was to be able to win it 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.480
 was basically just managing a 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.859
 move fast and win and even then 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.859
 not much distance reported 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.870
 i 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.270
 the car started to fail the good principle 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.640
 and you see that I was already understanding 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.290
 which does not see hypothesis being the first 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.700
 and I started to play a case calmly and 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.520
 internally speaking news 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.970
 and there the guilt that the tires when it is 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.040
 whenever we got it and good it was not 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.740
 very bad but it is now with these tires 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.740
 that the box now a couple is also good 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.480
 toll and more came from each state because 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.160
 let loose a piece is that makes the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.050
 forward- reverse transmission 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.270
 I wanted to make a lot of noise I thought it was 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.310
 right after the jump and like Carlos 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.500
 olsen author in the air and I thought 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.770
 engage a transmission in the front and 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.310
 come to do that afternoon will come to 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.930
 save the case the expectation if you 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.000
 transmission can learn the exchange 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.580
 may have to do tonight at 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.160
 of the transmission but after all it was 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.650
 even just a Brazilian deportee 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.540
 We are now, to conquer, we do not want to. 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.540
 continue hurting, let's work
