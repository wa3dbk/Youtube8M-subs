00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
f3 functions one by one so obviously I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.830 
f3 functions one by one so obviously I
mean<00:00:41.700> just<00:00:41.910> there<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.540> go

mean just there we go

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.520 
mean just there we go
normal<00:00:43.649> f3<00:00:44.390> it<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.600> opens<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.110> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
normal f3 it just opens up this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.240 
normal f3 it just opens up this
minecraft<00:00:46.860> screen<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.640> hit<00:00:47.789> f3<00:00:48.000> +<00:00:48.719> B<00:00:49.250> it

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
minecraft screen if you hit f3 + B it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.479 
minecraft screen if you hit f3 + B it
creates<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.570> hit<00:00:51.899> weird<00:00:52.289> kinda<00:00:52.980> hitbox

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
creates this hit weird kinda hitbox

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.000 
creates this hit weird kinda hitbox
thing<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.270> encompasses<00:00:55.140> mobs<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
thing that encompasses mobs so you can

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
thing that encompasses mobs so you can

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
see that kind of white circle or white
square<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> should<00:01:02.730> say<00:01:03.229> around<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.409> mob<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

square I should say around the mob and
you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.909> if<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.360> try<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.570> punch<00:01:06.900> him

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
you can see if I try to punch him

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.830 
you can see if I try to punch him
outside<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> square<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
outside of that square it's not going to

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.830 
outside of that square it's not going to
register<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.320> hit<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
register as a hit so that is what that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.160 
register as a hit so that is what that
is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.590 
is
if<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.650> hit<00:01:13.799> f3<00:01:13.979> +<00:01:14.549> B<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.090> bring<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.450> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
if you hit f3 + B it will bring up that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.230 
if you hit f3 + B it will bring up that
hitbox<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.259> at<00:01:16.350> f3<00:01:16.530> +<00:01:17.070> B<00:01:17.310> again<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:18.090> makes

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
hitbox if you at f3 + B again it makes

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
hitbox if you at f3 + B again it makes
it<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.509> away<00:01:20.240> okay<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:22.320> next<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it go away okay so the next one is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
it go away okay so the next one is
technically<00:01:23.520> C<00:01:23.909> +<00:01:24.270> f3<00:01:24.509> which<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.500> out

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
technically C + f3 which will do out

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
technically C + f3 which will do out
crash<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.790> I'm<00:01:26.909> not<00:01:27.060> going<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.600> f3<00:01:28.110> +<00:01:28.350> C

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
crash but I'm not going to do f3 + C

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800 
crash but I'm not going to do f3 + C
because<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.189> recording<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.119> stop<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
because the recording will just stop and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.190 
because the recording will just stop and
that<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.920> silly<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.150> instead<00:01:33.659> what<00:01:34.020> I'm

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that would be silly so instead what I'm

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.380 
that would be silly so instead what I'm
going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.590> do<00:01:35.119> is<00:01:36.259> f3<00:01:37.259> +<00:01:37.950> H<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:40.340> hmm<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.240> way

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
going to do is f3 + H so hmm the way

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
going to do is f3 + H so hmm the way
this<00:01:42.659> works<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:45.079> if<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.700> do<00:01:48.049> f3<00:01:49.049> +<00:01:49.560> H<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
this works is if I do f3 + H and this is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
this works is if I do f3 + H and this is
when<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> personally<00:01:51.180> use<00:01:51.299> all<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> time<00:01:51.750> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
when I personally use all the time you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.230 
when I personally use all the time you
start<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:52.979> item<00:01:53.250> information<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.119> I

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
start getting item information so if I

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.700 
start getting item information so if I
do<00:01:54.299> f3<00:01:54.930> +<00:01:55.170> H<00:01:55.409> again<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:57.409> have<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.680> here

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
do f3 + H again I have to be out here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.789 
do f3 + H again I have to be out here
inventory<00:01:59.100> f3<00:01:59.399> +<00:01:59.579> H<00:01:59.850> you'll<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.380> don't

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
it super handy to know my tools

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.520 
it super handy to know my tools

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
durability and if you'll do f3 + P it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.890 
durability and if you'll do f3 + P it
will<00:02:34.680> turn<00:02:34.890> off<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> out<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:36.000> auto

the auto pausing feature on you can see

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.240 
the auto pausing feature on you can see
that<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.760> pause<00:02:56.940> menu<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.450> came<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:57.840> because

messed<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.580> show<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:11.100> tend<00:03:11.400> to

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
messed up show you know I just tend to

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.030 
messed up show you know I just tend to
leave<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.820> out<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.090> pause<00:03:12.239> feature<00:03:12.570> on<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.920> if

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
leave the out of pause feature on but if

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.259 
leave the out of pause feature on but if
you<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.280> play<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.489> servers<00:03:14.880> all<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.120> time

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
you just play on servers all the time

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.670 
you just play on servers all the time
it's<00:03:15.450> something<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.870> totally<00:03:16.230> turn<00:03:16.500> off

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's something you can totally turn off

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.440 
it's something you can totally turn off
because<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.370> does<00:03:17.489> nothing<00:03:17.760> for<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.180> server

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
because it does nothing for a server

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.880 
because it does nothing for a server
Dada<00:03:18.750> pause<00:03:19.400> seriously<00:03:21.170> ok<00:03:22.170> so<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:22.530> these

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
Dada pause seriously ok so now these

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.990 
Dada pause seriously ok so now these
next<00:03:23.610> ones<00:03:23.790> aren't<00:03:24.000> very<00:03:24.739> useful<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.860> guess<00:03:26.130> if

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
next ones aren't very useful I guess if

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.370 
next ones aren't very useful I guess if
you<00:03:27.630> do<00:03:27.829> f3<00:03:28.829> +<00:03:29.430> s<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:31.799> will<00:03:32.280> reload<00:03:32.820> all<00:03:33.380> website

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
you do f3 + s it will reload all website

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.930 
you do f3 + s it will reload all website
client<00:03:34.950> information<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:36.540> would<00:03:36.660> be<00:03:36.870> like

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
client information so that would be like

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.729 
client information so that would be like
skins<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.269> stuff<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.950> I<00:03:41.100> do<00:03:41.160> f3<00:03:41.940> +<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
skins and stuff like that if I do f3 + a

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.080 
skins and stuff like that if I do f3 + a
you<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.890> see<00:03:44.040> here<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.370> reloads<00:03:44.760> all<00:03:44.910> the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
you can see here it reloads all the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.970 
you can see here it reloads all the
chunks<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:45.810> if<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> chunk<00:03:46.470> air<00:03:46.769> that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
chunks so if you have a chunk air that

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.030 
chunks so if you have a chunk air that
might<00:03:47.130> be<00:03:47.280> something<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.760> want<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> do<00:03:48.890> if<00:03:49.890> you

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
might be something you want to do if you

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.060 
might be something you want to do if you
do<00:03:50.209> f3<00:03:51.209> +<00:03:51.510> T<00:03:52.459> there<00:03:53.459> we<00:03:53.579> go<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:54.570> will<00:03:54.870> reload<00:03:55.320> all

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
do f3 + T there we go it will reload all

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.449 
do f3 + T there we go it will reload all

of the textures in the game which is

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.770 
of the textures in the game which is
something<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.880> don't<00:04:00.060> think<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.359> guys<00:04:00.480> really

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
something I don't think you guys really

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.210 
something I don't think you guys really
need<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.989> worry<00:04:01.260> about<00:04:01.560> maybe<00:04:01.829> if<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.100> have

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
need to worry about maybe if you have

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.740 
need to worry about maybe if you have
some<00:04:02.370> sort<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> weird<00:04:02.790> texture<00:04:03.150> glitch<00:04:03.540> you

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
some sort of weird texture glitch you

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.560 
some sort of weird texture glitch you
want<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.019> try<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:05.720> f3<00:04:06.720> +<00:04:07.680> F<00:04:08.269> will<00:04:09.269> change

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
want to try that and f3 + F will change

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.789 
want to try that and f3 + F will change
the<00:04:09.840> fog<00:04:10.049> distance<00:04:10.650> up<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.760> shift<00:04:12.570> F<00:04:12.840> 3<00:04:13.290> F<00:04:13.410> will

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
the fog distance up and shift F 3 F will

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.610 
the fog distance up and shift F 3 F will
change<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.280> fog<00:04:14.459> distance<00:04:15.000> down<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:16.350> those

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
change the fog distance down so those

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.900 
change the fog distance down so those
are<00:04:16.949> all<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:18.090> f

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
are all of the f

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.140 
are all of the f
options<00:04:19.239> and<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.780> hope<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.230> found<00:04:20.560> them

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
options and I hope you found them

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.390 
options and I hope you found them
freakin<00:04:22.260> useful<00:04:23.260> because<00:04:23.590> they<00:04:23.950> are<00:04:24.100> the<00:04:24.250> F

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
freakin useful because they are the F

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.310 
freakin useful because they are the F
functions<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.480> wasn't<00:04:25.780> as<00:04:25.840> funny<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.200> I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
functions that that wasn't as funny as I

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.850 
functions that that wasn't as funny as I
thought<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.650> was<00:04:26.740> going<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.070> be<00:04:27.280> but<00:04:28.120> anyway

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860
