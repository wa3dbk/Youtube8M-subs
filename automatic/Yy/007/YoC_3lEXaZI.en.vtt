that's my advice for you guys try and
sell<00:00:40.469> overnight<00:00:40.890> because<00:00:41.280> most<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> time

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
sell overnight because most of the time

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.330 
sell overnight because most of the time
they<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:43.829> better<00:00:44.160> than

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
they do so and it's better than

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
they do so and it's better than
relisting<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.000> every<00:00:45.510> hour<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.250> Bradley

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
relisting them every hour or so Bradley

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400
