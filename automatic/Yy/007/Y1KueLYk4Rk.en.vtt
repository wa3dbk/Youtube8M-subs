 holidays on yoshi island but during the 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.180
 barbosa or bowser parties 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.250

 Also got to go there from the dinosaur. 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.010
 cited the episode its inhabitants in 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.739
 another image is where we all save 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.020

 connected to the imaruÃ­ to face the challenge 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.070
 Very different until you defeat the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.070

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.110

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.070
 make new worlds because before 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.350
 I had access we have nowadays 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.959
 internet is breaking the head even for 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.510
 the 96 phase our little friend I think the most 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.780
 as a principle for the girls the little horse 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.120
 of mary kuntz the horse of the mario I 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.579
 I think today was a trick of everyone. 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.600
 consoles in the mouth including me 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.940
 I think not to die mainly 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.230
 in that phase to which the pieces of land 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.360
 it goes down and up 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.940
 Do you know which one is asking for everyone with a 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.769
 blue yellow exclamation environment 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.630
 to make the journey as easy as 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.519
 also with the secret worlds with the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.560
 strict way to help you get 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.450
 a shortcut and you did not know that a 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.079
 drawing of the sea, the only 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.079
 a bet 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 so it's sick there 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:47.110
 today the design was basically for 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.210
 try to save the dinosaur and 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.130
 princess like it's a game even more 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.660
 the coolest it was not the design and 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.900
 Yes, you started to know the numbers. 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.910
 character and then people come to the end 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.490
 This story years are asking me 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.620
 why I did not say that plumber mara 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.320
 Italian he had that hat 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.950
 mustache one that everyone already knows it 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.720
 You do not know the hat, it's really you. 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.270
 but he had no hair at the time. 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.270
 enough pixels came out hat 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.880
 without wanting the mustache the nose because a 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.520
 wanted the mario to need 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.280
 get airton mustache nose big and big 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.190
 It turned out that this style was kind of 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.420
 became a classic in the 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.250
 games at all 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:34.050
