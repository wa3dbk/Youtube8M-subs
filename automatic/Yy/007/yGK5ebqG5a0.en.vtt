and<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:49.079> settings<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.160> changed<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:51.180> all

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and the settings have not changed at all

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.770 
and the settings have not changed at all
or<00:00:51.860> if<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.610> changed<00:00:53.880> it<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.510> been

or if they have changed it has been

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.569 
or if they have changed it has been
minimal<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.470> they<00:00:55.649> stay<00:00:55.920> pretty<00:00:56.160> much<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
minimal so they stay pretty much the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.780 
minimal so they stay pretty much the
same<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.470> I<00:00:58.470> wanted<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
same and I wanted to get this out of the

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.510 
same and I wanted to get this out of the
way<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.360> I<00:01:00.630> am<00:01:00.750> bit<00:01:01.230> getting<00:01:01.590> asked<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
way because I am bit getting asked this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.999 
way because I am bit getting asked this
question<00:01:03.059> every<00:01:03.630> time<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.170> do<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.530> video<00:01:04.860> on

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
question every time I do a video on

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.270 
question every time I do a video on
airbrushing<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.380> wanted<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> add

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
airbrushing and I also wanted to add

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.539 
airbrushing and I also wanted to add
that<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.570> exact<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:10.710> setting<00:01:11.220> for

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that I use this exact same setting for

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.110 
that I use this exact same setting for
my<00:01:11.700> primer<00:01:12.200> colors<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.470> clear<00:01:14.070> coats<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.640> zero

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
my primer colors and clear coats so zero

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.460 
my primer colors and clear coats so zero
point<00:01:15.360> four<00:01:15.690> needle<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.420> 35<00:01:18.420> PSI<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.350> 2.4<00:01:20.250> bar

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
point four needle and 35 PSI or 2.4 bar

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
point four needle and 35 PSI or 2.4 bar
so<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.130> got<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.760> out<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> way

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
so now that I got that out of the way

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.440 
so now that I got that out of the way
it's<00:01:24.750> back<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:25.860> normal<00:01:26.280> routine<00:01:26.760> I<00:01:26.940> used

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's back to some normal routine I used

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740 
it's back to some normal routine I used

hardener and 4 milliliters of thinners

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.590 
hardener and 4 milliliters of thinners
to<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.869> my<00:01:34.080> mixture<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> 2k<00:01:35.369> clear<00:01:35.700> coat<00:01:35.909> from

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
to make my mixture of 2k clear coat from

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.649 
to make my mixture of 2k clear coat from
zero<00:01:37.140> Pink's<00:01:37.650> now<00:01:38.460> additional<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.479> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
zero Pink's now additional to this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.649 
zero Pink's now additional to this
mixture<00:01:40.110> after<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:41.010> finish<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.880> coat<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.360> I

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
mixture after I finish one coat and I

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
mixture after I finish one coat and I
move<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> next<00:01:43.619> coat<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.159> add<00:01:44.850> another

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
move on to the next coat I add another

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
move on to the next coat I add another
milliliter<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.140> thinners<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> complete

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
milliliter of thinners to the complete

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.600 
milliliter of thinners to the complete
mixture<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> thin<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.330> down<00:01:48.540> even<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
mixture to thin it down even more and

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.260 
mixture to thin it down even more and
this<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.880> done<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.909> lay<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.240> down

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this is done so that if you lay it down

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.539 
this is done so that if you lay it down
really<00:01:54.869> smooth<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.950> thinners<00:01:56.340> will

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
really smooth the thinners will

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.820 
really smooth the thinners will
evaporate<00:01:56.880> out<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> hardener<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.259> clear

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
evaporate out of the hardener and clear

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.039 
evaporate out of the hardener and clear
mixture<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> will<00:02:00.030> pull<00:02:00.299> even<00:02:00.720> tighter

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
mixture and will pull even tighter

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.050 
mixture and will pull even tighter
around<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.619> body<00:02:01.829> making<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.790> better

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
around the body making it a better

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.530 
around the body making it a better
finish<00:02:03.799> now<00:02:04.799> starting<00:02:05.460> off<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.970> first<00:02:06.270> coat

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
of clear this is also again pretty much

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.660 
of clear this is also again pretty much

this<00:02:22.320> light<00:02:22.620> coat<00:02:22.920> again<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.930> some

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
this light coat again is to get some

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:51.699 
this light coat again is to get some
grip<00:02:25.500> for<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.070> second<00:02:26.460> coat<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.910> bite<00:02:27.210> into

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.380 

so<00:02:52.709> now<00:02:52.950> while<00:02:53.220> you're<00:02:53.519> watching<00:02:53.939> me<00:02:54.060> apply

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
so now while you're watching me apply

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.449 
so now while you're watching me apply
some<00:02:54.689> clear<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.140> thought<00:02:55.500> I'd<00:02:55.769> explain

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
some clear I thought I'd explain

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.600 
some clear I thought I'd explain
something<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.180> bit<00:02:57.360> more<00:02:57.540> clear<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.110> well<00:02:58.610> okay

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
something a bit more clear as well okay

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.679 
something a bit more clear as well okay
that<00:02:59.849> was<00:03:00.060> lame<00:03:00.269> never<00:03:01.140> mind<00:03:02.120> you<00:03:03.120> might<00:03:03.360> think

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
that was lame never mind you might think

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.080 
that was lame never mind you might think
that<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:04.470> exact<00:03:05.010> same<00:03:05.220> settings<00:03:05.670> will<00:03:05.879> work

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
that my exact same settings will work

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.539 
that my exact same settings will work
for<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.540> as<00:03:06.750> well<00:03:06.959> well<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.680> could<00:03:08.159> very<00:03:08.459> well

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
for you as well well it could very well

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.649 
for you as well well it could very well
be<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.290> not<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.829> guarantee<00:03:11.659> some

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
be but that is not a guarantee some

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.319 
be but that is not a guarantee some
factors<00:03:13.109> come<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.470> play<00:03:13.680> as<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.430> mentioned<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
factors come in play as I mentioned the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.569 
factors come in play as I mentioned the
length<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.959> my<00:03:16.109> air<00:03:16.379> hose<00:03:16.409> that<00:03:17.069> makes<00:03:17.459> a

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
length of my air hose that makes a

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.849 
length of my air hose that makes a
difference<00:03:18.000> as<00:03:18.180> well<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.569> I<00:03:18.959> set<00:03:19.409> my<00:03:19.590> air

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
difference as well as I set my air

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.009 
difference as well as I set my air
pressure<00:03:20.040> at<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.849> compressor<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.569> not<00:03:21.750> at

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
pressure at the compressor and not at

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.530 
pressure at the compressor and not at
the<00:03:22.049> airbrush<00:03:22.620> I'd<00:03:22.859> so<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.940> longer<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.299> air

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
the airbrush I'd so the longer the air

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.449 
the airbrush I'd so the longer the air
hose<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.049> higher<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.500> pressure<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
hose the higher the pressure is and the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.699 
hose the higher the pressure is and the
lower<00:03:26.609> the<00:03:26.849> pressure<00:03:27.060> will<00:03:27.389> be<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.230> end<00:03:28.440> of

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
lower the pressure will be at the end of

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.240 
lower the pressure will be at the end of
the<00:03:28.859> airbrush<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:30.889> also<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> temperature

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
the airbrush and also the temperature

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.720 
the airbrush and also the temperature
comes<00:03:32.790> in<00:03:32.970> play<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.620> colder<00:03:35.129> out<00:03:35.370> here

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
comes in play as it is colder out here

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.309 
comes in play as it is colder out here
in<00:03:35.939> the<00:03:36.060> Netherlands<00:03:36.569> than<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> might<00:03:37.079> be<00:03:37.139> in

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
in the Netherlands than it might be in

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.399 
in the Netherlands than it might be in
the<00:03:37.650> US<00:03:37.950> or<00:03:38.299> some<00:03:39.299> other<00:03:39.510> places<00:03:39.840> where<00:03:40.230> my

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
the US or some other places where my

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.089 
the US or some other places where my
viewers<00:03:40.739> are<00:03:40.889> from<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:42.299> pressure<00:03:43.200> matters<00:03:43.859> as

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
viewers are from the pressure matters as

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.610 
viewers are from the pressure matters as
well<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:45.000> might<00:03:45.209> need<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.599> turn<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.930> up<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.439> get

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
well you might need to turn it up to get

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.710 
well you might need to turn it up to get
the<00:03:46.829> same<00:03:47.069> results<00:03:47.549> as<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:48.000> would<00:03:48.180> with<00:03:48.480> a

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the same results as you would with a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.440 
the same results as you would with a
higher<00:03:48.930> temperature<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.700> that's<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:51.030> couple<00:03:51.389> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
higher temperature so that's a couple of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.509 
higher temperature so that's a couple of
things<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:51.810> need<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.109> keep<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.439> mind<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.950> also

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
things you need to keep in mind and also

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.229 
things you need to keep in mind and also
another<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.810> important<00:03:55.319> thing<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.400> air

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
another really important thing the air

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.229 
another really important thing the air
brush<00:03:57.480> you're<00:03:57.690> using<00:03:57.900> might<00:03:58.730> work<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.940> lot

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
brush you're using might work a lot

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.849 
brush you're using might work a lot
better<00:04:00.449> with<00:04:00.840> completely<00:04:01.709> different

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
better with completely different

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.220 
better with completely different
settings<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:02.790> don't<00:04:03.239> just<00:04:03.480> rely<00:04:03.810> on<00:04:03.840> my

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
settings so don't just rely on my

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.699 
settings so don't just rely on my
settings<00:04:04.680> play<00:04:05.160> around<00:04:05.430> for<00:04:05.579> yourself<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
settings play around for yourself and

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.699 
settings play around for yourself and
find<00:04:07.709> out<00:04:07.859> what<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.370> best<00:04:08.849> for<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.329> now<00:04:10.290> back

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
find out what is best for you now back

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.500 
find out what is best for you now back
to<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.949> clear<00:04:11.159> coat<00:04:11.400> after<00:04:11.970> applying<00:04:12.299> this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
to the clear coat after applying this

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.659 
to the clear coat after applying this
first<00:04:12.810> coat<00:04:13.079> I<00:04:13.260> let<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> gas<00:04:13.949> out<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.489> five

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
first coat I let it gas out for five

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.569 
first coat I let it gas out for five
minutes<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.409> as<00:04:16.409> you<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.739> see<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.190> still<00:04:17.549> has

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
minutes and as you can see it still has

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.969 
minutes and as you can see it still has
a<00:04:17.880> bit<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> orange<00:04:18.419> peel<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.169> definitely

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
a bit of orange peel so I definitely

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.909 
a bit of orange peel so I definitely
need<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.430> go<00:04:20.760> for<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.329> second<00:04:21.780> coat<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.139> this

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
need to go for a second coat and this

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.830 
need to go for a second coat and this
second<00:04:23.340> coat<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.760> pretty<00:04:24.090> much<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.479> same<00:04:24.659> as

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
second coat is pretty much the same as

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.050 
second coat is pretty much the same as
the<00:04:24.930> first<00:04:25.169> coat<00:04:25.409> might<00:04:26.190> be<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.610> little<00:04:26.849> bit

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
the first coat might be a little bit

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.330 
the first coat might be a little bit
heavier<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.690> as<00:04:28.470> I<00:04:28.650> mentioned<00:04:29.130> at<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
heavier and as I mentioned at the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.520 
heavier and as I mentioned at the
beginning<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.060> video<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.570> added<00:04:31.139> one

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
beginning of the video I added one

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.710 
beginning of the video I added one
milliliter<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.250> extra<00:04:33.030> thinners<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
milliliter of extra thinners to the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.140 
milliliter of extra thinners to the
complete<00:04:34.080> mixture<00:04:34.500> with<00:04:34.830> clear<00:04:35.159> coat<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.580> thin

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
complete mixture with clear coat to thin

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.740 
complete mixture with clear coat to thin
it<00:04:36.180> down<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.510> bit<00:04:36.690> more<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.919> get<00:04:38.159> a<00:04:38.750> smoother

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
it down a bit more and to get a smoother

00:04:39.750 --> 00:05:11.320 
it down a bit more and to get a smoother
result<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.830> clear<00:04:41.039> coat

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:35.850 

you

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.650 

after<00:05:36.860> completing<00:05:37.370> this<00:05:37.580> second<00:05:38.210> coat<00:05:38.420> I

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
after completing this second coat I

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.870 
after completing this second coat I
again<00:05:39.110> let<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.350> gas<00:05:39.680> out<00:05:39.950> for<00:05:40.220> five<00:05:40.400> minutes

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
again let it gas out for five minutes

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.360 
again let it gas out for five minutes
and<00:05:41.000> then<00:05:41.240> moved<00:05:41.540> on<00:05:41.750> to<00:05:42.140> the<00:05:42.500> third<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:43.070> final

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
and then moved on to the third and final

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.510 
and then moved on to the third and final
coat<00:05:43.760> but<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:44.810> third<00:05:45.230> coat<00:05:45.590> is<00:05:45.800> completely

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
coat but this third coat is completely

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.060 
coat but this third coat is completely
optional<00:05:46.790> as<00:05:47.360> it<00:05:47.840> already<00:05:48.080> looks<00:05:48.560> pretty<00:05:48.860> good

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
optional as it already looks pretty good

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.880 
optional as it already looks pretty good
and<00:05:49.250> two<00:05:49.700> coats<00:05:50.000> is<00:05:50.270> more<00:05:50.900> than<00:05:51.110> enough<00:05:51.410> for<00:05:51.830> a

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
and two coats is more than enough for a

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.740 
and two coats is more than enough for a
scale<00:05:52.250> model<00:05:52.460> as<00:05:52.790> it's<00:05:53.120> not<00:05:53.330> going<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.630> be

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
scale model as it's not going to be

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.930 
scale model as it's not going to be
banged<00:05:53.960> up<00:05:54.140> or<00:05:54.320> anything<00:05:54.530> like<00:05:54.920> a<00:05:55.370> real<00:05:55.700> car

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
banged up or anything like a real car

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.990 
banged up or anything like a real car
would<00:05:56.120> be<00:05:56.270> and<00:05:56.480> if<00:05:57.470> a<00:05:57.710> real<00:05:57.890> car<00:05:58.160> is<00:05:58.400> good

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
would be and if a real car is good

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.480 
would be and if a real car is good
enough<00:05:59.270> with<00:05:59.540> two<00:05:59.840> coats<00:06:00.080> a<00:06:00.350> scale<00:06:00.890> model<00:06:01.100> will

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
enough with two coats a scale model will

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.120 
enough with two coats a scale model will
certainly<00:06:01.970> be<00:06:02.300> more<00:06:02.780> than<00:06:02.990> good<00:06:03.170> enough<00:06:03.230> with

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
certainly be more than good enough with

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.940 
certainly be more than good enough with
two<00:06:04.490> coats<00:06:04.760> now<00:06:05.480> I<00:06:05.720> decided<00:06:06.170> to<00:06:06.410> go<00:06:06.560> for<00:06:06.800> this

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
two coats now I decided to go for this

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.190 
two coats now I decided to go for this
third<00:06:07.400> coat<00:06:07.700> as<00:06:07.880> I<00:06:08.210> was<00:06:08.450> not<00:06:08.600> completely

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.920 
third coat as I was not completely
satisfied<00:06:09.470> with<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.910> results<00:06:11.420> in<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:11.750> orange

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930
