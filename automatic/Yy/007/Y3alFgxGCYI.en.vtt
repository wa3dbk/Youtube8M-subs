00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.360
 there are layoffs 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.590
 friends I do not know about you but I always 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.599
 When I play something new I wonder which one 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
 it's the best weapon with what weapon I'm going to 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.590
 find more and with what style of weapons is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 say nobody assaults for their rifles 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 shotguns etcetera then in this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 video I'm going to teach you a way in the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 that you can know what weapon is the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.730
 more suitable for each one of you 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 but without using platoon points like 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 you also know now everything is through 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 of that body in your purchases your 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 advantages its attacks everything all all to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 through squat points by the way 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.789
 a couple of days I heard a video about how 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 have them in a faster way to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.850
 that are going to check this video I'm going to 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.640
 leave a link on the screen in the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.590
 description but outside of that is a bit 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.140
 frustrating the fact that they have their 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.480
 squat points, say ok, it's me 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.879
 it suits me or the one I like the most if 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.949
 of sight but the test neither say nor is it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.960
 what I expected or also typical 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.360
 what happens that some friend recommends them 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.399
 x weapon to give you an example tells you no 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 do not buy the real chin is 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.080
 very good is super father 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.460
 they buy and it's not what you guys 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.740
 they were waiting because they remember that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.240
 we are each different, each one of us 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 we find in a different way with 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 each weapon 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.810
 then in this video as you 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.720
 he mentioned is going to teach them a way 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 so that they do not go through that first thing 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.500
 have to do is go create a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.530
 soldier and by hubble are going to have already 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.229
 the class of the strike assault forgiveness 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.240
 you see there are three assault support and 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.650
 specialist then what are you going to be 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.080
 select the second one that is the one of 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.810
 support and also by default they will already have 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.300
 the master crate in the nun and the second and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.159
 what he does is strike and he gave him a strike 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.220
 because it's funny because in the modem 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.289
 alfred 3 and other games is called streak 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 district but here it's called strike es es 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.600
 a little weird but good is striker 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 strike and it came to confuse go to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.340
 select the master crate that also 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 they have default and what this does is 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 that when they pass over it is bar amo 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.070
 but apart from giving them love they go to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.430
 be able to take a random weapon if you 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.380
 press x on in xbox 360 or square on 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.300
 playstation3 can give them any 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.130
 weapon is to say one is nobody but one sub 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.260
 more chingÃ³n an assault rifle and so on 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.420
 You can also give them any 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.880
 performance in which a red point is a grip 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 a silencer then the good thing about 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.770
 these who have the possibility of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.080
 try out 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.090
 different weapons different attachments 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.440
 and as an example if you give them a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.360
 tool or not they are not with the 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.580
 planning tone when these are already 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
 buy a weapon they will know that they should not 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.510
 spend on that gun because maybe it's not 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.580
 which obviously suits them best 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.320
 you can buy the can dominate and everything 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.080
 It is also very good but as well as 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.420
 start so they do not spend so much 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.790
 squad points let's say foolish is a 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.980
 good way to do it or is this the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.910
 contrast that they are given as a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.500
 example here 12 here 12 they love it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.090
 the whole when you are already well in 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 the lobby that want to buy a weapon with 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.260
 their bodies will know that this is going to be a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.120
 smart purchase a wise purchase 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.430
 because it is already a weapon that in advance 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.170
 they tried and that was not simply from 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.240
 hearsay came and foresees to be very 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.060
 good but you already personally 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.060
 they tried those weapons they know they have and 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.000
 if I do not know if he gives them the master craig them 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.490
 It gives the aca 2 and with silencer wears 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.980
 you tested it like that and you found 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.069
 very well so they will also know that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.290
 attachment buy for 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.810
 as if he were killing several birds 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.870
 of a single shot and good is a way 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.180
 very very easy to know what weapon is the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.680
 more suitable for you friends I hope 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.930
 that you liked this video that 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.549
 be helpful if it was so please support 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.799
 I like to share the video with 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.329
 his friends because he helps me too much and 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.920

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.340
