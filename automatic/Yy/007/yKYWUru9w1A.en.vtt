00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and the lack of them will leave you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
and the lack of them will leave you

the water and the glycogen make the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.090 
the water and the glycogen make the

enables the rebuilding process and

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.410 
enables the rebuilding process and
therefore<00:00:43.290> allows<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.340> increased<00:00:44.489> lean<00:00:45.390> a
