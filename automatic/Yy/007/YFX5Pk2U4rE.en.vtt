00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 moin moin and this is again eilfeld 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:25.310
 22 today there is the mpc weapons review 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.260
 you see here a gameplay resp 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.480
 various gameplays plan gameplay 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.300
 I have the class I have in the play 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.860
 I used that once in the picture 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.500
 means you can see what kind of a 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.960
 I class at the time used is 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.660
 also directly to the net makes the weapon 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.720
 on short distance 33 harm what 1 4 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.719
 towards killers and at maximum range 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.460
 18 hurt what 1 6 kill with skill is 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.519
 Of course, he is short 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.050
 that's always the case at the station 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.870
 She can still walk through thin walls 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.519
 shoot but it really can 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.829
 it could be eight or nine 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.150
 It takes shots because it will hurt 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:09.950
 There is pretty quick minimized and is 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.530
 not so recommend trying too 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.050
 want is not so good she has it 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.090
 astonishingly fast 900 shots per 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.120
 minute which is not bad at all 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 is and with in the higher category 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.140
 that's why all the machines are helps beforehand 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.280
 Of course that's okay, that's logical 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 a tractor then much better 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.250
 as my offices still and in any case 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.930
 you can shoot it from the hip 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.670
 the speed with the weapon is 100 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.820
 percent that means you get faster in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.730
 can not run the game 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 the downside time that means you need 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.260
 to go sight is 0 22 seconds 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960
 that's a bit faster than bolt 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.570
 rifles but you will hardly the 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.820
 difference remember the reload is on 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.820
 is already relatively quickly what is beautiful 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.730
 at 1.72 seconds this is the fastest 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.740
 - That's why machines are great and powerful 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.360
 so almost max with 14 2 seconds 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.680
 relatively unnecessary and even you can get better 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 take another 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.480
 Nicole I find a bit funny 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.970
 So I'm not so clear but that 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.890
 is personal preference here 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.940
 I deserve to classify as medium and 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.780
 I think he can already 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.550
 check 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.630
 but I have a total problem with those 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.390
 with the nicole baczak machine quite yes 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.610
 the high point is definitely 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.290
 I would not use it though 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.300
 be sure to use one thing 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.460
 compare time with that from mw3 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.290
 most get along well and 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.840
 I do not think you need it 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.260
 definitely the red dot the handle 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 Chambers use it but quite honestly 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.930
 you do not have to have a melee weapon 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.810
 the laser i would say is a must 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.920
 you only need this weapon with laser 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.230
 then she is really good at finding you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.330
 extended mix power increases the magazine 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.610
 only on 54 shot 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.760
 I do not necessarily need one 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.500
 long tail is quite useful if you are 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.220
 because a bit on range something 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.810
 wants to tear 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.030
 but also there I would say you need 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.470
 It does not necessarily come to me now 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.740
 the classes I meanwhile 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.810
 tried during this weapons test 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.660
 there was once the next class 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.700
 that is a boring and a laser 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 time on the weapon and is actually 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.730
 Almost the weapon I am on 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.660
 So she would recommend it 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.550
 variable 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.160
 you can spend a bit on long range 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.320
 travel quite a bit on distance 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.840
 the damage is the maximum damage to the man 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:45.110
 makes and therefore the four hip 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.010
 range becomes around 11 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.040
 multiplies that means you have one 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.500
 a bit more reach something 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.860
 is useful then there was still at bw 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.240
 klos quarters class that was laser and 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.070
 I have almost max there too 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.870
 found that you can not even max almost 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.330
 about a monastery that needs because this 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.780
 03 seconds you can rather by 1 1 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.330
 recoup 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.550
 because you remain undetected on the map 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.670
 you can then use ghost 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.530
 or the way I did it 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.150
 lightweight and extreme conditioning 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.180
 that you can do it very quickly with this 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.360
 great and still soundless anyway 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.370
 that would also be one of the recommended ones 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.150
 class time so one of the classes 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.950
 I recommend you 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.830
 then I have a class 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.870
 Tried out that you just mj and 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.180
 quick drop 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.250
 forget it offered no longer needs 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.380
 It is not outraged on that machine 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.070
 anyway unnecessary and really get ne 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.110
 Not 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.540
 then just the range class draws 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.510
 with the handle and long barrel 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.270
 that is you can do it but you can 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.640
 should rather play the weapon like that 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.710
 you as well as you thought is up 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.780
 after removal either with long way 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.700
 and laser side or laser time and 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.410
 Seidel i would definitely 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.720
 say that you need the laser time 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.200
 because otherwise you are so kind 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.610
 in a fix 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.320
 my opinion to the end she is one 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.910
 quite variable weapon 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.890
 I can only recommend it to you 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.800
 to try out you have it from level 4 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.980
 that means it's the starting weapon and everyone 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.190
 available and with laser time what you need 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.220
 Relatively early, it's actually there 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.220
 the machine and you can handle it 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.390
 actually do not do anything wrong so that 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.450
 it was already with this again 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.870
 episode many dates and in the next 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.030
 episode becomes the 870 mcs city gang 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.520
 come if you like this episode 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.270
 then tilts the video yet, and 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.270
