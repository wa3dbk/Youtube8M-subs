of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.430> things<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.090> they

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
of the little things I like is that they

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.569 
of the little things I like is that they
painted<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.930> little<00:00:37.320> light<00:00:37.559> brown<00:00:37.860> that

goes underneath the main part of his
tunic<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.910> also<00:00:41.910> think<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.120> did<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> great<00:00:42.660> job

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the belt you'll see that they use like a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.590 
the belt you'll see that they use like a
wash<00:00:47.190> over<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> brown<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.180> almost<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.510> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
wash over the brown so almost like a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000 
wash over the brown so almost like a
black<00:00:48.840> wash<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.500> gives<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
black wash that gives it kind of a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
black wash that gives it kind of a
leathery<00:00:50.309> effect<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> see

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
hang down
they<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.240> read<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:15.869> leather<00:01:16.229> almost

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
they really do read like leather almost

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.370 
they really do read like leather almost
it's<00:01:16.890> creepy<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.820> much<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.810> material

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
it's creepy like how much this material

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
it's creepy like how much this material
doesn't<00:01:19.650> feel<00:01:19.979> like<00:01:20.159> cloth<00:01:20.580> but<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.180> be

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
doesn't feel like cloth but it could be

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.480 
doesn't feel like cloth but it could be
a<00:01:21.390> leather<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.770> absolutely<00:01:22.920> hate

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
a leather one thing I absolutely hate

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.109 
a leather one thing I absolutely hate
though<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.119> hate<00:01:24.600> cloth<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.979> action<00:01:26.820> figures

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
though is I hate cloth on action figures

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.569 
though is I hate cloth on action figures
I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:28.170> six<00:01:28.530> inch<00:01:28.710> figures<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.280> three

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
I think six inch figures and three

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
I think six inch figures and three
three-quarter<00:01:29.820> inch<00:01:30.000> figures<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.509> small

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
three-quarter inch figures are so small

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
three-quarter inch figures are so small
that<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.079> shouldn't<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.409> using<00:01:31.500> cloth<00:01:31.829> on

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that you shouldn't be using cloth on

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
that you shouldn't be using cloth on
them<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.579> also<00:01:33.119> cloth<00:01:33.600> that's

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
them at all and also cloth that's

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
them at all and also cloth that's
designed<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> full<00:01:35.280> person

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
designed for you know a full person

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.280 
designed for you know a full person
scale<00:01:36.210> doesn't<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.689> work<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.079> such<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
scale doesn't really work in such a

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
scale doesn't really work in such a
small<00:01:37.560> scale<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.240> minimal

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
small scale but it's a very minimal

small scale but it's a very minimal
cloth<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.140> you'll<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.439> deal<00:01:40.590> with

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
cloth on this you'll have to deal with

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.639 
cloth on this you'll have to deal with
that<00:01:40.799> too<00:01:40.979> much<00:01:42.140> let's<00:01:43.140> take<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.320> closer<00:01:43.530> look

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that too much let's take a closer look

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
that too much let's take a closer look
at<00:01:43.860> his<00:01:44.009> head<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.460> actually<00:01:44.759> did<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
at his head because actually did a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.060 
at his head because actually did a
pretty<00:01:45.210> good<00:01:45.360> job<00:01:45.530> sculpting<00:01:46.530> his<00:01:46.590> hair

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
pretty good job sculpting his hair

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.789 
pretty good job sculpting his hair
I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> hair<00:01:48.329> looks<00:01:48.509> good<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:49.619> all

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
I think the hair looks good from all

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.200 
I think the hair looks good from all
sides<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> even<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> front<00:01:51.090> in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
sides and even in the front in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
sides and even in the front in
particular<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.229> job

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
particular I think that it a good job

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.350 
particular I think that it a good job
with<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.909> what<00:01:53.909> I'm<00:01:54.000> really<00:01:54.210> impressed

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
with that but what I'm really impressed

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.810 
with that but what I'm really impressed
by<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> lightness<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> face<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.790> know

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
by is the lightness in the face you know

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
by is the lightness in the face you know
they're<00:01:57.090> Leia<00:01:57.299> likeness<00:01:57.750> maybe<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.649> good

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
they're Leia likeness maybe not so good

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.039 
they're Leia likeness maybe not so good
but<00:01:59.009> they're<00:01:59.250> Anakin<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.000> think<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:00.810> it's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but they're Anakin I think actually it's
