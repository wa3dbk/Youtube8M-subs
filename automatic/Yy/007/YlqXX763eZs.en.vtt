so<00:00:03.780> now<00:00:04.350> that<00:00:04.410> we've<00:00:04.680> got<00:00:04.890> all<00:00:05.010> our<00:00:05.040> zones

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
so now that we've got all our zones

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.289 
so now that we've got all our zones
wired<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:06.170> we<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.760> we<00:00:08.760> were<00:00:08.850> smart<00:00:09.090> enough<00:00:09.180> to

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
wired in we have we were smart enough to

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.810 
wired in we have we were smart enough to
previously<00:00:10.020> do<00:00:10.559> these<00:00:10.740> two<00:00:10.949> knockouts<00:00:11.490> at<00:00:11.699> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
previously do these two knockouts at the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.539 
previously do these two knockouts at the
top<00:00:12.059> right<00:00:12.539> corner<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.170> vista<00:00:13.440> 21ip<00:00:13.740> panel

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
top right corner of the vista 21ip panel

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.090 
top right corner of the vista 21ip panel
and<00:00:14.699> the<00:00:15.600> reason<00:00:15.930> there<00:00:16.110> have<00:00:16.890> those

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and the reason there have those

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.640 
and the reason there have those
knockouts<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.940> fit<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.449> antenna<00:00:18.870> for

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
knockouts is to fit in the antenna for

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.580 
knockouts is to fit in the antenna for
the<00:00:19.710> gsm<00:00:20.280> board<00:00:20.520> obviously<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.510> our

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
the gsm board obviously with our

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.390 
the gsm board obviously with our
clearance<00:00:22.590> here<00:00:22.830> we're<00:00:23.100> not<00:00:23.160> gonna<00:00:23.280> be<00:00:23.370> able

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
clearance here we're not gonna be able

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.920 
clearance here we're not gonna be able
to<00:00:23.520> have<00:00:23.700> our<00:00:23.730> antenna<00:00:24.120> stick<00:00:24.420> straight<00:00:24.720> up

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to have our antenna stick straight up

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.890 
to have our antenna stick straight up
but<00:00:25.770> we'll<00:00:25.920> be<00:00:26.310> able<00:00:26.370> to<00:00:26.520> run<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.420> parallel<00:00:27.600> be

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
but we'll be able to run it parallel be

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.290 
but we'll be able to run it parallel be
okay<00:00:28.200> so<00:00:28.550> we've<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.880> little<00:00:30.180> white

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
okay so we've got this little white

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.319 
okay so we've got this little white
piece<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.720> comes<00:00:30.869> along<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> Vista

or vertical obviously not going to work

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.020 
or vertical obviously not going to work
so<00:02:35.890> we're<00:02:36.890> going<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.070> run<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.340> off<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> side

hard to get a grip up here so I'm just
using<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.220> antenna<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:11.670> connection

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
using the antenna to get that connection

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.770 
using the antenna to get that connection
as<00:03:12.870> tight<00:03:13.620> as<00:03:13.740> we<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:17.510> we've<00:03:18.510> now
