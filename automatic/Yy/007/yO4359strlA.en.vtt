now<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> couple<00:00:21.270> things<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.900> go<00:00:22.020> over

now a couple things I want to go over
first<00:00:22.439> are<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> basic<00:00:24.090> things<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
first are some of the basic things that

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.290 
first are some of the basic things that
you<00:00:24.930> need<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.140> always<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.740> even<00:00:26.699> if<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

you need to always do even if you have
old<00:00:27.599> iOS<00:00:27.900> any<00:00:28.529> smartphone<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.429> save<00:00:29.699> battery

life<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.539> remember<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.140> thing

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
life you have to remember the thing

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.290 
life you have to remember the thing
about<00:00:31.560> smartphones<00:00:31.980> they're<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.149> much

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
about smartphones they're not so much

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
about smartphones they're not so much
phones<00:00:33.600> anymore<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.410> our<00:00:34.559> computer<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.280> it's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
phones anymore as a our computer so it's

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.780 
phones anymore as a our computer so it's
kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:36.440> naive<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.710> think<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.370> battery

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
kind of naive to think that the battery

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150 
kind of naive to think that the battery
is<00:00:38.879> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.440> three<00:00:40.590> days

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
is going to last two or three days

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100 
is going to last two or three days
that's<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.730> not<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.390> they're<00:00:42.540> meant<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.870> do

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
that's just not what they're meant to do

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.900 
that's just not what they're meant to do
anymore<00:00:43.379> they're<00:00:44.070> getting<00:00:44.399> better<00:00:44.579> through

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
anymore they're getting better through

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.529 
anymore they're getting better through
time<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.780> remember<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.350> essentially<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
time but remember this is essentially a

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
time but remember this is essentially a
computer<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.870> not<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> phone<00:00:49.440> anymore<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
computer it's not a phone anymore so

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.319 
computer it's not a phone anymore so
just<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> treat<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.120> like<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
just you have to treat it like your

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.100 
just you have to treat it like your
laptop<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.170> tablet<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:53.160> going<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.489> day

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
laptop or tablet you're going to get day

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.180 
laptop or tablet you're going to get day
maximum<00:00:55.110> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> these<00:00:55.500> but<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:55.980> ways

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
maximum out of these but there are ways

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040 
maximum out of these but there are ways
to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:56.760> efficient<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.629> battery

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to be more efficient with your battery

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.439 
to be more efficient with your battery
like<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> first<00:00:58.530> thing<00:00:58.770> you'll<00:00:58.920> notice<00:00:59.039> is

woods somewhere hiking or running I may
not<00:05:08.919> need<00:05:09.160> 4G<00:05:09.850> LTE<00:05:10.120> turned<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:10.960> 4G<00:05:11.950> LTE<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.940> a

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
not need 4G LTE turned on 4G LTE it's a

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.510 
not need 4G LTE turned on 4G LTE it's a
great<00:05:13.510> data<00:05:13.840> service<00:05:14.350> but<00:05:14.590> he<00:05:14.620> eats<00:05:15.040> up

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
great data service but he eats up

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.000 
great data service but he eats up
battery<00:05:15.550> life<00:05:16.120> like<00:05:16.360> crazy<00:05:16.720> so<00:05:17.410> if<00:05:17.620> you're<00:05:17.800> not

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
battery life like crazy so if you're not

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.790 
battery life like crazy so if you're not
going<00:05:18.250> in<00:05:18.370> need<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.669> fast<00:05:19.510> data<00:05:19.990> speeds<00:05:20.380> turn

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
going in need of fast data speeds turn

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.010 
going in need of fast data speeds turn
that<00:05:20.950> off<00:05:21.010> that'll<00:05:21.580> save<00:05:21.820> you<00:05:21.970> a<00:05:22.000> load<00:05:22.510> of

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
that off that'll save you a load of

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.560 
that off that'll save you a load of
battery<00:05:23.889> life<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.280> just<00:05:24.460> keep<00:05:24.820> your<00:05:24.970> cellular

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
battery life and just keep your cellular

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.810 
battery life and just keep your cellular
data<00:05:25.750> which<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.080> essentially<00:05:26.590> 3g<00:05:27.160> so<00:05:27.729> you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
data which is essentially 3g so you

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
data which is essentially 3g so you
could<00:05:27.970> just<00:05:28.120> keep<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.510> out<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:28.780> that's

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
could just keep that out and that's

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.379 
could just keep that out and that's
another<00:05:29.169> way<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.440> save<00:05:29.740> battery<00:05:30.490> life<00:05:30.520> another

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
another way to save battery life another

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.510 
another way to save battery life another
thing<00:05:31.660> and<00:05:31.840> this<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.050> kind<00:05:32.260> of<00:05:32.320> a<00:05:32.440> neat<00:05:33.370> little

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
thing and this is kind of a neat little

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.940 
thing and this is kind of a neat little
trick<00:05:33.789> you<00:05:34.030> notice<00:05:34.270> my<00:05:34.419> background<00:05:35.080> is<00:05:35.560> pretty

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
trick you notice my background is pretty

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.580 
trick you notice my background is pretty
dark<00:05:36.280> now<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.570> lot<00:05:37.870> of<00:05:37.900> people<00:05:38.020> like<00:05:38.380> different

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
dark now a lot of people like different

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.680 
dark now a lot of people like different
pictures<00:05:39.100> in<00:05:39.250> their<00:05:39.370> background<00:05:39.610> but<00:05:40.419> believe

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
pictures in their background but believe

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.409 
pictures in their background but believe
it<00:05:40.810> or<00:05:40.840> not<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.229> brighter<00:05:41.560> your<00:05:41.889> screen<00:05:42.310> as<00:05:42.580> I

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
it or not the brighter your screen as I

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.730 
it or not the brighter your screen as I
mentioned<00:05:43.810> before<00:05:43.840> about<00:05:44.110> brightness<00:05:44.710> the

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
mentioned before about brightness the

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.529 
mentioned before about brightness the
more<00:05:45.130> battery<00:05:45.490> life<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.910> uses<00:05:46.240> so<00:05:46.389> the

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:46.539 
more battery life it uses so the

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.900 
more battery life it uses so the
brighter<00:05:46.810> your<00:05:47.110> background<00:05:47.650> image<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.700> more

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
brighter your background image the more

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.760 
brighter your background image the more
power<00:05:49.150> it<00:05:49.300> takes<00:05:49.419> a<00:05:49.780> display<00:05:50.229> it<00:05:50.380> so<00:05:50.530> with<00:05:50.650> all

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
power it takes a display it so with all

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.469 
power it takes a display it so with all
these<00:05:50.919> dark<00:05:51.190> spaces<00:05:51.520> i<00:05:51.760> have<00:05:51.940> up<00:05:52.090> here<00:05:52.270> in<00:05:52.419> a

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
these dark spaces i have up here in a

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.900 
these dark spaces i have up here in a
dark<00:05:52.750> blue<00:05:53.050> is<00:05:53.289> basically<00:05:53.740> a<00:05:53.800> globe<00:05:54.310> image

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
dark blue is basically a globe image

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.110 
dark blue is basically a globe image
here<00:05:55.229> the<00:05:56.229> wider<00:05:56.470> this<00:05:56.740> image<00:05:57.099> is<00:05:57.250> here<00:05:57.639> the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
here the wider this image is here the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.700 
here the wider this image is here the
more<00:05:58.360> battery<00:05:58.720> life<00:05:58.780> that's<00:05:59.110> going<00:05:59.289> to<00:05:59.349> eat<00:05:59.500> up

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
more battery life that's going to eat up

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.140 
more battery life that's going to eat up
so<00:05:59.889> you<00:05:59.950> may<00:06:00.130> want<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:00.430> select<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.910> background
