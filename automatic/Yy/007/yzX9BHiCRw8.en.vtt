00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
of it stretching time yes and no if we

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.290 
of it stretching time yes and no if we
remember<00:02:12.440> last<00:02:12.470> year<00:02:12.920> we<00:02:13.130> lost<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.820> don't<00:02:14.210> know

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
remember last year we lost I don't know

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.110 
remember last year we lost I don't know
maybe<00:02:14.510> ten<00:02:15.410> twelve<00:02:15.710> twelve<00:02:16.100> games<00:02:16.280> on<00:02:16.490> the

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
maybe ten twelve twelve games on the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.560 
maybe ten twelve twelve games on the
same<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> same<00:02:18.410> moment<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.360> yeah<00:02:20.360> it's

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
same at the same moment so yeah it's

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.780 
same at the same moment so yeah it's
frustrating<00:02:20.750> because<00:02:21.320> we<00:02:21.950> all<00:02:22.160> want<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.520> win

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
frustrating because we all want to win

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.210 
frustrating because we all want to win
and<00:02:23.150> sometimes<00:02:24.080> when<00:02:24.320> you<00:02:24.470> feel<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
and sometimes when you feel that you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.640 
and sometimes when you feel that you
lose<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.730> Saturday<00:02:26.450> against<00:02:26.660> mid-war<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.380> a

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
lose like Saturday against mid-war for a

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.710 
lose like Saturday against mid-war for a
penalty<00:02:28.370> at<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.490> end<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> game<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.480> all

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
penalty at the end of the game of all

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.010 
penalty at the end of the game of all
it's<00:02:30.590> very<00:02:30.710> frustrating<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:31.880> after<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:32.630> have

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
it's very frustrating but after we have

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.200 
it's very frustrating but after we have
to<00:02:33.170> work<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.950> like<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.610> said<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:35.060> most

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
to work on it and like I said the most

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.660 
to work on it and like I said the most
important<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.870> we<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.440> stay<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.370> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
important is we have to stay on the to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.810 
important is we have to stay on the to
draw<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:38.570> didn't<00:02:38.900> lose<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.610> it's<00:02:40.610> very

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
draw so we didn't lose and it's very

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.140 
draw so we didn't lose and it's very
important<00:02:41.270> for<00:02:41.980> confident<00:02:42.980> different<00:02:43.790> they

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
important for confident different they

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.060 
important for confident different they
get<00:02:44.300> close<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:45.050> getting<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.320> first<00:02:45.650> when<00:02:45.950> do

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.930 
course it will take time you're not
going<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.080> play<00:03:36.560> from<00:03:36.980> a<00:03:37.100> league<00:03:37.280> like<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.700> or

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
going to play from a league like that or

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.690 
going to play from a league like that or
then<00:03:38.480> if<00:03:39.080> you<00:03:39.230> go<00:03:39.410> straight<00:03:39.470> straight<00:03:40.250> back<00:03:40.550> in

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
then if you go straight straight back in

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.040 
then if you go straight straight back in
from<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.970> league<00:03:41.120> you<00:03:41.300> will<00:03:41.510> go<00:03:41.660> down<00:03:41.780> straight

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
from a league you will go down straight

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.380 
from a league you will go down straight
away<00:03:42.110> so<00:03:42.920> you<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.459> take<00:03:43.640> time<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.180> be

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
away so you have to take time and be

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.360 
away so you have to take time and be
sure<00:03:44.420> that<00:03:44.930> it's<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.530> right<00:03:45.739> moment<00:03:45.890> at<00:03:46.220> the

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
sure that it's a right moment at the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.790 
sure that it's a right moment at the
moment

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
moment

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.950 
moment
I<00:03:46.830> think<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.190> are<00:03:47.240> just<00:03:48.240> trying<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.600> breathe

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:48.960

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.200 
I think we are just trying to breathe
something<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.680> once<00:03:50.220> it<00:03:50.430> should<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.730> good<00:03:50.910> I

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
something but once it should be good I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.290 
something but once it should be good I
