yeah<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.130> hood<00:01:17.700> scoop<00:01:18.740> doesn't<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.920> as

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
yeah that hood scoop doesn't look as

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.560 
yeah that hood scoop doesn't look as
accentuate<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> does<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
accentuate that as it does in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.149 
accentuate that as it does in the
picture<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.110> still<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> neat<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> Ford

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
picture but still really neat and a Ford

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
picture but still really neat and a Ford
f-150<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.060> little<00:01:27.330> heavier<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.170> due<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> all

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
f-150 a little heavier just due to all

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.750 
f-150 a little heavier just due to all
this<00:01:28.829> metal<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> top<00:01:29.810> an<00:01:30.810> extended<00:01:31.439> cab

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.360 

and<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.360> guess<00:01:35.510> that's<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:36.140> guess<00:01:36.800> that<00:01:36.980> counts

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
and I guess that's I guess that counts

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.230 
and I guess that's I guess that counts
as<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.730> rear<00:01:38.090> yeah<00:01:38.900> rear<00:01:39.530> lights<00:01:40.370> that

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
as that rear yeah rear lights that

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.940 
as that rear yeah rear lights that
doesn't<00:01:41.570> go<00:01:41.720> all<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:41.900> way<00:01:41.990> around<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.620> corner

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
doesn't go all the way around the corner

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.770 
doesn't go all the way around the corner
this<00:01:43.340> one<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.700> was<00:01:43.910> really<00:01:44.150> interested<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:44.660> this

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
this one I was really interested in this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.520 
this one I was really interested in this
is<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.080> project<00:01:45.590> speeder<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.350> new

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
casting for 2014 and I like it because

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.780 
casting for 2014 and I like it because
it<00:01:54.380> seems<00:01:54.710> like<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.920> seems<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.580> really

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
it seems like a seems like a really

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.190 
it seems like a seems like a really
rough<00:01:56.150> custom<00:01:56.690> job

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
rough custom job

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.230 
rough custom job
you<00:01:57.470> know<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.710> tempos<00:01:58.130> are<00:01:58.240> intentionally

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
you know the tempos are intentionally

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.820 
you know the tempos are intentionally
smudged<00:02:00.100> it's<00:02:01.100> missing<00:02:01.460> a<00:02:02.080> front<00:02:03.080> fenders<00:02:03.620> on

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
smudged it's missing a front fenders on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.420 
smudged it's missing a front fenders on
both<00:02:04.040> sides<00:02:05.650> missing<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.710> bumper<00:02:07.070> for<00:02:07.280> that

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
both sides missing a bumper for that

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.540 
both sides missing a bumper for that
matter<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:09.860> this<00:02:09.980> will<00:02:10.190> do<00:02:10.369> well

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
matter and I think this will do well

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.490 
matter and I think this will do well
with<00:02:10.730> even<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.330> customization<00:02:12.170> although

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
with even more customization although

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.630 
with even more customization although
they<00:02:12.650> did<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:12.860> really<00:02:12.980> good<00:02:13.130> job<00:02:13.190> there's<00:02:13.520> our

tampo right here on the on the gas tank

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.000 
tampo right here on the on the gas tank
it<00:02:18.170> would<00:02:18.260> have<00:02:18.350> been<00:02:18.470> nice<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.650> have<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.920> little

it would have been nice to have a little

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.590 
it would have been nice to have a little
bit<00:02:19.190> more<00:02:19.340> tampo<00:02:19.790> detail<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.330> front

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
bit more tampo detail on the front

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.150 
bit more tampo detail on the front
because<00:02:20.870> there's<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.200> much<00:02:21.290> going<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.740> in<00:02:21.950> here

it's but when is just a flat orange it's
kind<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.060> hard<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.300> see<00:02:26.540> everything<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.080> it'd

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
kind of hard to see everything so it'd

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.440 
kind of hard to see everything so it'd
be<00:02:27.350> nice<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.710> have<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:28.010> maybe<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:29.060> silver

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
be nice to have like maybe some silver

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.630 
be nice to have like maybe some silver
dots<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:30.380> maybe<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.620> might<00:02:30.770> do<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:30.950> with<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
dots and maybe I might do that with the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.110 
dots and maybe I might do that with the
some<00:02:31.910> testers<00:02:32.390> paint<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.280> finish<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.000> out

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
some testers paint just to finish it out

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.170 
some testers paint just to finish it out
but<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> really<00:02:36.410> cool<00:02:36.730> car<00:02:37.730> on

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
but I think this is a really cool car on

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.660 
but I think this is a really cool car on
its<00:02:38.420> own<00:02:38.860> plastic<00:02:39.860> base<00:02:41.920> chrome<00:02:42.920> interior<00:02:43.400> or

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
its own plastic base chrome interior or

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.240 
its own plastic base chrome interior or
the<00:02:43.850> next<00:02:44.030> four<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.680> actually<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:46.070> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the next four I actually have the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.210 
the next four I actually have the
variations<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.209> these<00:02:47.390> four<00:02:47.920> from<00:02:48.920> earlier

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
variations of these four from earlier

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.470 
variations of these four from earlier
cases<00:02:49.580> that<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.180> unbox

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
cases that I'm going to unbox

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.120 
cases that I'm going to unbox
side-by-side<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.620> we<00:02:51.709> can<00:02:51.830> see<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
side-by-side so we can see the

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.490 
side-by-side so we can see the
differences<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.900> first<00:02:54.200> step<00:02:54.350> would<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.739> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
differences so first step would be the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.140 
differences so first step would be the
71<00:02:57.500> Plymouth<00:02:57.890> Roadrunner<00:02:58.250> as<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.820> comes<00:02:59.000> in

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
71 Plymouth Roadrunner as it comes in

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.140 
71 Plymouth Roadrunner as it comes in
the<00:02:59.209> K<00:02:59.390> case<00:02:59.950> here's<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.220> green<00:03:01.670> Plymouth

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the K case here's the green Plymouth

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.710 
the K case here's the green Plymouth
Roadrunner

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
Roadrunner

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.740 
Roadrunner
and<00:03:02.870> this<00:03:03.320> is<00:03:03.440> from<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.920> F<00:03:04.190> case<00:03:07.330> so<00:03:08.330> both<00:03:08.510> are

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
and this is from the F case so both are

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.550 
and this is from the F case so both are
really<00:03:08.989> nice<00:03:09.260> same<00:03:09.770> chrome<00:03:10.550> interior<00:03:11.030> on<00:03:11.180> both

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
really nice same chrome interior on both

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.699 
really nice same chrome interior on both
same<00:03:12.560> wheels<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.640> bases<00:03:14.030> are<00:03:14.180> different<00:03:14.709> both

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
same wheels the bases are different both

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.590 
same wheels the bases are different both
plastic<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:19.190> together<00:03:19.400> they<00:03:20.060> look<00:03:20.209> really

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
plastic but together they look really

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.670 
plastic but together they look really
neat<00:03:20.840> next<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.530> each<00:03:21.620> other<00:03:23.230> next<00:03:24.230> up<00:03:24.500> we<00:03:24.650> have

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
neat next to each other next up we have

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.440 
neat next to each other next up we have
the<00:03:25.040> 72<00:03:25.760> Ford<00:03:26.180> Gran<00:03:26.480> Torino<00:03:26.780> sport<00:03:28.300> and<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
the 72 Ford Gran Torino sport and the

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.190 
the 72 Ford Gran Torino sport and the
KKK's<00:03:29.930> version<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.590> white<00:03:30.800> one<00:03:31.010> and<00:03:32.200> then

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
KKK's version is the white one and then

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.720 
KKK's version is the white one and then
the<00:03:33.470> blue<00:03:33.800> version<00:03:34.070> from<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.090> F<00:03:35.570> case<00:03:36.610> one<00:03:37.610> is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the blue version from the F case one is

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.880 
the blue version from the F case one is
primarily<00:03:38.180> blue<00:03:38.450> with<00:03:38.750> white<00:03:39.110> accents<00:03:39.739> and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
primarily blue with white accents and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.500 
primarily blue with white accents and
the<00:03:39.980> other<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.280> primarily<00:03:40.760> white<00:03:41.120> with<00:03:41.300> blue

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the other is primarily white with blue

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.110 
the other is primarily white with blue
accents<00:03:42.020> so<00:03:42.170> that's<00:03:42.350> really<00:03:42.549> nice<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:44.030> way

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
accents so that's really nice the way

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760 
accents so that's really nice the way
they<00:03:44.150> did<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.720> basis

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
they did that the basis

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.950 
they did that the basis
are<00:03:46.640> really<00:03:46.820> different<00:03:47.270> though<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.810> makes

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
are really different though that makes

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.140 
are really different though that makes
it<00:03:48.140> stand<00:03:48.350> out<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.590> lot<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.100> like<00:03:49.760> these<00:03:49.940> these

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
it stand out a lot I like these these

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.790 
it stand out a lot I like these these
are<00:03:50.330> really<00:03:50.360> complementary<00:03:51.020> to<00:03:51.500> each<00:03:51.530> other

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
are really complementary to each other

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.800 
are really complementary to each other
next<00:03:52.670> up<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.740> K<00:03:54.740> case<00:03:55.010> 71<00:03:55.910> dodge<00:03:56.210> demon<00:03:58.810> and

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
next up is the K case 71 dodge demon and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.090 
next up is the K case 71 dodge demon and
both<00:03:59.990> of<00:04:00.140> these<00:04:00.230> have<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.710> effect<00:04:00.980> your

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
both of these have that effect your

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
flame color pattern correct me if I'm

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.940 
flame color pattern correct me if I'm
wrong<00:04:04.820> in<00:04:05.270> the<00:04:05.360> comments<00:04:05.630> but<00:04:06.620> it<00:04:06.680> has<00:04:06.770> that

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
wrong in the comments but it has that

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.050 
wrong in the comments but it has that
really<00:04:07.370> metallic<00:04:07.820> gold<00:04:08.540> flake<00:04:09.640> paint<00:04:10.640> going

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
really metallic gold flake paint going

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.900 
really metallic gold flake paint going
on<00:04:11.240> in<00:04:11.420> this<00:04:11.510> car<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:13.280> is<00:04:13.370> really<00:04:13.580> nice<00:04:13.730> how

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
on in this car this is really nice how

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.520 
on in this car this is really nice how
the<00:04:13.970> yellow<00:04:14.210> line<00:04:14.480> tires<00:04:14.780> are<00:04:14.990> set<00:04:15.200> off<00:04:15.320> by

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the yellow line tires are set off by

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.490 
the yellow line tires are set off by
this<00:04:15.590> yellow<00:04:16.100> tampo<00:04:16.640> here<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:18.049> then<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.290> same

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
this yellow tampo here and then the same

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.680 
this yellow tampo here and then the same
thing<00:04:18.709> with<00:04:18.860> this<00:04:19.040> one<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.430> Orange<00:04:20.090> Line<00:04:20.299> tires

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
thing with this one is Orange Line tires

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.810 
thing with this one is Orange Line tires
set<00:04:21.380> off<00:04:21.470> by<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.709> orange<00:04:22.100> tap<00:04:22.370> books<00:04:22.610> but

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
set off by this orange tap books but

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.970 
set off by this orange tap books but
again<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.120> same<00:04:23.300> tampo<00:04:23.750> is<00:04:23.870> really<00:04:24.320> nice<00:04:29.980> okay

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
again the same tampo is really nice okay

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.160 
again the same tampo is really nice okay
and<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.730> mercury<00:04:32.150> figure<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.780> think

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
and this is the mercury figure I think

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.410 
and this is the mercury figure I think
this<00:04:33.290> is<00:04:33.440> from<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:34.490> is<00:04:34.640> an<00:04:34.730> international

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
this is from this is an international

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.910 
this is from this is an international
card<00:04:35.660> so<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.870> can't<00:04:36.080> really<00:04:36.350> read<00:04:36.530> what<00:04:36.560> case

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
card so I can't really read what case

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.350 
card so I can't really read what case
but<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.460> is<00:04:37.610> either<00:04:37.760> funny<00:04:38.120> like

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
but I think this is either funny like

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.110 
but I think this is either funny like
the<00:04:38.480> C<00:04:39.460> C<00:04:40.460> or<00:04:40.670> D<00:04:40.700> case<00:04:41.540> or<00:04:41.930> B<00:04:42.350> case<00:04:42.910> one<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.000> those

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the C C or D case or B case one of those

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.910 
the C C or D case or B case one of those
one<00:04:44.570> of<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.720> earlier<00:04:45.020> cases<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.590> this<00:04:45.740> year

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
one of the earlier cases of this year

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.010 
one of the earlier cases of this year
and<00:04:46.550> again<00:04:46.640> here's<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.090> K<00:04:47.270> case<00:04:47.570> mercury

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
and again here's the K case mercury

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:57.730 
and again here's the K case mercury
country<00:04:54.910> side<00:04:55.910> by<00:04:55.940> side<00:04:56.360> tempo<00:04:57.260> is<00:04:57.320> exactly

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
country side by side tempo is exactly

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.510 
country side by side tempo is exactly
the<00:04:57.920> same<00:04:58.100> but<00:04:58.250> I<00:04:58.310> really<00:04:58.610> like<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.020> rally

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
the same but I really like this rally

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.080 
the same but I really like this rally
racing<00:05:01.520> tempos<00:05:03.520> it's<00:05:04.520> really<00:05:04.730> cool<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.060> see

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
racing tempos it's really cool to see

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.000 
racing tempos it's really cool to see
what<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.690> exact<00:05:05.960> same<00:05:06.230> car<00:05:06.470> would<00:05:06.650> look<00:05:06.860> like

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
what the exact same car would look like

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.040 
what the exact same car would look like
with<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:07.340> exact<00:05:07.640> same<00:05:07.850> tempo<00:05:08.300> same<00:05:08.600> racing

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
with the exact same tempo same racing

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.110 
with the exact same tempo same racing
car<00:05:10.090> different<00:05:11.090> color<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.700> wheels<00:05:13.910> are

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
car different color and the wheels are

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.620 
car different color and the wheels are
actually<00:05:14.540> different<00:05:14.750> on<00:05:15.080> each<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:16.010> these<00:05:16.630> it's

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
actually different on each of these it's

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.060 
actually different on each of these it's
really<00:05:17.840> hard<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.110> see<00:05:18.230> on<00:05:18.260> camera<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:18.860> there's

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
really hard to see on camera but there's

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.440 
really hard to see on camera but there's
a<00:05:19.130> lot<00:05:19.250> of<00:05:19.280> nice<00:05:19.520> detailing<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:21.620> recess

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
a lot of nice detailing and this recess

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.860 
a lot of nice detailing and this recess
part<00:05:23.450> of<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.660> wheel

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
part of the wheel

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.930 
part of the wheel
whereas<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.800> is<00:05:26.860> kind<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.280> less<00:05:27.430> standard

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
whereas this is kind of less standard

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.160 
whereas this is kind of less standard
but<00:05:28.390> there's<00:05:28.570> still<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.780> little<00:05:28.990> bit<00:05:29.080> of

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
but there's still a little bit of

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.060 
but there's still a little bit of
detailing<00:05:29.530> going<00:05:29.830> on<00:05:31.590> interesting<00:05:32.590> these

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
detailing going on interesting these

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:37.490 
detailing going on interesting these
wheels<00:05:33.370> are<00:05:33.580> exactly<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.210> same

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.810 

Roadrunner<00:05:38.500> wheels<00:05:40.350> exactly<00:05:41.350> the<00:05:41.470> same<00:05:44.820> these

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
Roadrunner wheels exactly the same these

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.390 
Roadrunner wheels exactly the same these
are<00:05:46.000> exactly<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.600> same

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
are exactly the same

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.300 
are exactly the same
anyway<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:49.420> only<00:05:49.840> other<00:05:50.020> unboxings<00:05:50.770> I<00:05:51.130> have

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
anyway the only other unboxings I have

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.160 
anyway the only other unboxings I have
from<00:05:51.520> this<00:05:51.640> case<00:05:52.380> of<00:05:53.380> course<00:05:53.710> are<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:55.170> the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170 
from this case of course are the the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.370 
from this case of course are the the
fantasy<00:05:56.680> lion<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.580> again<00:05:58.060> I<00:05:58.320> going<00:05:59.320> to

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
fantasy lion and again I going to

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.630 
fantasy lion and again I going to
compare<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.920> Impala<00:06:00.460> with<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:01.000> parable<00:06:02.640> as

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
compare the Impala with the parable as

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.250 
compare the Impala with the parable as
you<00:06:03.730> can<00:06:03.880> see<00:06:04.060> they<00:06:04.240> almost<00:06:04.450> are<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:05.020> exact

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
you can see they almost are the exact

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.810 
you can see they almost are the exact
same<00:06:05.290> body<00:06:05.620> type<00:06:05.770> but<00:06:06.100> I'll<00:06:06.190> get<00:06:06.340> it<00:06:06.430> more<00:06:06.610> into

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
same body type but I'll get it more into

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.840 
same body type but I'll get it more into
this<00:06:06.970> when<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.680> when<00:06:08.680> I<00:06:08.710> do<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.010> unboxing<00:06:09.160> I'm
