00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hey, youtube, I'm a public speaker. 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.410
 subject matter 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.170
 I'm here again with samsung 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.780
 galaxy tab is afraid of 10 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 today I will show something different something that 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.580
 I've already been asked I could not answer 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.820
 but now that I've done here without wanting a 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.789
 test here and I ended up even solving 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.680
 find a solution here finding the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.019
 answer to a user's question 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 once here if you can get 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.880
 here we have two sensors 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 I do not know any closeness to who 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.059
 It's the light understood then I'll show 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.870
 for you what happens for example the 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:54.320
 tap that is now lit according 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.320
 strong here mainly in automatic 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 automatic that we're going to do I go 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 I'll take place here in front 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:12.150
 near the camera and the sensor here Ã“tv 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 thing has changed and will increase the brightness there and 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:23.869
 it 's not the camera 's from the tablets or put 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 dies in front of the serve as the 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:40.939
 oo normal then the save function 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:49.729
 energy 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:52.490
 of course not very sure 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.670
 the environment is darker and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 low brightness as if it were fine 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:07.110
 Also in a dark year I'm not in the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 Your eyes are not well lit so I 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.879
 I try to light up even more so I can 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.080
 compensate for the strong light so that 's it 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.350
 folks 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.700
 this was another tip and and with the tablet 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.470
 saves energy by brightening the 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.590
 of the personal touch screen 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.880
