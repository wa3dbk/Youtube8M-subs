 stories of road accidents involving a pedestrian are on the order of

 local level since 1999 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.260
 for 9 years we have urged the center-left administrations of san

 ferdinando of puglia 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.560
 to adopt measures to moderate traffic for the protection of users

 of the defenseless polimi of the road pedestrians and cyclists 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.880
 we have presented organic proposals 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 accompanied by a timely and accurate documentation 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.110

 15 years of center-left administration 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.600
 on the topic of pedestrian safety traffic moderation 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 did not produce any appreciable results 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.619
 while the neighboring cities of trinitapoli canosa realized with the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.969
 raised pedestrian crossings 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.069

 administrative 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.959
 a political program in which among the many proposals 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.440
 there were those of traffic moderation and crossings

 led by Mayor Savior Smurfs 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:57.849

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.289
 finally accepted our proposal and realized it 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:07.999
 57 pedestrian crossings raised at most road intersections 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.019

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.430
 these are the first traffic mitigation measures for the

 pedestrian protection 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 implemented by the new municipal administration 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:33.819
 in the same period the municipality of canosa decided to build 7 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.680
 raised pedestrian crossings in addition to those of excellent workmanship 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:41.999

 the poor quality of the first 33 raised pedestrian crossings 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.559
 if compared to the good quality of those present in trinitapoli and canosa 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:57.049
 is to be considered a sin of youth remedied by the administrators 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.709
 municipal by technicians is belatedly noted in the remaining 24 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.009
 pedestrian crossings that turn out to be of good construction quality 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.999
 in the future we hope for a sequence of interventions in the road network 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.259
 small town 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.589
 which includes the creation of a zone 30 throughout the city 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.279
 narrowing of roadway 

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.590
