there<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.600> believe<00:00:49.110> sugar<00:00:49.649> cane<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.399> little

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there and I believe sugar cane a little

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
there and I believe sugar cane a little
bit<00:00:50.850> further<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.420> long<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> coast<00:00:52.250> now<00:00:53.250> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
bit further I'm not long the coast now I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
bit further I'm not long the coast now I
believe<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.719> over<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.440> general

believe if you go over in this general

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.380 
believe if you go over in this general
direction<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.280> should<00:00:56.520> not<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.699> too<00:00:57.090> far

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.499 

looks<00:01:24.460> pretty<00:01:24.609> interesting<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:25.240> like<00:01:25.359> the

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
looks pretty interesting I like the

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.419 
looks pretty interesting I like the
whole<00:01:25.659> structure<00:01:26.049> I<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:29.740> know<00:01:29.859> why<00:01:30.039> it<00:01:30.100> just

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
whole structure I don't know why it just

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:31.889 
whole structure I don't know why it just
kind<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:30.820> reminds<00:01:31.240> me<00:01:31.299> of<00:01:31.359> like<00:01:31.539> something

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
kind of reminds me of like something

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.450 
kind of reminds me of like something
like<00:01:31.990> Atlantis<00:01:32.619> would<00:01:32.799> be<00:01:32.920> like<00:01:33.100> or<00:01:33.250> something

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
or at least a tenth one Atlantis would

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:40.169 
or at least a tenth one Atlantis would
be<00:01:35.590> like<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:38.259> sure<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.799> pretty<00:01:39.729> much<00:01:39.880> know

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
I tried spawning iron golems in this

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.090 
I tried spawning iron golems in this
area<00:01:46.149> they<00:01:46.810> don't<00:01:46.929> seem<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.229> attack<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:48.009> only

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
area they don't seem to attack the only

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.620 
area they don't seem to attack the only

they might attack some of the other

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.210 
they might attack some of the other
stuff<00:01:57.619> as<00:01:57.799> well<00:01:59.290> where<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.409> this<00:02:00.530> with<00:02:00.950> there

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
stuff as well where is this with there

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.370

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
jungle temple was disappointing in my

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.920 
jungle temple was disappointing in my
opinion<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:43.940> too<00:02:44.090> easy<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.420> get<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:44.720> loot

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
opinion it's too easy to get the loot

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.949 
opinion it's too easy to get the loot
and<00:02:45.670> sometimes<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.819> loot<00:02:47.000> was<00:02:47.209> diamond<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:47.930> I

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
and sometimes the loot was diamond so I

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.960 
and sometimes the loot was diamond so I
just<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.459> just<00:02:49.489> didn't<00:02:49.819> like<00:02:49.910> that

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970
