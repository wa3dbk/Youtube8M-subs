the ace 52 there's something rewarding
about<00:00:41.170> them<00:00:41.559> they<00:00:42.010> seem<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.610> reward<00:00:42.960> accuracy

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
about them they seem to reward accuracy

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.420 
about them they seem to reward accuracy
and<00:00:44.199> if<00:00:44.290> you<00:00:44.379> get<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.680> headshots

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
and if you get the headshots

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.600 
and if you get the headshots
you<00:00:45.909> can<00:00:46.210> drop<00:00:46.600> people<00:00:47.050> fairly<00:00:47.410> quickly<00:00:47.890> now<00:00:48.579> I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
you can drop people fairly quickly now I

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.360 
you can drop people fairly quickly now I
must<00:00:49.180> admit<00:00:49.390> that<00:00:49.840> really<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.379> don't<00:00:50.620> use<00:00:51.100> these

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
must admit that really I don't use these

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.229 
must admit that really I don't use these
weapons<00:00:51.850> as<00:00:52.270> often<00:00:52.660> as<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:52.930> used<00:00:53.199> to<00:00:53.410> in

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
weapons as often as I used to in

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.150 
weapons as often as I used to in
battlefield<00:00:55.239> 3<00:00:55.390> there's<00:00:56.260> just<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:56.559> few<00:00:56.800> things

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
battlefield 3 there's just a few things

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.250 
battlefield 3 there's just a few things
about<00:00:57.460> them<00:00:57.820> that<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.059> feel<00:00:58.390> could<00:00:58.719> be<00:00:58.780> improved

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
about them that I feel could be improved

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.250 
about them that I feel could be improved
to<00:00:59.530> make<00:00:59.710> them<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.219> bit<00:01:00.760> more<00:01:00.789> viable<00:01:01.300> now<00:01:01.750> lots

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
to make them a bit more viable now lots

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.900 
to make them a bit more viable now lots
of<00:01:02.440> people<00:01:02.800> when<00:01:02.980> they<00:01:03.129> talk<00:01:03.190> about<00:01:03.579> these

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
of people when they talk about these

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.630 
of people when they talk about these
sorts<00:01:04.300> of<00:01:04.360> LMGs<00:01:04.869> they<00:01:05.199> say<00:01:05.440> that<00:01:05.710> it's<00:01:06.399> the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
sorts of LMGs they say that it's the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.669 
sorts of LMGs they say that it's the
accuracy<00:01:07.360> that's<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.780> issue<00:01:07.929> with<00:01:08.259> them<00:01:08.470> and

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
accuracy that's the issue with them and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.279 
accuracy that's the issue with them and
it<00:01:08.770> is<00:01:09.039> if<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.970> strafe<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.539> lot<00:01:10.690> while<00:01:10.869> shooting

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
it is if you strafe a lot while shooting

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:13.320 
it is if you strafe a lot while shooting
which<00:01:11.500> by<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:11.950> way<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.190> actually<00:01:12.490> do<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:12.940> have<00:01:13.179> to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
which by the way I actually do I have to

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.090 
which by the way I actually do I have to
admit<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:13.780> can<00:01:13.960> see<00:01:14.170> me<00:01:14.320> I'm<00:01:14.410> about<00:01:14.649> to<00:01:14.860> do<00:01:15.009> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
admit you can see me I'm about to do it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.490 
admit you can see me I'm about to do it
here<00:01:15.310> strafing<00:01:16.210> all<00:01:16.360> over<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:16.780> place<00:01:16.990> but<00:01:17.320> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
here strafing all over the place but the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.680 
here strafing all over the place but the
actual<00:01:17.830> truth<00:01:18.100> is<00:01:18.429> if<00:01:18.910> you<00:01:19.090> can<00:01:19.360> remain

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
actual truth is if you can remain

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.480 
actual truth is if you can remain
stationary<00:01:20.470> while<00:01:20.830> shooting<00:01:21.130> one<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:21.399> these

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
stationary while shooting one of these

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.330 
stationary while shooting one of these
big<00:01:21.819> LMGs<00:01:22.450> it's<00:01:23.050> actually<00:01:23.470> just<00:01:23.860> as<00:01:24.099> accurate

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
big LMGs it's actually just as accurate

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.859 
big LMGs it's actually just as accurate
as<00:01:24.849> a<00:01:24.880> carbine<00:01:25.539> so<00:01:26.250> acw-r<00:01:27.420> ak5c<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.780> be

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
as a carbine so acw-r ak5c you can be

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.710 
as a carbine so acw-r ak5c you can be
just<00:01:29.050> as<00:01:29.170> accurate<00:01:29.649> with<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.890> bloody<00:01:30.099> m60<00:01:31.060> but

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
just as accurate with a bloody m60 but

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.690 
just as accurate with a bloody m60 but
know<00:01:32.440> what<00:01:32.619> I<00:01:32.649> think<00:01:32.860> one<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.130> problems<00:01:33.280> I

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
know what I think one of the problems I

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.449 
know what I think one of the problems I
have<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.720> lack<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:34.929> extended<00:01:35.830> magazine

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
have is the lack of extended magazine

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.389 
have is the lack of extended magazine
battlefield<00:01:37.119> 4<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:37.989> was<00:01:38.200> such<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> big<00:01:38.860> thing<00:01:38.890> to

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
battlefield 4 it was such a big thing to

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.120 
battlefield 4 it was such a big thing to
be<00:01:39.489> able<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.759> run<00:01:39.940> around<00:01:40.149> with<00:01:40.770> 200<00:01:41.770> bullets

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
be able to run around with 200 bullets

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.249 
be able to run around with 200 bullets
and<00:01:42.459> I<00:01:42.580> know<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.789> hundred<00:01:43.119> bullets<00:01:43.509> is<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.899> lot

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
and I know a hundred bullets is a lot

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.680 
and I know a hundred bullets is a lot
but<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:45.310> can<00:01:45.489> get<00:01:45.700> through<00:01:45.940> them<00:01:46.209> really

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
but you can get through them really

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.630 
but you can get through them really
rather<00:01:47.080> quickly<00:01:47.530> if<00:01:47.830> you're<00:01:48.039> using<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.610> to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
rather quickly if you're using it to

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.540 
rather quickly if you're using it to
suppress<00:01:49.239> an<00:01:49.420> enemy<00:01:49.810> or<00:01:50.619> just<00:01:50.860> ping<00:01:51.069> down<00:01:51.280> an

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
suppress an enemy or just ping down an

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.520 
suppress an enemy or just ping down an
area<00:01:51.759> like<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.239> just<00:01:52.539> was<00:01:52.720> there<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.289> stop

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
area like I just was there to stop

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.320 
area like I just was there to stop
people<00:01:53.679> peeking<00:01:54.310> out<00:01:54.429> but<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.119> thing<00:01:55.270> is

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
people peeking out but the thing is

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.960 
people peeking out but the thing is
right<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.380> reloads<00:01:56.920> on<00:01:57.160> some<00:01:57.369> of<00:01:57.489> these<00:01:57.580> guns

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
right the reloads on some of these guns

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.389 
right the reloads on some of these guns
are<00:01:58.360> so<00:01:58.629> bloody<00:01:59.050> long<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.800> give<00:01:59.950> you<00:02:00.039> an<00:02:00.190> idea

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
are so bloody long to give you an idea

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.080 
are so bloody long to give you an idea
on<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.110> m62<00:02:02.110> reload<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.800> thing<00:02:03.220> is<00:02:03.399> nearly<00:02:03.849> 8

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
on the m62 reload that thing is nearly 8

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.499 
on the m62 reload that thing is nearly 8
seconds<00:02:04.840> 8<00:02:05.229> seconds<00:02:05.920> it's<00:02:06.190> absolutely<00:02:06.970> mental

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
seconds 8 seconds it's absolutely mental

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.510 
seconds 8 seconds it's absolutely mental
and<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:08.080> course<00:02:08.289> on<00:02:08.470> these<00:02:08.590> LMGs<00:02:09.129> there's<00:02:09.369> no

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
and of course on these LMGs there's no

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.570 
and of course on these LMGs there's no
quick<00:02:09.849> reload<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.750> just<00:02:11.050> is<00:02:11.260> one<00:02:11.770> reload<00:02:12.280> time

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
quick reload it just is one reload time

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.869 
quick reload it just is one reload time
for<00:02:13.300> pkp<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.260> reload<00:02:14.620> time<00:02:14.650> isn't<00:02:15.069> too<00:02:15.340> bad<00:02:15.610> at

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
for pkp the reload time isn't too bad at

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.890 
for pkp the reload time isn't too bad at
five<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> half<00:02:16.390> seconds<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.770> 240<00:02:18.370> Bravo

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
five and a half seconds and a 240 Bravo

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.720 
five and a half seconds and a 240 Bravo
6.2<00:02:19.900> seconds<00:02:20.470> so<00:02:21.220> there<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.520> are

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
6.2 seconds so there we are

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.580 
6.2 seconds so there we are
and<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.480> going<00:02:22.660> through<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.900> rates<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.439> fire

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
and just going through the rates of fire

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.420 
and just going through the rates of fire
600<00:02:24.340> rounds<00:02:24.459> per<00:02:24.730> minute<00:02:24.849> pkp<00:02:26.310> 507

600 rounds per minute pkp 507
rounds<00:02:27.790> per<00:02:28.000> minute<00:02:28.239> for<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.420> m60<00:02:29.109> and<00:02:29.730> 650

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
rounds per minute for the m60 and 650

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.119 
rounds per minute for the m60 and 650
for<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.269> 240<00:02:31.900> Bravo<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.500> feel<00:02:32.829> like<00:02:32.980> at<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.099> end

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
for the 240 Bravo I feel like at the end

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.160 
for the 240 Bravo I feel like at the end
of<00:02:33.310> 60<00:02:33.640> kind<00:02:33.969> of<00:02:34.120> got<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> bad<00:02:34.510> deal<00:02:34.810> in<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
of 60 kind of got a bad deal in the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.869 
of 60 kind of got a bad deal in the
balancing<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.799> these<00:02:35.950> weapons<00:02:36.159> it's<00:02:36.640> got<00:02:36.760> the

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
balancing of these weapons it's got the

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.390 
balancing of these weapons it's got the
lowest<00:02:37.569> rate<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> fire<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.620> it's<00:02:39.010> got<00:02:39.219> the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
lowest rate of fire and it's got the

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.759 
lowest rate of fire and it's got the
longest<00:02:39.879> reload<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.780> mean<00:02:40.930> what<00:02:41.079> really<00:02:41.439> is

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
longest reload I mean what really is

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.369 
longest reload I mean what really is
going<00:02:42.159> for<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.549> it's<00:02:42.700> even<00:02:43.120> got<00:02:43.359> solve<00:02:43.750> fairly

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
going for it it's even got solve fairly

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.289 
going for it it's even got solve fairly
high<00:02:44.739> recoil<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.459> got<00:02:45.579> more<00:02:45.760> vertical

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
high recoil it's got more vertical

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.440 
high recoil it's got more vertical
recoil<00:02:46.540> than<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.409> pkp<00:02:48.099> I<00:02:48.400> suppose<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.269> one

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
recoil than the pkp I suppose the one

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.509 
recoil than the pkp I suppose the one
thing<00:02:49.659> about<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.079> m60<00:02:50.680> though<00:02:50.829> is<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.250> it

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
thing about the m60 though is like it

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.030 
thing about the m60 though is like it
basically<00:02:52.420> isn't<00:02:52.719> the<00:02:53.230> better<00:02:53.409> of<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.889> three

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
basically isn't the better of the three

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.640 
basically isn't the better of the three
weapons<00:02:54.310> but<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.049> struggle<00:02:56.469> with

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
weapons but if you do struggle with

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.220 
weapons but if you do struggle with
accuracy<00:02:57.400> or<00:02:57.670> keeping<00:02:58.090> shots<00:02:58.389> on<00:02:58.599> target

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
accuracy or keeping shots on target

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.740 
accuracy or keeping shots on target
probably<00:02:59.859> the<00:02:59.980> m60<00:03:00.639> is<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.909> one<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.299> go<00:03:01.480> for

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
probably the m60 is the one to go for

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.479 
probably the m60 is the one to go for
because<00:03:02.109> that<00:03:02.200> lower<00:03:02.530> rate<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.799> fire<00:03:02.980> does

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
because that lower rate of fire does

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.030 
because that lower rate of fire does
mean<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:03.939> it<00:03:04.120> does<00:03:04.510> feel<00:03:04.720> easier<00:03:05.379> to<00:03:05.799> keep<00:03:05.980> your

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
mean it it does feel easier to keep your

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.339 
mean it it does feel easier to keep your
crosshair<00:03:06.760> over<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.269> enemy<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.200> way<00:03:08.319> I

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
crosshair over your enemy so the way I

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.649 
crosshair over your enemy so the way I
solved<00:03:08.829> like<00:03:08.980> running<00:03:09.459> these<00:03:09.609> LM<00:03:09.970> G's<00:03:10.209> if<00:03:10.510> and

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
solved like running these LM G's if and

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.770 
solved like running these LM G's if and
when<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.900> use<00:03:11.379> some<00:03:11.409> is<00:03:11.859> stubby<00:03:12.700> or<00:03:12.939> ergo

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
when I do use some is stubby or ergo

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.300 
when I do use some is stubby or ergo
grip<00:03:14.079> now<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.680> first<00:03:14.980> shot<00:03:15.159> recoil

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
grip now the first shot recoil

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.789 
grip now the first shot recoil
multiplier<00:03:15.639> is<00:03:16.329> low<00:03:16.689> but<00:03:17.319> they<00:03:17.439> sort<00:03:17.769> of

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
multiplier is low but they sort of

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.830 
multiplier is low but they sort of
having<00:03:18.099> said<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.389> vertical

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
having said that because the vertical

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.869 
having said that because the vertical
recoil<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.409> recoil<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:20.950> general<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.549> quite

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
recoil in the recoil in general is quite

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.869 
recoil in the recoil in general is quite
high<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.810> might<00:03:23.019> be<00:03:23.200> a<00:03:23.230> factor<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.829> consider

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
high that might be a factor to consider

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.610 
high that might be a factor to consider
but<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.000> reason<00:03:25.359> I<00:03:25.419> like<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.810> stubby<00:03:26.230> grip<00:03:26.260> is

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
but the reason I like the stubby grip is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.860 
but the reason I like the stubby grip is
just<00:03:26.919> like<00:03:27.189> the<00:03:27.669> suppressive<00:03:28.090> nature<00:03:28.629> if<00:03:28.750> I'm

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
just like the suppressive nature if I'm

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.720 
just like the suppressive nature if I'm
going<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.079> go<00:03:29.230> sort<00:03:29.530> of<00:03:29.650> full<00:03:29.859> auto<00:03:30.129> with<00:03:30.400> these

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
going to go sort of full auto with these

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.809 
going to go sort of full auto with these
big<00:03:31.000> LMGs<00:03:31.690> then<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.769> stubby<00:03:33.280> grip<00:03:33.310> will<00:03:33.669> help

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
big LMGs then the stubby grip will help

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.460 
big LMGs then the stubby grip will help
keep<00:03:33.970> your<00:03:34.150> bullets<00:03:34.419> on<00:03:34.599> target<00:03:35.109> if<00:03:35.199> someone's

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
keep your bullets on target if someone's

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.349 
keep your bullets on target if someone's
gonna<00:03:35.590> peek<00:03:35.949> out<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.609> recently<00:03:37.120> like<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
gonna peek out and recently like the

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.240 
gonna peek out and recently like the
ergo<00:03:37.690> grip<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.079> as<00:03:38.169> you<00:03:38.319> can<00:03:38.470> see<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:38.769> ID

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
ergo grip it's as you can see I ID

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.610 
ergo grip it's as you can see I ID
straight<00:03:39.849> for<00:03:40.120> fair<00:03:40.389> bit<00:03:40.659> while<00:03:41.199> I'm<00:03:41.349> shooting

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
straight for fair bit while I'm shooting

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.099 
straight for fair bit while I'm shooting
and<00:03:42.129> these<00:03:42.579> weapons<00:03:43.090> as<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.510> said<00:03:43.659> earlier<00:03:43.989> they

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
and these weapons as I said earlier they

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.349 
and these weapons as I said earlier they
don't<00:03:44.319> have<00:03:44.409> the<00:03:44.560> best<00:03:44.769> accuracy<00:03:45.370> if<00:03:45.879> you're

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
don't have the best accuracy if you're

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.330 
don't have the best accuracy if you're
strafing<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.959> shooting<00:03:47.379> anyway<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.040> ergo

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
strafing and shooting anyway so the ergo

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.399 
strafing and shooting anyway so the ergo
grip<00:03:48.579> can<00:03:48.760> help<00:03:49.000> solve<00:03:49.299> bring<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.079> down<00:03:50.379> a

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
grip can help solve bring that down a

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.259 
grip can help solve bring that down a
little<00:03:50.620> bit<00:03:50.979> and<00:03:51.159> work<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.639> in<00:03:51.760> your<00:03:51.970> favor

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
little bit and work it in your favor

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.559 
little bit and work it in your favor
with<00:03:53.109> regards<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.620> barrel<00:03:54.159> attachments<00:03:54.819> you

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
with regards to barrel attachments you

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.839 
with regards to barrel attachments you
guys<00:03:55.840> know<00:03:56.560> by<00:03:56.859> now<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.069> I<00:03:57.310> never<00:03:57.400> really

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
guys know by now that I never really

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.909 
guys know by now that I never really
recommend<00:03:58.389> a<00:03:58.479> muzzle<00:03:58.840> brake<00:03:58.870> or<00:03:59.229> compensator

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
recommend a muzzle brake or compensator

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.920 
recommend a muzzle brake or compensator
for<00:04:00.040> very<00:04:00.400> much<00:04:00.699> but<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.389> think<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.750> they're

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
for very much but I think that they're

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.229 
for very much but I think that they're
fair<00:04:02.259> options<00:04:02.799> on<00:04:03.009> these<00:04:03.220> big<00:04:03.489> LMGs

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
fair options on these big LMGs

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.499 
fair options on these big LMGs
particularly<00:04:04.989> on<00:04:05.139> console<00:04:05.799> and<00:04:06.040> if<00:04:06.909> you<00:04:07.299> are

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:07.509 
particularly on console and if you are

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.539 
particularly on console and if you are
sort<00:04:07.840> at<00:04:08.199> firing<00:04:08.650> or<00:04:08.769> burst<00:04:09.009> wrong<00:04:09.310> then

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
sort at firing or burst wrong then

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.819 
sort at firing or burst wrong then
they're<00:04:09.759> even<00:04:10.030> more<00:04:10.419> of<00:04:10.750> an<00:04:10.870> option<00:04:11.319> because

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
they're even more of an option because

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.030 
they're even more of an option because
they<00:04:12.189> won't<00:04:12.370> come<00:04:12.669> into<00:04:12.879> effect<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:14.040> increase

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
they won't come into effect and increase

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.949 
they won't come into effect and increase
your<00:04:15.069> spread<00:04:15.639> or<00:04:15.879> decrease<00:04:16.329> your<00:04:16.479> accuracy

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
your spread or decrease your accuracy

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.170 
your spread or decrease your accuracy
however<00:04:17.139> you<00:04:17.409> want<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.650> look<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.459> actually

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
however you want to look here I actually

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.539 
however you want to look here I actually
think<00:04:19.750> though<00:04:19.989> another<00:04:20.560> option<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.250> this<00:04:21.400> is

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
think though another option and this is

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.029 
think though another option and this is
a<00:04:21.579> bit<00:04:21.820> way<00:04:22.000> out<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:22.509> is<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:23.139> suppressor<00:04:23.800> and

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
a bit way out there is a suppressor and

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.950 
a bit way out there is a suppressor and
the<00:04:24.669> reason<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.180> actually<00:04:25.389> think<00:04:25.750> that's<00:04:25.840> a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
the reason I actually think that's a

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.570 
the reason I actually think that's a
good<00:04:26.110> option<00:04:26.229> even<00:04:26.530> though<00:04:26.800> I'm<00:04:26.889> not<00:04:27.039> using<00:04:27.280> it

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
good option even though I'm not using it

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.390 
good option even though I'm not using it
in<00:04:27.669> this<00:04:27.820> gameplay<00:04:28.180> is<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:29.650> with<00:04:30.250> the

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
in this gameplay is that with the

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.360 
in this gameplay is that with the
reloads<00:04:30.849> being<00:04:31.449> so<00:04:31.900> long<00:04:32.199> it<00:04:32.740> can<00:04:32.949> give<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.340> a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
reloads being so long it can give you a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.000 
reloads being so long it can give you a
bit<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.669> time<00:04:33.970> if<00:04:34.419> if<00:04:34.810> enemies<00:04:35.560> don't<00:04:35.830> know

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
bit of time if if enemies don't know

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.409 
bit of time if if enemies don't know
where<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.310> are<00:04:36.340> you're<00:04:36.700> not<00:04:36.820> appearing<00:04:37.300> on

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
where you are you're not appearing on

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.659 
where you are you're not appearing on
the<00:04:37.539> mini-map<00:04:37.930> just<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.680> get<00:04:38.950> yourself<00:04:39.400> in<00:04:39.550> a

the mini-map just to get yourself in a

the mini-map just to get yourself in a
little

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
little

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.350 
little
and<00:04:40.590> reload<00:04:41.219> because<00:04:41.460> let's<00:04:41.789> face<00:04:41.879> it<00:04:42.030> when

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
and reload because let's face it when

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.820 
and reload because let's face it when
you're<00:04:42.509> going<00:04:42.719> through<00:04:43.080> these<00:04:43.259> massive

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
you're going through these massive

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.100 
you're going through these massive
reloads<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.939> do<00:04:45.090> need<00:04:45.270> to<00:04:45.449> literally<00:04:45.780> hide

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
reloads you do need to literally hide

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.559 
reloads you do need to literally hide
away<00:04:46.379> somewhere<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:47.280> reload<00:04:47.729> all<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.419> way<00:04:48.479> on

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
away somewhere to reload all the way on

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.170 
away somewhere to reload all the way on
the<00:04:48.719> screen<00:04:49.050> now<00:04:49.319> this<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.400> writing<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:50.849> start

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
the screen now this is writing the start

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
the screen now this is writing the start
of<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.389> round<00:04:51.749> of<00:04:52.020> chain<00:04:52.319> link<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.740> I'm<00:04:53.099> the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
of a round of chain link and I'm the

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.589 
of a round of chain link and I'm the
only<00:04:53.580> one<00:04:53.819> on<00:04:53.849> my<00:04:54.150> team

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
only one on my team

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.269 
only one on my team
I've<00:04:54.659> ran<00:04:54.900> all<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.319> way<00:04:55.469> up<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.770> sides<00:04:56.009> of<00:04:56.189> the

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:56.279 
I've ran all the way up the sides of the

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:58.189 
I've ran all the way up the sides of the
map<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.849> get<00:04:56.969> the<00:04:57.090> back<00:04:57.330> flank<00:04:57.719> on<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.139> I

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
map to get the back flank on and I

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.899 
map to get the back flank on and I
really<00:04:58.499> recommend<00:04:58.979> you<00:04:59.069> doing<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.580> what<00:04:59.849> I

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
really recommend you doing this what I

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.089 
really recommend you doing this what I
see<00:05:00.090> on<00:05:00.180> chain<00:05:00.449> link<00:05:00.749> a<00:05:00.960> lot<00:05:01.409> of<00:05:01.469> the<00:05:01.620> time<00:05:01.860> is

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
see on chain link a lot of the time is

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.429 
see on chain link a lot of the time is
people<00:05:02.490> just<00:05:02.939> run<00:05:03.180> towards<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.810> first<00:05:04.050> flag

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:04.439 
people just run towards the first flag

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.800 
people just run towards the first flag
but<00:05:05.159> there's<00:05:05.669> always<00:05:05.789> plenty<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.449> your<00:05:06.599> team

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
but there's always plenty of your team

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.360 
but there's always plenty of your team
members<00:05:07.199> there<00:05:07.379> capping<00:05:07.800> it<00:05:07.889> you<00:05:07.979> don't<00:05:08.219> you

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
members there capping it you don't you

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.709 
members there capping it you don't you
don't<00:05:08.490> really<00:05:08.789> need<00:05:08.909> to<00:05:09.120> be<00:05:09.270> there<00:05:09.539> yourself

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
don't really need to be there yourself

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.839 
don't really need to be there yourself
if<00:05:10.439> you<00:05:10.650> can<00:05:10.830> get<00:05:11.039> yourself<00:05:11.129> all<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.699> way<00:05:11.729> at

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
if you can get yourself all the way at

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.790 
if you can get yourself all the way at
the<00:05:11.939> side<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.539> map<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.990> get<00:05:13.139> a<00:05:13.169> back<00:05:13.469> flank

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
the side of the map and get a back flank

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.619 
the side of the map and get a back flank
on<00:05:14.039> actually<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:14.789> can<00:05:14.939> do<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.150> bit<00:05:15.389> for<00:05:15.569> your

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
on actually you can do a bit for your

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.290 
on actually you can do a bit for your
team<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.229> create<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:16.860> bit<00:05:17.129> of<00:05:17.219> disturbance<00:05:17.969> in

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
team and create a bit of disturbance in

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.610 
team and create a bit of disturbance in
the<00:05:18.419> enemy<00:05:18.779> team<00:05:19.050> because<00:05:19.319> they're<00:05:19.439> not

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
the enemy team because they're not

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.890 
the enemy team because they're not
expecting<00:05:20.189> you<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.340> be<00:05:20.639> there<00:05:20.879> so<00:05:21.569> those<00:05:21.689> are

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
expecting you to be there so those are

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.570 
expecting you to be there so those are
really<00:05:22.020> my<00:05:22.259> thoughts<00:05:22.650> on<00:05:23.039> these<00:05:23.279> free

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
really my thoughts on these free

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.209 
really my thoughts on these free
heavy-hitting<00:05:24.300> LMGs<00:05:24.930> in<00:05:25.229> battlefield<00:05:25.949> 4

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
heavy-hitting LMGs in battlefield 4

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.580 
heavy-hitting LMGs in battlefield 4
I<00:05:26.400> suppose<00:05:26.879> ultimately<00:05:27.479> I<00:05:27.840> probably<00:05:28.349> would

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
I suppose ultimately I probably would

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.790 
I suppose ultimately I probably would
rather<00:05:28.620> run<00:05:29.219> with<00:05:29.460> the<00:05:29.610> mg<00:05:30.000> 4<00:05:30.270> or<00:05:30.539> the<00:05:30.750> m249<00:05:31.560> I

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
rather run with the mg 4 or the m249 I

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.029 
rather run with the mg 4 or the m249 I
mean<00:05:32.129> me<00:05:32.819> and<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.120> mg<00:05:33.449> 4<00:05:33.779> have<00:05:34.229> got<00:05:34.560> a<00:05:34.589> lot<00:05:35.009> of

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
mean me and the mg 4 have got a lot of

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:37.010 
mean me and the mg 4 have got a lot of
kills<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.610> mowed<00:05:35.849> down<00:05:35.879> a<00:05:36.360> lot<00:05:36.539> of<00:05:36.659> enemies

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
kills and mowed down a lot of enemies

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.679 
kills and mowed down a lot of enemies
throughout<00:05:37.529> battlefield<00:05:38.129> 4<00:05:38.430> these<00:05:39.180> weapons

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:39.689 
throughout battlefield 4 these weapons

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.929 
throughout battlefield 4 these weapons
they're<00:05:39.839> okay<00:05:40.259> by<00:05:40.620> thinking<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.400> spring

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
they're okay by thinking the spring

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.059 
they're okay by thinking the spring
weapon<00:05:42.419> balancing<00:05:42.990> patch<00:05:43.229> they<00:05:43.740> could<00:05:43.919> do

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:44.069 
weapon balancing patch they could do

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.589 
weapon balancing patch they could do
with<00:05:44.189> a<00:05:44.310> bit<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.580> tweaking<00:05:44.789> to<00:05:45.089> make<00:05:45.300> them<00:05:45.449> just

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:45.599 
with a bit of tweaking to make them just

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.899 
with a bit of tweaking to make them just
a<00:05:45.689> bit<00:05:45.900> more<00:05:46.110> viable<00:05:46.469> if<00:05:46.919> I<00:05:47.250> had<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.550> pick<00:05:47.729> one

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
a bit more viable if I had to pick one

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.029 
a bit more viable if I had to pick one
of<00:05:47.969> them<00:05:48.150> out<00:05:48.330> it's<00:05:48.509> my<00:05:48.659> favorite<00:05:49.229> probably

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
of them out it's my favorite probably

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.300 
of them out it's my favorite probably
the<00:05:50.189> peak<00:05:50.400> AP<00:05:50.909> maybe<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.689> 240<00:05:52.379> Bravo<00:05:52.409> but

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
the peak AP maybe the 240 Bravo but

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.450 
the peak AP maybe the 240 Bravo but
certainly<00:05:54.089> not<00:05:54.689> the<00:05:54.750> m60<00:05:55.500> although<00:05:55.800> sometimes

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
certainly not the m60 although sometimes

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.100 
certainly not the m60 although sometimes
is<00:05:56.639> you<00:05:56.819> could<00:05:57.000> use<00:05:57.029> a<00:05:57.360> weapon<00:05:57.839> like<00:05:57.870> that

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
is you could use a weapon like that

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.860 
is you could use a weapon like that
because<00:05:58.349> it<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.649> so<00:05:58.979> iconic<00:05:59.599> anyway<00:06:00.599> I<00:06:00.659> want<00:06:00.839> to

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
because it is so iconic anyway I want to

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.329 
because it is so iconic anyway I want to
