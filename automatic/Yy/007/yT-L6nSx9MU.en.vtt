of<00:02:23.499> my<00:02:23.650> face<00:02:23.829> at<00:02:24.040> my<00:02:24.159> brows<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.209> lashes<00:02:25.480> of

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
of my face at my brows and the lashes of

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.530 
of my face at my brows and the lashes of
lips<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:27.340> like<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.760> said<00:02:27.939> a<00:02:27.969> really<00:02:28.150> simple

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
lips it's like I said a really simple

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.509 
lips it's like I said a really simple
look<00:02:28.719> I<00:02:28.870> put<00:02:29.109> apply<00:02:29.379> lashes<00:02:29.650> off-camera<00:02:30.219> and

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
look I put apply lashes off-camera and

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.270 
look I put apply lashes off-camera and
the<00:02:31.329> glue<00:02:31.810> was<00:02:32.019> kind<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:32.290> crazy<00:02:32.500> looking<00:02:32.920> so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
the glue was kind of crazy looking so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.729 
the glue was kind of crazy looking so
that's<00:02:34.090> why<00:02:34.209> I<00:02:34.269> had<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.480> line<00:02:35.230> them<00:02:35.469> a<00:02:35.500> little

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
that's why I had to line them a little

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.770 
that's why I had to line them a little
bit<00:02:35.859> just<00:02:35.889> to<00:02:36.069> hide<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.400> lash<00:02:36.549> glue<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:37.599> lash

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
bit just to hide the lash glue the lash

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.080 
bit just to hide the lash glue the lash
line<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:38.799> this<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.099> um<00:02:39.280> Lime<00:02:39.849> Crime
