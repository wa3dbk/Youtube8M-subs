then<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.819> you<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:44.999> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.209> you<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.389> to

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:45.419 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:47.419 
then what you want to do is you want to
put<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:46.049> item<00:01:46.439> down<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.859> that<00:01:47.069> you're<00:01:47.189> named

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
put your item down in that you're named

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.989 
put your item down in that you're named
and<00:01:47.819> then<00:01:48.329> when<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.539> walk<00:01:48.689> away<00:01:48.929> you've<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
and then when you walk away you've got a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.309 
and then when you walk away you've got a
sign<00:01:50.999> that<00:01:51.029> tells<00:01:51.359> you<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.929> ponds

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
sign that tells you where your ponds

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.050 
sign that tells you where your ponds
gonna<00:01:52.499> be<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.829> imagine<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.579> there<00:01:53.939> was<00:01:54.029> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
gonna be so imagine that there was a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.149 
gonna be so imagine that there was a
path<00:01:54.359> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.169> side<00:01:55.349> of<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.950> was

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
path on the side of it and this was

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.550 
path on the side of it and this was
telling<00:01:56.369> me<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.669> a<00:01:56.759> pond<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.560> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
telling me to go to a pond and then that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.209 
telling me to go to a pond and then that
works<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.069> that<00:01:59.959> now<00:02:00.959> this<00:02:01.739> is<00:02:01.889> really<00:02:02.039> cool

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
works like that now this is really cool

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.319 
works like that now this is really cool
to<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.459> because<00:02:02.639> you<00:02:02.759> could<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:02.999> with<00:02:03.090> so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to do because you could do it with so

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.120 
to do because you could do it with so
many<00:02:03.539> different<00:02:03.719> items<00:02:03.989> there<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.499> I've<00:02:04.950> got

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
many different items there like I've got

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.260 
many different items there like I've got
a<00:02:05.159> few<00:02:05.459> of<00:02:05.609> my<00:02:05.639> uh<00:02:06.299> hot<00:02:07.139> bar<00:02:07.349> right<00:02:07.529> there<00:02:07.679> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
a few of my uh hot bar right there and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.090 
a few of my uh hot bar right there and
it's<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.660> cool<00:02:09.930> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.590> world<00:02:10.740> like

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it's really cool to do in a world like

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's really cool to do in a world like
just<00:02:11.910> having<00:02:12.150> no<00:02:12.720> labeled<00:02:13.320> oil<00:02:13.590> frames

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
just having no labeled oil frames

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.390 
just having no labeled oil frames
is<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:14.670> cool<00:02:15.170> but<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.829> isn't<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.250> only

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
is really cool but this isn't the only

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.539 
is really cool but this isn't the only
thing<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.180> do<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:19.290> old<00:02:19.439> frame<00:02:19.739> sign

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
thing you can do with the old frame sign

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.179 
thing you can do with the old frame sign
things<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.480> I'll<00:02:21.750> show<00:02:22.049> you<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.349> us<00:02:22.500> but

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
things so I'll show you the of us but

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.369 
things so I'll show you the of us but
just<00:02:23.430> before<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.760> do<00:02:23.970> there<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.810> bug

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
just before I do there is a little bug

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.259 
just before I do there is a little bug
I<00:02:25.409> think<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:25.860> cuz<00:02:26.159> it's<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.939> snapshot

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
I think it's cuz it's in this snapshot

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.440 
I think it's cuz it's in this snapshot
and<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.689> not<00:02:27.840> really<00:02:28.349> been<00:02:29.030> kinked<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.180> yet

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and it's not really been kinked out yet

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.899 
and it's not really been kinked out yet
when<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.680> place<00:02:31.950> another<00:02:32.280> item<00:02:32.519> frame

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
when you do place another item frame

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.750 
when you do place another item frame
down<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.599> does<00:02:33.989> delete<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.799> text<00:02:35.069> but<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> do

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
down it does delete the text but I do

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.289 
down it does delete the text but I do
think<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.390> bug<00:02:36.629> so<00:02:37.409> when<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:39.120> the

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
think that's a bug so when you when the

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.509 
think that's a bug so when you when the
full<00:02:39.720> 1.7<00:02:40.109> comes<00:02:40.709> out<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.129> think<00:02:41.280> I'll<00:02:41.459> be

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
full 1.7 comes out that I think I'll be

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.539 
full 1.7 comes out that I think I'll be
fixed<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.180> this<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.019> just<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.349> little<00:02:43.590> head

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
fixed so this is just a little head

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.059 
fixed so this is just a little head
start<00:02:44.700> warm-up<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.989> get<00:02:46.319> used<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> but

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
start warm-up for you to get used to but

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.699 
start warm-up for you to get used to but
I'll<00:02:47.250> cut<00:02:47.579> straight<00:02:47.849> across<00:02:47.909> now<00:02:48.359> to<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
I'll cut straight across now to the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
I'll cut straight across now to the
other<00:02:50.040> item<00:02:50.639> things<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.269> can<00:02:51.420> do<00:02:51.569> these

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
other item things you can do these

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.119 
other item things you can do these
aren't<00:02:51.989> all<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.260> ones<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.709> do<00:02:52.829> there<00:02:53.010> are

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
aren't all the ones you can do there are

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.649 
aren't all the ones you can do there are
many<00:02:53.159> more<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.609> these<00:02:53.970> are<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.359> ones<00:02:54.450> are

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
many more of these are just the ones are

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.729 
many more of these are just the ones are
full<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.560> I'll<00:02:55.980> be<00:02:56.400> right<00:02:56.519> back<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:58.650> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
full of so I'll be right back so as you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.339 
full of so I'll be right back so as you
can<00:02:58.829> see<00:02:58.950> here<00:02:59.250> we<00:02:59.459> got<00:02:59.609> a<00:02:59.670> little<00:03:00.540> fern<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.139> a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
can see here we got a little fern and a

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.470 
can see here we got a little fern and a
fire<00:03:01.650> moving<00:03:02.310> in<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.430> background<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.120> I've

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
fire moving in the background and I've

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.839 
fire moving in the background and I've
renamed<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.620> little<00:03:04.859> fern<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.250> forest<00:03:05.639> fire

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
renamed the little fern to forest fire

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.429 
renamed the little fern to forest fire
so<00:03:06.120> maybe<00:03:06.329> if<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.569> had<00:03:06.659> like<00:03:06.840> an<00:03:06.989> adventure

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
so maybe if you had like an adventure

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.940 
so maybe if you had like an adventure
map<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:08.370> could<00:03:08.609> have<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.510> locating<00:03:10.319> to<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
map you could have this locating to a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.069 
map you could have this locating to a
forest<00:03:11.700> fire<00:03:11.879> in<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.180> map<00:03:12.299> maybe<00:03:12.689> that<00:03:12.900> would

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
forest fire in your map maybe that would

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.479 
forest fire in your map maybe that would
be<00:03:13.109> relevant<00:03:13.709> to<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:14.010> storyline<00:03:14.340> or

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
be relevant to the storyline or

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.369 
be relevant to the storyline or
something<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.629> you<00:03:15.780> can<00:03:15.930> name<00:03:16.079> that<00:03:16.109> to

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
something but you can name that to

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.050 
something but you can name that to
whatever<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.739> wanted<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.340> maybe<00:03:17.819> like

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
whatever you wanted so maybe like

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.689 
whatever you wanted so maybe like
burning<00:03:18.480> trees<00:03:18.750> branch<00:03:19.109> or<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.579> want

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
burning trees branch or just if you want

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.449 
burning trees branch or just if you want
to<00:03:20.819> get<00:03:20.940> into<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.500> but<00:03:22.500> that's<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
to get into it but that's that one and

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.720 
to get into it but that's that one and
onto<00:03:23.849> the<00:03:23.910> next<00:03:24.090> one<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:26.069> as<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.549> see

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
onto the next one so as you can see

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400 
onto the next one so as you can see
again<00:03:26.849> in<00:03:27.150> front<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.449> you<00:03:27.540> there's<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.870> jail

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
again in front of you there's a jail

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.020 
again in front of you there's a jail
sign<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.069> this<00:03:29.160> one<00:03:29.340> works<00:03:29.579> really<00:03:29.819> well

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
sign and this one works really well

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.420 
sign and this one works really well
because<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.599> just<00:03:30.959> iron<00:03:31.260> bars<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.859> a<00:03:31.949> player

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
because it's just iron bars and a player

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.390 
because it's just iron bars and a player
head<00:03:32.669> and<00:03:33.079> so<00:03:34.079> and<00:03:34.620> if<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.829> rename<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.280> head

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
head and so and if you rename the head

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.039 
head and so and if you rename the head
to<00:03:35.549> jail<00:03:35.790> this<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.299> effect<00:03:36.569> again<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
to jail this is the effect again it

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.509 
to jail this is the effect again it
works<00:03:37.709> really<00:03:37.980> well<00:03:38.129> because<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.400> actually

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
works really well because it actually

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.460 
works really well because it actually
doesn't<00:03:38.879> look<00:03:38.909> kind<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.299> like<00:03:39.389> a<00:03:39.419> jail<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.409> you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
doesn't look kind of like a jail so you

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.349 
doesn't look kind of like a jail so you
could<00:03:40.980> use<00:03:41.159> that<00:03:41.190> one<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.699> an<00:03:41.760> adventure<00:03:42.150> map

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
could use that one in an adventure map

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.509 
could use that one in an adventure map
or<00:03:42.629> on<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.919> server<00:03:43.919> where<00:03:44.190> you've<00:03:44.280> got<00:03:44.430> an

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
or on a server where you've got an

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.640 
or on a server where you've got an
actual<00:03:44.879> jail<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.690> someone's<00:03:45.989> grief<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.500> or

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
actual jail for someone's grief in or

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.530 
actual jail for someone's grief in or
something<00:03:46.919> like<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.180> cool<00:03:48.389> one

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
something like that so that's a cool one

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.020 
something like that so that's a cool one
to<00:03:48.720> use<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.139> well<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:50.609> right<00:03:50.760> back<00:03:50.909> with

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
to use as well and be right back with

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.180 
to use as well and be right back with
the<00:03:51.090> next<00:03:51.269> one<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:52.500> final<00:03:52.680> one<00:03:52.919> for<00:03:53.099> this

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190
