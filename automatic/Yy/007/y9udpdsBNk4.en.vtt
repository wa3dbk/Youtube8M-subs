springform pans when you're doing food
photography<00:01:10.799> everything<00:01:12.500> should<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.619> small

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
photography everything should be small

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
photography everything should be small
it's<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.640> easier<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.060> photograph<00:01:15.509> little

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's way easier to photograph little

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
it's way easier to photograph little
things<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.130> lot<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.939> use

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
things it's a lot you don't have to use

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.090 
things it's a lot you don't have to use
as<00:01:18.180> much<00:01:18.330> ingredients<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.619> batch<00:01:20.070> of

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
as much ingredients like one batch of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
as much ingredients like one batch of
this<00:01:20.520> could<00:01:20.850> do<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> whole<00:01:21.360> bunch<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> stuff<00:01:21.900> if

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this could do a whole bunch of stuff if

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
this could do a whole bunch of stuff if
you<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.350> huge<00:01:22.740> springform<00:01:23.340> pan<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.970> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you have a huge springform pan like this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.649 
you have a huge springform pan like this
big<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> work<00:01:27.150> well<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
big it's not going to work well so of

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
big it's not going to work well so of
course<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.960> springform<00:01:28.470> pan<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> means

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
course the springform pan just means

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.810 
course the springform pan just means
that<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.170> pop<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
that it can pop out like that and that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.069 
that it can pop out like that and that
works<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.270> well<00:01:33.450> because<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.840> gives<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
works really well because it gives a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.510 
works really well because it gives a
really<00:01:34.320> nice<00:01:34.470> edge<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
really nice edge and you don't have to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.140 
really nice edge and you don't have to
cut<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> traditional<00:01:38.790> little

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
cut it so this is a traditional little

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
cut it so this is a traditional little
minis<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.900> think<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> four<00:01:40.560> inch

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
minis I think it's a four inch

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.480 
minis I think it's a four inch

actually recently bought this pan about

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.690 
actually recently bought this pan about
a<00:02:00.090> year<00:02:00.390> ago<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.780> I've<00:02:00.960> never<00:02:01.320> even<00:02:01.770> used<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a year ago and I've never even used it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.770 
a year ago and I've never even used it
because<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.119> love<00:02:03.990> using<00:02:04.409> silicone<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:06.360> got<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
because I love using silicone I got so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.350 
because I love using silicone I got so
excited<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.290> started<00:02:07.590> doing<00:02:07.920> them<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.610> silicon

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
excited I started doing them but silicon

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.449 
excited I started doing them but silicon
or<00:02:09.690> silicon<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.349> don't<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.129> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
or silicon I don't know it what it is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.809 
or silicon I don't know it what it is
molds<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> don't<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:12.930> use<00:02:13.200> these<00:02:13.410> like

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
molds I don't really use these like

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.690 
molds I don't really use these like
traditional<00:02:14.329> muffin<00:02:14.840> tin<00:02:15.260> pans<00:02:15.890> much<00:02:16.280> anymore

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
traditional muffin tin pans much anymore

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.470 
traditional muffin tin pans much anymore
at<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.620> yeah<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.769> bought<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.609> I<00:02:20.420> never

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
at all so yeah I bought that and I never

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.170 
at all so yeah I bought that and I never
even<00:02:20.780> really<00:02:21.170> used<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:22.670> what<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:22.879> use

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
even really used it so but what I use

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.069 
even really used it so but what I use
all<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.569> time<00:02:23.810> are<00:02:24.790> these<00:02:25.790> kinds<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.540> silicone

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
all the time are these kinds of silicone

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:28.539 
all the time are these kinds of silicone
molds<00:02:27.439> because<00:02:27.500> they're<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:27.859> much<00:02:27.980> easier

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
molds because they're so much easier

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.559 
molds because they're so much easier
and<00:02:28.819> another<00:02:29.420> tip<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.870> like<00:02:30.019> to<00:02:30.200> do<00:02:30.349> as<00:02:30.500> well<00:02:30.530> is

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
and another tip I like to do as well is

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.210 
and another tip I like to do as well is
here's<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.659> sheet<00:02:33.049> that<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.349> came<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.980> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
here's the sheet that it came in and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.069 
here's the sheet that it came in and
there's<00:02:34.700> some<00:02:37.329> don't<00:02:38.329> I'm<00:02:38.750> getting

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
there's some don't I'm getting

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.929 
there's some don't I'm getting
distracted<00:02:39.230> okay<00:02:40.189> with<00:02:40.459> my<00:02:40.670> lack<00:02:40.909> of

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
distracted okay with my lack of

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.729 
distracted okay with my lack of
perfectionism<00:02:41.659> but<00:02:41.989> nobody<00:02:42.379> needs<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.650> be

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
perfectionism but nobody needs to be

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.050 
perfectionism but nobody needs to be
perfect<00:02:43.099> and<00:02:43.219> that's<00:02:43.370> why<00:02:43.519> I'm<00:02:43.639> sharing<00:02:43.969> this

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
perfect and that's why I'm sharing this

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.970 
perfect and that's why I'm sharing this
with<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:44.989> good<00:02:45.230> tip<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:45.889> the

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
with you so a good tip is with the

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
with you so a good tip is with the
silicone<00:02:46.430> mold<00:02:46.700> even<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.180> this<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.870> you

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
silicone mold even like this is you

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.259 
silicone mold even like this is you
could<00:02:48.889> cut<00:02:49.189> them<00:02:49.400> with<00:02:49.549> scissors<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:50.239> it

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
could cut them with scissors and it

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.599 
could cut them with scissors and it
makes<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.629> easier<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.049> just<00:02:51.260> use<00:02:51.470> like<00:02:51.889> one<00:02:52.459> of

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
makes it easier to just use like one of

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.479 
makes it easier to just use like one of
these<00:02:52.730> things<00:02:53.409> so<00:02:54.409> why<00:02:54.919> don't<00:02:55.129> we<00:02:55.159> go<00:02:55.370> ahead

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
these things so why don't we go ahead

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.240 
these things so why don't we go ahead
right<00:02:56.030> now<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.720> just<00:02:57.409> show<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.739> a<00:02:57.859> little<00:02:58.159> bit

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
like this is really nice because it's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.180 
like this is really nice because it's
almost<00:03:22.519> like<00:03:22.699> a<00:03:22.729> tart<00:03:23.150> or<00:03:23.389> flan<00:03:24.319> and<00:03:24.709> then<00:03:25.069> you

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
almost like a tart or flan and then you

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.469 
almost like a tart or flan and then you
can<00:03:25.340> load<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.579> whole<00:03:25.790> bunch<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.030> fruit<00:03:26.329> on<00:03:26.449> top

can load a whole bunch of fruit on top
and<00:03:26.900> it's<00:03:27.129> still<00:03:28.129> has<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> really<00:03:28.760> nice<00:03:29.000> it

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750

looks like you're giving a really big
piece<00:03:31.159> but<00:03:31.430> it's<00:03:31.579> not<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:32.060> huge<00:03:32.840> piece<00:03:33.139> so<00:03:33.769> that

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
piece but it's not a huge piece so that

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:35.770 
piece but it's not a huge piece so that
would<00:03:34.310> be<00:03:34.430> that's<00:03:34.699> easy<00:03:34.879> with<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.239> springform

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
would be that's easy with the springform

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.580 
would be that's easy with the springform
pants<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.400> then<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:37.549> love<00:03:37.849> making<00:03:38.239> little<00:03:38.599> and

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
pants and then I love making little and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.259 
pants and then I love making little and
again<00:03:40.099> it's<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.459> same<00:03:40.639> recipe<00:03:40.909> and

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
again it's the same recipe and

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.050 
again it's the same recipe and
frequently<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.840> will<00:03:42.310> take<00:03:43.310> one<00:03:43.519> recipe<00:03:43.909> like

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
frequently I will take one recipe like
