these little fellers Captain Morgans cuz

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.220 
these little fellers Captain Morgans cuz
they're<00:00:22.490> positive<00:00:23.490> leg<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.000> kicked<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.109> the

they're positive leg is kicked up to the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.120 
they're positive leg is kicked up to the
side<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.650> Captain<00:00:26.010> Morgan<00:00:27.289> and<00:00:28.289> these

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130

capacitor

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.469 

these<00:01:29.740> are<00:01:29.890> all<00:01:30.009> 10<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.520> capacitors<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
these are all 10 on the capacitors the

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.529 
these are all 10 on the capacitors the
little<00:01:31.719> ones<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.430> see<00:01:33.579> that<00:01:33.729> black<00:01:33.909> box<00:01:34.180> with

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
little ones you see that black box with

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:46.550 
little ones you see that black box with
the<00:01:34.630> numbers<00:01:34.899> on<00:01:35.020> it<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:37.299> we<00:01:37.360> go<00:01:41.579> here's<00:01:42.579> one

totally<00:01:47.560> ceramic<00:01:47.799> dipped<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.990> was<00:01:50.200> me

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
totally ceramic dipped this was me

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:58.649 
totally ceramic dipped this was me
didn't<00:01:53.429> 45th<00:01:54.429> week<00:01:54.579> of<00:01:54.759> 1978<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:57.659> here

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
didn't 45th week of 1978 and here

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.169 
didn't 45th week of 1978 and here
there's<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.649> whole<00:02:00.280> bunch<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.640> other<00:02:00.759> different

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
there's a whole bunch of other different

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.490 
there's a whole bunch of other different
kinds<00:02:01.299> yeah

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
kinds yeah

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.419 
kinds yeah
black<00:02:02.740> bullets<00:02:03.130> yellow<00:02:03.490> bullets<00:02:05.039> full<00:02:06.039> yellow

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
black bullets yellow bullets full yellow

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:13.220 
black bullets yellow bullets full yellow
boxes<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.950> there's<00:02:12.160> all<00:02:12.340> kinds<00:02:12.819> of<00:02:12.880> different

boxes so there's all kinds of different
styles<00:02:14.230> of<00:02:14.290> tantalum<00:02:14.650> capacitors<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:21.430> get

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
styles of tantalum capacitors you get

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.770 
styles of tantalum capacitors you get
some<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.849> these<00:02:21.940> it<00:02:22.239> just<00:02:22.269> look<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:22.510> bullet

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
some of these it just look like bullet

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.610 
some of these it just look like bullet
or<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.290> bullets<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:26.040> sound<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.220> fish

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
or not bullets but sound like a fish

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.839 
or not bullets but sound like a fish
that's<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:29.920> different<00:02:30.190> styles<00:02:30.670> there

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
that's all the different styles there

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.819 
that's all the different styles there
are<00:02:31.410> hope<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.620> helped<00:02:32.799> see<00:02:33.700> ya
