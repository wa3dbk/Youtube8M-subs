close to 70 I thought there's no way but
there<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.720> way<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.820> brush<00:01:24.090> works<00:01:24.390> really

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:12.220 
on it and I'm going to turn it on its
going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> get<00:02:04.710> loud<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> do

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.330 

and<00:02:12.430> what<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.580> basically<00:02:13.790> does<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.599> dry<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
and what that basically does is dry the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.570 
and what that basically does is dry the
mascara<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.000> my<00:02:17.060> eyelashes<00:02:17.920> curling<00:02:18.920> them<00:02:19.099> up

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
mascara on my eyelashes curling them up

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.380 
mascara on my eyelashes curling them up
and<00:02:19.940> so<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:20.900> get<00:02:21.140> nice<00:02:21.379> long<00:02:21.650> eyelashes<00:02:22.489> without

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and so I get nice long eyelashes without

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.119 
and so I get nice long eyelashes without
an<00:02:23.540> eyelash<00:02:23.900> curler<00:02:24.470> because<00:02:24.769> those<00:02:24.920> things

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
an eyelash curler because those things

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.649 
an eyelash curler because those things
kind<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.430> freaked<00:02:25.700> me<00:02:25.849> out<00:02:25.879> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.090> bit<00:02:26.390> I'm

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
kind of freaked me out a little bit I'm

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.770 
kind of freaked me out a little bit I'm
afraid<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.110> gonna<00:02:27.170> break<00:02:27.470> my<00:02:27.650> eyelash<00:02:28.040> off

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
afraid it's gonna break my eyelash off

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.830 
afraid it's gonna break my eyelash off
just<00:02:29.780> like<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.049> flat<00:02:30.260> iron<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.599> that's<00:02:32.599> it

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
just like my flat iron and that's it

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.750 
just like my flat iron and that's it
that's<00:02:33.200> my<00:02:33.470> routine<00:02:33.830> for<00:02:34.040> putting<00:02:34.280> on<00:02:34.370> mascara

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760
