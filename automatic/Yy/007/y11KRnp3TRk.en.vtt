modifications that I did to my tank

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.969 
modifications that I did to my tank
since<00:01:13.600> I<00:01:13.780> knew<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> lighting<00:01:14.440> was<00:01:14.710> kind

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
since I knew that the lighting was kind

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.550

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
of low in comparison to what it should

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.600 
of low in comparison to what it should
be<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.880> tank<00:01:19.240> with<00:01:19.479> live<00:01:19.720> plants<00:01:20.440> I<00:01:20.680> decided

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
be for a tank with live plants I decided

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.570 
be for a tank with live plants I decided
to<00:01:21.789> put<00:01:22.000> some<00:01:22.890> mylar<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.160> you<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.399> see<00:01:24.550> I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
to put some mylar as you can see I

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.139 
to put some mylar as you can see I
covered<00:01:25.060> all<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.420> strips<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:27.520> top<00:01:27.850> at<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
covered all the strips up top at the

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.680 
covered all the strips up top at the
canopy<00:01:28.420> with<00:01:28.690> mylar<00:01:29.490> reflecting<00:01:30.490> material<00:01:31.240> so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
canopy with mylar reflecting material so

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.290 
canopy with mylar reflecting material so
that<00:01:31.720> whenever<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:33.550> lights<00:01:33.759> are<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
that whenever the lights are on and the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.880 
that whenever the lights are on and the
lids<00:01:34.479> are<00:01:34.570> down<00:01:34.720> there's<00:01:35.259> a<00:01:35.320> little<00:01:35.530> bit<00:01:35.649> more

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
lids are down there's a little bit more

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
lids are down there's a little bit more
of<00:01:36.130> reflection<00:01:37.119> going<00:01:37.330> into<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:37.780> tank<00:01:38.050> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of reflection going into the tank and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.040 
of reflection going into the tank and
therefore<00:01:40.570> benefit<00:01:41.020> benefiting<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.070> plants

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
therefore benefit benefiting the plants

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.940 
therefore benefit benefiting the plants

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
let me show you guys the side of the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:56.270 
let me show you guys the side of the
tank

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.560 

as<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.550> can<00:01:57.730> see<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.840> a<00:02:00.630> JBJ<00:02:01.630> Submariner

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
as you can see I have a JBJ Submariner

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.250 
as you can see I have a JBJ Submariner
inside<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.720> tank

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
inside the tank

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.260 
inside the tank
it's<00:02:05.650> a<00:02:05.770> UV<00:02:06.070> sterilizer<00:02:06.130> which<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:06.970> think<00:02:07.180> has

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
it's a UV sterilizer which I think has

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.389 
it's a UV sterilizer which I think has
done<00:02:07.300> a<00:02:07.450> pretty<00:02:07.510> good<00:02:07.750> job<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:08.380> barely<00:02:09.009> have<00:02:09.220> any

ology in my tank the sides I have to

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.020 
ology in my tank the sides I have to
clean<00:02:12.010> them<00:02:12.130> maybe<00:02:12.310> every<00:02:12.670> three<00:02:12.850> or<00:02:12.880> four

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
clean them maybe every three or four

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.000 
clean them maybe every three or four
days<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:13.600> just<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.840> minimum<00:02:14.380> little<00:02:14.650> thin

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
days and it's just a minimum little thin

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.730 
days and it's just a minimum little thin

aquarium plants calm those are the the
rest<00:04:47.600> of<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.780> modules<00:04:48.260> from<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:49.570> from<00:04:50.570> my

rest of the modules from the from my

rest of the modules from the from my
controller<00:04:52.010> that's<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.120> control<00:04:53.480> the<00:04:53.570> moon

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
controller that's to control the moon

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.090 
controller that's to control the moon
lights<00:04:53.930> at<00:04:54.080> night<00:04:54.550> it's<00:04:55.550> my<00:04:55.820> my<00:04:56.680> my<00:04:57.680> probes

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
lights at night it's my my my probes

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.530 
lights at night it's my my my probes
which<00:04:58.610> are<00:04:58.760> over<00:04:58.940> here<00:05:00.430> for<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.580> pH<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.240> for

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
which are over here for the pH and for

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.800 
which are over here for the pH and for
the<00:05:02.660> temperature<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.910> pretty<00:05:05.390> much<00:05:05.570> I'm<00:05:05.780> using

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
the temperature so pretty much I'm using

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.870 
the temperature so pretty much I'm using
the<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.740> filter<00:05:07.040> that<00:05:07.160> came<00:05:07.370> with<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.580> setup

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
the the filter that came with the setup

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.770 
the the filter that came with the setup
which<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.480> the<00:05:08.600> 305<00:05:09.350> I'm<00:05:10.010> using<00:05:10.280> it<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.570> to<00:05:11.570> flow

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
which is the 305 I'm using it to to flow

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.070 
which is the 305 I'm using it to to flow
the<00:05:11.840> water<00:05:12.110> through<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.620> co2<00:05:13.900> reactor<00:05:14.900> cause

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
the water through the co2 reactor cause

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.810 
the water through the co2 reactor cause
it<00:05:15.169> didn't<00:05:15.380> want<00:05:15.530> for<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.370> flow<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.669> be

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
it didn't want for the flow to be

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.930 
it didn't want for the flow to be
affected<00:05:17.360> on<00:05:17.540> my<00:05:17.780> g6<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:19.130> technically<00:05:19.729> there's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
affected on my g6 so technically there's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.870 
affected on my g6 so technically there's
two<00:05:20.300> filters<00:05:21.020> running<00:05:21.740> this<00:05:21.860> tank<00:05:22.100> which<00:05:22.729> is

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
two filters running this tank which is

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.880 
two filters running this tank which is
why<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.060> can<00:05:23.330> put<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:24.020> lot<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.320> fish<00:05:24.500> in<00:05:24.620> here<00:05:24.770> and

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
why I can put a lot of fish in here and

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.870 
why I can put a lot of fish in here and
I<00:05:24.950> don't<00:05:25.130> think<00:05:25.250> I'll<00:05:25.370> ever<00:05:25.460> have<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.700> problem

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
I don't think I'll ever have a problem

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.510 
I don't think I'll ever have a problem
my<00:05:26.570> nitrogen<00:05:27.020> cycle<00:05:27.410> went<00:05:28.070> through<00:05:28.250> perfectly

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
my nitrogen cycle went through perfectly

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.730 
my nitrogen cycle went through perfectly
I<00:05:28.760> didn't<00:05:29.060> have<00:05:29.180> any<00:05:29.360> ammonia<00:05:29.690> no<00:05:30.200> nitrates<00:05:30.620> at

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
I didn't have any ammonia no nitrates at

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.040 
I didn't have any ammonia no nitrates at
once<00:05:30.919> no<00:05:31.430> nitrites<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.540> went<00:05:32.720> straight<00:05:32.930> to

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
once no nitrites and went straight to

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.640 
once no nitrites and went straight to
nitrate<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:34.190> highly<00:05:35.180> recommend<00:05:35.210> any<00:05:36.169> of

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
nitrate so I highly recommend any of

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.870 
nitrate so I highly recommend any of
these<00:05:36.740> two<00:05:36.890> filters<00:05:37.100> because<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.490> did<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.700> great

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
these two filters because I did a great

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:47.650 
these two filters because I did a great
job<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:45.080> last<00:05:45.260> thing<00:05:45.500> I<00:05:45.590> did<00:05:45.800> was<00:05:46.160> I<00:05:46.660> mentioned

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660
