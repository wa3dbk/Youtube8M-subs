one is the gray sleeves and the collar

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.090

here they're kind of a shiny material
and<00:02:06.640> I<00:02:06.850> think<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.390> that's<00:02:07.659> odd<00:02:08.350> choice<00:02:08.799> I

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
and I think that that's odd choice I

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.120 
and I think that that's odd choice I
thought<00:02:10.119> it<00:02:10.570> would<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:10.840> been<00:02:11.019> mat<00:02:11.500> would

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
thought it would have been mat would

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.479 
thought it would have been mat would
have<00:02:12.250> looked<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.549> lot<00:02:13.330> better<00:02:14.250> another<00:02:15.250> bad

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
have looked a lot better another bad

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.840 
have looked a lot better another bad
thing<00:02:15.519> about<00:02:16.390> these<00:02:17.019> wardrobe<00:02:17.560> sets<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.100> that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
thing about these wardrobe sets is that

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.460 
thing about these wardrobe sets is that
they<00:02:19.000> don't<00:02:19.120> come<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.540> shoes<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.350> she

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
they don't come with shoes so she

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.250 
they don't come with shoes so she
doesn't<00:02:20.769> come<00:02:21.070> with<00:02:21.250> her<00:02:21.690> clogs<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.870> she

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.300 
like this it just sticks up by itself so
I<00:04:24.790> think<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:25.810> they<00:04:26.110> used<00:04:26.350> um<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.980> kind<00:04:27.280> of

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
I think it if they used um I kind of

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.190 
I think it if they used um I kind of
softer<00:04:27.820> material<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.480> would<00:04:28.600> have<00:04:28.720> been<00:04:28.900> a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
softer material that would have been a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:36.030 
softer material that would have been a
lot<00:04:29.800> better<00:04:33.570> other<00:04:34.570> than<00:04:34.720> that<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.260> do<00:04:35.560> like<00:04:35.890> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
lot better other than that I do like the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.580 
lot better other than that I do like the
wedding<00:04:36.310> dress<00:04:36.520> and<00:04:36.760> I'm<00:04:37.240> glad<00:04:37.630> they<00:04:38.590> didn't

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.250 
wedding dress and I'm glad they didn't
they<00:04:41.590> decided<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.310> give<00:04:42.940> her<00:04:43.120> another<00:04:43.660> dress<00:04:45.210> I

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
they decided to give her another dress I

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.740
