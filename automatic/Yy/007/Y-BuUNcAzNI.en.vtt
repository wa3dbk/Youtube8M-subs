00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.230
 once created 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.980
 we have to put 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.860
 yes 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:20.510
 we are with the map 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 in infrastructures not this not for 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.190

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 I want to go back to your bed 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.790
 then with the sugar 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.790
 create in a new world 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.850
 as you can see is no longer the best 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 form of lime 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.240
 now what they will do is do 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.830
 everything you want to do in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.580

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.119

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.119
 strong 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 we will build things 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.299
 5 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 two 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.580
 I could not say long to put the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580
 emotion 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.530
 suddenly 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.530
 against the door 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.780
 horford 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.010
 first name 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.849
 I 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.849
 I do not know why 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.370
 or what you have to keep in San MamÃ©s 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.890
 once it is closed the only thing that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.890
 will have to do is create a folder 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.070
 now 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:05.130
 put the name of vargas where it will be 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.130
 same 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.780
 do is open that folder 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.490
 put them in everything 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.210
 good 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.210
 with rules on one side 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.530
 and for that 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.960
 just copy and paste 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.200
 then where they should do it is to go up 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.270
 is on the internet that I visit a 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.849

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:48.439

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.010
 so that everyone knows their art 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.940
