concerns

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.080 
concerns
I<00:03:08.239> think<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> opacity<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.069> fact<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.459> the

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
I think the opacity the fact that the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
I think the opacity the fact that the
cadmium<00:03:11.629> tends<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.109> be<00:03:12.230> a<00:03:12.260> little<00:03:12.409> bit<00:03:12.620> more

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
cadmium tends to be a little bit more

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.869 
cadmium tends to be a little bit more
opaque<00:03:14.140> artists<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.159> company<00:03:16.549> started

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
opaque artists that the company started

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.330 
opaque artists that the company started
making<00:03:16.939> this<00:03:17.569> nickel<00:03:18.319> as<00:03:18.469> Oh<00:03:18.500> again<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.310> I

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
making this nickel as Oh again that I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.670 
making this nickel as Oh again that I
see<00:03:19.609> a<00:03:19.640> thing<00:03:19.879> I<00:03:20.030> need<00:03:20.209> to<00:03:20.329> fix<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:23.349> and<00:03:24.349> so

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
see a thing I need to fix there and so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.289 
see a thing I need to fix there and so
it<00:03:24.829> turns<00:03:25.099> out<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.459> it's<00:03:25.609> a<00:03:25.730> transparent

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
it turns out that it's a transparent

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.629 
it turns out that it's a transparent
pigment<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.590> it's<00:03:27.799> a<00:03:27.920> good<00:03:28.099> one

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
pigment so it's a good one
