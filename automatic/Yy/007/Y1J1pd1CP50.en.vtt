00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.492
Hi, baby.
Talk fast, I'm working.

00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:11.455
Honey, you left your Facebook
logged in in the computer.

00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:16.204
Oh, I'm glad you called!
I really needed to talk to you.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:19.599
Do me a favor. Go to the laundry.
Get out of this room!

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:20.975
-The laundry?
-Yes.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.240
I need you to look
for a steel screw

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.296
&lt;i&gt;which is inside
my tool box.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:27.242
You want me to
look for it now?

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.603
-You just said you were in a hurry!
-No!

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.049
It's no problem.
I just got a break.

00:00:32.258 --> 00:00:34.429
Okay, but what do I do
with the computer?

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.351
Forget the computer!
For God sakes, just leave it there!

00:00:37.598 --> 00:00:39.171
Let's focus
on the tool box.

00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:41.130
Okay, I'm going
to the laundry.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:45.348
You have to check one by one!
It's a very specific screw!

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:47.016
It's made of steel!

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.361
-Augusto, the box isn't here.
-What?

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.868
-Aline? What?
-The screw box isn't here!

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.387
Okay then,
since you're going to the bank,

00:00:56.585 --> 00:00:58.961
&lt;i&gt;pick some old clothes
to give to the church.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.582
What do you think?
We have lots of old clothes!

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:05.503
Bank? I've been paying our bills
through the internet for 2 years!

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.138
Aline, no!

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:10.429
It's very dangerous
to pay bills through the internet!

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:14.597
But now I'll have to
because the bank already closed.

00:01:14.797 --> 00:01:16.774
-Bye.
-No! No bye!

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:18.928
Where are you now?
In the kitchen?

00:01:19.102 --> 00:01:21.504
So, tell me how many tiles
there are on the stove's wall?

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:25.511
-One hundred and forty.
-140? ow do you know that?

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.859
Because 10 times 14 is 140.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.766
You can't count tiles
like this, you know that!

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:33.629
You have to count
one by one!

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.791
-You sound weird.
-It's how I speak.

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:40.167
Maybe I'm speaking a little lower
because Nogueira entered the room

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:43.275
&lt;i&gt;and I have to show
respect for the boss.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.610
-Baby!
-What, Augusto?

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:47.978
You said it my YouTube or Facebook
page was logged in?

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.652
I don't know,
for me it's all the same crap.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.734
Yeah, baby.
It's all the same crap.

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:04.170
Hi, Guto.
You forgot your cellphone at home.

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:06.838
Yes, I have it with me.

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:09.839
Yes, I'm looking at it!
Your cell phone is with me.

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:11.551
What? No...

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:14.490
Wait, you want me
to read the Bible to you now?

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:16.816
Like right now?
Okay, Guto.

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:19.474
What passage do you want?
The whole Bible?

00:02:21.054 --> 00:02:23.764
You want me to transcript
the whole thing?

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.854
Where am I going to get a Bible?
We don't have one!

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.379
In Manaus?

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.429
Guto, I'm going to the gym,
there's no time.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.222
No, the class is right now!
It's a scheduled class!

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.084
What? Okay, I can try catching
a flight after the class...
