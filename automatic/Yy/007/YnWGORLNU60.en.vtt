00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to be able to make my biceps pop and

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
to be able to make my biceps pop and
make<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.119> better<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.350> can

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
still work them and improve them so if

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
still work them and improve them so if
you<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.380> lagging<00:01:19.680> body<00:01:19.979> part<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
you have a lagging body part this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.770 
you have a lagging body part this is
something<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> might<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.570> add

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
something that you might want to add

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
something that you might want to add
into<00:01:22.649> your<00:01:23.009> routine<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.520> there's<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
into your routine because there's a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.109 
into your routine because there's a
really<00:01:24.869> large<00:01:25.320> benefit<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.920> giving<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.399> body

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
really large benefit of giving a body

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.240 
really large benefit of giving a body
part<00:01:27.390> an<00:01:27.600> extra<00:01:28.170> day<00:01:28.290> assuming<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.740> fits<00:01:28.950> into

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
part an extra day assuming it fits into

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.459 
part an extra day assuming it fits into
your<00:01:29.729> training<00:01:30.420> split<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:30.719> there<00:01:30.960> are<00:01:31.020> 52

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
your training split because there are 52

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:33.200 
your training split because there are 52
weeks<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> year<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.670> might<00:01:32.790> not<00:01:32.909> sound

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
weeks in a year and it might not sound

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.050 
weeks in a year and it might not sound
like<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.840> doing<00:01:34.290> one<00:01:34.530> extra<00:01:35.460> arm<00:01:35.640> day<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> week

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
like much doing one extra arm day a week

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
like much doing one extra arm day a week
but<00:01:36.240> think<00:01:36.450> about<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.840> over<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> course<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
but think about that over the course of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.999 
but think about that over the course of
a<00:01:37.799> long<00:01:37.950> period<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.490> time<00:01:38.780> one<00:01:39.780> year<00:01:39.990> that's<00:01:40.229> 52

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a long period of time one year that's 52

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
a long period of time one year that's 52
extra<00:01:41.909> workouts<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.049> more<00:01:43.200> volume<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
extra workouts a lot more volume and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.999 
extra workouts a lot more volume and
there's<00:01:44.549> obviously<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.090> large<00:01:45.539> benefit<00:01:46.469> for

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
there's obviously a large benefit for

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
there's obviously a large benefit for
adding<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.270> let's<00:01:48.420> go<00:01:48.509> ahead<00:01:48.539> and

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
adding that in so let's go ahead and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.480 
adding that in so let's go ahead and
talk<00:01:48.869> about<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> actual<00:01:49.320> work<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:50.070> here<00:01:50.310> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
talk about the actual work out here so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
talk about the actual work out here so
right<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:50.880> doing<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> dumbbell<00:01:52.049> curls

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320

right now I'm doing the dumbbell curls
making<00:01:52.590> sure<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:52.799> really<00:01:53.009> supinate<00:01:53.520> my<00:01:53.670> wrist

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

time trying to do a little bit of

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.740 
time trying to do a little bit of
controlled<00:02:11.760> cheating<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.390> for<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.599> most

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
controlled cheating but for the most

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.450 
controlled cheating but for the most

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
part keeping it strict keeping the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.880 
part keeping it strict keeping the
mention<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.660> should<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:15.960> we've<00:02:16.620> got<00:02:16.740> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
mention where it should be we've got the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.650 
mention where it should be we've got the
dumbbell<00:02:17.160> curls<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.580> then<00:02:17.970> four<00:02:18.210> sets<00:02:18.480> of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150

final exercise are these decline

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.650 
final exercise are these decline
dumbbell<00:03:05.130> skull<00:03:05.730> crushers<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.300> being<00:03:06.540> at<00:03:06.630> a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
dumbbell skull crushers and being at a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630 
dumbbell skull crushers and being at a
decline<00:03:07.080> when<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.680> do<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.890> movement<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.250> so

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
decline when you do this movement is so

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.470 
decline when you do this movement is so
much<00:03:09.510> less<00:03:09.810> stressful<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.370> elbows<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:12.060> mean

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
much less stressful on the elbows I mean

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.240 
much less stressful on the elbows I mean
just<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.870> few<00:03:13.080> inches<00:03:13.320> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.620> decline<00:03:13.920> takes

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
just the few inches on the decline takes

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.710 
just the few inches on the decline takes
a<00:03:14.340> lot<00:03:14.460> of<00:03:14.490> stress<00:03:14.760> off<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.090> elbow<00:03:15.210> so<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.600> is

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
a lot of stress off the elbow so that is

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.290 
a lot of stress off the elbow so that is
another<00:03:15.840> thing<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.320> try<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.830> all<00:03:17.000> 20<00:03:18.000> sets

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
another thing to try that is all 20 sets

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.350 
another thing to try that is all 20 sets
of<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:19.230> workout<00:03:19.590> we've<00:03:19.740> got<00:03:19.890> our<00:03:20.040> biceps<00:03:20.940> 12

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
of the workout we've got our biceps 12

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.630 
of the workout we've got our biceps 12
sets<00:03:21.510> their<00:03:21.690> triceps<00:03:22.230> 8<00:03:22.440> sets<00:03:22.920> there<00:03:23.370> and

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
sets their triceps 8 sets there and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.570 
sets their triceps 8 sets there and
that's<00:03:24.360> it<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.050> if<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.320> guys<00:03:25.440> add<00:03:25.710> in<00:03:26.370> an<00:03:26.490> extra
