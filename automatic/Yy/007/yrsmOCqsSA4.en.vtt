00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
extra handlebars they don't appear to be

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
extra handlebars they don't appear to be
any<00:01:20.009> different<00:01:20.580> than<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.720> ones<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.020> are

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
any different than the ones that are

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
any different than the ones that are
already<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> bike<00:01:22.920> maybe<00:01:23.759> they're<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
already on the bike maybe they're just

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.359 
already on the bike maybe they're just
replacements<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> case<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
replacements just in case it's just

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.210 
replacements just in case it's just
wheeled<00:01:26.580> just<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.390> see<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
wheeled just so you can see the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.190 
wheeled just so you can see the
replacements<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> handlebars<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.820> come<00:01:30.000> off

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
replacements the handlebars do come off

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
replacements the handlebars do come off
but<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.680> any<00:01:31.829> difference<00:01:32.299> between

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
but I don't see any difference between

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
but I don't see any difference between
these<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.380> this<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.560> unless<00:01:35.369> the

Shatt<00:01:35.880> no<00:01:36.119> no<00:01:36.540> difference<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.850> know

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
Shatt no no difference so I don't know

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.359 
Shatt no no difference so I don't know
what<00:01:39.119> that's<00:01:39.210> about

is over here but again I'm not going to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.130 
is over here but again I'm not going to
bother<00:02:08.629> swapping<00:02:09.629> those<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:09.929> because

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
bother swapping those out because

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.199 
bother swapping those out because
they're<00:02:10.259> very<00:02:10.379> tiny<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.670> also<00:02:11.819> comes<00:02:12.150> with

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
they're very tiny and it also comes with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.940 
they're very tiny and it also comes with
a<00:02:12.330> couple<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.660> new<00:02:13.050> hands<00:02:13.349> which<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> will<00:02:13.800> put

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
a couple of new hands which I will put

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.970 
a couple of new hands which I will put
on<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.450> grab<00:02:15.690> the

the bars of the bike and have his

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.670 
the bars of the bike and have his
fingers<00:02:17.750> out<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.290> he's<00:02:18.470> reaching

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.529 
pose but there you go you have fours a
riding<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.610> bike<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:36.789> I<00:04:37.000> love<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.360> see

riding a bike and I love you can see
that<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:37.870> see<00:04:38.050> how<00:04:38.229> his<00:04:38.440> uh<00:04:38.470> I<00:04:38.949> seem<00:04:39.550> to<00:04:39.580> recall

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
that but see how his uh I seem to recall

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.460 
that but see how his uh I seem to recall
when<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.090> first<00:04:40.360> got<00:04:40.539> him<00:04:40.750> he<00:04:40.780> was<00:04:41.080> just<00:04:41.110> as

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
when I first got him he was just as

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.260 
when I first got him he was just as
white<00:04:41.680> as<00:04:41.889> this<00:04:42.010> bike<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.729> I<00:04:43.030> don't<00:04:43.090> if<00:04:43.210> you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
white as this bike and I don't if you

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.740 
white as this bike and I don't if you
can<00:04:43.360> tell<00:04:43.660> but<00:04:43.780> there's<00:04:43.960> very<00:04:44.199> definitely<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.919> a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
can tell but there's very definitely a a

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.620 
can tell but there's very definitely a a
yellowing<00:04:47.789> different<00:04:48.789> shade<00:04:49.090> difference

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
yellowing different shade difference

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.000 
yellowing different shade difference
there<00:04:50.250> between<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.580> bike<00:04:51.760> and<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.180> fours<00:04:52.539> a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
there between the bike and and fours a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.570 
there between the bike and and fours a
hopefully<00:04:54.010> that's<00:04:54.130> just<00:04:54.310> my<00:04:54.400> imagination

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
hopefully that's just my imagination

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.100 
hopefully that's just my imagination
it's<00:04:55.180> just<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.389> way<00:04:55.479> I'm<00:04:55.570> looking<00:04:55.660> at<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:56.020> but

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
it's just the way I'm looking at it but

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.320 
it's just the way I'm looking at it but
he<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.919> seems<00:04:57.190> especially<00:04:57.699> in<00:04:58.030> comparison

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
he just seems especially in comparison

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.930 
he just seems especially in comparison
to<00:04:58.539> the<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.960> white<00:04:59.139> of<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.349> bike<00:04:59.849> to<00:05:00.849> have

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
to the the white of the bike to have

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.980 
to the the white of the bike to have
yellowed<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.449> don't<00:05:01.510> know<00:05:01.720> how<00:05:01.840> it
