00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.460
 I'm traveling all the way 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.290
 I have a good application for you 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.120
 go as I am I also have one for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.210
 teach you to me first mine first 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.000
 friend of mine who calls polyvore remix and is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 as well as a fashion consultant of yours 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.090
 mentions then look in the morning to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.919
 Sometimes it happens to you that you do not know what to wear 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.200
 is not if always all life is good 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.520
 then you select a category by 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.380
 example you have some shoes and 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.660
 balls to these partners and that you do not do 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.359
 click and the same application will give you 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.000
 ideas of how to combine it already if it is not 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:41.190
 you like the ideas you put remix and you 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.019
 is going to give new ones already like that if you like 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.879
 you grab but suddenly you want to change 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.649
 or just an accessory you click on the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.070
 accessory and the application will give 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.749
 more options that happens listen to me and bone 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.489
 if I really like there some 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.170
 accessory that I do not have give you 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.149
 options to see where I can say 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.129
 that's the coolest thing if you like a 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 you click on it and it says 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.839
 price and online store so that what 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 buy that go to see another question what 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.560
 happens if I already found a combination 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
 that I really like I can share in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 You can share the networks for me 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.800
 by facebook twitter obviously interest 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.180
 and above free guess right now 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.550
 but listen to me now if I 'm going to teach you 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.550
 my application is a photo editor 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:46.400
 carmelo if you can totally like 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.400
 funny 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.729
 think that the floors 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.970
 can you remove my application to see if 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.649
 is a photo editor in good truths 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.450
 or it's called in like once you're 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.280
 come down they will not need another editor 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.290
 because it's super complete well first thing 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.290
 what we are going to do is take some of you 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.980
 and here the wind can cut it spinning and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.510
 teach you can change the perspective in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 result could also eliminate a 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.140
 part of the photo as the Chinese by 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.390
 example on whether we should not enter 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.160
 here in image the objective of this 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.720
 tool is good selections about 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.210
 a part of the photo to work the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.190
 contrast exposure and saturation and 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.410
 look here in filters have a lot of 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.330
 options but the best one was with the one 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.190
 you can apply a different effect to two 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.530
 parts of the photo and can also 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.870
 mix world and up to convert it to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.560
 immense to add urban effects to do 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.720
 sketches paint look write also and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.270
 make me a month to good also add 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.890
 edges and marks already but what if 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 I want to upload a photo of instagram I have 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.580
 than using another application to do the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.440
 photo squared not because they also have 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.060
 this photo that what he does is add a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.070
 blur at the top and the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 bottom part and return your photo in a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370
 square 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.319
 also does with the Chinese I'm being 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.569
 which is complete then 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.519
 I can simply download this and delete 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.780
 all the other photo editors and already 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.049
 just stay with stations in 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.700
 We have learned all the time to see what is 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.999
 to keep trying the knowledge of knowing 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.999
 the end
