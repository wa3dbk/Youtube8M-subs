 are present in the most diverse places especially where the populations 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.669
 in situations of social risk 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.669
 change their lives 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.550
 most of the families we serve here 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.379
 the community was at risk and vulnerability if it passed 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.129
 the more time you know who you are 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.559
 if there is no such selection, 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.129
 had the heart and heart of Roberto asking for help from the
