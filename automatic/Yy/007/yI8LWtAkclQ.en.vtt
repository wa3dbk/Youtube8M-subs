00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.510
 to the extent that English does as it 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.340
 have already realized the summer is a 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.530
 point to get and along with summer 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.030
 school holidays come like this 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.829
 that if they do not have health plans for 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.360
 no part in the summer I'm going to 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.430

 have a great time and have fun with your 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.390
 friends at home a little bit ago I met with 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:56.059
 my friends in an afternoon to see a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.949
 movie and that I could think of doing 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.870

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.970

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.739

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.569
 I upload a new video and challenge them 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:20.700
 I'm going to put all of you today 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:23.130
 let's make this video reach a thousand 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.319
 little fingers up because as you know 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.170
 little fingers friends are cool and they are 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.670
 Cool people and they are super fun 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.679
 so let's make this video 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.359
 arrives at least a thousand crimes above 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.280
 another thing is also that it would help me 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.020
 a lot if at least being you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.759
 they share this video and their networks 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.950
 social networks like facebook and twitter 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 because that way other people are going to go 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.590
 knowing my channel and now we're going to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.830
 start with the video 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.830
 ag 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.580
 first that first we are going to change a 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.260
 little decoration of our room 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.420
 so that it is ready for our 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.090
 visitors this is super easy only 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.180
 you have to take a blanket and put it on 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.350
 the floor add some cushions and already 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.780
 you have your corner to watch movies 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.880
 together with your friends and so you can 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.900
 receive many of them and they will be 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.900
 super comfortable 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.370
 in my night visit I did some 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.260
 changes with simple things that maybe and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.060
 we will need while we were 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.210
 watching the movie for example something for 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.730
 lip disinfecting moisturizer 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.550
 you know lipsticks things that sometimes 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 we invented glazed girls because they did not 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.170
 I know if it happens to you but when 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.630
 I have visitors at home it happens that the 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.520
 girls just remember that they 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.620
 it was not necessary to paint the nails because 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.780
 they have a little bone so it's a 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.330
 good idea to have as well as a station 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
 of self-service by the way some of 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.860
 my favorite movies lately are 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.660
 for example teen diva forever 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.660
 I feel and pride and prejudice 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.799
 I would call my lawyer 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.220
 ok dolls 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.650
 now we go with the hairstyle that I used that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 day is still carry something simple because 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.970
 let's see when we are with friends not 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.610
 we need to have a very hairstyle 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.340
 drawn up so just take a 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.610
 little of the hair on top and 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.400
 I grabbed it with two spikes on the side of 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.769
 back after to keep it simple 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 also divide the hair into two and three 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.450
 and this as in the form of cord that is 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.940
 super easy to do is just say 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.799
 with seeing it you can do it all 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.540
 We decided to stay in our pajamas because 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.310
 although it was not a sleepover it was much more 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.310
 comfortable to enjoy the movie 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.660
 and to not die of hunger we decided 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.150
 make some super delicious treats 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.890
 that are not healthy at all but what 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.350
 import dolls one day does not hurt with 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.300
 the first I took some round cookies 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.040
 and smear peanut butter for it 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.900
 make sandwiches milestones the truth 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.480
 is that I love peanut butter 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.580
 Then what I did was that I also took 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.770
 a little white chocolate and what 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.390
 melt in the microwave I recommend them 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.880
 they need it with a little milk 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.190
 so they do not get burned because to me 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.350
 like what happened to me at the beginning later what 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.480
 What I did was to bathe half of the 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 sandwiches and coughs with chocolate and 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.860
 I was putting or I'm putting them in a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080
 tray that was already oiled I tell you 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.910
 that this tastes super delicious because the 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.650
 combination of peanut butter with 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.650
 chocolate is delicious 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.370
 for this I took two cups of oreo biscuit 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.020
 and what made it crush very well if 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.390
 you have something in which to crush it you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.570
 would make life easier after mixing 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.460
 two cups of chocolate sprinkles for 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.080
 Take it to the microwave with a cup and 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.360
 average of condensed milk so that 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.580
 melted very well then what I did 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.800
 was to mix this chocolate with the 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.720
 condensed milk already melted with 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.700
 cookies that I already had crushed 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.350
 previously also add you a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.290
 teaspoon vanilla extract 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.850
 then take it to the fridge for a while 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.190
 until it got really hard that lasts 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.170
 about an hour and then what 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.180
 I cut into little squares I tell them that girl 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.370
 you should try this dessert 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.830
 because it tastes super rich and I know it because 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.930
 passed the test with many people who 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.030
 I'm going to try them and they were super 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.210
 delicious and the best thing is that it only takes 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.370
 three ingredients 0 or not and it takes away 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.680
 very little time and of course not 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.670
 popcorn may be missing for 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.670
 the day of the movie 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.540
 and that day we played some games for 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.910
 example of an application that you download to 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.199
 your cell phone and you can go guessing or 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.900
 try to guess what the other 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.290
 person is trying to tell you we take 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.660
