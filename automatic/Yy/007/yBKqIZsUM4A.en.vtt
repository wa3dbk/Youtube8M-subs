00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.690 

okay<00:00:15.880> this<00:00:16.059> video<00:00:16.209> I<00:00:16.420> just<00:00:16.690> want<00:00:16.869> to<00:00:16.960> discuss

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
okay this video I just want to discuss

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.220 
okay this video I just want to discuss
absolute<00:00:18.700> value<00:00:19.000> inequalities<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.720> little<00:00:20.110> bit

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
absolute value inequalities a little bit

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.769 
absolute value inequalities a little bit
more<00:00:20.470> and<00:00:20.710> I<00:00:20.950> actually<00:00:21.189> want<00:00:21.580> to<00:00:21.779> specifically

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
more and I actually want to specifically

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.400 
more and I actually want to specifically
talk<00:00:23.170> about<00:00:24.000> absolute<00:00:25.000> value<00:00:25.330> as<00:00:25.480> it<00:00:26.110> relates

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
talk about absolute value as it relates

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
talk about absolute value as it relates
to<00:00:26.560> distance<00:00:27.189> on<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.180> number<00:00:28.570> line<00:00:28.860> as<00:00:29.860> you<00:00:30.310> can

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
to distance on a number line as you can

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.950 
to distance on a number line as you can
see<00:00:30.610> most<00:00:30.759> people<00:00:30.939> know<00:00:31.180> absolute<00:00:31.630> value

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
see most people know absolute value

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.170 
see most people know absolute value
simply<00:00:32.259> take<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.890> negative<00:00:33.250> x<00:00:33.460> and<00:00:33.790> it<00:00:33.910> the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
simply take the negative x and it the

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.030 
simply take the negative x and it the
output<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.660> positive<00:00:34.989> x<00:00:35.380> so<00:00:35.770> if<00:00:35.829> you<00:00:35.920> had

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
output is positive x so if you had

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.979 
output is positive x so if you had
negative<00:00:36.399> seven<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.820> becomes<00:00:37.120> seven<00:00:37.540> if<00:00:37.899> you

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
negative seven it becomes seven if you

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.360 
negative seven it becomes seven if you
have<00:00:38.079> positive<00:00:38.260> five<00:00:38.710> it<00:00:38.920> stays<00:00:39.160> positive

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
have positive five it stays positive

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.490 
have positive five it stays positive
five<00:00:39.820> but<00:00:40.420> there's<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.630> little<00:00:40.870> bit<00:00:40.960> more<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.350> it

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
five but there's a little bit more to it

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.560 
five but there's a little bit more to it
the<00:00:41.920> absolute<00:00:42.070> value<00:00:42.610> also<00:00:43.000> discusses

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
the absolute value also discusses

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.330 
the absolute value also discusses
distance<00:00:44.079> in<00:00:44.230> either<00:00:44.380> direction<00:00:44.740> on<00:00:44.980> a<00:00:45.010> number

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
distance in either direction on a number

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.220 
distance in either direction on a number
line<00:00:45.370> so<00:00:46.270> what<00:00:46.330> I've<00:00:46.450> done<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.750> I've<00:00:46.870> prepared

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
line so what I've done is I've prepared

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.980 
line so what I've done is I've prepared
three<00:00:47.350> examples

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.480 

all<00:00:55.470> right<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.770> let's<00:00:55.950> take<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> first

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
all right so let's take the first

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.630 
all right so let's take the first
example<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.410> as<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.890> see<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:01.020> obvious

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
example and as you can see the obvious

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.530 
example and as you can see the obvious
expression<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.880> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> general

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
expression is going to be a general

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.950 
expression is going to be a general
inequality<00:01:04.500> okay<00:01:05.160> it's<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.090> X<00:01:06.690> is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
inequality okay it's going to be X is

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410 
inequality okay it's going to be X is
greater<00:01:07.140> than<00:01:07.410> or<00:01:07.530> equal<00:01:07.620> to<00:01:07.800> 5<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.460> X<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:09.360> less

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
greater than or equal to 5 or X is less

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
greater than or equal to 5 or X is less
than<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.870> equal<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.230> negative<00:01:10.320> 5<00:01:10.650> rather

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
than or equal to negative 5 rather

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
than or equal to negative 5 rather
straightforward<00:01:11.610> basic<00:01:12.560> arithmetic<00:01:13.560> or

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
straightforward basic arithmetic or

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
straightforward basic arithmetic or
algebra<00:01:14.090> ok<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.240> there's<00:01:15.390> another<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
algebra ok but there's another way to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.540 
algebra ok but there's another way to
express<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.650> that's<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.040> use<00:01:17.280> an

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
express this and that's if you use an

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.050 
express this and that's if you use an
absolute<00:01:18.000> value<00:01:18.320> inequality<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.060> basically

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
absolute value inequality and basically

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.270 
absolute value inequality and basically
as<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.260> if<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.100> absolute

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
as you can see if you have the absolute

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.540 
as you can see if you have the absolute
value<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.910> 5<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:25.230> would<00:01:25.350> equal<00:01:25.470> 5<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.460> you

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
value of 5 it would equal 5 and if you

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.860 
value of 5 it would equal 5 and if you
have<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.730> absolute<00:01:27.060> value<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.300> negative<00:01:27.479> 5

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
have the absolute value of negative 5

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.450 
have the absolute value of negative 5
and<00:01:28.110> equal<00:01:28.320> 5<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.560> there's<00:01:29.010> some<00:01:29.190> sort<00:01:29.370> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and equal 5 so there's some sort of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.310 
and equal 5 so there's some sort of
relationship<00:01:29.940> here<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> I've<00:01:31.140> actually

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
relationship here and I've actually

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
relationship here and I've actually
written<00:01:31.710> out<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:33.470> inequality<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.560> will

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
written out the inequality that will

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
written out the inequality that will
represent<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:35.940> it's<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
represent this as you can see it's the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
represent this as you can see it's the
absolute<00:01:36.450> value<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.750> X<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> greater<00:01:37.170> than<00:01:37.410> or

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
absolute value of X is greater than or

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.650 
absolute value of X is greater than or
equal<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.800> 5<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.760> pretty<00:01:39.090> intuitive<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
equal to 5 and it's pretty intuitive you

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.400 
equal to 5 and it's pretty intuitive you
just<00:01:39.869> look<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
just look at it

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.000 
just look at it
and<00:01:41.060> 5<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.420> course<00:01:42.660> 6<00:01:42.960> 7<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.619> and

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
and 5 and of course 6 7 and on and

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.890 
and 5 and of course 6 7 and on and
negative<00:01:44.460> 6<00:01:44.640> negative<00:01:44.700> 7<00:01:45.210> negative<00:01:45.240> 8<00:01:45.479> on<00:01:45.690> down

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
negative 6 negative 7 negative 8 on down

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.930 
negative 6 negative 7 negative 8 on down
and<00:01:46.080> everything<00:01:46.440> in<00:01:46.560> between<00:01:46.640> ok<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.700> that's

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
and everything in between ok so that's

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.850 
and everything in between ok so that's
the<00:01:48.000> first<00:01:48.090> example<00:01:50.900> then<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.110> next<00:01:52.350> example

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the first example then the next example

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.060 
the first example then the next example
we<00:01:53.160> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> number<00:01:53.670> line<00:01:53.880> graph<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:55.070> again

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
we have a number line graph and again

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.999 
we have a number line graph and again
there's<00:01:56.910> an<00:01:57.000> open<00:01:57.240> circle<00:01:57.540> at<00:01:57.660> negative<00:01:57.690> 3<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there's an open circle at negative 3 and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.010 
there's an open circle at negative 3 and
then<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> an<00:02:00.360> open<00:02:00.630> circle<00:02:00.929> at

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
then going on down and an open circle at

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.840 
then going on down and an open circle at
5<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.800> on<00:02:01.920> up<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.369> we're<00:02:02.520> looking<00:02:02.729> for

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
5 and going on up so we're looking for

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
5 and going on up so we're looking for
less<00:02:03.030> than<00:02:03.210> negative<00:02:03.300> 3<00:02:03.570> greater<00:02:04.080> than<00:02:04.170> 5<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
less than negative 3 greater than 5 and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.840 
less than negative 3 greater than 5 and
the<00:02:05.700> obvious<00:02:06.860> direct<00:02:07.860> inequality<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.700> could

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
the obvious direct inequality we could

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.910 
the obvious direct inequality we could
use<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.300> simply<00:02:10.100> X<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.430> greater<00:02:11.580> than<00:02:11.790> 5<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:13.050> X

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
use is simply X is greater than 5 or X

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.830 
use is simply X is greater than 5 or X
is<00:02:14.190> less<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.760> negative<00:02:14.910> 3<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.540> everything

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
is less than negative 3 and everything

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.480 
is less than negative 3 and everything
in<00:02:15.960> between<00:02:15.990> would<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.620> fit<00:02:16.890> either<00:02:17.100> one<00:02:17.370> of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
in between would not fit either one of

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.010 
in between would not fit either one of
these<00:02:17.580> possibilities<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.720> how<00:02:18.840> would<00:02:18.900> we

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
these possibilities but how would we

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
these possibilities but how would we
express<00:02:19.470> this<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.710> an<00:02:19.950> absolute<00:02:20.280> value

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
express this as an absolute value

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330 
express this as an absolute value
inequality<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:22.260> as<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.410> mentioned<00:02:22.470> before<00:02:23.100> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
inequality well as I mentioned before a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.340 
inequality well as I mentioned before a
lot<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.880> absolute<00:02:24.390> values<00:02:24.690> it's<00:02:24.870> related<00:02:25.260> to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
lot of absolute values it's related to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
lot of absolute values it's related to
distance<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.550> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.880> here<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.450> have

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
distance so what we have here is we have

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
distance so what we have here is we have
a<00:02:27.569> distance<00:02:28.080> we're<00:02:28.920> trying<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.220> find<00:02:29.430> what

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
a distance we're trying to find what

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.870 
a distance we're trying to find what
value<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.240> x<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.260> middle<00:02:31.610> would<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
value of x in the middle would be the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.580 
value of x in the middle would be the
distance<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.480> each<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:33.780> these<00:02:33.870> endpoints<00:02:34.200> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
distance to each of these endpoints and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.220 
distance to each of these endpoints and
going<00:02:34.770> outward<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:36.240> there's<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
going outward and this there's kind of a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.770 
going outward and this there's kind of a
simple<00:02:37.620> three-step<00:02:38.370> process<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.270> to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
simple three-step process to do this to

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.370 
simple three-step process to do this to
discover<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.210> inequality<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.170> first

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
discover the inequality and the first

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.559 
discover the inequality and the first
step<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.830> simply<00:02:44.220> find<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> midpoint<00:02:45.210> of

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
step is simply find the midpoint of

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.360 
step is simply find the midpoint of
these<00:02:45.750> two<00:02:46.020> critical<00:02:46.860> values<00:02:46.950> these

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
these two critical values these

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.910 
these two critical values these
endpoints<00:02:47.670> ok<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:49.470> halfway<00:02:49.680> point

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
endpoints ok and then the halfway point

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.860 
endpoints ok and then the halfway point
between<00:02:50.370> negative<00:02:50.760> 3<00:02:51.180> &amp;<00:02:51.300> 5<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.350> 1<00:02:53.300> ok<00:02:54.300> and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
between negative 3 &amp; 5 would be 1 ok and

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.980 
between negative 3 &amp; 5 would be 1 ok and
it's<00:02:55.470> simply<00:02:56.459> taking<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.790> average<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.750> Plus

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
it's simply taking the average this Plus

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.410 
it's simply taking the average this Plus
this<00:02:58.020> is<00:02:58.319> 2<00:02:58.530> divided<00:02:58.980> by<00:02:59.010> 2<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.340> 1<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.940> notice

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
this is 2 divided by 2 is 1 and notice

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.420 
this is 2 divided by 2 is 1 and notice
it's<00:03:00.720> 4<00:03:00.959> units<00:03:01.260> from<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.770> 4<00:03:01.980> units<00:03:02.250> from

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
it's 4 units from here and 4 units from

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.400 
it's 4 units from here and 4 units from
there<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.270> let's<00:03:03.510> see<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:03.960> can<00:03:04.080> write<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
there so let's see if we can write the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.000 
there so let's see if we can write the
inequality<00:03:04.560> based<00:03:05.100> on<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.810> okay<00:03:07.010> we're

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
inequality based on that okay we're

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.809 
inequality based on that okay we're
taking<00:03:08.160> any

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
taking any

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.660 
taking any
of<00:03:08.939> X<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.450> what<00:03:09.569> we're<00:03:09.719> looking<00:03:10.049> for<00:03:10.099> okay<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
of X is what we're looking for okay and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.000 
of X is what we're looking for okay and
what<00:03:12.299> we<00:03:12.390> want<00:03:12.659> is<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.019> related<00:03:13.379> distance<00:03:13.859> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
what we want is this related distance is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.970 
what we want is this related distance is
the<00:03:14.189> distance<00:03:14.730> from<00:03:14.969> any<00:03:15.209> value<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.599> x<00:03:15.900> -<00:03:16.200> 1<00:03:16.409> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the distance from any value of x - 1 so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.000 
the distance from any value of x - 1 so
in<00:03:17.189> this<00:03:17.310> case<00:03:17.549> 5<00:03:17.879> -<00:03:18.120> 1<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.569> 4<00:03:18.870> units<00:03:19.230> negative<00:03:19.769> 3

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
in this case 5 - 1 is 4 units negative 3

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.610 
in this case 5 - 1 is 4 units negative 3
to<00:03:20.159> negative<00:03:20.489> 1<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.209> also<00:03:21.599> 4<00:03:21.900> units<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.409> just

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
to negative 1 is also 4 units just just

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.410 
to negative 1 is also 4 units just just
in<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.799> other<00:03:22.980> direction<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.329> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
in the other direction and then the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.140 
in the other direction and then the
absolute<00:03:24.840> value<00:03:25.349> and<00:03:25.700> we<00:03:26.700> want<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:26.939> to<00:03:27.060> be

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
absolute value and we want it to be

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.610 
absolute value and we want it to be
greater<00:03:27.450> than<00:03:27.659> on<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.930> outside

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
greater than on the outside

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.259 
greater than on the outside
must<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.069> greater<00:03:29.370> than<00:03:30.409> 4<00:03:31.409> units<00:03:31.769> okay<00:03:32.700> for

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
must be greater than 4 units okay for

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.979 
must be greater than 4 units okay for
this<00:03:33.480> way<00:03:34.250> for<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.489> way<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.599> our<00:03:36.780> final

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
this way for this way and so our final

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.410 
this way for this way and so our final
absolute<00:03:37.739> value<00:03:37.980> inequality<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:38.579> X<00:03:38.790> minus<00:03:39.209> 1

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.140 
absolute value inequality is X minus 1
is<00:03:39.689> the<00:03:40.019> absolute<00:03:40.680> value<00:03:41.010> of<00:03:41.040> X<00:03:41.310> minus<00:03:41.400> 1<00:03:41.879> is

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
is the absolute value of X minus 1 is

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
here was our first example we had X is

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.520 
here was our first example we had X is
greater<00:04:06.359> than<00:04:06.659> or<00:04:06.870> equal<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.409> absolute

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
greater than or equal to the absolute

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.970 
greater than or equal to the absolute
value<00:04:07.859> of<00:04:08.129> 5<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:09.379> notice<00:04:10.379> here<00:04:10.650> how<00:04:10.680> I've

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
value of 5 and notice here how I've

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.909 
value of 5 and notice here how I've
rewritten<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.579> X<00:04:11.879> -<00:04:12.480> 0<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.139> absolute<00:04:13.260> value<00:04:13.889> of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
rewritten it X - 0 the absolute value of

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.500 
rewritten it X - 0 the absolute value of
X<00:04:14.190> minus<00:04:14.280> 0<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.879> greater<00:04:15.090> than<00:04:15.180> equal<00:04:15.419> to<00:04:15.449> 5

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
X minus 0 is greater than equal to 5

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.360 
X minus 0 is greater than equal to 5
which<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.019> course<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.620> same<00:04:16.799> thing<00:04:17.099> as<00:04:17.220> the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
which of course is the same thing as the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.159 
which of course is the same thing as the
absolute<00:04:17.400> value<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:18.000> X<00:04:18.150> but<00:04:18.479> what<00:04:18.599> it<00:04:18.720> does<00:04:18.930> is

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
absolute value of X but what it does is

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.830 
absolute value of X but what it does is
it<00:04:19.349> emphasizes<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.449> a<00:04:21.479> statement

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
it emphasizes that this is a statement

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.080 
it emphasizes that this is a statement
that<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.560> difference<00:04:22.919> between<00:04:22.949> any<00:04:23.430> X<00:04:23.729> that

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
that the difference between any X that

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.469 
that the difference between any X that
you<00:04:24.120> choose<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.780> 0<00:04:25.849> must<00:04:26.849> be<00:04:26.970> greater<00:04:27.240> than<00:04:27.330> or

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
you choose and 0 must be greater than or

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.020 
you choose and 0 must be greater than or
equal<00:04:27.659> to<00:04:27.840> 5<00:04:28.139> units<00:04:28.409> so<00:04:29.159> here<00:04:29.370> we<00:04:29.460> have<00:04:29.610> our<00:04:29.639> 0

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
equal to 5 units so here we have our 0

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.570 
equal to 5 units so here we have our 0
as<00:04:30.210> our<00:04:30.300> metal<00:04:30.659> point<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.949> if<00:04:32.070> we<00:04:32.159> go<00:04:32.280> 5<00:04:32.550> units

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
as our metal point and if we go 5 units

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.000 
as our metal point and if we go 5 units
up<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.270> way<00:04:33.419> we're<00:04:33.630> at<00:04:33.690> 5<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.289> if<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:34.650> go<00:04:34.740> 5

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
up this way we're at 5 and if we go 5

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.379 
up this way we're at 5 and if we go 5
units<00:04:35.340> in<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.550> other<00:04:35.669> direction<00:04:35.880> we're<00:04:36.330> at

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
units in the other direction we're at

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.180 
units in the other direction we're at
negative<00:04:36.780> 5<00:04:37.020> so<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:37.710> wanted<00:04:37.919> to<00:04:38.039> use<00:04:38.159> that

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
negative 5 so I just wanted to use that

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.339 
negative 5 so I just wanted to use that
to<00:04:38.550> clarify<00:04:38.909> that<00:04:39.300> when<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.570> see<00:04:39.780> just<00:04:39.960> an<00:04:40.169> X

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
to clarify that when you see just an X

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.850 
to clarify that when you see just an X
it's<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.039> same<00:04:41.280> thing<00:04:41.550> as<00:04:41.699> X<00:04:41.940> -<00:04:42.330> 0<00:04:45.409> then<00:04:46.409> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
it's the same thing as X - 0 then the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.700 
it's the same thing as X - 0 then the
final<00:04:47.699> example<00:04:48.030> see<00:04:48.990> if<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.139> can<00:04:49.320> do<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.590> on

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
final example see if you can do it on

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.399 
final example see if you can do it on
your<00:04:49.740> own<00:04:50.060> here<00:04:51.060> we<00:04:51.150> have<00:04:51.360> negative<00:04:51.720> 7<00:04:52.260> and

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
your own here we have negative 7 and

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.040 
your own here we have negative 7 and
negative<00:04:52.440> 1<00:04:52.919> and<00:04:53.190> we<00:04:53.820> want<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.150> find<00:04:54.479> all<00:04:54.720> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
negative 1 and we want to find all the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.800 
negative 1 and we want to find all the
values<00:04:55.199> within<00:04:55.680> there<00:04:56.180> in<00:04:57.180> a<00:04:57.330> certain<00:04:57.630> range

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
values within there in a certain range

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.960 
values within there in a certain range
and<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.770> course<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.159> direct<00:04:59.490> way<00:04:59.669> to<00:04:59.699> write

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
and of course the direct way to write

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.330 
and of course the direct way to write
this<00:05:00.180> expression<00:05:00.510> would<00:05:00.810> be<00:05:00.870> simply<00:05:01.349> X<00:05:02.099> is

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
this expression would be simply X is

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.279 
this expression would be simply X is
between<00:05:02.490> negative<00:05:02.940> 7<00:05:03.539> and<00:05:03.780> less<00:05:04.050> than<00:05:04.169> or

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
between negative 7 and less than or

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.140 
between negative 7 and less than or
equal<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.590> negative<00:05:04.710> 1<00:05:04.919> including<00:05:05.699> because

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
equal to negative 1 including because

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.570 
equal to negative 1 including because
it's<00:05:06.300> a<00:05:06.330> closed<00:05:06.570> circle<00:05:07.280> you<00:05:08.280> could<00:05:08.370> also

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
it's a closed circle you could also

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.999 
it's a closed circle you could also
write<00:05:08.789> it<00:05:08.849> as<00:05:09.150> an<00:05:09.479> an<00:05:09.630> statement<00:05:10.289> X<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:10.770> less

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
write it as an an statement X is less

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.490 
write it as an an statement X is less
than<00:05:11.039> or<00:05:11.220> equal<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.639> 1<00:05:11.849> and<00:05:12.030> it's<00:05:12.690> also<00:05:12.900> less

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
than or equal to 1 and it's also less

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.159 
than or equal to 1 and it's also less
than<00:05:13.530> greater<00:05:14.099> than<00:05:14.190> and<00:05:14.340> then<00:05:14.880> negative<00:05:15.690> 7

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
than greater than and then negative 7

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.019 
than greater than and then negative 7
must<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.740> both<00:05:16.950> okay

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
must be both okay

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:20.540 
must be both okay
so<00:05:18.389> using<00:05:18.900> our<00:05:19.020> three-step<00:05:19.320> process<00:05:19.740> let's

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
so using our three-step process let's

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.220 
so using our three-step process let's
let's<00:05:20.940> come<00:05:21.120> up<00:05:21.150> with<00:05:21.360> an<00:05:21.479> absolute

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
let's come up with an absolute

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.160 
let's come up with an absolute
you<00:05:22.350> inequality<00:05:22.980> for<00:05:23.280> this<00:05:23.430> graph<00:05:24.050> what<00:05:25.050> is

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
you inequality for this graph what is

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.320 
you inequality for this graph what is
the<00:05:25.320> midpoint<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.280> midpoint<00:05:26.760> is<00:05:26.940> going<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.240> be

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
the midpoint the midpoint is going to be

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.140 
the midpoint the midpoint is going to be
negative<00:05:27.720> 4<00:05:27.990> negative<00:05:28.260> 7<00:05:29.220> plus<00:05:29.250> negative<00:05:29.670> 1<00:05:30.000> is

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
negative 4 negative 7 plus negative 1 is

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.500 
negative 4 negative 7 plus negative 1 is
negative<00:05:30.180> 8<00:05:30.870> divided<00:05:31.560> by<00:05:31.590> 2<00:05:31.710> is<00:05:32.070> negative<00:05:32.190> 4<00:05:32.700> so

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
negative 8 divided by 2 is negative 4 so

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.830 
negative 8 divided by 2 is negative 4 so
we<00:05:33.660> have<00:05:33.690> our<00:05:34.200> midpoint<00:05:35.630> there's<00:05:36.630> going<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.780> be

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
we have our midpoint there's going to be

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.710 
we have our midpoint there's going to be
X<00:05:37.080> minus<00:05:37.640> minus<00:05:38.640> 4<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.210> we're<00:05:39.360> looking<00:05:39.540> for

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
X minus minus 4 so we're looking for

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.350 
X minus minus 4 so we're looking for
distances<00:05:40.260> from<00:05:40.440> any<00:05:40.680> X<00:05:40.980> to<00:05:41.340> negative<00:05:41.370> 4<00:05:42.120> and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
distances from any X to negative 4 and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.020 
distances from any X to negative 4 and
it<00:05:43.320> has<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.650> be<00:05:43.710> less<00:05:44.010> than<00:05:44.070> we<00:05:44.580> want<00:05:44.760> it<00:05:44.820> within

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
it has to be less than we want it within

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.350 
it has to be less than we want it within
3<00:05:45.990> units<00:05:46.290> so<00:05:46.500> it's<00:05:46.830> going<00:05:46.920> to<00:05:47.010> be<00:05:47.070> less<00:05:47.280> than<00:05:47.360> 3

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
3 units so it's going to be less than 3

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.150 
3 units so it's going to be less than 3
units<00:05:48.750> and<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:49.020> course<00:05:49.050> we<00:05:49.320> tack<00:05:49.560> on<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.800> equal

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
units and of course we tack on the equal

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.500 
units and of course we tack on the equal
because<00:05:50.250> it<00:05:50.400> could<00:05:50.520> also<00:05:50.670> be<00:05:50.790> equal<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.330> 3

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
because it could also be equal to 3

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.990 
because it could also be equal to 3
units<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:51.870> there's<00:05:52.440> our<00:05:52.560> statement

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
units and there's our statement

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.030 
units and there's our statement
it<00:05:54.420> could<00:05:54.630> be<00:05:54.720> also<00:05:54.990> simplified<00:05:55.560> we<00:05:55.740> can<00:05:55.920> make

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
it could be also simplified we can make

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.870 
it could be also simplified we can make
it<00:05:56.220> the<00:05:56.370> absolute<00:05:56.730> value<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.090> x<00:05:57.480> plus<00:05:57.870> 4<00:05:58.880> is

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
it the absolute value of x plus 4 is

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.190 
it the absolute value of x plus 4 is
less<00:06:00.090> than<00:06:00.150> or<00:06:00.330> equal<00:06:00.420> to<00:06:00.600> 3<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:00.990> course

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.200 
less than or equal to 3 and of course

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.720 
less than or equal to 3 and of course
you<00:06:01.290> can<00:06:01.410> easily<00:06:01.710> check<00:06:01.920> it<00:06:02.100> you<00:06:02.220> just<00:06:02.400> plug<00:06:02.580> in

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:02.730 
you can easily check it you just plug in

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.850 
you can easily check it you just plug in
these<00:06:02.850> values<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:03.810> make<00:06:04.440> sure<00:06:04.590> that

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
these values and and make sure that

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.680 
these values and and make sure that
anything<00:06:05.190> outside<00:06:05.580> of<00:06:05.640> here<00:06:06.030> does<00:06:06.240> not<00:06:06.270> work

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
anything outside of here does not work

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.110 
anything outside of here does not work
and<00:06:07.680> again<00:06:07.800> it's<00:06:08.190> just<00:06:08.250> a<00:06:08.460> statement<00:06:08.700> the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
and again it's just a statement the

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
and again it's just a statement the
difference<00:06:09.540> between<00:06:09.690> X<00:06:10.440> and<00:06:10.830> negative<00:06:11.700> 4<00:06:12.180> must

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
difference between X and negative 4 must

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:35.020 
difference between X and negative 4 must
be<00:06:13.340> less<00:06:14.340> than<00:06:14.520> or<00:06:14.580> equal<00:06:14.700> to<00:06:15.000> 3<00:06:15.720> units

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.090
