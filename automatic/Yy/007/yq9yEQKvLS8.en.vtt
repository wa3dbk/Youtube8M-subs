00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
I like all seeing off all seeing is

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.729 
I like all seeing off all seeing is
pretty<00:03:37.639> cool<00:03:37.849> so<00:03:38.120> let's<00:03:38.389> try<00:03:39.349> to<00:03:39.379> max<00:03:41.680> see<00:03:42.680> if

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
pretty cool so let's try to max see if

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.520 
pretty cool so let's try to max see if
we<00:03:42.859> can<00:03:42.980> get<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.280> second<00:03:44.139> or<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.199> last

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
we can get the second or the last

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.199 
we can get the second or the last
evolution<00:03:46.010> actually<00:03:46.400> let's<00:03:46.699> put<00:03:46.879> those<00:03:47.030> in

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
evolution actually let's put those in

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.470 
evolution actually let's put those in
there<00:03:47.329> cuz<00:03:47.510> I'm<00:03:47.569> not<00:03:47.660> going<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.930> eat<00:03:47.989> them<00:03:49.480> now

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
there cuz I'm not going to eat them now

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.449 
there cuz I'm not going to eat them now
let's<00:03:50.659> try<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.260> to<00:03:51.680> level<00:03:51.919> 50<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.430> i

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
let's try to get the to level 50 so i

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.360 
let's try to get the to level 50 so i
can<00:03:52.760> show<00:03:52.909> you<00:03:52.940> guys<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.510> third<00:03:53.750> evolution<00:03:54.470> of

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
can show you guys the third evolution of

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.860 
can show you guys the third evolution of
glacial<00:03:55.730> regalia<00:03:56.650> that'd<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.739> pretty<00:03:57.949> sweet

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
glacial regalia that'd be pretty sweet

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.920 
glacial regalia that'd be pretty sweet
so<00:03:59.870> let's<00:04:00.109> put<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:00.650> all<00:04:00.859> in<00:04:00.889> there<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.930> like
