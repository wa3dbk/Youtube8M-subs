either<00:00:55.899> way<00:00:56.170> we'll<00:00:56.410> take<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.680> best<00:00:56.829> we<00:00:57.010> can

character<00:01:32.920> design<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.849> it's<00:01:33.940> character

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
character design I think it's character

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.449 
character design I think it's character
design<00:01:34.509> is<00:01:34.750> definitely<00:01:35.110> unique<00:01:35.289> it<00:01:36.099> kind<00:01:36.369> of

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:36.459 
design is definitely unique it kind of

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.029 
design is definitely unique it kind of
reminds<00:01:36.789> me<00:01:36.880> of<00:01:36.970> how<00:01:37.149> torian's<00:01:37.929> designs<00:01:38.709> are

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039

had happened a long time ago or

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.650 
had happened a long time ago or
something<00:02:24.580> like<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.819> because<00:02:25.150> he's<00:02:25.420> just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
something like that because he's just

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.650 
something like that because he's just
owning<00:02:26.200> Goku<00:02:26.950> in<00:02:27.129> Super<00:02:27.760> Saiyan<00:02:27.970> level<00:02:28.239> 3<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
may have trouble even messing with him

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.550 
may have trouble even messing with him
that's<00:02:49.000> how<00:02:49.150> powerful<00:02:49.360> he<00:02:49.720> has<00:02:50.080> become<00:02:50.410> at

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
that's how powerful he has become at

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.530 
that's how powerful he has become at
this<00:02:50.680> point<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.460> even<00:02:51.820> though<00:02:51.850> bills<00:02:52.300> is

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
this point so even though bills is

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.910 
this point so even though bills is
supposed<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.900> be<00:02:52.990> a<00:02:53.020> god<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> all<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.710> kind

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
supposed to be a god and all that kind

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550 
supposed to be a god and all that kind
of<00:02:53.950> stuff<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.400> still<00:02:55.240> tend<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.050> think<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.380> he

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
of stuff I still tend to think that he

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.020 
of stuff I still tend to think that he
would<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.830> a<00:02:56.860> way<00:02:57.100> harder<00:02:57.430> time<00:02:57.610> messing

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
would have a way harder time messing

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.880 
would have a way harder time messing
with<00:02:58.150> Goku<00:02:58.510> than<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:59.050> still<00:02:59.500> tend<00:02:59.740> to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
with Goku than that I still tend to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.130 
with Goku than that I still tend to
think<00:03:00.100> goku<00:03:00.610> super<00:03:00.760> saiyan<00:03:01.060> level<00:03:01.330> 3<00:03:01.540> it

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
think goku super saiyan level 3 it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.360 
think goku super saiyan level 3 it
doesn't<00:03:02.440> matter<00:03:02.500> who<00:03:02.740> you<00:03:02.920> are<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.220> that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
doesn't matter who you are in that

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.910 
doesn't matter who you are in that
Universal<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.300> know<00:03:04.450> you're<00:03:05.140> gonna<00:03:05.350> have<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
Universal you know you're gonna have to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.010 
Universal you know you're gonna have to
at<00:03:06.340> least<00:03:06.610> take<00:03:06.820> him<00:03:07.000> seriously<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.900> he

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
at least take him seriously and he

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.300 
at least take him seriously and he
wouldn't<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.320> be<00:03:08.560> owned<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.860> in<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.070> way<00:03:09.100> so

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
wouldn't just be owned it in that way so

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.040 
wouldn't just be owned it in that way so
he<00:03:09.610> does<00:03:09.760> say<00:03:09.970> before<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.390> he<00:03:10.660> remembers

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
he does say before that he remembers

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.660 
he does say before that he remembers
them<00:03:11.200> from<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.500> dream<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.160> something<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.490> saw

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
them from a dream or something you saw

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
in a dream so maybe that clip is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160 
in a dream so maybe that clip is
supposed<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.370> be<00:03:15.490> referring<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:16.060> his<00:03:16.630> dream

because<00:03:20.710> I<00:03:20.980> would<00:03:21.130> think<00:03:21.220> he'd<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.460> a

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
because I would think he'd have a

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.980 
because I would think he'd have a
tougher<00:03:21.850> time<00:03:21.880> than<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.240> messing<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.840> him

tougher time than that messing with him
I<00:03:23.080> really<00:03:23.290> don't<00:03:23.440> think<00:03:23.500> he<00:03:23.710> would<00:03:23.830> roll<00:03:24.040> Goku

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.620 
I really don't think he would roll Goku
like<00:03:24.610> that<00:03:24.820> with<00:03:24.970> his<00:03:25.060> hands<00:03:25.240> behind<00:03:25.390> his<00:03:25.600> back

like<00:03:38.980> I<00:03:39.100> I<00:03:39.460> just<00:03:39.850> tend<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.270> nobody<00:03:40.570> would

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
like I I just tend to think nobody would

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.450 
like I I just tend to think nobody would
really<00:03:40.900> do<00:03:40.990> that<00:03:41.020> super<00:03:41.500> sale<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.920> 3<00:03:42.100> dokie

really do that super sale of a 3 dokie

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.430 
really do that super sale of a 3 dokie
so<00:03:42.910> all<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.540> i<00:03:43.750> mean<00:03:43.900> he's<00:03:44.170> one<00:03:44.380> of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
so all there is to it i mean he's one of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.650 
so all there is to it i mean he's one of
the<00:03:44.530> strongest<00:03:44.590> even<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:46.120> period<00:03:46.540> even

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
the strongest even just period even

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.270 
the strongest even just period even
among<00:03:47.020> gods<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.500> all<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.770> a<00:03:47.800> lot<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.070> them
