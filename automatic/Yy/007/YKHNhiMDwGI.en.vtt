Cubs kind of an add-on so we were

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.950 
Cubs kind of an add-on so we were

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
thinking like would it be really really

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.689 
thinking like would it be really really
cool<00:00:29.320> if<00:00:29.859> you<00:00:29.980> could<00:00:30.130> make<00:00:30.249> a<00:00:30.279> game<00:00:30.519> that<00:00:30.609> was

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
cool if you could make a game that was

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.700 
cool if you could make a game that was
totally<00:00:31.210> focused<00:00:31.630> on<00:00:31.720> coop<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.290> the<00:00:32.439> people

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
totally focused on coop and the people

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.560 
totally focused on coop and the people
like<00:00:32.829> yeah<00:00:33.010> that<00:00:33.280> just<00:00:33.309> caught<00:00:33.850> on<00:00:33.879> and<00:00:34.420> then

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
like yeah that just caught on and then

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.209 
like yeah that just caught on and then
we<00:00:34.899> came<00:00:35.109> up<00:00:35.140> with<00:00:35.379> the<00:00:35.469> idea<00:00:35.500> for<00:00:35.770> private

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
we came up with the idea for private

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.709 
we came up with the idea for private
military<00:00:36.370> corporations<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.270> sort<00:00:37.480> of<00:00:37.510> make

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
military corporations to sort of make

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.020 
military corporations to sort of make
that<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.050> universe<00:00:38.559> around<00:00:39.039> which<00:00:39.309> co-op<00:00:39.760> fit

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
that the universe around which co-op fit

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.880 
that the universe around which co-op fit
so<00:00:40.239> that's<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.660> genesis<00:00:41.199> of<00:00:41.350> all<00:00:41.530> this<00:00:41.710> and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
so that's with genesis of all this and

the enemies and then from there it just

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.310 
the enemies and then from there it just
expands<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.660> gameplay<00:03:20.960> because<00:03:21.200> you're
