00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:14.389
 Boot out and there guys, ailson. 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.720
 now I'm bringing a 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.380
 mini games game called the dragons together 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.960
 from the 60's to here the escape of a drug 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.070
 drug script a little tip behind 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.520
 ramon dragon dragons can break 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.790
 then dragon a little the sound that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.290
 look it gets has to be a good face 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.430
 too crazy to be able to pass this here 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.390
 was a bad eiro parkour is this 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 occur the cruise is on this map that 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.700
 very small so I know you have to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.990
 to do exactly is not very sparing 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.720
 some 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.050
 So we have to keep thinking. 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.460
 that running it has no way 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.420
 now I found it very interesting and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.550
 I found this interesting and useful 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:10.250
 maine blacks mariflex he has several 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.710
 different and original things from himself 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.170
 which is a very good thing and craft 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:22.180
 original bet in the seventeenth century on ipi 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:24.430
 in the description of the mother almost win this 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:33.080
 because I understood more or less what 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:37.670
 no no no no no occupy the water 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.720
 takes a lot giving then was gave up dragon 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.720
 spend here love 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.520
 Now he fucked is life, he is going 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.070
 recovering the mother that dragons look at 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.850
 no no no no no no no 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.520
 not 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.610
 so I could not have a team 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.610
 Uploading now was from baby mama 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.760
 now it seems that he is now like Pedro 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.610
 pedro bmc know each other 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.830
 speak in the video even his type there is is okay 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:24.120
 a no no no no no no no no no 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:26.040
 No, no, do not do not bring the guys here. 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.390
 matter, I ended up dying 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 I'll see if I can and another from here. 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.420
 little I 'm back only a minute 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.760
 so they come back from engines in 50ยบ 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.760
 since it is all very easy to have 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.660
 shown in fact begins there 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.769
 2 the cable and we have to run 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.910
 motherfucker of the dragon 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.110
 I do not know if there was a very 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.630
 great of three waterways skateboard your 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.130
 They have different names but 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.920
 I heard the same thing 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.820
 The basic difference is that I realized it is 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.700
 that in the escape dragon is more sparse and here 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.739
 We run and then we know. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.320
 I'm wrong, correct me, right? 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.320
 As I always say this for fear of 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.660
 speak shit 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.660
 ai there 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.019
 they keep throwing things on the map 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.430
 on the map interest in running 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.350
 basically if you stop this 20 map is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.690
 much is too much of the time time 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.560
 even at the beginning of the video and expression 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.519
 more flex is the sp 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:42.720
 It's true, Mommy. 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:46.370
 now is the time is now now to mine 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.370
 flies came 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.239
 in of jesus christ 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.269
 so now I'm back I think 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.129
 that recording that said is not that I 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.980
 died in the poses or whatever 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:03.000
 then on the other parkour wave the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.310
 dragon escape is like that one here 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.040
 I died with two seconds black because no 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.409
 end of a long way because the fota 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:17.070
 crazy 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:19.650
 the hand is in the front came running going 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.910
 run the ballot but break 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.910
