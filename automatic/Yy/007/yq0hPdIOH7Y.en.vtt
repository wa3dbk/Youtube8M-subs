00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.340
 I study tutorials to make a 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.870
 explanation and demonstration of how 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.389
 walk robots 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.710
 there are some to see you know but the step of 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.710
 that city back 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.610
 and there are two ways to pass so to speak 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.150
 which speed keys pulling the ball 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.740
 when our partner is older 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.640
 distance could not be done 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.140
 so normal without giving it the effect 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 good 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 well 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.430
 we take him from the waist 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.530
 with the arms while the arm of 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:52.199
 outside 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.199
 the turn and the inside with the thumb 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.070
 then this hand we would take it 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.510
 little further back to give strength to 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 ball and this to give you the address 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.360
 the hands that end where we want them 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.640
 go to go the ball 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.150
 the other one is from the position 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.150
 What is it 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.960
 it would always be from the ground then it is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.760
 similar to the position d is almost equal 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.300
 the position of the hands the same as 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.300
 we start from 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 when doing this pass we step on the next 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.920
 of the ball to know where it is located 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.140
 we stretch a leg because we observe 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.260
 the same position as before and we have 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.970
 that with our body 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.710
 press for the ball to catch more 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.370
 strength and greater travel 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.370
 always looking at me 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.540
 or not
