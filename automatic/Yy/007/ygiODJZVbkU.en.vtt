00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
of the game and I think we've had a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.730 
of the game and I think we've had a
struggle<00:00:27.060> with<00:00:27.269> those<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.810> closing<00:00:28.260> games<00:00:28.470> on

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
was a better one since I mean winners

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450

win<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.630> Cincinnati<00:01:10.500> gating<00:01:10.799> was

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
win to me I think Cincinnati gating was

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
win to me I think Cincinnati gating was
good<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:11.820> us<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> fight

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
good for us because you have to fight

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
good for us because you have to fight
all<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.400> really

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
all the way do you know they're really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.980 
all the way do you know they're really
good<00:01:14.820> team<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.119> high<00:01:15.210> team<00:01:15.450> right<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
good team your high team right now so I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350 
good team your high team right now so I
feel<00:01:16.200> like<00:01:16.290> after<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.850> since<00:01:17.970> nervous

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
feel like after I think since nervous

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.749 
feel like after I think since nervous
but<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.659> would<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> our<00:01:20.220> 16<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
but it would for us to one of our 16 so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.500 
but it would for us to one of our 16 so
absolutely

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
absolutely

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.580 
absolutely
so<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.920> both<00:01:23.070> movie<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.550> a<00:01:23.580> win<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.910> me<00:01:24.590> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so I think both movie is a win to me I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.340 
so I think both movie is a win to me I
think<00:01:26.580> both<00:01:26.940> one<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> gradient<00:01:27.450> Cincinnati

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
think both one is a gradient Cincinnati

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.760 
think both one is a gradient Cincinnati
was<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.850> learning<00:01:29.850> experience<00:01:30.270> because<00:01:30.690> we<00:01:31.650> got

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
was a learning experience because we got

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.960 
was a learning experience because we got
the<00:01:31.860> grind<00:01:32.100> through<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> whole<00:01:32.580> game<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the grind through the whole game like

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.820 
the grind through the whole game like
you've<00:01:33.180> already<00:01:33.420> said<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.020> he<00:01:34.620> came<00:01:34.800> down

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
you've already said and he came down

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.070 
you've already said and he came down
from<00:01:35.190> tipping<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.300> the<00:01:36.420> buzzer<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:36.900> in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
from tipping at the buzzer you know in

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.810 
from tipping at the buzzer you know in
this<00:01:37.710> game<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> also<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> learning

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this game it also was a learning

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.770 
this game it also was a learning
experience<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.300> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.750> first

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
experience because this is the first

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.350 
experience because this is the first
time<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.800> close<00:01:41.370> out<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> game<00:01:41.700> when

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
time we actually close out a game when

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
time we actually close out a game when
the<00:01:42.630> team<00:01:42.810> was<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:43.440> had<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.770> spread

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the team was they had little spread

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.890 
the team was they had little spread
towards<00:01:44.460> end<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.820> game<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.420> think<00:01:45.810> they

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
towards end of the game and I think they

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.950 
towards end of the game and I think they
got<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.350> 10<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:47.400> were<00:01:47.550> tired<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> we

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
got it to 10 we were tired and we

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.450 
got it to 10 we were tired and we
returned<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.530> around<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.460> close<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.820> game

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
returned it around in and close the game

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.670 
returned it around in and close the game
without<00:01:53.460> logos<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.120> finances<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.410> think<00:01:55.590> he

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
without logos for finances you think he

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.830 
without logos for finances you think he
gets<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> our<00:01:56.040> perspective<00:01:57.110> as<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> freshman

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
gets in our perspective as a freshman

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.330 
gets in our perspective as a freshman
altec<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> because<00:02:01.170> II<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.860> don't<00:02:02.130> know

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
altec so because II just don't know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.540 
altec so because II just don't know
almost<00:02:03.090> every<00:02:03.360> night<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.830> consistent

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
almost every night it's consistent

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.640 
almost every night it's consistent
