k-cup<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:33.260> absolutely<00:03:33.950> perfect<00:03:34.129> there's<00:03:34.610> no

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
k-cup it's absolutely perfect there's no

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.500

there's no need to keep buying over and
over<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:41.440> think<00:03:42.440> those<00:03:42.590> those<00:03:43.129> fake<00:03:43.400> cups<00:03:43.610> are

over I think those those fake cups are

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.460 
over I think those those fake cups are
such<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.090> waste<00:03:44.390> of<00:03:44.540> money<00:03:46.480> because<00:03:47.480> with<00:03:48.349> this

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
such a waste of money because with this

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.830 
such a waste of money because with this
you<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:48.800> buy<00:03:48.920> as<00:03:49.129> much<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.450> coffee<00:03:50.629> that

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
you can buy as much of the coffee that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.250 
you can buy as much of the coffee that
you<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:52.120> see<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.390> already<00:03:53.930> had<00:03:54.050> some

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
you like and see I already had some

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.170 
you like and see I already had some
liquid<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:54.709> there<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.099> it<00:03:55.250> came<00:03:55.519> up<00:03:55.700> higher<00:03:55.849> but

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
liquid in there so it came up higher but

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.070 
liquid in there so it came up higher but
anyways<00:03:57.459> when<00:03:58.459> you're<00:03:58.580> done<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.000> just<00:03:59.080> lift

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
anyways when you're done you just lift

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.170 
anyways when you're done you just lift
it<00:04:00.260> off<00:04:00.409> it's<00:04:00.769> not<00:04:00.950> even<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.400> hot<00:04:01.580> I<00:04:01.909> mean

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
it off it's not even that hot I mean

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.270 
it off it's not even that hot I mean
it's<00:04:02.720> a<00:04:02.810> little<00:04:03.019> warm<00:04:03.379> but<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:03.950> can<00:04:04.099> still

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
it's a little warm but you can still

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.100 
it's a little warm but you can still
take<00:04:04.819> it<00:04:05.000> right<00:04:05.090> out<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.420> very<00:04:05.510> awesome

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
take it right out it's very awesome

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:14.320 
take it right out it's very awesome
design<00:04:08.500> go<00:04:09.500> back<00:04:09.680> over<00:04:09.980> here<00:04:12.909> you<00:04:13.909> just<00:04:14.120> rinse

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
design go back over here you just rinse

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:36.580 
design go back over here you just rinse
off<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.690> lid<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:34.330> then<00:04:35.330> a<00:04:35.750> little<00:04:36.349> coffee

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
off the lid and then a little coffee

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.050 
off the lid and then a little coffee
grinds

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.650 

I<00:04:42.620> think<00:04:43.669> that<00:04:44.669> one's<00:04:44.850> easy<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.150> wash<00:04:45.270> off<00:04:45.450> and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
I think that one's easy to wash off and

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.610 
I think that one's easy to wash off and
then<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.350> just<00:04:46.530> set<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.830> aside<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:48.290> dry

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
then you just set it aside to dry

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.580 
then you just set it aside to dry
that's<00:04:50.400> it<00:04:50.550> all<00:04:51.980> right

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
that's it all right

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.810 
that's it all right
