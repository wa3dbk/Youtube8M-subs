00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.330
 The iiss 9 new year intro and new design 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.280
 of letter our kitty nails for 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 this tutorial we're going to need a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.990
 clear enamel a black color a mobile 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 pink and a thin skewer let's paint 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.340
 the base of our nails with enamel 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.369
 clear and on the ring finger we're going to do 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 a half moon in the publicanos and the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.199
 we are going to fill in and in the other fingers 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.150
 we are going to paint them as it has dried 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.000
 let's put in a bit advance of the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.739
 clear enamel and with a thin football 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.450
 let's use two diagonal lines in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.270
 the edges these are going to be the ears 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.660
 of the natives and then we're going to 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660
 Fill 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.930
 then with a little black nail polish and 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 the help of a baby team we are going to 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.590
 use balls in all our nails 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 light color 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.490
 You can only use it long ago 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 two nails the others can be 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.810
 normal or you can add a brightness and 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.970
 whatever you want 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.920
 then to make the kitten we are going to 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.729
 use two eyeballs with a 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.729
 brush gone off 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.830
 let's do an inverse triangle for 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.050
 nose 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.050
 and two curves for the mouth 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.480
 ah 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.060
 then we are going to use the whiskers of 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.330
 making diagonal lines next to the 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.330
 nose 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.140
 after painting the little ones in all 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 these nails so our design remains 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.039
 a very simple man but they look very 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.049
