so it's lots of tips and tricks really
advanced<00:00:23.600> driving<00:00:23.869> on<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.170> am<00:00:24.410> driving

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
advanced driving on the I am driving

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.189 
advanced driving on the I am driving
really<00:00:24.980> it's<00:00:25.160> just<00:00:25.310> it's<00:00:25.880> a<00:00:26.029> system<00:00:26.449> and<00:00:26.840> it's

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
really it's just it's a system and it's

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.330 
really it's just it's a system and it's
just<00:00:27.320> lofted<00:00:27.590> at<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.740> tips<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.039> tricks<00:00:28.130> on

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
just lofted at the tips and tricks on

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.470 
just lofted at the tips and tricks on
top<00:00:28.460> of<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.609> it's<00:00:28.760> just<00:00:28.910> well<00:00:29.269> probably

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
top of that it's just well probably

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.970 
top of that it's just well probably
little<00:00:29.720> more<00:00:29.900> than<00:00:29.990> that<00:00:30.050> it's<00:00:30.199> a<00:00:30.230> system<00:00:30.410> it's

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
little more than that it's a system it's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.409 
little more than that it's a system it's
observation<00:00:31.580> its<00:00:31.699> training<00:00:32.029> yourself<00:00:32.180> to

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
observation its training yourself to

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.750 
observation its training yourself to
look<00:00:32.629> for<00:00:33.230> hazards<00:00:33.350> and<00:00:33.650> look<00:00:33.830> ahead<00:00:33.949> look

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
look for hazards and look ahead look

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.890 
look for hazards and look ahead look
ahead<00:00:34.879> further<00:00:35.269> than<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.540> probably<00:00:35.690> would

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:35.900 
ahead further than you probably would

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.630 
ahead further than you probably would
have<00:00:36.049> been<00:00:36.140> before<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.010> know<00:00:37.129> it<00:00:37.250> depends<00:00:37.489> on

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
have been before you know it depends on

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.579 
have been before you know it depends on
the<00:00:37.699> driver<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.540> certainly<00:00:39.320> us<00:00:39.440> what<00:00:39.530> it

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
the driver but and certainly us what it

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.110 
the driver but and certainly us what it
did<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.769> for<00:00:39.890> me<00:00:39.979> it<00:00:40.280> made<00:00:40.549> me<00:00:40.580> look<00:00:40.760> much

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
did it for me it made me look much

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.280 
did it for me it made me look much
further<00:00:41.299> ahead<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.809> made<00:00:41.900> me<00:00:41.989> think<00:00:42.019> about

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
further ahead and made me think about

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.750 
further ahead and made me think about
what<00:00:42.409> I'm<00:00:42.620> doing<00:00:42.650> they<00:00:43.190> would<00:00:43.250> concentrate<00:00:43.610> a

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
what I'm doing they would concentrate a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.610 
what I'm doing they would concentrate a
lot<00:00:43.879> more<00:00:44.120> it's<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.989> really<00:00:45.170> good<00:00:45.290> thing<00:00:45.409> to<00:00:45.440> do

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
lot more it's a really good thing to do

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.350 
lot more it's a really good thing to do
and<00:00:48.309> yeah<00:00:49.309> so<00:00:49.519> it's<00:00:49.760> basically<00:00:50.089> what<00:00:50.299> I'm

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
and yeah so it's basically what I'm

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.729 
and yeah so it's basically what I'm
saying<00:00:50.600> is<00:00:50.720> that<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.080> advanced<00:00:51.470> you<00:00:51.589> know

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
saying is that the advanced you know

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.170 
saying is that the advanced you know
catastrophize<00:00:52.309> driving<00:00:52.640> test<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.879> not<00:00:53.030> that

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
catastrophize driving test is not that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.729 
catastrophize driving test is not that
difficult<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:54.049> just<00:00:54.110> basically<00:00:54.409> nervous

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
difficult it's just basically nervous

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.530 
difficult it's just basically nervous
system<00:00:55.040> learn<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.970> look<00:00:56.119> ahead<00:00:56.239> a<00:00:56.360> little<00:00:56.420> bit

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
system learn to look ahead a little bit

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.240 
system learn to look ahead a little bit
more<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.930> then<00:00:57.229> learned<00:00:57.500> some<00:00:57.739> tips<00:00:57.890> tricks

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
more and then learned some tips tricks

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.369 
more and then learned some tips tricks
and<00:00:58.400> pass<00:00:59.119> those<00:00:59.269> on<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.420> other<00:00:59.570> people<00:00:59.930> you

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
and pass those on to other people you

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.899 
and pass those on to other people you
know<00:01:00.500> it's<00:01:00.650> all<00:01:00.769> about<00:01:00.799> learning<00:01:01.640> from<00:01:01.760> each

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
know it's all about learning from each

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.270 
know it's all about learning from each
other<00:01:02.059> really<00:01:02.269> so

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
other really so

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.800 
other really so
watching<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.030> one<00:01:05.120> who's<00:01:05.239> going<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.420> cross

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
watching the one who's going to cross

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.270 
watching the one who's going to cross
the<00:01:05.930> path<00:01:06.110> potential<00:01:06.530> here's<00:01:06.680> fine<00:01:06.920> shoulder

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
the path potential here's fine shoulder

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.410 
the path potential here's fine shoulder
check<00:01:07.430> both<00:01:07.550> sides<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.030> good<00:01:08.150> idea

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
check both sides it's good idea

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.180 
check both sides it's good idea
occasionally<00:01:09.380> when<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.620> suspect<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.100> you

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
occasionally when you suspect it's you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.980 
occasionally when you suspect it's you

cyclists coming up then Frank keep the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.550 
cyclists coming up then Frank keep the
vehicle<00:01:26.690> moving<00:01:26.869> here<00:01:27.140> my<00:01:27.229> don't<00:01:27.380> think<00:01:27.500> I'll

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
vehicle moving here my don't think I'll

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.109 
vehicle moving here my don't think I'll
be<00:01:27.650> able<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.490> I'm<00:01:28.550> gonna<00:01:28.640> do<00:01:28.790> is<00:01:28.880> put<00:01:29.000> in<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
be able to so I'm gonna do is put in the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.070 
be able to so I'm gonna do is put in the
closure<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.390> just<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.720> little<00:01:29.840> bit<00:01:29.990> of

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
closure and just a little bit of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.830 
closure and just a little bit of
tactical<00:01:30.500> coasting<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.070> then<00:01:31.700> stopping<00:01:32.060> with

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
tactical coasting and then stopping with

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.120 
tactical coasting and then stopping with
sufficient<00:01:33.290> distance<00:01:33.410> in<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.770> one<00:01:33.860> in<00:01:33.950> front

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
sufficient distance in the one in front

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.530 
sufficient distance in the one in front
so<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.550> can<00:01:34.700> see<00:01:34.820> some<00:01:34.970> tarmac<00:01:36.009> if<00:01:37.540> that

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
so that I can see some tarmac if that

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.850 
so that I can see some tarmac if that
means<00:01:38.720> basically<00:01:38.960> if<00:01:39.140> he<00:01:39.229> breaks<00:01:39.410> down<00:01:39.590> or<00:01:39.800> if

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
means basically if he breaks down or if

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.410 
means basically if he breaks down or if
it<00:01:39.950> rolls<00:01:40.100> back<00:01:40.220> a<00:01:40.369> little<00:01:40.550> bit<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:41.180> I<00:01:41.240> have<00:01:41.360> a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
it rolls back a little bit and I have a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.760 
it rolls back a little bit and I have a
look<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.660> space<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:42.140> something<00:01:42.440> about<00:01:42.500> it

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
look that space to do something about it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.900 
look that space to do something about it
if<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.009> breaks<00:01:43.130> now<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.399> can<00:01:43.550> get<00:01:43.640> around<00:01:43.700> them

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
if it breaks now I can get around them

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.600 
if it breaks now I can get around them
if<00:01:44.000> your<00:01:44.090> rolls<00:01:44.240> back<00:01:44.479> I<00:01:44.720> can<00:01:45.259> I<00:01:45.649> can<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.399> know

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
if your rolls back I can I can you know

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.800 
if your rolls back I can I can you know

rest<00:02:02.840> because<00:02:03.590> basically<00:02:03.890> what<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.220> want<00:02:04.340> to

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
rest because basically what you want to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.160 
rest because basically what you want to
do<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.550> get<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.729> handbrake<00:02:05.060> on<00:02:05.210> first<00:02:05.509> that

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
do is get the handbrake on first that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.169 
do is get the handbrake on first that
gets<00:02:06.350> the<00:02:06.440> current<00:02:06.680> of<00:02:06.740> control<00:02:07.039> so<00:02:07.789> even<00:02:08.090> if

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
gets the current of control so even if

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.310 
gets the current of control so even if
you're<00:02:08.269> hitting<00:02:08.420> behind<00:02:08.600> yourselves<00:02:09.080> you're

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
you're hitting behind yourselves you're

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
handbrake on first so shoulder checking

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.320 
handbrake on first so shoulder checking
on<00:02:21.950> your<00:02:22.070> side<00:02:22.220> plenty<00:02:22.459> reflections<00:02:23.120> here<00:02:23.209> to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
on your side plenty reflections here to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.000 
on your side plenty reflections here to
look<00:02:23.450> at<00:02:23.600> just<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> see<00:02:24.380> if<00:02:24.500> doesn't<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.890> know

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
look at just to see if doesn't you know

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
look at just to see if doesn't you know
we<00:02:25.610> can<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:25.850> little<00:02:26.090> more<00:02:26.269> than<00:02:26.420> with<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
we can see little more than with the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.180 
we can see little more than with the
view<00:02:26.959> our<00:02:27.110> direct<00:02:27.320> view<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.560> affording<00:02:27.920> us<00:02:27.980> but

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
view our direct view is affording us but

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.240 
view our direct view is affording us but
probably<00:02:28.400> not<00:02:28.640> too<00:02:28.760> much<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.000> moment

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.680 

okay<00:02:34.250> it's<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.519> keeping<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.879> rolling<00:02:35.239> this

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
okay it's just keeping it rolling this

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.390 
okay it's just keeping it rolling this
is<00:02:35.840> another<00:02:35.959> thing<00:02:36.200> another<00:02:36.650> goal<00:02:37.010> relieved

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
is another thing another goal relieved

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.190 
is another thing another goal relieved
of<00:02:37.670> driving<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.330> vehicle<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.930> keep<00:02:39.080> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
of driving the vehicle is to keep the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.960 
of driving the vehicle is to keep the
vehicle<00:02:39.349> rolling<00:02:39.769> forward<00:02:40.099> or<00:02:40.280> as<00:02:40.640> much<00:02:40.849> as

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
vehicle rolling forward or as much as

vehicle rolling forward or as much as
possible<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.019> way<00:02:42.049> to<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.530> and

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
possible and the way to do that and

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.050 
possible and the way to do that and
everyone<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.129> front<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.400> fairness<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:43.819> doing

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
everyone in front in fairness is doing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.699 
everyone in front in fairness is doing
it<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.269> certain<00:02:44.420> extent<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:45.260> even<00:02:45.500> if<00:02:45.620> it

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
it to a certain extent it's even if it

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.140 
it to a certain extent it's even if it
likes<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.980> red<00:02:46.129> now<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:46.489> a<00:02:46.519> headlights<00:02:47.000> are

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
likes a red now you see a headlights are

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.880 
likes a red now you see a headlights are
red<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.420> education<00:02:48.019> is<00:02:48.080> crossing<00:02:48.410> there<00:02:48.560> I'm

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
red and education is crossing there I'm

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.110 
red and education is crossing there I'm
gonna<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.160> believe<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.459> second<00:02:49.819> that's<00:02:49.910> fine

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
gonna do believe in second that's fine

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.880 
gonna do believe in second that's fine
but<00:02:50.239> still<00:02:50.390> at<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.629> car<00:02:50.780> crawl<00:02:51.080> up<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.500> at<00:02:51.830> a

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
but still at the car crawl up I'm at a

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.289 
but still at the car crawl up I'm at a
time<00:02:52.099> that<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.459> vehicles<00:02:52.760> in<00:02:52.819> front<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.060> stop

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
time that the vehicles in front of stop

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.580 
time that the vehicles in front of stop
can<00:02:53.480> start<00:02:53.660> moving<00:02:53.959> forward<00:02:54.080> again<00:02:54.379> hopefully

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
can start moving forward again hopefully

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.259 
can start moving forward again hopefully
the<00:02:55.099> lights<00:02:55.250> will<00:02:55.370> be<00:02:55.430> green<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> time<00:02:56.239> I

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
the lights will be green and the time I

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.220 
the lights will be green and the time I
get<00:02:56.510> there<00:02:56.599> I'll<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:56.900> able<00:02:56.959> to<00:02:57.079> keep<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
get there I'll just be able to keep the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.289 
get there I'll just be able to keep the
vehicle<00:02:57.379> rolling<00:02:57.799> and<00:02:57.950> by<00:02:58.790> doing<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.060> we're

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
vehicle rolling and by doing that we're

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.670 
vehicle rolling and by doing that we're
saving<00:02:59.659> some<00:02:59.780> fuel<00:03:00.110> making<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.530> ride

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
saving some fuel making the ride

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.110 
saving some fuel making the ride
smoother<00:03:01.099> we're<00:03:01.280> making<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.549> safer<00:03:01.909> really

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
smoother we're making it safer really

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.240 
smoother we're making it safer really
because<00:03:03.110> we<00:03:03.200> don't<00:03:03.349> have<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.680> come<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.220> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
because we don't have to come to a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.130 
because we don't have to come to a
complete<00:03:04.519> stop<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.910> then<00:03:05.000> you<00:03:05.209> know<00:03:05.329> risk

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
complete stop and then you know risk

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.509 
complete stop and then you know risk
someone<00:03:06.440> under<00:03:06.620> taking<00:03:06.950> us<00:03:07.069> wasn't<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.370> that

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
someone under taking us wasn't like that

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.670 
someone under taking us wasn't like that
and<00:03:07.700> then<00:03:08.030> we're<00:03:08.359> also<00:03:08.510> just<00:03:09.049> saving<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.620> little

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
and then we're also just saving a little

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.740 
and then we're also just saving a little
bit<00:03:09.859> of<00:03:09.950> wear<00:03:10.069> and<00:03:10.099> tear<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.489> car<00:03:10.670> really

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.660 

okay<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.470> that's<00:03:15.650> not<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:15.920> clear<00:03:16.040> now<00:03:16.160> Junction

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
okay so that's not so clear now Junction

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.220 
okay so that's not so clear now Junction

give it to her you know sometimes I

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:24.580 
give it to her you know sometimes I
might<00:03:23.780> have<00:03:23.870> done<00:03:23.989> there<00:03:24.140> I<00:03:24.170> might<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.500> let

might have done there I might just let
her<00:03:24.680> out<00:03:24.769> but<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.010> would<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.310> certainly<00:03:26.000> not

held flat headlamp flashed her and for
that<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:27.829> wouldn't<00:03:28.099> ever<00:03:28.340> recommend<00:03:28.910> her<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.030> do

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
that I wouldn't ever recommend her to do

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.440 
that I wouldn't ever recommend her to do
that<00:03:29.680> well<00:03:30.819> then<00:03:31.819> keep<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.150> around<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.420> the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
that well then keep it around to the

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.569 
that well then keep it around to the
left<00:03:32.629> here<00:03:32.780> we're<00:03:32.900> gonna<00:03:33.019> take<00:03:33.200> the<00:03:33.319> left<00:03:33.579> exit

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
left here we're gonna take the left exit

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.940 
left here we're gonna take the left exit
here<00:03:34.819> shoulder<00:03:35.780> check<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.560> just<00:03:36.709> keeping

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
here shoulder check and just keeping

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.460 
here shoulder check and just keeping
around<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.370> left<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:39.019> position<00:03:39.139> of<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
around to the left the position of the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.629 
around to the left the position of the
car<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.709> my<00:03:39.799> view<00:03:40.010> there<00:03:40.130> was<00:03:40.310> no<00:03:40.430> one<00:03:40.549> around

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
car in my view there was no one around

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.009 
car in my view there was no one around
really<00:03:41.030> depletion<00:03:41.359> of<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.510> car<00:03:41.690> was<00:03:41.840> enough

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
really depletion of the car was enough

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.569 
really depletion of the car was enough
to<00:03:42.169> signal<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> vehicles<00:03:42.829> behind<00:03:43.099> my

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
to signal to the vehicles behind my

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.339 
to signal to the vehicles behind my
intentions<00:03:44.030> there's<00:03:44.599> only<00:03:44.750> two<00:03:44.900> lanes<00:03:45.109> here

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
intentions there's only two lanes here

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.440 
intentions there's only two lanes here
but<00:03:46.340> again<00:03:46.519> if<00:03:46.639> you<00:03:46.700> wanted<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.060> signal<00:03:47.359> they

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
but again if you wanted a signal they

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.280 
but again if you wanted a signal they
wouldn't<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.870> wouldn't<00:03:48.079> do<00:03:48.139> any<00:03:48.260> harm

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
wouldn't it wouldn't do any harm

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.140 
wouldn't it wouldn't do any harm
whatsoever<00:03:50.230> so<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.819> don't<00:03:52.819> know<00:03:52.880> if<00:03:53.000> I'm

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
whatsoever so I don't know if I'm

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.440 
whatsoever so I don't know if I'm
getting<00:03:53.419> across<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.790> what<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.150> system<00:03:56.419> is

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
getting across but what the system is

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.830 
getting across but what the system is
all<00:03:56.569> about<00:03:56.810> here<00:03:57.049> really

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
all about here really

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.750 
all about here really
so<00:03:59.800> let's<00:03:59.920> check<00:04:00.010> both<00:04:00.160> sides<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.670> move

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
so let's check both sides then to move

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.520 
so let's check both sides then to move
off<00:04:00.970> always<00:04:01.330> shoulder<00:04:01.840> check<00:04:01.990> both<00:04:02.140> sides<00:04:02.200> to

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
off always shoulder check both sides to

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.120 
off always shoulder check both sides to
move<00:04:02.620> off<00:04:02.800> because<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.220> em<00:04:04.860> just<00:04:05.860> in<00:04:05.950> case

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
move off because it's em just in case

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.310 
move off because it's em just in case
any<00:04:06.280> motorcyclist<00:04:06.880> likely<00:04:07.150> III<00:04:07.570> live<00:04:08.230> in

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
any motorcyclist likely III live in

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.740 
any motorcyclist likely III live in
Oxford<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.070> you<00:04:09.790> know<00:04:09.910> I'm<00:04:10.000> paranoid<00:04:10.450> but

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
Oxford so and you know I'm paranoid but

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.240 
Oxford so and you know I'm paranoid but

position<00:04:33.430> to<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.640> off<00:04:33.760> side<00:04:34.000> now<00:04:34.180> because

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
position to the off side now because

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.670

don't need to worry about the brake
lights<00:05:46.880> or<00:05:47.000> not<00:05:47.120> just<00:05:47.780> use<00:05:47.900> whatever<00:05:48.080> we<00:05:48.230> need

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380

to again no need signal currently we're

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
to again no need signal currently we're
both<00:05:50.390> signal<00:05:50.660> actually<00:05:50.870> now<00:05:50.990> that<00:05:51.140> there's

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
both signal actually now that there's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.660 
both signal actually now that there's
some<00:05:51.410> traffic<00:05:51.800> problems<00:05:51.950> from<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.520> right

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
some traffic problems from the right

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.670 
some traffic problems from the right
very<00:05:53.330> restricted<00:05:53.780> view<00:05:53.840> here<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.170> the<00:05:54.260> left<00:05:54.440> so

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
very restricted view here to the left so

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.830 
very restricted view here to the left so
it's<00:05:54.800> going<00:05:54.950> to<00:05:55.040> be<00:05:55.130> last<00:05:55.910> look<00:05:56.150> left<00:05:56.420> because

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
it's going to be last look left because

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.600 
it's going to be last look left because
as<00:05:56.960> I<00:05:57.020> said<00:05:57.170> earlier<00:05:57.230> you<00:05:57.710> want<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.460> be<00:05:58.580> a

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
as I said earlier you want to be a

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.250 
as I said earlier you want to be a
sweating<00:05:59.390> for<00:05:59.540> distracted<00:05:59.900> clear<00:06:00.050> from<00:06:00.200> the

sweating for distracted clear from the

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.630 
sweating for distracted clear from the
right<00:06:00.410> then<00:06:00.590> they're<00:06:00.710> both<00:06:00.800> turning<00:06:01.190> but<00:06:01.580> I

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
right then they're both turning but I

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.100 
right then they're both turning but I
can't<00:06:01.850> assume<00:06:02.120> anything<00:06:02.390> so<00:06:02.720> we'll<00:06:02.840> just<00:06:02.990> let

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
can't assume anything so we'll just let

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.070 
can't assume anything so we'll just let
them<00:06:03.260> clear<00:06:03.730> that's<00:06:04.730> fine<00:06:05.030> we<00:06:05.210> still<00:06:05.420> nothing

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
them clear that's fine we still nothing

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.150 
them clear that's fine we still nothing
behind<00:06:06.200> to<00:06:06.500> worry<00:06:06.620> about<00:06:06.710> still<00:06:09.100> now<00:06:10.100> I'm

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
behind to worry about still now I'm

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.320 
behind to worry about still now I'm
gonna<00:06:10.340> start<00:06:10.520> inching<00:06:10.700> forward<00:06:10.850> once<00:06:11.240> this

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
gonna start inching forward once this

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.610 
gonna start inching forward once this
traffic<00:06:11.570> clears<00:06:11.960> is<00:06:12.080> from<00:06:12.230> the<00:06:12.320> right<00:06:12.470> so

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
traffic clears is from the right so

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.720 
traffic clears is from the right so
we've<00:06:12.740> nothing<00:06:12.890> for<00:06:13.190> different<00:06:13.430> rights<00:06:13.580> like

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
we've nothing for different rights like

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.909 
we've nothing for different rights like
a<00:06:13.760> concert<00:06:14.120> isn't<00:06:14.360> left<00:06:14.570> where's<00:06:15.500> one<00:06:15.680> more

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
a concert isn't left where's one more

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.650 
a concert isn't left where's one more
I'm<00:06:16.130> sleeping<00:06:16.790> around<00:06:16.910> here<00:06:17.240> or<00:06:18.110> okay<00:06:18.320> go

a hazard now sometimes you might be more
flexible<00:06:52.479> about<00:06:52.809> system<00:06:53.169> but<00:06:53.289> generally<00:06:53.650> and

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
flexible about system but generally and

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.939 
flexible about system but generally and
that's<00:06:54.909> a<00:06:54.969> good<00:06:55.089> way<00:06:55.180> to<00:06:55.210> do<00:06:55.389> it<00:06:55.419> and<00:06:55.629> then

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
that's a good way to do it and then

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.079 
that's a good way to do it and then
speed<00:06:56.949> next<00:06:57.309> on<00:06:57.400> the<00:06:57.460> acceleration<00:06:57.819> sense

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 
speed and finally just one gear change

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.420

maybe<00:07:08.439> with<00:07:08.589> a<00:07:08.620> blip<00:07:08.830> on<00:07:08.949> the<00:07:08.979> throttle<00:07:09.279> like<00:07:09.339> I

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:09.430

showed you earlier with it the the rev
matching<00:07:12.069> method<00:07:12.550> and<00:07:12.729> then<00:07:13.539> finally<00:07:13.900> just

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960 
matching method and then finally just

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.450 
matching method and then finally just
accelerate<00:07:14.529> back<00:07:14.680> on<00:07:14.860> the<00:07:14.919> drive<00:07:15.129> around<00:07:15.310> the

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
accelerate back on the drive around the

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.100 
accelerate back on the drive around the
hazard<00:07:15.789> but<00:07:16.270> it<00:07:16.360> was<00:07:16.449> just<00:07:16.659> varied<00:07:16.960> and

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
hazard but it was just varied and

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.480 
hazard but it was just varied and
announced<00:07:17.499> normally<00:07:17.740> fairly<00:07:17.919> like<00:07:18.129> trottle

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
announced normally fairly like trottle

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.459 
announced normally fairly like trottle

setting to negotiate you know most most
and<00:07:21.089> most<00:07:22.089> kind<00:07:22.539> of<00:07:22.599> junctions<00:07:23.139> and

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:26.700 
roundabouts and that kind of even bends
are<00:07:25.270> still<00:07:25.449> gonna<00:07:25.569> be<00:07:25.629> like<00:07:26.080> trottle<00:07:26.469> setting

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710 
are still gonna be like trottle setting

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.709 
are still gonna be like trottle setting
really<00:07:26.979> but<00:07:27.729> I<00:07:27.759> don't<00:07:27.969> mean<00:07:28.059> to<00:07:28.120> be<00:07:28.300> stamping

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719 
really but I don't mean to be stamping

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.600 
really but I don't mean to be stamping
on<00:07:28.809> the<00:07:28.839> gas<00:07:29.080> and<00:07:29.379> sort<00:07:29.589> of<00:07:29.649> you<00:07:30.339> know<00:07:30.370> making

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
on the gas and sort of you know making

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.010 
on the gas and sort of you know making
the<00:07:30.729> curse<00:07:30.939> skid<00:07:31.180> round<00:07:31.360> I<00:07:31.449> had<00:07:31.569> on<00:07:31.659> my<00:07:31.779> talking

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.020 
the curse skid round I had on my talking

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.700 
the curse skid round I had on my talking
without<00:07:32.229> I'm<00:07:32.319> just<00:07:32.469> talking<00:07:32.649> about

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
without I'm just talking about

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.409 
without I'm just talking about
acceleration<00:07:33.129> mild<00:07:33.759> acceleration<00:07:34.270> around

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:34.419 
acceleration mild acceleration around

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:35.879 
acceleration mild acceleration around
the<00:07:34.479> hazard<00:07:34.749> and<00:07:34.839> then<00:07:34.930> further<00:07:35.379> acceleration

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:35.889 
the hazard and then further acceleration

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:36.839 
the hazard and then further acceleration
away<00:07:36.039> from<00:07:36.189> the<00:07:36.249> hazard<00:07:36.490> I<00:07:36.520> guess<00:07:36.639> at<00:07:36.759> the<00:07:36.819> end

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:36.849 
away from the hazard I guess at the end

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:37.950 
away from the hazard I guess at the end
and<00:07:37.029> then<00:07:37.120> your<00:07:37.270> systems<00:07:37.479> overran<00:07:37.719> you<00:07:37.810> can

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
and then your systems overran you can

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.839 
and then your systems overran you can
look<00:07:38.110> now<00:07:38.319> she'd<00:07:38.860> always<00:07:38.979> everything<00:07:39.520> is<00:07:39.729> that

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:39.849 
look now she'd always everything is that

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:41.459 
look now she'd always everything is that
what<00:07:40.240> you<00:07:40.360> get<00:07:40.509> better<00:07:40.659> at<00:07:40.810> it<00:07:40.839> you're<00:07:41.349> not

00:07:41.459 --> 00:07:41.469 
what you get better at it you're not

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:43.649 
what you get better at it you're not
going<00:07:41.649> to<00:07:41.770> be<00:07:41.889> fixated<00:07:42.789> on<00:07:43.029> the<00:07:43.149> same<00:07:43.300> hazard

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:43.659 
going to be fixated on the same hazard

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:44.879 
going to be fixated on the same hazard
you<00:07:43.839> know<00:07:43.959> in<00:07:44.050> a<00:07:44.110> single<00:07:44.409> hazard<00:07:44.680> you're<00:07:44.770> gonna

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:44.889 
you know in a single hazard you're gonna

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:46.439 
you know in a single hazard you're gonna
be<00:07:44.949> planning<00:07:45.219> for<00:07:45.339> that<00:07:45.580> main<00:07:45.849> hazard<00:07:46.300> to<00:07:46.360> my

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:46.449 
be planning for that main hazard to my

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:48.089 
be planning for that main hazard to my
dealer<00:07:46.779> but<00:07:46.899> also<00:07:46.990> as<00:07:47.469> I<00:07:47.529> said<00:07:47.740> earlier<00:07:48.039> just

00:07:48.089 --> 00:07:48.099 
dealer but also as I said earlier just

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:49.499 
dealer but also as I said earlier just
looking<00:07:48.520> for<00:07:48.669> entrances<00:07:49.060> looking<00:07:49.330> for<00:07:49.419> other

looking for entrances looking for other

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:51.239 
looking for entrances looking for other
hazards<00:07:49.870> as<00:07:49.959> you<00:07:50.080> approach<00:07:50.349> and<00:07:50.680> modifying

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:51.249 
hazards as you approach and modifying

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:52.709 
hazards as you approach and modifying
your<00:07:51.339> plan<00:07:51.520> accordingly<00:07:51.969> so<00:07:52.180> it's<00:07:52.270> a<00:07:52.330> it's<00:07:52.629> a
