00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is the hippo exhibit I had to do some

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
is the hippo exhibit I had to do some
modification<00:00:17.190> because<00:00:17.369> i<00:00:17.699> think<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.940> hip

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
modification because i think the hip

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
modification because i think the hip
pulls<00:00:18.300> originally<00:00:19.230> were<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.529> bit<00:00:19.710> too

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
pulls originally were a little bit too

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.340 
pulls originally were a little bit too
large<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.699> zoo<00:00:20.910> they<00:00:21.510> were<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:22.289> know

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
large for the zoo they were you know

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.080 
large for the zoo they were you know
like<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.619> big<00:00:23.010> trucks<00:00:23.250> i<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> hippos

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
like like big trucks i know the hippos

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330 
like like big trucks i know the hippos
in<00:00:24.240> real<00:00:24.359> life<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:24.660> huge<00:00:25.230> but<00:00:25.410> i<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
in real life are huge but i think the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.009 
in real life are huge but i think the
way<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.490> they<00:00:26.699> originally<00:00:26.970> designed<00:00:27.210> we're

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
way that they originally designed we're

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.179 
way that they originally designed we're
just<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.500> too<00:00:28.619> big<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:28.949> i<00:00:29.010> did

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
just a little bit too big but i did

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.640 
just a little bit too big but i did
tweak<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> um<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.570> i<00:00:31.019> liked<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> lot<00:00:31.560> of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
tweak it um and i liked a lot of

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.410 
tweak it um and i liked a lot of
elements<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.130> were<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:32.969> obviously<00:00:33.329> the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
elements that were from obviously the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
elements that were from obviously the
original<00:00:33.809> design<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> exhibit<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> I

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
original design of the exhibit and I

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.880 
original design of the exhibit and I
just<00:00:35.850> sort<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> fit<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.630> into<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.770> know

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just sort of fit them into what you know

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.549 
just sort of fit them into what you know
I<00:00:37.920> already<00:00:38.160> naturally<00:00:38.399> had<00:00:38.960> as<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.379> see

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
I already naturally had as you can see

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.020 
I already naturally had as you can see
part<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> problem<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.520> layout

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
part of the problem with this layout

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.569 
part of the problem with this layout
already<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.379> bad<00:00:43.739> biome<00:00:44.309> it's

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
already is that it's in a bad biome it's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
already is that it's in a bad biome it's
Anna<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.270> snow<00:00:45.510> biome<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Anna it's my snow biome so that the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
Anna it's my snow biome so that the
water<00:00:46.530> freezes<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.850> makes<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> look

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
water freezes and it makes it look

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.330 
water freezes and it makes it look
really<00:00:48.629> strange<00:00:49.020> however<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:49.980> worry<00:00:50.190> we

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
really strange however don't worry we

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.040 
really strange however don't worry we
will<00:00:50.460> fix<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.850> later<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.300> we'll<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.660> move

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
will fix that later on we'll just move

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.569 
will fix that later on we'll just move
the<00:00:52.410> entire<00:00:52.590> map<00:00:52.860> into<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> hopefully<00:00:54.180> better

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
the entire map into a hopefully better

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.680 
the entire map into a hopefully better
better<00:00:56.579> environment<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.390> won't<00:00:57.539> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
better environment and it won't have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010 
better environment and it won't have
this<00:00:57.840> problem<00:00:59.270> we<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.539> know<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.719> had<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> same

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
this problem we you know we had the same

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.270

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
problem with the sesame street map

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.939 
problem with the sesame street map
though<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.730> well<00:01:03.049> this<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.470> elephant

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
though as well this is the elephant

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
though as well this is the elephant
exhibit<00:01:05.159> honestly<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.360> pretty

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
of it and TV elephant with the water

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.530 
of it and TV elephant with the water
coming<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.820> spout<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> great

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
coming out of the spout this was a great

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780 
coming out of the spout this was a great
this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> great<00:01:43.470> design<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.640> also

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this is a great design and there's also

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.120 
this is a great design and there's also
this<00:01:44.970> little<00:01:45.240> cool<00:01:45.450> thing<00:01:45.720> down<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.710> think

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this little cool thing down here I think

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
this little cool thing down here I think
it's<00:01:47.220> part<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> maintenance<00:01:47.909> thing<00:01:48.320> but<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it's part of the maintenance thing but a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.230 
it's part of the maintenance thing but a
waterfall<00:01:50.130> comes<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.579> which<00:01:50.759> which<00:01:50.939> again<00:01:51.180> is

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
waterfall comes out which which again is

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.149 
waterfall comes out which which again is
it<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.570> very<00:01:51.810> cool<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.890> like<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> fact

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it is very cool and I do like the fact

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.120 
it is very cool and I do like the fact
that<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.610> exhibit<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> middle<00:01:54.899> walkway

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
that the exhibit has a middle walkway

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.130 
that the exhibit has a middle walkway
like<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> way<00:01:57.060> people<00:01:57.329> can<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
like this so that way people can kind of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
like this so that way people can kind of
see<00:01:58.320> over<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.890> isn't<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.549> nice<00:01:59.790> touch<00:02:00.090> that's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
see over it isn't this nice touch that's

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.280 
see over it isn't this nice touch that's
definitely<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.009> um<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
definitely like that um because the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
definitely like that um because the
elephant<00:02:04.680> exhibit<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little<00:02:05.549> bit

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
elephant exhibit was a little bit

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.740 
elephant exhibit was a little bit
smaller<00:02:05.820> than<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.060> thought<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.329> would<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
smaller than I thought it would be in

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.050 
smaller than I thought it would be in
and<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.020> not<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.409> uh<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.550> any<00:02:08.759> fault

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and that's not a uh you know any fault

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
and that's not a uh you know any fault
to<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> designer

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to the designer

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
to the designer
this<00:02:11.530> new<00:02:11.680> exhibit<00:02:12.070> sort<00:02:12.310> of<00:02:12.400> cropped<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:13.000> here

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
this new exhibit sort of cropped up here

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.210 
this new exhibit sort of cropped up here
and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.660> thought<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.590> kind<00:02:14.800> of<00:02:14.830> animal

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
and so I thought what kind of animal

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.280 
and so I thought what kind of animal
could<00:02:15.310> go<00:02:15.490> hear<00:02:15.820> that<00:02:16.330> certif<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:16.900> with<00:02:17.080> this

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
could go hear that certif it's with this

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.120 
could go hear that certif it's with this
Sahara<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.480> African<00:02:20.130> wildlife

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
Sahara you know African wildlife

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.150 
Sahara you know African wildlife
experience<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:21.970> thought<00:02:22.180> wildebeest<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.160> had

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
experience so I thought wildebeest I had

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.830 
experience so I thought wildebeest I had
a<00:02:24.190> couple<00:02:24.490> other<00:02:24.640> animals<00:02:25.390> in<00:02:25.480> mind<00:02:25.630> but

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
a couple other animals in mind but

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.120 
a couple other animals in mind but
hopefully<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.530> come<00:02:26.590> up<00:02:26.770> with<00:02:26.890> some<00:02:27.040> of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
hopefully you can come up with some of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.970 
hopefully you can come up with some of
yourself<00:02:28.050> I'm<00:02:29.050> hoping<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.620> land<00:02:29.830> is

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
yourself I'm hoping that this land is

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.380 
yourself I'm hoping that this land is
where<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> theater<00:02:30.490> will<00:02:30.820> go<00:02:30.970> I'll<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.270> to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
where the theater will go I'll have to

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.230 
where the theater will go I'll have to
get<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.660> from<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.170> theater<00:02:32.650> designer<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.760> guess

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
get it from the theater designer I guess

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.740 
get it from the theater designer I guess
um<00:02:35.050> because<00:02:35.650> uh<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:36.790> he<00:02:37.000> made<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.330> theater<00:02:37.720> I

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
um because uh when he made the theater I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.210 
um because uh when he made the theater I
thought<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.110> was<00:02:38.230> just<00:02:38.380> great<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.860> was<00:02:38.950> really

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
thought it was just great it was really

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.420 
thought it was just great it was really
nice<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.980> very<00:02:42.190> very

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
great my next project is probably to get

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.480 
great my next project is probably to get
the<00:02:49.390> visitor<00:02:49.900> center<00:02:50.170> design<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.040> set<00:02:51.310> up

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
the visitor center design and set up

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.330 
the visitor center design and set up
however<00:02:52.560> there's<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.620> lot<00:02:53.770> of<00:02:53.800> possibilities

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
however there's a lot of possibilities

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.070 
however there's a lot of possibilities
not<00:02:54.730> with<00:02:54.850> 1.8<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.630> that's<00:02:55.780> one<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:55.960> the

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
not with 1.8 and that's one of the

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
not with 1.8 and that's one of the
things<00:02:56.110> that<00:02:56.290> I'm<00:02:56.440> sort<00:02:56.620> of<00:02:56.680> running<00:02:56.860> across

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
things that I'm sort of running across

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.420 
things that I'm sort of running across
it<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.690> we're<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.620> making<00:02:59.770> me<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.040> excited

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it and we're just making me more excited

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.030 
it and we're just making me more excited
about<00:03:00.610> 1.8<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.570> because<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.320> know<00:03:02.740> that<00:03:02.890> there's

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
about 1.8 is because I know that there's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.490 
about 1.8 is because I know that there's
the<00:03:03.130> iron<00:03:03.430> bars<00:03:03.760> those<00:03:04.240> fence<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.960> know<00:03:04.990> gates

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
the iron bars those fence you know gates

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.010 
the iron bars those fence you know gates
and<00:03:05.800> all<00:03:06.070> those<00:03:06.280> grates<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.850> brick<00:03:07.180> stairs<00:03:07.570> and

and all those grates of brick stairs and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.780 
and all those grates of brick stairs and
to<00:03:08.470> me<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:08.980> may<00:03:09.070> not<00:03:09.190> be<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.370> big<00:03:09.610> deal<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
to me I know it may not be a big deal to

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.640 
to me I know it may not be a big deal to
a<00:03:10.000> lot<00:03:10.030> of<00:03:10.150> other<00:03:10.390> people<00:03:10.600> but<00:03:10.990> seriously

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
a lot of other people but seriously

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.160 
a lot of other people but seriously
those<00:03:11.860> things<00:03:12.130> are<00:03:12.310> pretty<00:03:13.300> awesome<00:03:13.420> at<00:03:13.960> least

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
those things are pretty awesome at least

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.880 
those things are pretty awesome at least
to<00:03:14.350> me<00:03:15.120> so<00:03:16.120> this<00:03:16.270> is<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.989> last<00:03:17.410> exhibit

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
to me so this is the the last exhibit

design um and I really liked it mostly

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.100 
design um and I really liked it mostly
because<00:03:26.739> of<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.400> design<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.390> dam<00:03:28.630> here

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110

and he did a really great job with the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.070 
and he did a really great job with the
the<00:03:33.070> fertile<00:03:33.459> land<00:03:33.670> along<00:03:34.120> the<00:03:34.150> sides<00:03:34.540> i<00:03:34.780> added

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
the fertile land along the sides i added

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.140 
the fertile land along the sides i added
some<00:03:35.110> pretty<00:03:35.470> good<00:03:35.590> texture<00:03:36.040> as<00:03:36.250> well<00:03:36.310> as<00:03:36.940> the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
some pretty good texture as well as the

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.940 
some pretty good texture as well as the
design<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.930> beaver<00:03:38.140> which<00:03:38.380> i<00:03:38.470> did<00:03:38.620> tweak

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
design of the beaver which i did tweak

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.360 
design of the beaver which i did tweak
i'm<00:03:39.670> not<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.880> huge<00:03:40.150> fan<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.590> obsidian<00:03:41.590> but<00:03:42.340> i

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
i'm not a huge fan of obsidian but i

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.479 
i'm not a huge fan of obsidian but i
just<00:03:42.580> had<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.850> make<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.180> tail<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.420> black<00:03:44.489> but

just had to make the tail is black but

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.949 
just had to make the tail is black but
overall<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:45.940> thought<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.209> was<00:03:46.300> a<00:03:46.360> great<00:03:46.540> design
