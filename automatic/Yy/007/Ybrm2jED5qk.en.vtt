and now the Chi and the E flat so you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.250 
and now the Chi and the E flat so you
have<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:44.420> is<00:02:44.690> easy<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:47.080> lead<00:02:48.080> his

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
D and then you have the D flat so it's

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.250
