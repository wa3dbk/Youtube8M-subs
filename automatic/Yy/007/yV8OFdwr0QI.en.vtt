00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.720
 yes 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.040
 the tijuana team removed from what 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.170
 is the concachampions tournament now 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.180
 focus on the league tournament against 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.070
 of tigers next weekend in a 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.020
 vital match we listen to the reactions 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 of tijuana team players 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
 regarding what remains of here at 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.320
 heiress tournament could give a final and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.789
 to be able to dispute it if we're going 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.189
 calm because I think we make a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.310
 good match they meet with a 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.770
 autogol in your favor and then it 's a ball 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.060
 and stopped and then it becomes difficult 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.050
 the match I think a first time 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.840
 where where we were very superior and the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 difference today that we scored the goal 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.670
 from the michete team at the end we had 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.800
 a lot of chance to start at the end but 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 good this soccer that continues working 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.629
 the last game is an important phase 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 of the championship so you have to focus 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.000
 one hour at 100% 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.649
 we proposed a we are playing our thing and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.110
 we were not given 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.150
 fortunately at first a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.150
 a circumstantial own goal but 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.380
 I think it's a little more here yes 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.649
 a move came 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 high point emotionally you want to stick 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.630
 or not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.490
 but I must tell you, we need a 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.040
 little bit more of tranquility in that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 aspect and if for me they were important 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.479
 the first 15 minutes of running the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.130
 players did not abound on the subject of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.270
 Concussion of anger that happened at the end 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.189
 of the game against the players 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 of blue cross we hear the points of 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.800
 seen as always is a talent of 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.260
 party but the cat inside 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.860
 are nothing more than football anything if 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.960
 you're going to warm up and until then 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.140
 do not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.590
 it does not happen also there were aggressions of 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.710
 the two parts of them in us and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.930
 good 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.360
 the cameras recorded it and there they are 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.640
 now all ready the league tournament and in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.290
 tigers then a difficult square where no 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.060
 it's impossible to draw points so it's 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.990
 we will try to go more with three points and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.690
 then he will go to Cancun and receive the lion and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.720
 with the sum of we calculate from seven 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.000
 points of six points of 51 we can 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 be inside and thinking about what we can 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.750
 enjoy joy so it's that right now 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.700
 idea is to think about tigers and to do very 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.560
 well informed from the blue stadium 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.670
 for group chain sports chain a 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.670
