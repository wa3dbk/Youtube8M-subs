I'm better you know things are going
well<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:21.060> hope<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.449> back<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:21.990> month<00:00:22.230> you

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.670 
well I hope to be back in one month you
know<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.699> hard<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.660> still<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.080> watching<00:00:25.260> from

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
know it's hard to still be watching from

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
know it's hard to still be watching from
the<00:00:25.800> sidelines<00:00:26.220> but<00:00:26.779> it's<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.900> lot<00:00:28.050> easier

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
the sidelines but it's a lot easier

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870 
the sidelines but it's a lot easier
right<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:28.800> than<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.130> before<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.699> think

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
right now than it was before I think

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
right now than it was before I think
because<00:00:30.330> last<00:00:30.539> time<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.679> during<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
because last time it was during the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.780 
because last time it was during the
playoffs<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:33.239> it's<00:00:34.170> okay<00:00:34.410> now<00:00:39.379> my<00:00:40.379> summer

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790

sure they would actually get the silver

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.149 
sure they would actually get the silver
medal<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.990> thought<00:01:19.170> Australia<00:01:19.650> was

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
medal because I thought Australia was

medal because I thought Australia was
gonna<00:01:20.310> was<00:01:20.580> probably<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.570> um

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
gonna was probably gonna do it but um

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
half of the season you know coming off a

half of the season you know coming off a
major<00:03:16.840> injury<00:03:17.230> whether<00:03:17.530> it's<00:03:17.770> what<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.130> did<00:03:18.460> or

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
major injury whether it's what I did or

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.630 
major injury whether it's what I did or
a<00:03:19.270> knee<00:03:19.690> injury<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.380> takes<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.860> lot<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.100> time<00:03:21.340> and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
a knee injury it takes a lot of time and

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.860 
a knee injury it takes a lot of time and
even<00:03:21.820> though<00:03:21.910> you're<00:03:22.060> back<00:03:22.210> on<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.390> court<00:03:22.690> it

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
even though you're back on the court it

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.180 
even though you're back on the court it
still<00:03:23.170> takes<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.530> a<00:03:23.590> lot<00:03:23.710> of<00:03:23.800> time<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.100> get

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
still takes you a lot of time to get

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.100 
still takes you a lot of time to get
back<00:03:24.250> in<00:03:24.370> your<00:03:24.580> rhythm<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.970> stuff<00:03:25.210> so<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.720> don't

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
back in your rhythm and stuff so I don't

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.410 
back in your rhythm and stuff so I don't
really<00:03:26.290> anticipate<00:03:26.710> myself<00:03:27.550> playing<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.300> way

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
really anticipate myself playing the way

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.300 
really anticipate myself playing the way
that<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.660> used<00:03:28.960> to<00:03:29.080> play<00:03:29.230> probably<00:03:29.530> until

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
that I used to play probably until

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.760 
that I used to play probably until
January<00:03:31.000> I'm<00:03:31.510> not<00:03:31.750> saying<00:03:31.960> that<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.140> won't<00:03:32.320> I'll

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
January I'm not saying that I won't I'll

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.490 
January I'm not saying that I won't I'll
be<00:03:32.950> back<00:03:33.100> before<00:03:33.310> then<00:03:33.670> but<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.570> think<00:03:35.410> it's

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
be back before then but I think it's

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.560 
be back before then but I think it's
going<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.680> take<00:03:35.830> some<00:03:36.040> time<00:03:36.220> for<00:03:36.250> me<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:37.420> get

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
going to take some time for me to to get

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.750 
going to take some time for me to to get
my<00:03:37.690> groove<00:03:37.810> back

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.100 

disappointed<00:03:43.760> as<00:03:44.150> well<00:03:44.240> as<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.660> rest<00:03:44.810> of<00:03:44.990> our

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
disappointed as well as the rest of our

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.980 
disappointed as well as the rest of our
team<00:03:45.580> you<00:03:46.580> know<00:03:46.700> we<00:03:47.120> had<00:03:47.270> a<00:03:47.300> good<00:03:47.780> run<00:03:47.930> last

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
team you know we had a good run last

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.540 
team you know we had a good run last
year<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.620> think<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.890> lot<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.070> us<00:03:49.250> were<00:03:49.430> hoping

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
year and I think a lot of us were hoping

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.330 
year and I think a lot of us were hoping
that<00:03:49.790> we<00:03:49.970> could<00:03:50.290> potentially<00:03:51.290> get<00:03:51.470> qualified

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
that we could potentially get qualified

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.030 
that we could potentially get qualified
to<00:03:52.430> go<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.610> the<00:03:53.330> final<00:03:53.630> eight<00:03:53.890> so<00:03:54.890> it's

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
to go to the final eight so it's

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.740 
to go to the final eight so it's
disappointing<00:03:55.190> that<00:03:55.640> we<00:03:56.180> had<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.390> pull<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.720> of

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
disappointing that we had to pull out of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.530 
disappointing that we had to pull out of
it<00:03:57.250> hopefully<00:03:58.250> will<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.150> we'll<00:03:59.270> do<00:03:59.390> our<00:03:59.510> best

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it hopefully will you we'll do our best

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.130 
it hopefully will you we'll do our best
in<00:03:59.900> Euro<00:04:00.110> Cup<00:04:00.380> and<00:04:00.680> try<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.340> win<00:04:01.550> it<00:04:01.580> if<00:04:02.060> we<00:04:02.240> can

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
in Euro Cup and try to win it if we can

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.430 
in Euro Cup and try to win it if we can
and<00:04:03.470> then<00:04:03.680> hopefully<00:04:04.270> next<00:04:05.270> year<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.170> know<00:04:06.290> if

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
and then hopefully next year you know if

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.960 
and then hopefully next year you know if
I'm<00:04:06.590> still<00:04:06.800> with<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.100> team<00:04:07.310> maybe<00:04:07.550> we<00:04:07.790> can

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
I'm still with this team maybe we can

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.690 
I'm still with this team maybe we can
participate<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.230> early

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.349 
no actually they didn't at least as far
as<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.470> maybe<00:04:19.949> they<00:04:20.160> did<00:04:20.340> for<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.910> girls<00:04:21.120> here

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
