loop<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:07.850> then<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:09.410> can<00:04:09.820> go<00:04:10.820> back<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.450> auto

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
loop and then you can go back to auto

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.740 
loop and then you can go back to auto
and<00:04:12.290> then<00:04:12.610> move<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.990> face<00:04:14.990> elect<00:04:15.410> number<00:04:15.770> 2<00:04:16.750> to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
and then move to face elect number 2 to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.010 
and then move to face elect number 2 to
start<00:04:17.959> recording<00:04:18.500> your<00:04:18.650> next<00:04:19.010> sample<00:04:20.020> ok

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
start recording your next sample ok

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.610 
start recording your next sample ok
thanks<00:04:21.410> for<00:04:21.500> watching<00:04:21.860> I<00:04:21.980> hope<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.310> helped
