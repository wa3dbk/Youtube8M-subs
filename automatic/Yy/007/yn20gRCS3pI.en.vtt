00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.980 

now<00:01:30.670> we're<00:01:30.850> cooling<00:01:31.030> our<00:01:31.210> priming<00:01:31.540> sugar<00:01:31.600> down

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
now we're cooling our priming sugar down

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.810 
now we're cooling our priming sugar down
to<00:01:32.230> 80<00:01:32.380> degrees<00:01:32.710> Fahrenheit<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.250> we<00:01:33.490> can<00:01:33.640> mix

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
to 80 degrees Fahrenheit so we can mix

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820 
to 80 degrees Fahrenheit so we can mix
it<00:01:33.970> in<00:01:34.060> with<00:01:34.240> our<00:01:34.300> Bavarian<00:01:35.260> Hefeweizen

before<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.400> bottle<00:01:36.700> our<00:01:36.790> beer<00:01:37.060> let's<00:01:37.450> go<00:01:37.600> ahead

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
before we bottle our beer let's go ahead

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.150 
before we bottle our beer let's go ahead
and<00:01:37.840> get<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:37.960> final<00:01:38.290> gravity<00:01:38.620> for<00:01:39.040> this

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
and get a final gravity for this

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.950 
and get a final gravity for this
Bavarian<00:01:39.580> Hefeweizen<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.600> will<00:01:40.750> tell<00:01:40.930> us

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
Bavarian Hefeweizen this will tell us

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.860 
Bavarian Hefeweizen this will tell us
that<00:01:41.620> alcohol<00:01:42.100> by<00:01:42.250> volume<00:01:42.480> for<00:01:43.480> this<00:01:43.630> batch

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
that alcohol by volume for this batch

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.750 
that alcohol by volume for this batch
let's<00:01:44.650> take<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.800> sample<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.280> batch<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
let's take a sample of this batch and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.050 
let's take a sample of this batch and
then<00:01:45.910> measure<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.330> gravity<00:01:46.930> with<00:01:47.080> cider

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.550 

okay<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.510> can<00:01:57.690> see<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:58.080> our<00:01:58.170> final

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
okay and we can see that our final

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.820 
okay and we can see that our final
