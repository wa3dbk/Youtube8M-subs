00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.010
 Utrecht declares the war to the motorist bovag furiously 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.649
 Utrecht car plans 

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 within this door with cindy now also appears in the netherlands 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.129
 days are welcome at the bad news news week 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.509
 car owners rightly so at least if they don't have a group model 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.569
 because if the municipality is located, soon all cars will be the center 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.269
 no longer in and that not only for visitors but also for residents 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.269
 exceptions are made in some cases, but it was indicated by the alderman 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.009
 not from going to school in groceries then you just have to go 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.949
 nice on the bike very long ago green left councilor about yes why in 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.810
 name these plans 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.530
 10 both properties are welcome from test 15 the city center closes certain 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.010
 polluting cars 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.920
 you can tell something more about it 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 yes that's right we see that does not alter the fact that there is still a problem to the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.360
 air quality standards to help out we have to get everything out of the closet 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.080
 to meet those standards 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.110
 MDP's measure is that we are the most polluting cars the old diesels one 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.520
 lots of gasoline cars 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.900
 and those that allow access to the area the city is most vulnerable to is a study 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.930
 ordered yes which cars are involved then it is about the diesel cars euro 3 a 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.920
 holder and we see to report that the cars are the most 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.530
 pollute the music where dates would globally thinkers from the eighth to 12 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.100
 year old that can be a little boost 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.200
 This month's decision from Utrecht itself 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.550
 pro one 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.140
 the fight also affected 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.560
 yes webex together with the so-called empire in the south and we rarely return 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 agreements to make the air cleaner what we see 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.570
 the number of government measures from the nsl have not been implemented, such as for example 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.760
 road pricing 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.960
 in fact that the prize money already allows up to 30 degrees around the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.070
 city ​​but that does not apply to air quality 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 that means an urgent appeal to the government to do work also with the air 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.240
 to make it cleaner that there is also our own responsibility for that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.430
 to do what is not necessary because it is like it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.530
 because that it must be for the health of the people that city 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.770
 and there is sufficient support for the population 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050
 that implement the plans 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.090
 yes, when I look at our participation responses, that is the vast majority of 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.950
 the people perth the fact that a package of measures are taking 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.759
 the specific measure you sometimes have for passenger cars is in delft 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.039
 the group against and a small group that has no opinion about it 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.629
 bovag finds the plans terrible and believes that far too many people are being hurt 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.469
 if it is actually introduced 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.159
 the just heard the plans from the 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:26.739
 from the college yes what does the transition from the environmental zones to be established for 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.089
 Passenger cars have no effect whatsoever from the figures we turn up 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.589
 again from germany 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:35.960
 get even 4 residents of the inner city who have one 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.529
 research presented 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.159
 which shows that they are on the 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.119
 come to the point exactly behind there and there is zero comma zero 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.169
 effect of such a passenger car and environmental summer 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:49.959
 now the first town that says these kinds of rules that really services tanker 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.189
 apply to 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.379
 yes what do you think about that 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.699
 in Amsterdam it was also tried a few years ago we are real 

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:59.829
 fierce opponent of a patchwork of rules 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.680
 what a look the situation is the one city with a wooden or a mac and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.969
 another city with the other car again 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.809
 that is not to do that is not to keep track of what we want 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.780
 best conversation about such measures 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.899
 but then at national level and not at local level 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:18.989
 we have a lot of entrepreneurs here and there 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.929
 yes how will it turn out for him 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.119
 yes that is of course a very big problem because there are very many 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:28.059
 entrepreneurs also car companies gas stations the driving schools etcetera 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.289
 an inner city here 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:34.639
 has settled in which you actually provide with such a measure with 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.989
 that last push was needed in these economic times and there may be 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:38.790
 edge to fall 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.790
 and assume that no college wants to have it on its own conscience 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.489
 that given that rbs might take a step numbers how about that 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.349
 bovag 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.969
 Well indeed the ANWB has threatened with legal steps like the plans 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.229
 continue and we are now looking at whether it will eventually improve 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.019
 connect what the possibilities are and 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.469
 what the expected outcome of the salsa in Amsterdam is a few years ago 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:02.169
 ago 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:06.029
 is this plan if once wiped off the table, the Ministry has also informed 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.249
 Schepers have good hope 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.939
 that it does not go ahead 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.819
 bmw wants to give value to its electrical circuit in the long term 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.410
 line the models as to the current and sexy 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.620
 that is quite a bit 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.889
 Once it was Dutch Casting People Are Congress and therefore got the hang of it 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.630
 8 brought among them also in the Netherlands to promote how the bnd the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.990
 to be able to sell electric cars in the Netherlands 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.340
 yes we see here the bmw i8 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.719
 why is it here? 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.439
 after school unique opportunity to take the emily 8 for the first and to the Netherlands 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.340
 to get 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.639
 a few weeks ago we achieved the conception drion netherlands and this 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.940
 is the only opportunity to experience this unique altar only one worldwide 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.439
 so we chose to come here 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.169
 and show this audience 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.360
 What is the expectation with the disney serial support says the previously have the i3 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.460
 brought to the netherlands what you will achieve in the netherlands 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.780
 In doing so, they and the Dutch market for bone are a very important one 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.129
 markets 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.030
 especially because the neels government of electric driving very much 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.279
 frustrating 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.279
 and that is what seeing and seeing at the moment 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.419
 we think that we can clearly leave their mark from before BMW 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.650
 give up on our sustainability piece policy we have been around for a few years 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.349
 consecutively 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.620
 the number one in death due to a buggy index 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.760
 and I think that the arrival of baby D and in particular those 3 real harnesses 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.159
 The highlight is to give substance to this, also in practice 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.599
 when can we expect the bmw i3 on the dutch market 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.589
 at the bmw i3 the end of the year would come on the market will be the first 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:40.900
 electric bmw 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.500
 car that is completely designed as an electric car from the first signs 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.010
 sketches that it is designed as an electric car and is therefore 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.529
 not the concept 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.529
 compared to what moments in this area and the market have offered 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:54.009
 is becoming 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.229
 People who order a BMW i3 also get the charging points 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.870
 yes we are going to hit a tree when people want to go home 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.999
 install on if offer that option if the customer chooses 

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.099
 so continue to offer one 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.569
 in-house 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:11.839
 the product comes let you go so nice is called nb 3 dropbox 

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:15.770
 and we take care of the installation for the customers if the customer wishes 

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:18.809
 a straightened decorated horses that are conceived attracted 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.520
 people were not allowed to place robots at home 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
 We offer a late pass to the public 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:28.580
 the player takes on the costs of a lamppost 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.770
 and we offer the 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.259
 so don't work on it 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.469
 to free one 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:35.039
 the customer i can buy the products 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.259
 and that will be competitive prices 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.979
