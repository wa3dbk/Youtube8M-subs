00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:46.230
 neon green start with the first paint 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.450
 job called phoenix for things in the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.690
 primary colors in the area metallic and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 There you look for the color red 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.680
 that many times wanted a pager 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.329
 get red with the color now 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 her one in combination with 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 a bit orange to the pearl money 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.199
 you can still see clearly 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.400
 that there is still a bit of red between 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.710
 the shimmering colors is and 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.170
 Overall, it just looks right 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.270
 really cool from me personally has that 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.400
 also on one of my vehicles on it and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.900
 That's not so many colors 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.380
 the case that shows me that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.030
 at least really like the color 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.350
 computer color bubblegum than me to the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.509
 first time I saw you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 just rightly celebrated for it 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.520
 grab the metallic color petrol 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.470
 green and then goes into the perfect and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240
 then get the color hot pink 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.280
 or does it look like one of these? 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 you may still have older chewing gum 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.560
 knows where to even it around chewing this 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.600
 have blue color and in there this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 pink hamm I think just right 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.350
 In any case, you can be funny 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.210
 one of his vehicles on small and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.530
 Outside in the sun, the car sees 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.570
 even better we go over 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.829
 braid old olive is not now 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.840
 necessarily my favorite but I have 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.729
 seen that some celebrate this color 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.439
 That's why I put her in front of her 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 the field of market colors and chooses 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.670
 The forest green from then you have the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.229
 use it on a trick when on 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 sold penny you should I ever 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.700
 showed and chooses the perfect one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.270
 her the color blue yellow out here too 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.610
 you could turn the race yellow again 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.350
 use but I find that dew yellow in 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.870
 combination with the forest green easy 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:27.070
 better and that's how the car looks on everyone 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:28.990
 case ever relatively chic out for 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.630
 the next paint shop called platinum 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.420
 Get the brushed first 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.880
 black stall have her in the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.610
 he has done that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.700
 her in the perfect and skin the perfect 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.430
 Ice knows the vehicle and so on 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.410
 a really cool color in the area 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.390
 I rarely have silver gray 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.970
 online mode when you see one 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.130
 vehicle silver gray or platinum colors 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.990
 then you want to do that on everyone 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.950
 I like this case with this combination 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.800
 good if you write the comments 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.750
 as you Like It 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.430
 Last but not least we have the color and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.830
 Greens grab the metallic ones for that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.320
 Color lime green in online mode must 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.120
 first of all a lot of monster 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.960
 you still have to complete them 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.760
 not unlocked 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.860
 You have to look for it first 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.870
 after a few monster stan spots 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.790
 you have to know yourself whether you the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.440
 evaluates this effort to operate there 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.600
 the muslims in green skin to 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.820

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.100

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.209
 really top in combination of 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.040
