I<00:04:09.060> do<00:04:10.060> see<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:12.570> pretty<00:04:13.570> distinct<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:14.790> shade<00:04:15.790> of

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
I do see a pretty distinct a shade of

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.540 
I do see a pretty distinct a shade of
that<00:04:16.060> fuchsia<00:04:16.360> I<00:04:16.720> mean<00:04:17.010> it's<00:04:18.010> not<00:04:18.160> going<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.489> be

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.550 
that fuchsia I mean it's not going to be

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.890 
that fuchsia I mean it's not going to be
as<00:04:18.700> bright<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.300> see<00:04:19.420> in<00:04:19.480> here<00:04:19.690> obviously

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
as bright as you see in here obviously

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.270 
as bright as you see in here obviously
because<00:04:20.350> it's<00:04:20.500> just<00:04:20.530> like<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.800> very<00:04:21.040> light

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
because it's just like a very light

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.790 
because it's just like a very light
color<00:04:21.660> or<00:04:22.660> supposing<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.200> were<00:04:23.230> like<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.560> bamhi

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
color or supposing you were like a bamhi

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.010 
color or supposing you were like a bamhi
color<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.490> from<00:04:25.180> what<00:04:25.270> I<00:04:25.330> see<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.540> far<00:04:25.690> it's

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
color but from what I see so far it's

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020 
color but from what I see so far it's
really<00:04:26.410> really<00:04:26.620> nice<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.040> moisturizing<00:04:27.850> and

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.560 
pi and then that is the color whisper
and<00:06:01.370> right<00:06:02.370> when<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.550> was<00:06:02.730> watching<00:06:02.880> my<00:06:03.240> hand<00:06:03.450> I

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
and right when I was watching my hand I

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.360 
and right when I was watching my hand I
felt<00:06:03.870> like<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.170> lip<00:06:04.320> butter<00:06:04.500> was<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.830> little

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
felt like the lip butter was a little

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.210 
felt like the lip butter was a little
bit<00:06:05.490> more<00:06:05.730> heavier<00:06:06.120> um<00:06:07.020> then<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.950> color

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
bit more heavier um then the color

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.640 
bit more heavier um then the color
whisper<00:06:08.640> was<00:06:08.790> but<00:06:09.630> they<00:06:10.080> both<00:06:10.230> are<00:06:10.410> kind<00:06:10.560> of

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
whisper was but they both are kind of

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.080 
whisper was but they both are kind of
like<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.920> same<00:06:11.100> concept<00:06:11.610> probably<00:06:11.910> like<00:06:12.000> the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
like the same concept probably like the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.270 
like the same concept probably like the
same<00:06:12.410> concept<00:06:13.410> so<00:06:13.650> it's<00:06:13.950> just<00:06:14.040> like<00:06:14.190> a

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
same concept so it's just like a

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.570 
same concept so it's just like a
moisturizing<00:06:14.790> balm<00:06:15.630> lipstick<00:06:16.590> lips<00:06:17.100> lip

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
moisturizing balm lipstick lips lip

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.390 
moisturizing balm lipstick lips lip
gloss<00:06:17.880> hybrid<00:06:18.390> type<00:06:18.600> of<00:06:18.750> thing<00:06:18.960> I<00:06:19.950> think

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
gloss hybrid type of thing I think

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.700 
gloss hybrid type of thing I think
they're<00:06:20.640> both<00:06:20.820> pretty<00:06:21.240> similar<00:06:21.810> in<00:06:21.870> qualities

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
they're both pretty similar in qualities

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.100 
they're both pretty similar in qualities
like<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:23.490> said<00:06:23.730> the<00:06:24.180> color<00:06:24.390> whisper<00:06:24.750> just<00:06:24.960> seems

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
like I said the color whisper just seems

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.660 
like I said the color whisper just seems
to<00:06:25.230> be<00:06:25.320> slightly<00:06:25.560> lighter<00:06:26.010> than<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.460> lip

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:26.670 
to be slightly lighter than the lip

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.060 
to be slightly lighter than the lip
butter<00:06:27.170> but<00:06:28.170> they're<00:06:28.290> both<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.620> really<00:06:28.920> great

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.240
