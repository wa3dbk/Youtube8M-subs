00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
the movie Scarface but what I think is

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.719 
the movie Scarface but what I think is
actually<00:01:28.600> driving<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:29.650> much<00:01:29.890> traffic<00:01:30.280> towards

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
actually driving so much traffic towards

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.910 
actually driving so much traffic towards
it<00:01:31.000> is<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.540> good<00:01:31.780> Christian<00:01:32.260> mothers<00:01:32.650> are

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
it is that good Christian mothers are

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.219 
it is that good Christian mothers are
just<00:01:33.100> outraged<00:01:33.760> by<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.060> monstrosity<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:35.080> can
