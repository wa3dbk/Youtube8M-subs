incentive<00:02:23.260> which<00:02:24.260> same<00:02:24.650> equal<00:02:25.220> then<00:02:25.730> output

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
incentive which same equal then output

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.850

if<00:02:27.980> we<00:02:28.220> let<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:29.000> variable<00:02:29.840> with<00:02:30.049> several<00:02:30.590> will

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
if we let a variable with several will

if we let a variable with several will
from<00:02:31.190> me<00:02:31.370> compare<00:02:32.150> it<00:02:32.780> with<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.650> difference<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
from me compare it with a difference a

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.530 
from me compare it with a difference a
very<00:02:35.299> long<00:02:35.720> can<00:02:36.049> have<00:02:36.650> different<00:02:37.180> people<00:02:38.180> so

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
very long can have different people so

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.020 
very long can have different people so
