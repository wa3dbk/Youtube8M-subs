tournament the way I believe it's going
to<00:01:15.000> play<00:01:15.090> out<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.549> whoever<00:01:17.549> wins<00:01:17.880> this

to play out is that whoever wins this

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.570 
to play out is that whoever wins this
tournament<00:01:18.299> will<00:01:18.900> eventually<00:01:19.560> meet<00:01:20.040> AJ

tournament will eventually meet AJ

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.760 
tournament will eventually meet AJ
Styles<00:01:20.850> again<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.960> two<00:01:22.170> belts<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.740> be

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
Styles again and the two belts will be

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429 
Styles again and the two belts will be
unified<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.790> at<00:01:24.119> present<00:01:24.330> AJ<00:01:24.990> Styles<00:01:25.200> is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
