00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 Hi, I 'm me 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.020
 It's good I 'm easy and already others 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.910
 and we are going to make a video of how to have 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.910
 a funny call following asses 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.230
 villar meets 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.230
 and now 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.760
 r emotion 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.540
 let's admit it this is the expectation of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.540
 all the pineapples 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.570
 and I'm here is the cruel reality 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.659
 with the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.820
 finish 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.220
 something that I recommend a lot is that in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 your room where your call will be 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.790
 put a lot of warm things I 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.560
 I recommend you use the shopping bags 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.360
 but they can use blankets or pillow 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.360
 all as a more comfortable aspect 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.020
 an activity that can not be missing in your 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.590
 call are the challenges 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.590
 yes 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.360
 let's see who can inflate more their 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.320
 blog in 30 seconds out 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.320
 yes 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.920
 Let's see 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.370
 There is nothing backward 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.510
 to be a challenge 8 miccoli I went up a lot 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.510
 I live in my person 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.510
 one 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.790
 and I say it 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.970
 I will go 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.170
 devastating 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.240
 the next tip is that during all your 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.240
 party environments with a little music 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.880
 something that I also recommend you a lot 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.130
 to do is that everything you are going to give 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.350
 as a snack you put it in different 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.360
 containers thus everyone can 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.610
 grab what you want in the amount that 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.770
 want 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.420
 Another thing you can do is get into 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.580
 swim to the pool but if they all look 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.680
 put on a bathing suit, get in with 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.040
 clothes you do not have a pool you can play with 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.840
 water balloons the following movies you 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.490
 I recommend a lot to watch movies 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.490
 use netflix or clear video 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.890
 and you always imagine paying attention 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.890
 the film 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.830
 Y 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.890
 point 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.850
 the reality is that you almost never put 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.850
 Attention 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.970
 well now I'm going to give you a little 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.560
 diary of how marx actions the only thing 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.080
 what you need are sweet cookies 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.210
 chocolates and chocolate what are you going to do 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.340
 is to melt your chocolate in the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.770
 fire after you're going to put a cookie 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.170
 with a chocolate then chocolate and then 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.200

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.850
 order to a superclassic activity spain 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.240
 will do the other but if you are not very 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.220
 great, so do not do it, the party is not 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.350
 it ends until it's over in the morning 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.440
 next worry about having a rich 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.970
 rich breakfast this is french bread yes 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.020

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.480
