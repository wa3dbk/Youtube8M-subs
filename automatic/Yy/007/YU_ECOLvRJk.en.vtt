00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
system that I built this up here it's a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.740 
system that I built this up here it's a
55<00:00:31.679> gallon<00:00:31.859> tote<00:00:32.189> got<00:00:32.669> about<00:00:32.880> 20<00:00:33.450> gallons

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
55 gallon tote got about 20 gallons

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560 
55 gallon tote got about 20 gallons
water<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:35.460> whole<00:00:35.550> bunch<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.880> these

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
water in it and a whole bunch of these

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.049 
water in it and a whole bunch of these
in<00:00:38.570> here<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.719> gonna<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.489> returns

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
in here is gonna have all this returns

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.760 
in here is gonna have all this returns
gonna<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.600> down<00:00:42.840> through<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> through

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
gonna go down through here and through

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.049 
gonna go down through here and through
filters<00:00:44.309> blocks<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:46.550> then<00:00:47.550> that'll<00:00:47.850> rain

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
filters blocks and and then that'll rain

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
filters blocks and and then that'll rain
down<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.390> all<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.200> little<00:00:49.350> scrub<00:00:49.739> uses<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
down on all those little scrub uses the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.229 
down on all those little scrub uses the
biological<00:00:50.879> filter<00:00:52.699> in<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> it's

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
biological filter in there and it's

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.729 
biological filter in there and it's
diverted<00:00:54.690> back<00:00:54.840> over<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.620> don't

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
diverted back over here so don't

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
diverted back over here so don't
restrict<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.460> putting<00:00:57.390> some<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.809> water

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
restrict it putting some of the water

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
restrict it putting some of the water
back<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.410> thousand<00:00:58.890> gallons<00:00:59.219> per<00:00:59.430> hour

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
back at the thousand gallons per hour

back at the thousand gallons per hour
pump<00:01:01.100> these<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.309> my<00:01:02.460> my<00:01:03.180> overflows<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.519> you

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
pump these are my my overflows here you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.280 
pump these are my my overflows here you
can<00:01:05.729> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> see<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.540> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
can kind of see there on the one on the

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.600 
can kind of see there on the one on the
right<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:08.400> sucking<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> top<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.900> that's

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
right is sucking off the top and that's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
right is sucking off the top and that's
it's<00:01:11.610> an<00:01:11.790> odor<00:01:11.939> flow<00:01:12.299> it's<00:01:12.510> something<00:01:12.869> off<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
it's an odor flow it's something off the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
it's an odor flow it's something off the
ut's<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.770> don't<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> know<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.310> pretty<00:01:14.610> common

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
ut's I don't you know it's pretty common

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.960 
ut's I don't you know it's pretty common
thing<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.750> cool<00:01:15.960> works<00:01:16.200> really<00:01:16.439> well

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
thing it's really cool works really well

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.780 
thing it's really cool works really well
so<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.150> keeps<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.600> siphoned<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> when

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
so it keeps it siphoned when the when

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.320 
so it keeps it siphoned when the when
the<00:01:20.939> pump<00:01:21.659> fails<00:01:22.700> won't<00:01:23.700> driven<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.060> it'll

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the pump fails won't driven that it'll

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.730 
the pump fails won't driven that it'll
drain<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> tank<00:01:24.869> down<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.500> level

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
drain the tank down to just that level

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.100 
drain the tank down to just that level
and<00:01:26.189> that'll<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.580> into<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> sump<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.360> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and that'll go into the sump there and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
and that'll go into the sump there and
I'll<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.040> cool<00:01:29.930> then<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.220> fuckin<00:01:32.670> invented

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
I'll be cool then this I fuckin invented

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.319 
I'll be cool then this I fuckin invented
me<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.759> there<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
me this is a there you have to do a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.520 
me this is a there you have to do a
drilled<00:01:36.810> tank<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.619> make<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> solids

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
drilled tank you can make a solids

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520 
drilled tank you can make a solids
solids<00:01:40.530> lifting<00:01:41.400> overflow<00:01:42.140> well<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
solids lifting overflow well this is a

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.179 
solids lifting overflow well this is a
hybrid<00:01:44.310> solids<00:01:45.030> lifting<00:01:45.420> overflow<00:01:46.189> sucking

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
hybrid solids lifting overflow sucking

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.469 
hybrid solids lifting overflow sucking
from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> bottom<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.060> there's<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> whole

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
from the bottom there there's a whole

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.109 
from the bottom there there's a whole
bunch<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.840> little<00:01:48.990> holes<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> can<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
bunch of little holes you can see in the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.789 
bunch of little holes you can see in the
reflection<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> tank<00:01:52.229> there's<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.680> whole

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
reflection of the tank there's a whole

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.200 
reflection of the tank there's a whole
bunch<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> little<00:01:53.130> holes<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.549> bottom<00:01:53.640> and

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
bunch of little holes in the bottom and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.660 
bunch of little holes in the bottom and
it<00:01:55.049> sucks<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.189> pipe<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.750 

and<00:02:00.540> then<00:02:00.720> get<00:02:01.020> overflows<00:02:01.740> right<00:02:02.040> there<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
and then get overflows right there so it

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.670 
and then get overflows right there so it
comes<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.300> that<00:02:03.510> overflows<00:02:03.990> sucking<00:02:04.440> from<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
comes up that overflows sucking from the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 
comes up that overflows sucking from the
bottom<00:02:05.450> conservatories<00:02:06.450> second<00:02:06.840> from<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
bottom conservatories second from the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.880 
bottom conservatories second from the
top<00:02:07.580> these<00:02:08.580> caps<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.600> of<00:02:09.830> quieted<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
top these caps just kind of quieted a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.730 
top these caps just kind of quieted a
little<00:02:11.130> bit<00:02:11.250> I'll<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.200> but<00:02:13.200> so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
little bit I'll going with that but so
