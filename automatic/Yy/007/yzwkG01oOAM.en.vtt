00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.830
 Another very nice chess trap 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.120
 this time in defense 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.349
 the trains 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.969
 four five jumpers each, f3 and d6 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 created 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.310
 Now, the center immediately attacks 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.670
 played the four and got black 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.289
 I can do different things 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 lie fields play four to 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.119
 bind springer to f3 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.680
 he can even play f5 and even a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.750
 place counter in the center or play 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.200
 very quiet as it is in this case 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.850
 now occurs jump d7 and supports the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.200
 point to 5 but once white develops 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.739
 the voltage continues to be normal 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.579
 center upright it takes on the farmers 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.770
 e5 out but plays she runs 4 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 there is of course optimally placed and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 look at the weak ones too 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 point to 11 7 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.350
 that will become important later on 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.040
 played c6 that may prepare one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.100
 anti assault with bauer d5 form center 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.670
 and then black can counterattack 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.060
 hope now, however, focused white 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.840
 the point on 11 7 again with 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.299
 springer g5 of the springer on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.890
 rank six defended the most meaningful 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.360
 becomes 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.119
 now changes because of his opinion 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 short term degree of activity on 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.460
 Royal Wing relocated to our center 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 to feel this for a short time on the intestine 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.380
 bauer plays four of these builders is in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.810
 the other one falls a lot 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.120
 important role but only now 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.640
 times 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.490
 black in the trap a good move 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.130
 would have been the 4 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.160
 with it beats 4 and I jump five 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.660
 this springer on e5 now has several 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:05.810
 functions discovered point on 735 c4 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.619
 and also has the way for the runner of 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.840
 about 8 cleared that would be a good 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.890
 Continuation but here after farmer 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.530
 you already have black in the trap 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 he plays seven runs in hopes 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 this annoying springer on g5 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.070
 Get rid of 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.280
 he has a tactical here on the left 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.010
 strong seen the runner can also f7 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.190
 beats announces f8 prohibits 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.540
 of course because of springer e6 king takes 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.550
 That's why the ladies must 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.280
 heeks of haseks his defense 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.570
 perceive task and impact on 11 7 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.960
 now, however, where the farmer f7 is missing 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.860
 the field is weakened to 6 that uses 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.530
 the player plays out in this case 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.270
 springer the 6 and now is heat 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.830
 attacks that do not have that many anymore 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.930
 possibilities to draw only b6 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.200
 our five has happened first the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.790
 Variant with at that time five 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.650
 From there she will be back soon 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.400
 expelled companions the 2 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.680
 So she has to go back to B 66 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.970
 does not work because of springer c7 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.590
 cable cable king lady works so well 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.810
 Not 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.810
 That's why the lady tries luck on b6 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:38.180
 and after bafÃ¶g what the meaning of bauer a4 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.720
 clarified beats again on the 2 and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.010
 after 93, the lady has no fields again 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.810
 more on b5 she ends up in the same 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.510
 or a similar fork as well 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.810
 she jumps seven says chess again 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.190
 and belongs in the next breeding the lady 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.310
 the computer is still there 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.950
 therefore proposes a1 is the best for for 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.220
 black but still running 1 stuck 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.260
 Of course, black as well as 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.310
 lost 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.770
 Now let's look at the other variant 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.570
 on with it b6 and here it will be 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:20.690
 immediately expelled from this field again 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:24.440
 bauer a5 and as seen in school after a6 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.460
 and b5 can not do it 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.080
 it remains only b 4 and there too 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.000
 she can be attacked by a farmer 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 be white playing at c3 and now 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.490
 so c4 e6 attacks him jump on to 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.830
 that is, before anything 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.940
 The springer can be done in company 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.180
 safety 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.850
 s.besten to c7 because that takes 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.380
 at the same time fields a6 and b5 for the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:00.920
 lady and after the king lake 8 follows the 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.740
 3 but here the lady falls in the next 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.930
 train because she has no more fields where 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.640
 could stand down without being beaten 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.710
 to become 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.040
 an interesting variant would be too 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.640
 been city jump c7 with chess first 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.740
 the farmers on g7 creates increasing 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:24.620
 after king f8 b3 the lady with attacks 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.870
 again only after sex or b5 one 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.320
 big difference dearest however 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.080
 Do not say she goes to a6 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:38.090
 then the spokesman says the chess king 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.010
 goes to g8 goes after that is the fork 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:44.990
 of ten seven meters exploited that 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:48.260
 is king g8 but still springer c7 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.300
 gives the lady because she is not here either 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.360
 Fields had more where they were safe in 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.130
 that could be the small one 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.130
 fall in the much village participation 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.280
 after a4 and the error runs seven 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.280
 So you should always be here 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:09.240
 make running beats f7 look out 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.910
 which consistently wins the lady afterwards 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.139
 all clear that we we see fall 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.710
 us next time 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.710
 pure skin
