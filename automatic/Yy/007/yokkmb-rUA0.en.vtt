00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
you get a newer camera and it would
still<00:01:35.579> have<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.090> most<00:01:36.299> basic<00:01:36.570> entry

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
still have it be the most basic entry

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
still have it be the most basic entry
level<00:01:37.590> model<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> still<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.759> able<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.939> take

cool<00:01:39.600> pictures<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.470> what<00:01:40.619> you're

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
cool pictures just like what you're

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.450 
cool pictures just like what you're
seeing<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:40.979> here

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
seeing right here

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.370 
seeing right here
let<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:41.970> show<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.600> trick<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.170> you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
let me show you a little trick that you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.860 
let me show you a little trick that you
can<00:01:43.500> use<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.130> camera<00:01:44.240> Ralpha<00:01:45.240> bat<00:01:45.420> see

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
can use with any camera Ralpha bat see

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.990 
can use with any camera Ralpha bat see
the<00:01:46.020> little<00:01:46.290> thing<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.010> shutter<00:01:47.310> speed

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the little thing this is shutter speed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.060 
the little thing this is shutter speed
if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.510> raise<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.080> number<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.710> make<00:01:50.010> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
if you raise that number to make it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.920 
if you raise that number to make it
longer<00:01:50.220> whenever<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.450> picture<00:01:51.750> now

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
longer whenever you take a picture now

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.170 
longer whenever you take a picture now
your<00:01:52.470> camera<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:53.100> be<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.460> several

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
your camera will be on for several

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.719 
your camera will be on for several
seconds<00:01:54.750> taking<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.710> picture<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.550> amount

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
seconds taking a picture for that amount

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
seconds taking a picture for that amount
of<00:01:57.300> time<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:57.900> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.080> really<00:01:58.229> cool<00:01:58.560> because

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
of time now this is really cool because

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.980 
of time now this is really cool because
what<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.430> do<00:01:59.580> is<00:01:59.729> take<00:01:59.910> a<00:01:59.970> light<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.750> move

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
what you can do is take a light and move

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.660 
what you can do is take a light and move
it<00:02:01.260> around<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.619> frame<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.550> actually

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it around the frame and you can actually

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.880 
it around the frame and you can actually
record<00:02:03.300> light<00:02:03.900> trails<00:02:04.200> with<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.619> people

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
record light trails with that and people

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
record light trails with that and people
if<00:02:05.880> you've<00:02:06.270> heard<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.720> technique<00:02:06.930> before

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
if you've heard of this technique before

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.660 
if you've heard of this technique before
it's<00:02:07.530> called<00:02:07.680> light<00:02:07.890> painting<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.459> most

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it's called light painting but most

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.720 
it's called light painting but most
people<00:02:08.940> think<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.570> all<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.410> just<00:02:10.730> wave

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
people think that all I just I just wave

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.310 
people think that all I just I just wave
a<00:02:11.760> flashlight<00:02:12.090> around<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.080> done

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
a flashlight around and then it's done

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.500 
a flashlight around and then it's done
well<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.610> whole<00:02:14.760> art<00:02:14.820> form<00:02:15.330> in

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
well actually it's a whole art form in

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.210 
well actually it's a whole art form in
and<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.750> itself<00:02:16.080> because<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:16.920> are<00:02:16.980> dozens

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and of itself because there are dozens

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.940 
and of itself because there are dozens
of<00:02:18.209> different<00:02:18.600> types<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.320> lights<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
can use in my painting and all of them

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.620 
can use in my painting and all of them
have<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.530> specific<00:02:22.800> use<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.480> know
