going<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.330> pick<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.050> speed<00:00:40.440> if<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.830> could<00:00:41.040> still

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
going to pick up speed if I could still

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.890 
going to pick up speed if I could still
hang<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:42.000> needle<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.809> the

hang on to the right needle and get the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.900 
hang on to the right needle and get the
needle<00:00:43.140> wrapped<00:00:43.320> at<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.530> same<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.949> so<00:00:44.519> if

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
needle wrapped at the same time so if

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.310 
needle wrapped at the same time so if
you've<00:00:45.120> been<00:00:45.150> knitting<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.989> normal

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
you've been knitting the normal

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
you've been knitting the normal
right-handed<00:00:46.830> way<00:00:46.979> of<00:00:47.129> letting<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
right-handed way of letting go of the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.149 
right-handed way of letting go of the
needle<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.089> wrapping<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.620> can<00:00:49.769> do<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.010> too

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
needle and wrapping it you can do it too

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.649 
needle and wrapping it you can do it too
you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.580> just<00:00:50.729> change<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> way<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.269> knit<00:00:51.540> and

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
you can just change the way you knit and

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:53.960 
you can just change the way you knit and
force<00:00:51.839> yourself<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.290> have<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.250> economy<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
force yourself to have that economy of

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.939 
force yourself to have that economy of
movement<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.690> pick<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.589> speed

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
movement which will pick up the speed

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.509 
movement which will pick up the speed

let go of the right needle I actually
use<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.340> point<00:01:18.060> right<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.299> as<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> pivot

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.350 
use this point right here as a pivot
point<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.190> stabilize<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> tip<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.300> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
point and I stabilize the tip of the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
point and I stabilize the tip of the
left<00:01:21.480> needle<00:01:21.630> on<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:23.220> tip<00:01:23.370> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> right

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
needle on my left finger and when I do

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.420 
needle on my left finger and when I do
that<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.850> pop<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.050> needle<00:01:28.350> back<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.280> little

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that I pop the needle back and a little

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.310 
that I pop the needle back and a little
flick<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.910> my<00:01:29.970> index<00:01:30.420> finger<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.990> get<00:01:31.230> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
flick of my index finger I get it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.310 
flick of my index finger I get it
wrapped<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.770> pulled<00:01:31.980> through<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.360> needle

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
wrapped and pulled through so the needle

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.380 
wrapped and pulled through so the needle
is<00:01:34.410> stabilized<00:01:34.950> here<00:01:35.370> it's<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.820> pivot<00:01:36.120> point

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
is stabilized here it's a pivot point

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.070 
is stabilized here it's a pivot point
here<00:01:36.480> I<00:01:36.960> push<00:01:37.620> grab<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> yarn<00:01:38.940> and<00:01:39.240> pull<00:01:39.330> it

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
here I push grab the yarn and pull it

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.380 
here I push grab the yarn and pull it
through<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.920> similar<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.460> how<00:01:41.610> left-handed

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
through it's similar to how left-handed

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.370 
through it's similar to how left-handed
people<00:01:42.540> knit<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.370> continental<00:01:44.370> knitters<00:01:45.060> knit

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
people knit or continental knitters knit

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
people knit or continental knitters knit
because<00:01:46.380> it's<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:47.190> kind<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.120> grabbing<00:01:48.510> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
because it's just kind of grabbing the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.120 
because it's just kind of grabbing the
yarn<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.900> pulling<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.350> not<00:01:49.800> really

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
yarn and pulling it through not really

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.020 
yarn and pulling it through not really
wrapping<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.730> needle<00:01:50.760> as<00:01:51.150> much<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:53.730> again

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
wrapping the needle as much so again

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.840
