00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
here is going to be the case which is a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.220 
here is going to be the case which is a
rose<00:00:05.549> will<00:00:05.790> redbone<00:00:07.099> it<00:00:08.599> should<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> pretty

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:20.420 
rose will redbone it should be a pretty
decent<00:00:10.800> case<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.690> $39<00:00:18.260> but<00:00:19.340> let's<00:00:20.340> get

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
decent case and it was $39 but let's get

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:37.010 
decent case and it was $39 but let's get
that<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:31.160> there<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.430> go<00:00:35.630> best<00:00:36.630> way<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> get

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that out there we go best way to get

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.479 
that out there we go best way to get
cases<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.649> by<00:00:38.129> far<00:00:39.890> just<00:00:40.890> turn<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.160> right<00:00:41.460> side

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
cases out by far just turn it right side

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:58.760 
cases out by far just turn it right side
up<00:00:42.230> take

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.350 

alright<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.340> we<00:01:00.760> got<00:01:00.790> ourselves<00:01:01.150> a<00:01:03.360> ghetto

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
alright so we got ourselves a ghetto

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.570 
alright so we got ourselves a ghetto
installation<00:01:05.140> guide<00:01:05.380> on<00:01:05.710> one<00:01:05.920> piece<00:01:06.160> of<00:01:06.340> paper

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
installation guide on one piece of paper

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.980 
installation guide on one piece of paper
that's<00:01:06.850> cool<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.490> now<00:01:09.880> let's<00:01:10.090> take<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.390> closer

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
that's cool but now let's take a closer

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.660 
that's cool but now let's take a closer
look<00:01:11.170> at<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.680> computer<00:01:12.220> itself<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.550> get

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
look at the computer itself so you get

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.190 
look at the computer itself so you get
this<00:01:15.820> off<00:01:16.030> of<00:01:16.060> there<00:01:17.370> now<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.570> hard<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.930> tell

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
this off of there now it's hard to tell

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.180 
this off of there now it's hard to tell
what<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.840> front<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.050> is<00:01:23.200> actually<00:01:23.440> read<00:01:23.890> on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
what the front here is actually read on

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.370 
what the front here is actually read on
the<00:01:24.520> sides<00:01:24.760> here<00:01:25.620> and<00:01:27.390> then<00:01:28.390> here<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:28.750> got<00:01:28.990> a

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
the sides here and then here we got a

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.950 
the sides here and then here we got a
USB<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.040> point<00:01:30.310> out<00:01:30.400> port<00:01:30.700> audio<00:01:31.630> jacks

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
USB to point out port audio jacks

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.020 
USB to point out port audio jacks
another<00:01:32.290> USB<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.830> put<00:01:32.979> up<00:01:33.100> two<00:01:33.460> point<00:01:33.700> oh<00:01:33.790> poor

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
another USB to put up two point oh poor

another USB to put up two point oh poor
Andy<00:01:34.540> SATA<00:01:34.840> port<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.440> then<00:01:36.420> we've<00:01:37.420> got<00:01:37.630> a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
Andy SATA port and then we've got a

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.060 
Andy SATA port and then we've got a
power<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.979> reset<00:01:39.430> switch<00:01:40.830> then<00:01:41.830> there's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
power and a reset switch then there's

three drive bays and then there's a

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.359 
three drive bays and then there's a
smaller<00:01:45.100> one<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.700> could<00:01:45.910> use<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.210> put<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:47.369> fan

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
smaller one you could use to put a fan

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.900 
smaller one you could use to put a fan
controller<00:01:48.760> or<00:01:48.970> something<00:01:49.360> in<00:01:50.520> now<00:01:51.520> on<00:01:51.760> the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
controller or something in now on the

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.380 
controller or something in now on the
side<00:01:52.180> here<00:01:52.770> we've<00:01:53.770> got<00:01:53.979> some<00:01:54.310> ventilation<00:01:54.670> I'm

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
side here we've got some ventilation I'm

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.260 
side here we've got some ventilation I'm
sure<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:55.630> could<00:01:55.840> put<00:01:56.170> some<00:01:56.350> fans<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.860> here<00:01:57.270> later

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
sure I could put some fans in here later

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.290 
sure I could put some fans in here later
on<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.570> high<00:01:58.810> one<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.080> two<00:01:59.380> for<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.770> client<00:02:00.300> now

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.480 
dust filter on the bottom here on the
back<00:02:48.520> we've<00:02:49.360> got<00:02:49.600> some<00:02:49.990> holes<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.280> water

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
back we've got some holes for water

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.460 
back we've got some holes for water
cooling<00:02:53.250> 7<00:02:54.250> expansion<00:02:54.880> slots<00:02:55.390> here<00:02:55.780> that's

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
cooling 7 expansion slots here that's

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.050 
cooling 7 expansion slots here that's
where<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.770> i/o<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.430> motherboard<00:02:57.819> goes

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
where the i/o for the motherboard goes

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.020 
where the i/o for the motherboard goes
and<00:02:58.920> then<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.040> can<00:03:00.160> hide<00:03:00.280> all<00:03:00.460> your<00:03:00.490> cables

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
and then you can hide all your cables

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.210 
and then you can hide all your cables
easier<00:03:01.990> here<00:03:02.380> because<00:03:02.710> they've<00:03:02.950> actually

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
easier here because they've actually

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.730 
easier here because they've actually
made<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.700> protrude<00:03:04.240> a<00:03:04.360> little<00:03:04.600> bit<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.990> it

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740
