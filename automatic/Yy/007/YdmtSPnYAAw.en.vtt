Survival<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> strategy<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.850> I've

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
Survival this is a strategy that I've

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.150 
Survival this is a strategy that I've
been<00:00:21.510> using<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.109> while<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.680> friends<00:00:23.039> have

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
been using for a while my friends have

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
been using for a while my friends have
used<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:23.910> enjoyed<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.510> they<00:00:24.660> thought<00:00:24.840> it

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
used it they enjoyed it they thought it

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.450 
used it they enjoyed it they thought it
was<00:00:25.050> helpful<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> figured<00:00:25.980> I'd<00:00:26.099> share<00:00:26.430> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
was helpful so I figured I'd share it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.609 
was helpful so I figured I'd share it
with<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> rest<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.269> guys<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.869> my

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
with the rest of you guys and my

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
strategy involves going through solo

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.420 
strategy involves going through solo
missions<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> trust<00:00:31.679> me<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.219> by

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
missions and trust me do this by

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.520 
missions and trust me do this by
yourself<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.239> you're<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.050> select<00:00:34.230> the

yourself and you're going to select the
map<00:00:34.800> server<00:00:35.250> crash<00:00:35.640> now<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> at

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
map server crash now you have to be at

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720 
map server crash now you have to be at
least<00:00:36.390> level<00:00:36.989> 14<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.680> unlock<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.700> that

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
from 5,000 to possibly even maybe 7000

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
from 5,000 to possibly even maybe 7000
experience<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.510> why<00:00:48.809> do<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.379> much

experience and why do you get so much
you<00:00:49.770> ask<00:00:49.980> because<00:00:50.850> each<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.539> jeeps

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you ask because each one of these jeeps

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.229 
you ask because each one of these jeeps
are<00:00:52.079> worth<00:00:52.350> 700<00:00:53.219> apiece<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> there's<00:00:53.940> seven

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of them so at the bare minimum that's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
of them so at the bare minimum that's
four<00:00:57.059> thousand<00:00:57.480> nine<00:00:57.570> hundred<00:00:57.750> experience
