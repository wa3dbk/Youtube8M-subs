00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
and it would be nice if they implemented

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.410 
and it would be nice if they implemented

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
would spend a lot of time in the field

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.710 
would spend a lot of time in the field
battling<00:03:52.280> and<00:03:52.580> when<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.700> was<00:03:52.880> done<00:03:53.060> I'd<00:03:53.330> forget

the 3d sucks contributes nothing to the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.290 
the 3d sucks contributes nothing to the
game<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:03.980> drops<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.519> framerate<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.120> just

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
game and it drops the framerate so just

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.479 
game and it drops the framerate so just
stay<00:04:05.480> away<00:04:05.660> from<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.989> blinding<00:04:06.440> shit<00:04:06.709> fine

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
over d2 playing the game I could say

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.430 
over d2 playing the game I could say
that<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.880> think<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:11.239> worth<00:04:11.269> picking<00:04:11.630> up<00:04:11.900> but

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
that I think it's worth picking up but

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.040 
that I think it's worth picking up but
also<00:04:12.590> have<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:12.980> playa<00:04:13.220> ask<00:04:13.550> myself<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.900> I've

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
also have to playa ask myself what I've

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.039 
also have to playa ask myself what I've
enjoyed<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.860> game<00:04:16.130> as<00:04:16.400> much<00:04:16.760> as<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.150> did<00:04:17.510> if<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
enjoyed this game as much as I did if I

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.779 
enjoyed this game as much as I did if I
would<00:04:18.410> have<00:04:18.500> played<00:04:18.739> every<00:04:19.250> version<00:04:19.430> that

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
would have played every version that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.640 
would have played every version that
came<00:04:20.000> out<00:04:20.239> before<00:04:20.419> X<00:04:21.020> and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
came out before X and

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.050 
came out before X and
because<00:04:21.949> I<00:04:22.010> haven't<00:04:22.160> played<00:04:22.370> this<00:04:22.639> game<00:04:22.850> in

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
because I haven't played this game in

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.260 
because I haven't played this game in
like<00:04:23.090> 10<00:04:23.720> or<00:04:23.870> 15<00:04:24.020> years<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.919> my<00:04:25.240> answer<00:04:26.240> was

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
like 10 or 15 years and my answer was

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.230 
like 10 or 15 years and my answer was
probably<00:04:27.169> not<00:04:27.650> because<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.610> hasn't<00:04:28.850> really

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
probably not because it hasn't really

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.200 
probably not because it hasn't really
changed<00:04:29.270> too<00:04:30.080> much<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.620> just<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:31.130> mean<00:04:31.639> I<00:04:31.729> felt

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
changed too much it's just I mean I felt

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.520 
changed too much it's just I mean I felt
comfortable<00:04:32.389> playing<00:04:32.900> the<00:04:33.020> game<00:04:33.199> I<00:04:33.229> didn't

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
comfortable playing the game I didn't
