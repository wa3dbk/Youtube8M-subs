00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.420
 It is the Figuarts machine tracker to introduce this time 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:11.800
 Price will be 4860 yen 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.500
 The package is smaller than regular Figuarts with Kamen Rider Drive. 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:20.710
 It is compact 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:25.510
 If you are inside the machine cheese comes with three types of body and broken and replacement wrists 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.170
 First of all, I 'm a machine tracker, but I feel a rather solid figure compared to the drive 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.250
 I will 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:34.829
 After height is smaller than the drive 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.750
 It's pretty cool I a part is metallic paint of the running of the predecessor of purple after 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:45.579
 The film is also quite finely molded night film 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:49.480
 Please note that this antenna is a post part, so damage 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:53.740
 The rest is the tube of the former, but it says g junction but this is the manual 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.540
 Please note that it is easy to rub according to 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.990
 Operation is 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.990
 arm 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:18.850
 Then I put out my legs and the parts of my waist got a bit of enema 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:23.380
 As you can move the punishment of the lower back , you can raise it up a little by using it 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:28.680
 But it's fuselage g junction in the same way may interfere with 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:35.240
 You can lower it a bit by moving this 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.240
 It can be moved also radiator guard and death head shoulder after how 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.540
 The radiator guard is a tasted guard 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:50.030
 But towards the right shoulder you have a radiator guard doing something even armor of the bottom that 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:55.740
 I'm going to move a little bit plastic but it seems to be able to move 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:02:00.150
 Next is the weapon break gunner and it will look like this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:04.110
 Blake Gunner may be interesting if you try to give to various characters 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:08.940
 Then it is the midnight car road tire of the first score 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.240
 Rider can be mounted on the drive has been fired from Laurent stride Ron 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.560
 Mid- ride roadway tires 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.370
 Attached to the chest will be Kamen Rider Drive Midnight Roadway 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.610
 Belts and shift breaths have also changed, so it's fine. 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.380
 I have been attentive, but this installation is quite detailed work and it is lost 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.470
 Please be careful 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.230
 That was a brief introduction to Figuarts Machine Small 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.709
 Drive type 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 I say goodbye to Figuarts , well, I'm fine until the details of the drive 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.610
 I thought it was a ready-made figure 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.790
 It was cautious to have been there and stable after that, because the antenna is an imperial part 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:48.209
 After thinking that I want it, already on TV 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.220
 To be a Kamen Rider Chaser, not a machine tracker 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.270
 Care for those who of Kamen Rider chaser of I Figuarts future 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.270
 I think I want to do something
