00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
so you can see right there that I did

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540 
so you can see right there that I did
level<00:03:16.900> up<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.350> that's<00:03:17.920> what<00:03:18.070> I<00:03:18.100> wanted<00:03:18.430> to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
level up and that's what I wanted to

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.990 
level up and that's what I wanted to
include<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.330> last<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.560> then<00:03:21.340> Chuck<00:03:21.970> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
include the last of it and then Chuck a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.110 
include the last of it and then Chuck a
grenade<00:03:22.090> shoot<00:03:22.990> this<00:03:23.230> guy<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.070> my<00:03:24.850> friend

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
grenade shoot this guy and my friend

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.880 
grenade shoot this guy and my friend
will<00:03:25.270> hits<00:03:25.780> triple<00:03:26.080> need<00:03:26.380> for<00:03:26.800> the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
will hits triple need for the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.350 
will hits triple need for the
game-winner<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:27.670> there's<00:03:27.820> no<00:03:27.910> kill<00:03:28.150> cam

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
game-winner but there's no kill cam

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.630 
game-winner but there's no kill cam
because<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.960> know<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.860> was<00:03:30.040> an<00:03:30.160> early<00:03:30.430> game

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
because you know this was an early game

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.100 
because you know this was an early game
or<00:03:30.970> whatever<00:03:31.210> this<00:03:31.420> was<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.630> different<00:03:31.840> Lobby

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
or whatever this was a different Lobby

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:33.990 
or whatever this was a different Lobby
so<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.770> didn't<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.040> automatically<00:03:33.580> start<00:03:33.880> up

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
so it didn't just automatically start up

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.080 
so it didn't just automatically start up
the<00:03:34.450> next<00:03:34.690> game<00:03:34.870> you'll<00:03:35.740> see<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.250> when<00:03:36.670> the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the next game you'll see that when the

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.690 
the next game you'll see that when the

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.820 
and the camo for it but everything else
remains<00:04:00.160> locked<00:04:00.820> I<00:04:01.180> try<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.690> select<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.110> m40a3

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
remains locked I try to select the m40a3

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.830 
remains locked I try to select the m40a3
and<00:04:03.340> it<00:04:04.180> just<00:04:04.360> doesn't<00:04:04.540> let<00:04:04.750> me<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.690> so

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
and it just doesn't let me do it and so

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.540 
and it just doesn't let me do it and so
I<00:04:07.870> guess<00:04:08.050> that<00:04:08.230> means<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.530> once<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.190> leveled

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
I guess that means that once I leveled

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.800 
I guess that means that once I leveled
up<00:04:09.640> enough<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.060> would<00:04:10.209> have<00:04:10.360> everything

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
up enough I would have everything

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.140 
up enough I would have everything
unlocked<00:04:11.110> other<00:04:11.380> than<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.830> weapons<00:04:12.370> you

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
unlocked other than the weapons you

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.510

unlock<00:04:13.630> when<00:04:13.870> you<00:04:14.020> unlock<00:04:14.440> the<00:04:14.709> create<00:04:15.340> a

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
unlock when you unlock the create a

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.630 
unlock when you unlock the create a
class<00:04:15.940> feature<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.919> so<00:04:18.130> that's<00:04:18.370> something
