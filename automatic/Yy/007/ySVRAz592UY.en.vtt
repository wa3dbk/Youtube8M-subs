alright who are you speak up joined

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.539 
alright who are you speak up joined
ranks<00:00:03.610> over<00:00:04.359> here<00:00:04.779> we<00:00:05.560> have<00:00:05.770> a<00:00:05.799> lot<00:00:06.040> of<00:00:06.069> clocks

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:06.549 
ranks over here we have a lot of clocks

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.250 
ranks over here we have a lot of clocks
that<00:00:06.880> use<00:00:07.060> ancient<00:00:07.390> display<00:00:07.960> technologies

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.260 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.669 

come<00:00:12.260> and<00:00:12.380> take<00:00:12.530> a<00:00:12.559> look<00:00:12.650> okay

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:17.980 

so<00:00:16.250> this<00:00:16.460> right<00:00:16.699> here<00:00:16.760> uses<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:17.449> Penta<00:00:17.750> plex

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
so this right here uses the Penta plex

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.040 
so this right here uses the Penta plex
display<00:00:18.470> so<00:00:19.099> it's<00:00:19.250> neon<00:00:19.460> pills<00:00:19.880> but<00:00:20.390> it<00:00:20.509> has<00:00:20.660> 7

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
display so it's neon pills but it has 7

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.439 
display so it's neon pills but it has 7
seconds<00:00:21.560> just<00:00:22.099> like<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.490> LED<00:00:22.880> display<00:00:23.029> that

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
seconds just like the LED display that

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.040 
seconds just like the LED display that
you<00:00:23.539> see<00:00:23.750> on<00:00:24.200> the<00:00:24.439> top<00:00:24.650> alarm<00:00:25.039> clock<00:00:28.930> did<00:00:29.930> you

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
you see on the top alarm clock did you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.660 
you see on the top alarm clock did you
build<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:30.349> circuit<00:00:30.560> board<00:00:30.829> yourself<00:00:31.279> this

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
build this circuit board yourself this

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.910 
build this circuit board yourself this
is<00:00:31.849> my<00:00:32.000> own<00:00:32.150> design<00:00:32.300> how<00:00:32.960> does<00:00:33.110> it<00:00:33.230> work<00:00:33.379> well

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
is my own design how does it work well

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.100 
is my own design how does it work well
there's<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.280> high<00:00:34.430> voltage<00:00:34.760> power<00:00:34.970> supply<00:00:35.449> that

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
there's a high voltage power supply that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.290 
there's a high voltage power supply that
takes<00:00:36.410> the<00:00:36.680> voltage<00:00:37.190> coming<00:00:37.370> in<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.940> a<00:00:38.059> steps

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
takes the voltage coming in and a steps

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.140 
takes the voltage coming in and a steps
it<00:00:38.449> up<00:00:38.570> to<00:00:38.750> 180<00:00:39.470> volts<00:00:39.710> to<00:00:40.550> run<00:00:40.760> each<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.059> these

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
it up to 180 volts to run each of these

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.619 
it up to 180 volts to run each of these
displays<00:00:41.830> over<00:00:42.830> here<00:00:43.129> there's<00:00:43.309> a

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
displays over here there's a

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.939 
displays over here there's a
microprocessor<00:00:44.629> that<00:00:45.079> generates<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
microprocessor that generates the

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.700 
microprocessor that generates the
multiplex<00:00:46.519> signal<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.690> control<00:00:48.080> each<00:00:48.320> one<00:00:48.350> of

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
multiplex signal to control each one of

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.130 
multiplex signal to control each one of
these<00:00:48.799> display<00:00:49.250> panels<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.659> say<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.839> drive

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
these display panels so say a drive

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.619 
these display panels so say a drive
transits<00:00:51.650> very<00:00:51.860> low<00:00:52.250> driver<00:00:52.970> transistors

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
transits very low driver transistors

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.539 
transits very low driver transistors
here<00:00:53.809> for<00:00:53.989> each<00:00:54.049> set<00:00:54.320> of<00:00:54.350> segments<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.280> then

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
here for each set of segments and then

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.640 
here for each set of segments and then
one<00:00:55.699> for<00:00:55.940> each<00:00:56.059> of<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.360> digits<00:00:56.570> okay

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
one for each of the digits okay

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.039 
one for each of the digits okay
which<00:00:58.010> type<00:00:58.159> in<00:00:58.280> microcontroller<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.809> this<00:00:59.960> is

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:00.049 
which type in microcontroller so this is

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.060 
which type in microcontroller so this is
a<00:01:00.080> pic<00:01:00.379> okay

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
a pic okay

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.649 
a pic okay
what<00:01:04.070> are<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.309> oak<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:04.879> see<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> extra

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
what are the oak and I see the extra

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.160 
what are the oak and I see the extra
neon<00:01:06.110> bulbs<00:01:06.470> are<00:01:06.619> for<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.400> docks

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.450 

there's<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:10.860> hand<00:01:11.189> and

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
there's one here for hand and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.950 
there's one here for hand and
nice

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.180 

next

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.010 

Oh<00:01:19.250> week<00:01:19.790> ago<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:20.240> one<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.540> here<00:01:20.810> which

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
Oh week ago this one right here which

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.760 
Oh week ago this one right here which
uses<00:01:21.710> -<00:01:22.580> bunnies<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.750> these<00:01:24.170> are<00:01:24.380> real

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
uses - bunnies and these are real

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.390 
uses - bunnies and these are real
projective<00:01:24.950> plays<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:27.320> their<00:01:27.560> lenses<00:01:27.980> behind

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
projective plays so their lenses behind

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.920 
projective plays so their lenses behind
this<00:01:28.550> so<00:01:28.850> there's<00:01:29.030> lenses<00:01:29.390> behind<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.810> I'm

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
this so there's lenses behind you I'm

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.420 
this so there's lenses behind you I'm
not<00:01:30.050> sure<00:01:30.110> if<00:01:30.350> he<00:01:30.440> gets<00:01:30.620> width<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.160> can<00:01:31.220> see

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
not sure if he gets width you can see

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.700 
not sure if he gets width you can see
this<00:01:31.550> but<00:01:31.760> if<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.940> don't<00:01:32.000> assess<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.570> life<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
this but if I don't assess the life and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.860 
this but if I don't assess the life and
you<00:01:33.800> might<00:01:33.950> be<00:01:34.100> able<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.310> see<00:01:34.580> numbers<00:01:35.030> shining

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
you might be able to see numbers shining

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.130 
you might be able to see numbers shining
through<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.910> not<00:01:37.910> sure<00:01:38.120> because<00:01:38.330> yeah<00:01:38.660> yeah<00:01:38.960> we

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
through it not sure because yeah yeah we

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.440 
through it not sure because yeah yeah we
can<00:01:39.260> see<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:39.890> there's<00:01:40.120> lenses<00:01:41.120> in<00:01:41.270> there

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
can see that so there's lenses in there

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.310 
can see that so there's lenses in there
and<00:01:41.810> behind<00:01:42.500> each<00:01:42.710> lens<00:01:43.040> is<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.360> little<00:01:45.080> mass

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
and behind each lens is a little mass

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.430 
and behind each lens is a little mass
that<00:01:46.130> has<00:01:46.310> never<00:01:46.610> printed<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.150> it<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.320> what

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
that has never printed on it and so what

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.350 
that has never printed on it and so what
happens<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.550> take<00:01:49.580> this<00:01:49.850> little<00:01:50.060> array<00:01:50.240> of

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
happens is we take this little array of

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.020 
happens is we take this little array of
light<00:01:50.540> bulbs<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.620> that<00:01:52.220> fits<00:01:52.430> inside<00:01:52.640> here

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
light bulbs and that fits inside here

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.740 
light bulbs and that fits inside here
like<00:01:53.060> this<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:54.470> then<00:01:54.770> those<00:01:54.950> projects<00:01:55.750> inside

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
like this and then those projects inside

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.170 
like this and then those projects inside
this<00:01:57.050> screen<00:01:57.410> right<00:01:57.440> here<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.820> there's<00:01:59.120> a

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
this screen right here and there's a

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.840 
this screen right here and there's a
little<00:01:59.330> screen<00:01:59.600> hair<00:01:59.840> on<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.020> front<00:02:00.320> that<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
little screen hair on the front that the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.820 
little screen hair on the front that the
member<00:02:02.090> will<00:02:02.180> show<00:02:02.390> up<00:02:02.510> on<00:02:02.690> each<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.680> those

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
member will show up on each of those

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.490 
member will show up on each of those
lenses<00:02:04.370> gonna<00:02:04.850> angled<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.960> rights

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
lenses gonna angled so that the rights

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.169 
lenses gonna angled so that the rights
of<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.710> lenses<00:02:07.010> are<00:02:07.160> angled<00:02:07.520> appropriately

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
of the lenses are angled appropriately

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.330 
of the lenses are angled appropriately
and<00:02:08.510> with<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> right<00:02:08.960> focus<00:02:09.229> point<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.220> they

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
and with the right focus point so they

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.710 
and with the right focus point so they
focus<00:02:10.670> all<00:02:10.850> on<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> screen<00:02:11.390> in<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.570> same

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
focus all on the screen in the same

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.140 
focus all on the screen in the same
place<00:02:12.130> that's<00:02:13.130> what<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:13.490> see<00:02:13.670> there

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.780 

we<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.750> cathode<00:02:18.260> ray<00:02:18.440> tube<00:02:18.890> that's<00:02:19.489> being

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
we have a cathode ray tube that's being

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.660 
we have a cathode ray tube that's being
used<00:02:19.970> as<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.209> clocks<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:22.069> so<00:02:22.280> these<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.580> all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
used as a clocks and so these are all

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.690 
used as a clocks and so these are all
scanned<00:02:23.060> using<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.510> vector<00:02:23.920> algorithm<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.549> it's

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
scanned using a vector algorithm so it's

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.130 
scanned using a vector algorithm so it's
not<00:02:25.819> a<00:02:25.879> raster<00:02:26.299> scan<00:02:26.569> like<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:26.870> would<00:02:26.959> see

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
not a raster scan like you would see

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.440 
not a raster scan like you would see
with<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.349> typical<00:02:27.860> monitor<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.730> actually<00:02:29.090> scans

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
with a typical monitor it actually scans

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.910 
with a typical monitor it actually scans
out<00:02:29.690> each<00:02:29.900> number<00:02:30.319> just<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.620> you<00:02:30.799> would

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
out each number just like you would

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.619 
out each number just like you would
write<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.220> number<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.640> pen<00:02:31.909> because<00:02:32.330> that's

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
write the number in a pen because that's

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.660 
write the number in a pen because that's
instead<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.019> a<00:02:33.080> pen<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.920> using<00:02:34.220> electron

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
instead of a pen it's using electron

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.759 
instead of a pen it's using electron
beams<00:02:34.970> right<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:35.629> the<00:02:35.690> possible<00:02:36.110> sphere<00:02:36.319> all

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
beams right on the possible sphere all

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.149 
beams right on the possible sphere all
right<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.560> guns<00:02:39.560> are<00:02:39.739> down<00:02:39.860> here

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
right so the the guns are down here

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.640 
right so the the guns are down here
right<00:02:40.430> huh<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.659> then<00:02:41.780> they're<00:02:41.930> accelerated

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
right huh and then they're accelerated

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.920 
right huh and then they're accelerated
it<00:02:43.250> looks<00:02:43.400> like<00:02:43.579> you<00:02:43.730> have<00:02:43.930> electrostatic

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
it looks like you have electrostatic

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.539 
it looks like you have electrostatic
deflection<00:02:45.079> on<00:02:45.590> this<00:02:45.799> that's<00:02:46.040> right<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.430> it

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
deflection on this that's right so it

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.910 
deflection on this that's right so it
has<00:02:46.700> electrostatic<00:02:47.450> deflection<00:02:47.599> place<00:02:48.170> which

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
has electrostatic deflection place which

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.220 
has electrostatic deflection place which
moved<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.700> electron<00:02:50.120> beam<00:02:50.329> to<00:02:50.660> point<00:02:51.140> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
moved the electron beam to point the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.539 
moved the electron beam to point the
different<00:02:51.560> areas<00:02:51.799> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:51.980> screen<00:02:52.310> which<00:02:52.519> is

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
different areas of the screen which is

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.660 
different areas of the screen which is
right<00:02:52.819> up<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.239> front

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.699 

what<00:02:58.209> else<00:02:58.360> do<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.569> have<00:02:58.660> well<00:02:59.200> I<00:02:59.230> have<00:02:59.680> a

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
what else do you have well I have a

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.020 
what else do you have well I have a
mixing<00:03:00.370> suit<00:03:00.610> wall<00:03:00.819> clock<00:03:02.370> man<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.730> have<00:03:03.819> so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
mixing suit wall clock man you have so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.540 
mixing suit wall clock man you have so
many<00:03:04.120> clocks<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.810> lot<00:03:05.050> of<00:03:05.170> clocks<00:03:05.410> let<00:03:06.250> me<00:03:06.340> tell

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
many clocks a lot of clocks let me tell

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.070 
many clocks a lot of clocks let me tell
you<00:03:06.670> at<00:03:06.970> home<00:03:07.239> last<00:03:07.599> night<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.050> was

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
you at home last night it was

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.900 
you at home last night it was
disconcerting<00:03:08.860> because<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.400> looked<00:03:09.700> around

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
disconcerting because I looked around

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.370 
disconcerting because I looked around
and<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.150> couldn't<00:03:10.180> tell<00:03:10.569> the<00:03:10.690> time<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.080> was<00:03:11.200> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
and I couldn't tell the time it was it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.130 
and I couldn't tell the time it was it
was<00:03:11.500> terrible

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
was terrible

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.870 
was terrible
because<00:03:13.680> they're<00:03:13.830> all<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.250> that's<00:03:14.670> right

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
because they're all here that's right

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.850 
because they're all here that's right
they're<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.210> here<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> so<00:03:16.050> these<00:03:16.380> are<00:03:16.530> Nixie

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
they're all here and so these are Nixie

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.520 
they're all here and so these are Nixie
tubes<00:03:17.130> they're<00:03:18.000> filled<00:03:18.210> with<00:03:18.270> neon<00:03:18.630> gas<00:03:18.900> and

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
tubes they're filled with neon gas and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.560 
tubes they're filled with neon gas and
they<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.010> ten<00:03:20.520> electrodes<00:03:21.030> one<00:03:21.270> for<00:03:21.450> each

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
they have ten electrodes one for each

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.160 
they have ten electrodes one for each
digit<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.040> apply<00:03:23.370> 180<00:03:24.150> volts<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:25.140> a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
digit and so I apply 180 volts to a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.960 
digit and so I apply 180 volts to a
particular<00:03:25.470> electrode<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.400> causes<00:03:26.820> it

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
particular electrode and that causes it

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.360 
particular electrode and that causes it
to<00:03:27.000> light<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:28.290> that's<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> neon<00:03:28.890> gas<00:03:29.130> that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
to light up and that's the neon gas that

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.860 
to light up and that's the neon gas that
you're<00:03:29.520> seeing<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.090> same<00:03:30.270> principle<00:03:30.780> as

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you're seeing it's the same principle as

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.190 
you're seeing it's the same principle as
when<00:03:31.080> those<00:03:31.200> little<00:03:31.320> tiny<00:03:32.160> neon<00:03:32.430> bulbs

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
when those little tiny neon bulbs

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.250 
when those little tiny neon bulbs
and<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:35.000> circuit<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.300> similar<00:03:36.810> circuit

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
and the circuit is the similar circuit

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.440 
and the circuit is the similar circuit
so<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.530> same<00:03:37.890> power<00:03:38.130> supply<00:03:38.340> circuit<00:03:38.790> and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
so this same power supply circuit and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.510 
so this same power supply circuit and
then<00:03:39.780> there's<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.050> different<00:03:40.520> microcontroller

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
then there's a different microcontroller

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.030 
then there's a different microcontroller
circuit<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.900> different<00:03:43.260> Drive<00:03:43.440> circuitry

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
circuit and a different Drive circuitry

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.440 
circuit and a different Drive circuitry
but<00:03:44.250> other<00:03:44.489> than<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.970> very<00:03:45.030> very

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
but other than that it's very very

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.949 
but other than that it's very very
similar

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
similar

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.870

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
uses a max Q 2000 which is a 16-bit sort

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.740 
uses a max Q 2000 which is a 16-bit sort
of<00:03:52.230> similar<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.530> an<00:03:52.770> 1851<00:03:53.340> architecture

example<00:04:01.470> I<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:01.709> get<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.890> temperature<00:04:02.300> so<00:04:03.300> if

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
example I can get the temperature so if

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.390 
example I can get the temperature so if
you<00:04:03.480> look<00:04:03.599> up<00:04:03.750> here<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:03.959> can<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.500> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
you look up here you can see that the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.370 
you look up here you can see that the
block<00:04:05.580> links<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.030> 79<00:04:06.569> degrees<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.200> that's

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
block links to 79 degrees but that's

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.600 
block links to 79 degrees but that's
really<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.650> temperature<00:04:08.160> inside<00:04:08.310> this

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
really the temperature inside this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.100 
really the temperature inside this
plastic<00:04:08.880> case

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
plastic case

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.440 
plastic case
and<00:04:11.410> then<00:04:11.560> these<00:04:11.740> other<00:04:11.890> right<00:04:12.190> here<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:12.760> can

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
and then these other right here I can

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.220 
and then these other right here I can
run<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.440> clock<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.950> can<00:04:15.580> set<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.030> time<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:17.080> I

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
run the clock I can set the time and I

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.220 
run the clock I can set the time and I
can<00:04:17.380> pull<00:04:17.590> the<00:04:17.709> hour<00:04:17.860> and<00:04:18.190> minute<00:04:18.810> James<00:04:19.810> to

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
can pull the hour and minute James to

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.710 
can pull the hour and minute James to
change<00:04:20.440> a<00:04:20.500> particular<00:04:21.010> parameter<00:04:21.610> there<00:04:22.090> and

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
change a particular parameter there and

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.360 
change a particular parameter there and
it's<00:04:22.930> also<00:04:23.080> got<00:04:23.320> an<00:04:23.440> alarm<00:04:23.650> function<00:04:24.130> as<00:04:24.220> well

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
it's also got an alarm function as well

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.100 
it's also got an alarm function as well
if<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.790> can<00:04:24.940> turn<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.210> alarm<00:04:25.360> on<00:04:25.570> or<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.900> can<00:04:25.990> just

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
if I can turn the alarm on or I can just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.670 
if I can turn the alarm on or I can just
ring<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.350> alarm<00:04:27.960> is<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.170> little<00:04:29.320> bell<00:04:29.500> right

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
ring the alarm is that little bell right

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.860 
ring the alarm is that little bell right
there<00:04:29.950> so<00:04:30.220> that's<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.580> alarm<00:04:30.790> function<00:04:31.330> but

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
there so that's the alarm function but

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.290 
there so that's the alarm function but
it<00:04:31.960> also<00:04:32.080> strikes<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.710> hour<00:04:32.940> except<00:04:33.940> after

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
it also strikes the hour except after

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.170 
it also strikes the hour except after
9:00<00:04:34.480> p.m.<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:36.460> won't<00:04:36.640> strike<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.090> hour

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
9:00 p.m. and it won't strike the hour

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.690 
9:00 p.m. and it won't strike the hour
before<00:04:37.420> 10:00<00:04:37.840> a.m.<00:04:37.960> also<00:04:38.530> Bell<00:04:39.490> looks

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
before 10:00 a.m. also Bell looks

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.880 
before 10:00 a.m. also Bell looks
familiar<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.480> me<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.750> that<00:04:40.930> a<00:04:40.990> telephone<00:04:41.680> Bell

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
familiar to me is that a telephone Bell

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.580 
familiar to me is that a telephone Bell
this<00:04:42.220> is<00:04:42.370> one<00:04:42.550> half<00:04:42.790> of<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.060> telephone<00:04:43.330> Bell<00:04:43.690> so

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
this is one half of a telephone Bell so

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.110 
this is one half of a telephone Bell so
a<00:04:44.620> telephone<00:04:45.070> has<00:04:45.220> two<00:04:45.430> bells<00:04:45.670> each<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:46.060> a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
a telephone has two bells each with a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.340 
a telephone has two bells each with a
different<00:04:46.270> tone<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.960> makes<00:04:47.170> the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
different tone and that makes the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.100 
different tone and that makes the
distinctive<00:04:47.860> ring<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.070> signal<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:49.180> sounds<00:04:49.960> so

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
distinctive ring a signal that sounds so

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.180 
distinctive ring a signal that sounds so
familiar<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.620> all<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.770> us

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
familiar to all of us

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.240 
familiar to all of us
this<00:04:51.700> is<00:04:51.820> one<00:04:52.000> half<00:04:52.180> back<00:04:52.770> now<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.830> other<00:04:54.160> half

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
this is one half back now the other half

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.100 
this is one half back now the other half
of<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.670> telephone<00:04:54.940> Bell

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
of that telephone Bell

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.450 
of that telephone Bell
this<00:04:58.110> device<00:04:59.099> which<00:04:59.789> is<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.330> kitchen<00:05:01.289> timer<00:05:01.469> and

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
this device which is a kitchen timer and

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.189 
this device which is a kitchen timer and
so<00:05:02.669> what<00:05:02.789> I<00:05:02.819> can<00:05:03.000> do<00:05:03.120> here<00:05:03.389> is<00:05:03.449> push<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> button

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
so what I can do here is push a button

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.260 
so what I can do here is push a button
to<00:05:04.409> wake<00:05:04.530> it<00:05:04.710> up<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.039> then<00:05:05.159> by<00:05:05.819> pushing<00:05:06.030> these

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
to wake it up and then by pushing these

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.270 
to wake it up and then by pushing these
buttons<00:05:06.330> here<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:07.080> can<00:05:07.560> increment<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.069> time

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
buttons here I can increment the time

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.559 
buttons here I can increment the time
remaining<00:05:08.550> or<00:05:08.819> deep<00:05:09.000> commit<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.389> time

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
remaining or deep commit the time

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.730 
remaining or deep commit the time
remaining<00:05:11.810> so<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.930> is<00:05:13.050> called<00:05:13.259> the<00:05:13.349> decadron

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
remaining so this is called the decadron

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.839 
remaining so this is called the decadron
suit<00:05:14.129> and<00:05:14.490> it's<00:05:15.180> built<00:05:15.419> above<00:05:15.689> neon<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.289> argon

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
suit and it's built above neon and argon

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:20.420 
suit and it's built above neon and argon
and<00:05:17.849> so<00:05:18.419> that<00:05:18.750> gas<00:05:18.960> will<00:05:19.169> ionize<00:05:19.379> to<00:05:20.069> indicate

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
and so that gas will ionize to indicate

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.550 
and so that gas will ionize to indicate
one<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.699> those<00:05:20.789> positions<00:05:20.969> into<00:05:21.560> now

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
one of those positions into now

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.350 
one of those positions into now
originally<00:05:23.039> they<00:05:23.189> use<00:05:23.340> these<00:05:23.550> tubes<00:05:23.849> before

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
originally they use these tubes before

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.980 
originally they use these tubes before
that<00:05:24.990> invented<00:05:25.909> electronic<00:05:26.909> calculators<00:05:27.539> and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
that invented electronic calculators and

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.469 
that invented electronic calculators and
they<00:05:28.110> use<00:05:28.259> them<00:05:28.500> for<00:05:28.530> felting<00:05:29.039> so<00:05:29.909> for<00:05:30.090> example

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
they use them for felting so for example

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.179 
they use them for felting so for example
you<00:05:30.840> can<00:05:30.990> create<00:05:31.080> a<00:05:31.229> counter<00:05:31.469> by<00:05:31.830> putting<00:05:32.129> a

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
you can create a counter by putting a

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:35.629 
you can create a counter by putting a
row<00:05:32.370> of<00:05:32.520> seems<00:05:32.789> like<00:05:33.060> these<00:05:33.240> together<00:05:33.449> and<00:05:34.639> the

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
row of seems like these together and the

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:37.429 
row of seems like these together and the
device<00:05:35.939> would<00:05:36.150> Karen<00:05:36.449> around<00:05:36.750> until<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.319> hit<00:05:37.409> a

00:05:37.429 --> 00:05:37.439 
device would Karen around until it hit a

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.619 
device would Karen around until it hit a
limit<00:05:37.830> that<00:05:38.009> would<00:05:38.430> trigger<00:05:38.669> an<00:05:38.849> index<00:05:39.240> signal

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
limit that would trigger an index signal

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.659 
limit that would trigger an index signal
which<00:05:40.050> will<00:05:40.289> send<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.770> single<00:05:41.099> pulse<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.550> the

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
which will send a single pulse to the

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:42.950 
which will send a single pulse to the
next<00:05:41.879> stage<00:05:42.120> just<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:42.599> you<00:05:42.659> could<00:05:42.779> get<00:05:42.930> a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
next stage just so you could get a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.839 
next stage just so you could get a
decimal<00:05:43.199> counter<00:05:43.740> so<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.490> have<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> couple

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
decimal counter so you have a couple

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.839 
decimal counter so you have a couple
leads<00:05:45.779> that<00:05:45.990> go<00:05:46.139> in<00:05:46.349> there<00:05:46.650> hook<00:05:47.129> to<00:05:47.370> multiple

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
leads that go in there hook to multiple

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.510 
leads that go in there hook to multiple
pins<00:05:48.060> around<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.659> diameter<00:05:49.199> of<00:05:49.259> that<00:05:49.529> and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
pins around the diameter of that and

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.219 
pins around the diameter of that and
then<00:05:50.639> even<00:05:50.789> drag<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.270> neon<00:05:51.509> back<00:05:51.779> and<00:05:51.990> forth

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
then even drag the neon back and forth

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.420 
then even drag the neon back and forth
that's<00:05:52.379> right<00:05:52.620> so<00:05:52.740> you<00:05:52.800> can<00:05:52.949> move<00:05:53.069> the<00:05:53.189> neon

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
that's right so you can move the neon

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.709 
that's right so you can move the neon
forward<00:05:53.969> so<00:05:54.090> you<00:05:54.150> can<00:05:54.300> move<00:05:54.419> the<00:05:54.539> neon

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
forward so you can move the neon

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.960 
forward so you can move the neon
backwards<00:05:55.229> with<00:05:55.860> just<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.400> simple<00:05:56.729> step<00:05:56.909> input

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
backwards with just a simple step input

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.880 
backwards with just a simple step input
and<00:05:58.180> then<00:05:58.780> in<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:58.960> backyard<00:05:59.350> the<00:05:59.470> time<00:05:59.680> runs

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
and then in the backyard the time runs

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.160 
and then in the backyard the time runs
out<00:06:00.070> this<00:06:00.820> little<00:06:01.000> brass<00:06:01.360> bell<00:06:01.630> ring<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:01.960> let

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
out this little brass bell ring and let

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.130 
out this little brass bell ring and let
you<00:06:02.290> know<00:06:02.410> that<00:06:02.620> your<00:06:02.770> eggs<00:06:02.920> are<00:06:03.070> done<00:06:03.250> cooking

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
you know that your eggs are done cooking

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:10.179 
you know that your eggs are done cooking
perfect<00:06:05.140> time

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.189 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.389 

another<00:06:10.699> Nixie<00:06:11.119> clock<00:06:11.360> over<00:06:11.929> an<00:06:12.259> LED<00:06:12.709> one<00:06:12.979> look

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:13.399 
another Nixie clock over an LED one look

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.909 
another Nixie clock over an LED one look
at<00:06:13.489> that<00:06:13.669> so<00:06:14.360> this<00:06:14.479> is<00:06:14.539> an<00:06:14.749> LED<00:06:15.110> that<00:06:15.139> you<00:06:15.770> might

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
at that so this is an LED that you might

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.040 
at that so this is an LED that you might
see<00:06:16.189> in<00:06:16.339> an<00:06:16.789> old<00:06:16.969> calculator<00:06:17.539> while<00:06:17.959> the

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
see in an old calculator while the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.809 
see in an old calculator while the
camera<00:06:18.409> is<00:06:18.439> big<00:06:18.649> enough<00:06:18.889> the<00:06:19.129> scanner<00:06:19.550> then

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:19.819 
camera is big enough the scanner then

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:21.339 
camera is big enough the scanner then
yeah<00:06:19.969> the<00:06:20.089> standard<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.659> very<00:06:20.869> slow<00:06:21.169> because

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:21.349 
yeah the standard is very slow because

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:24.549 
yeah the standard is very slow because
the<00:06:21.889> device<00:06:22.580> is<00:06:22.610> running<00:06:22.909> at<00:06:23.149> 32<00:06:23.539> kilohertz<00:06:23.839> so

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:24.559 
the device is running at 32 kilohertz so

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.019 
the device is running at 32 kilohertz so
it<00:06:24.619> keeps<00:06:24.769> track<00:06:25.069> of<00:06:25.099> the<00:06:25.249> time<00:06:25.519> and<00:06:25.759> it<00:06:25.879> has

00:06:26.019 --> 00:06:26.029 
it keeps track of the time and it has

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.389 
it keeps track of the time and it has
the<00:06:26.179> multiplex<00:06:26.689> the<00:06:26.839> LEDs<00:06:27.259> but<00:06:28.009> it<00:06:28.159> doesn't

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:28.399 
the multiplex the LEDs but it doesn't

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:29.769 
the multiplex the LEDs but it doesn't
leave<00:06:28.489> a<00:06:28.519> whole<00:06:28.699> lot<00:06:28.729> of<00:06:28.909> processing<00:06:29.389> cycles

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
leave a whole lot of processing cycles

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.979 
leave a whole lot of processing cycles
to<00:06:29.989> do<00:06:30.110> that<00:06:31.059> so<00:06:32.059> what<00:06:32.209> do<00:06:32.269> we<00:06:32.360> have<00:06:32.449> going<00:06:32.629> on

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:32.989 
to do that so what do we have going on

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:34.540 
to do that so what do we have going on
here<00:06:33.050> for<00:06:33.409> the<00:06:33.469> electronic<00:06:34.039> fair<00:06:34.219> let's<00:06:34.369> see

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
here for the electronic fair let's see

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.609 
here for the electronic fair let's see
we've<00:06:34.759> got<00:06:34.909> a<00:06:34.969> pic<00:06:35.599> microcontroller<00:06:36.289> with<00:06:36.589> a

00:06:36.609 --> 00:06:36.619 
we've got a pic microcontroller with a

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:38.079 
we've got a pic microcontroller with a
little<00:06:37.099> voltage<00:06:37.249> regulator

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.089 
little voltage regulator

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.540 
little voltage regulator
I<00:06:38.169> like<00:06:39.169> your<00:06:39.349> prototype<00:06:39.889> in<00:06:40.069> here<00:06:40.309> that's

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
I like your prototype in here that's

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.399 
I like your prototype in here that's
drilled<00:06:40.909> through<00:06:41.209> a<00:06:41.239> piece<00:06:41.419> of<00:06:41.599> lexan<00:06:42.080> and

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
drilled through a piece of lexan and

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:45.730 
drilled through a piece of lexan and
then<00:06:42.529> and<00:06:42.769> then<00:06:42.860> we're<00:06:43.039> like<00:06:43.459> a<00:06:43.699> choir<00:06:44.059> yeah<00:06:44.740> so

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
then and then we're like a choir yeah so

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.809 
then and then we're like a choir yeah so
that<00:06:45.860> was<00:06:45.949> just<00:06:46.039> a<00:06:46.189> fun<00:06:46.309> little<00:06:46.459> experiment

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
that was just a fun little experiment

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.460 
that was just a fun little experiment
just<00:06:47.089> to<00:06:47.240> see<00:06:47.419> what<00:06:47.539> it<00:06:47.629> would<00:06:47.689> look<00:06:47.749> like

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
just to see what it would look like

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.310 
just to see what it would look like
then<00:06:50.010> one<00:06:51.000> final<00:06:51.360> very<00:06:51.750> interesting<00:06:52.230> building

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
then one final very interesting building

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320 
then one final very interesting building
project<00:06:52.860> is<00:06:53.040> this<00:06:53.430> guy<00:06:53.640> right<00:06:53.820> here<00:06:53.880> which<00:06:54.150> I'm

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
project is this guy right here which I'm

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.020 
project is this guy right here which I'm
wearing<00:06:54.540> and<00:06:55.410> this<00:06:55.590> is<00:06:55.650> a<00:06:55.770> Nixie<00:06:56.160> tube<00:06:56.400> but<00:06:56.940> I'm

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
wearing and this is a Nixie tube but I'm

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.790 
wearing and this is a Nixie tube but I'm
wearing<00:06:57.210> it<00:06:57.450> like<00:06:57.630> a<00:06:57.690> pendant<00:06:57.990> and<00:06:58.620> that's

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
wearing it like a pendant and that's

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.050 
wearing it like a pendant and that's
because<00:06:59.070> it's<00:06:59.220> got<00:06:59.340> high<00:06:59.520> voltage<00:06:59.820> power

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
because it's got high voltage power

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.360 
because it's got high voltage power
supply<00:07:00.510> that<00:07:00.750> takes<00:07:00.960> a<00:07:01.230> 3<00:07:01.560> volt<00:07:01.710> point<00:07:02.100> cell

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
supply that takes a 3 volt point cell

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.150 
supply that takes a 3 volt point cell
and<00:07:02.850> it<00:07:02.970> steps<00:07:03.180> the<00:07:03.330> voltage<00:07:03.660> up<00:07:03.840> to<00:07:03.870> 150<00:07:04.830> volts

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
and it steps the voltage up to 150 volts

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.880 
and it steps the voltage up to 150 volts
run<00:07:05.850> the<00:07:06.090> neon<00:07:06.720> in<00:07:06.900> the<00:07:06.960> next<00:07:07.170> C<00:07:07.260> -<00:07:07.410> how<00:07:07.680> are<00:07:07.800> you

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
run the neon in the next C - how are you

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.880 
run the neon in the next C - how are you
doing<00:07:08.160> it<00:07:08.280> well<00:07:09.470> here<00:07:10.470> I<00:07:10.500> can<00:07:10.740> give<00:07:10.860> that

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
doing it well here I can give that

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.070 
doing it well here I can give that
seeker<00:07:11.250> away<00:07:11.520> this<00:07:11.850> is<00:07:12.030> a<00:07:12.060> simple<00:07:12.480> Royer

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.930 
seeker away this is a simple Royer
oscillator<00:07:13.650> circuit<00:07:14.130> so<00:07:14.640> it's<00:07:14.760> two

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
oscillator circuit so it's two

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.970 
oscillator circuit so it's two
transistors<00:07:15.570> that<00:07:15.780> are<00:07:16.140> in<00:07:16.410> a<00:07:16.500> resonant

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980 
transistors that are in a resonant

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.600 
transistors that are in a resonant
configuration<00:07:17.670> with<00:07:18.360> a<00:07:18.390> toroidal<00:07:19.020> e<00:07:19.230> wound

transformer<00:07:20.610> and<00:07:21.150> so<00:07:21.360> it<00:07:21.450> generates<00:07:21.810> sort<00:07:22.380> of

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:22.470 
transformer and so it generates sort of

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.520 
transformer and so it generates sort of
a<00:07:22.530> modified<00:07:22.830> sine<00:07:23.250> wave<00:07:24.020> the<00:07:25.020> output<00:07:25.320> of<00:07:25.410> that

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
a modified sine wave the output of that

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.240 
a modified sine wave the output of that
is<00:07:25.740> a<00:07:26.580> little<00:07:26.820> bit<00:07:26.910> higher<00:07:27.090> voltage<00:07:27.600> AC<00:07:28.160> and<00:07:29.160> I

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
is a little bit higher voltage AC and I

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.590 
is a little bit higher voltage AC and I
run<00:07:29.430> them<00:07:29.610> through<00:07:29.640> a<00:07:29.850> multiplier<00:07:30.330> circuit

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
run them through a multiplier circuit

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.740 
run them through a multiplier circuit
right<00:07:30.930> here<00:07:31.260> to<00:07:31.890> multiply<00:07:32.520> that<00:07:32.700> up<00:07:32.850> to<00:07:33.030> 150

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
right here to multiply that up to 150

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.480
