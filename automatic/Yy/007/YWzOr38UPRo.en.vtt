00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.250
 There are many varieties of combat on 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.900
 guitar but they are based on only three 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.240
 we don't need movement 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.470
 by themselves but also because they help 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.480
 prepare a hand for other types of equipment 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.880
 the first movement is shaking off water 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 bags suppose our hands are wet 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.279
 and here we want to shake off the water 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.920
 just relax with a wave of your hand down 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.920
 then we bring in who we are doing and launch 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.109
 try to hit all the strings 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.180
 but most importantly after hitting the arm 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.820
 instantly relaxes 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.310
 or rather, she is relaxed already in 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.160
 the road that is, it is somehow tense 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.680
 only here in the upper position for 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.430
 of this she is empty limply under power 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.899
 gravity hangs 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 the left hand does not press anything 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.070
 all strings open 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.100
 The main thing here is that the hand is almost everything 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.550
 time was absolutely relaxed except 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 position above 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.479
 the second movement is vice versa 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.810
 relaxed absolutely free and we her 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 rise to the top 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.020
 it actually happens only 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.020
 hand turn in this direction 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.550
 fingers slightly bend inside palm 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.790
 a bit mostly movement all 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.790
 brush 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 hit the strings up from the bottom and hand 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.040
 hang limp again 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.289
 connect these two movements falling down 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.409
 all the same beat the strings they just 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.409
 you 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.240
 fighters practically don't work on 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.360
 extension 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.040
 work just by gravity on 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.830
 flexing work a little bit basically 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:21.300
 work the whole brush and a little bit from the elbows 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 movement is a little important here 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 two things big over all the strings they plan 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.349
 happiness and most importantly relax your hand 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.690
 I repeat the only thing 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.690
 less tense situation is 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:43.350
 here when moving up but still 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.350
 extremely relax your arm 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.709
 the third movement is again based on 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:55.299
 turning the brush like we 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.530
 light bulb fasten like this 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:05.200
 Here in the arm we turn completely free 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:08.950
 then we take the strings near the very 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.829
 neck over the outlet so that it turned out 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.470
 sharp click 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:21.670
 the prize here it is movement by turning hands 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:24.320
 while suppressing the strings 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.760
 again the arm is completely relaxed 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.460
 she just is 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.290
 but we try to hit all the strings 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:36.340
 immediately and now let's try to combine the punch 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.140
 down with that flick arm 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.740
 completely free beats down and after 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.620
 of this 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.620
 instantly more complete rotation of the thumb 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:56.930
 but it's all in one movement a fight at all 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:00.970
 better to play on the outlet closer to the fingerboard 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:04.130
 than here it sounds more tasty 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.900
 it's hard to swing it now 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:17.109
 connect this click 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:19.609
 with the upper movement keeping 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.100
 ultimate hand relaxation like 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.570
 only she stopped working she 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.110
 instantly relaxes instantly her 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.470
 fingers 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:40.790
 limp accelerate but don't forget about 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:42.979
 relaxing your arms and here we already 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.150
 It turned out the simplest form 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.150
 combat gypsy battle 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:05:03.470
 Now we complicate the task a bit 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.470
 alternate down give up counter hit 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:12.210
 where down blow up 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.210
 flip up 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.030
 the coffin is surrounded 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.660
 so 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.660
 on 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:35.429
 click with one thumb can still 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.429
 apply in such more 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:44.389
 This is already a combination method. 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:46.189
 difficult in the left hand we press some 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.279
 a chord in the right hand 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:52.939
 play with your thumb bass three 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:55.759
 fingers chaplin chord and after that with 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:06:00.789
 span beat thumb only 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.789
 ambassador to the strings and again i will pluck mccord 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.560
 or you can not pinch with three fingers 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.560
 chord pointing up
