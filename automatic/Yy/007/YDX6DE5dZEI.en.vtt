HDMI cable this one comes in the ps4

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.790 
HDMI cable this one comes in the ps4
again<00:00:48.960> every<00:00:49.289> ps4<00:00:49.739> has<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:51.239> specific<00:00:52.050> HDMI

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
again every ps4 has this specific HDMI

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.700 
again every ps4 has this specific HDMI
cable<00:00:53.190> inside<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.379> hook<00:00:55.620> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
cable inside of it and you just hook it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979

console which I'll just use the manual
here<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> illustrate<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.840> located<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.350> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
here to illustrate is located right on

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.039 
here to illustrate is located right on
the<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.270> those<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.570> recessed

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
the back in one of those little recessed
ports<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.070> I've<00:01:08.700> got<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> HDMI<00:01:09.330> cable<00:01:09.360> I've

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
ports so I've got the HDMI cable I've

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.100 
ports so I've got the HDMI cable I've
got<00:01:09.900> my<00:01:10.049> Ethernet<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.860> LAN<00:01:11.369> cable<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.110> and

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
got my Ethernet or a LAN cable here and
like<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.860> don't<00:01:14.040> need<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> hook

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
like I said you don't need this to hook

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
like I said you don't need this to hook
up<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> Internet<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.869> happen<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.290> have

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
up to the Internet I just happen to have

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.039 
up to the Internet I just happen to have
my<00:01:16.530> ps4<00:01:17.159> right<00:01:17.729> next<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.180> router<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
my ps4 right next to my router which is

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.810 
my ps4 right next to my router which is
right<00:01:19.770> over<00:01:20.150> here<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> hook<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
right over here so I can just hook it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
right over here so I can just hook it
right<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.390> them<00:01:25.020> both<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> router

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
right up to them both on the router

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.039 
right up to them both on the router
directly<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> wire<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.600> if<00:01:27.780> you're<00:01:27.900> using

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
directly with a wire but if you're using

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.920 
directly with a wire but if you're using
Wi-Fi<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.740> also<00:01:29.270> connect<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.479> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.630> with

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
Wi-Fi you can also connect to Wi-Fi with

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090 
Wi-Fi you can also connect to Wi-Fi with
this<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:32.930> step<00:01:33.930> number<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.259> after<00:01:34.920> plugging

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
this so step number one after plugging

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950 
this so step number one after plugging
in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> power<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.180> want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.659> ps4

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
in the power you want to take the ps4

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
in the power you want to take the ps4
and<00:01:39.320> plug<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:42.049> HDMI<00:01:43.049> cable<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.280> back

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and plug in the HDMI cable to the back

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.490 
and plug in the HDMI cable to the back
now<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.060> plugging<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
now if you're plugging this in and

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
now if you're plugging this in and
you're<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.890> having<00:01:47.070> trouble<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
know reaching around finding which port

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.740 
know reaching around finding which port
it<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> back<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> third<00:01:53.159> port

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
it is in the back it is the third port

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
it is in the back it is the third port
from<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.500> far<00:01:55.829> right<00:01:56.159> side<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.579> the
