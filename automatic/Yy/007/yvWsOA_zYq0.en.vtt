oh yeah oh that's breezy too
oh<00:01:11.939> there's<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.149> wire<00:01:13.329> right<00:01:13.659> there

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.560 

to<00:01:20.320> where

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.620 

it<00:01:23.930> doesn't<00:01:24.320> look<00:01:24.440> down<00:01:24.680> food

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.929 

like<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> water<00:01:33.229> came<00:01:33.590> ran<00:01:33.950> out

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.830 

straight<00:01:37.539> out<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.869> authority

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.600 

there's<00:01:41.079> supposed<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.590> two<00:01:41.829> wires<00:01:42.100> going

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
there's supposed to be two wires going

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.340 
there's supposed to be two wires going
up<00:01:42.790> in<00:01:42.939> there

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
up in there

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.350 
up in there
now<00:01:45.700> I've<00:01:46.700> got<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.350> ingenious<00:01:48.350> plan<00:01:48.620> here<00:01:49.360> it

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
now I've got a ingenious plan here it

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.920 
now I've got a ingenious plan here it
works<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.870> works<00:01:51.190> if<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.460> don't<00:01:52.700> work<00:01:52.930> well

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
works it works if it don't work well

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.420 
works it works if it don't work well
I'll<00:01:54.140> have<00:01:54.230> to<00:01:54.290> get<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.500> speed<00:01:54.740> sensor<00:01:54.920> anyway

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
I'll have to get a speed sensor anyway

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.530 
I'll have to get a speed sensor anyway
so<00:01:55.990> here's<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.140> we're<00:01:57.260> gonna<00:01:57.380> do<00:01:58.390> I'm<00:01:59.390> gonna

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.120 
so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna
take<00:01:59.690> these<00:02:00.610> wire<00:02:01.610> cutters<00:02:02.030> here

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
take these wire cutters here

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.859 
take these wire cutters here
strippers<00:02:04.130> cutters<00:02:07.119> cut<00:02:08.119> off<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> section<00:02:08.660> of

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
strippers cutters cut off a section of

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.250 
strippers cutters cut off a section of
wire<00:02:09.430> he<00:02:10.430> worked<00:02:10.610> really<00:02:10.850> well

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
wire he worked really well

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.100 
wire he worked really well
turn<00:02:12.260> off<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.530> section<00:02:12.770> wire<00:02:13.570> skip<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.690> off

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
turn off the section wire skip it off

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.410 
turn off the section wire skip it off
they<00:02:15.980> just<00:02:16.190> she's<00:02:17.380> squeezing<00:02:18.380> him<00:02:19.360> pull<00:02:20.360> off

they just she's squeezing him pull off

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.160 
they just she's squeezing him pull off
the<00:02:20.660> insulation<00:02:21.760> all<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:22.850> now<00:02:23.090> take<00:02:24.020> about

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the insulation all right now take about

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.560 
the insulation all right now take about
three<00:02:24.440> strands<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.130> this<00:02:25.250> wire<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.790> this

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
three strands of this wire and this

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.480 
three strands of this wire and this
straight<00:02:26.990> pin<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.680> sewing<00:02:28.100> needle

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
straight pin it is sewing needle

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
twist the wire around the needle cut off

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.100 
twist the wire around the needle cut off
a<00:02:48.250> little<00:02:48.790> shorter<00:02:49.240> strip<00:02:49.720> back<00:02:49.900> some

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
a little shorter strip back some

a little shorter strip back some
insulation<00:02:50.820> what<00:02:51.820> I'm<00:02:51.940> gonna<00:02:52.090> do<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.870> that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
insulation what I'm gonna do in that

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.690 
insulation what I'm gonna do in that
area<00:02:53.350> where<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> wire<00:02:53.830> came<00:02:54.280> out<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.610> the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
area where the wire came out of the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.810 
area where the wire came out of the
sensor<00:02:55.120> I'm<00:02:55.570> gonna<00:02:55.930> jab<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.890> pin<00:02:57.310> it's<00:02:57.580> far

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
sensor I'm gonna jab this pin it's far

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.850 
sensor I'm gonna jab this pin it's far
up<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:58.300> as<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.540> can<00:02:58.720> go<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.200> then<00:02:59.709> I'm
