00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.790
 great love 1000 ps fans you will notice in 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.429
 1000 ps land burns the fire for us 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 every two-wheeler for every motorized 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.140
 two wheel clock street she is and we are 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:23.250
 well with 72 ps overjoyed well not 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.269
 all but the new delight of yamaha 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.849
 team 72 ps and you can tell because it is there 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 just a city moped so one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.030
 stadtroller because it's 125cc too 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.860
 if he has only 114 kubik but it for 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.320
 the city is made and in the city 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 he was so agile and good for that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 to drive 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 that in reality the smaller nobitz 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:58.079
 competition makes a small problem 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.899
 could be the pronunciation of the rollers 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.049
 I'll say the name just like he did 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.920
 is the people but what the apostrophe 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.560
 actually maybe that should mean or 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 light or unfortunately we just say 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.049
 the people and thun yamaha give them one 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.450
 I am happy and say that anyway 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.790
 Delight is a good start scooter 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.210
 98 kilo only weighs as always said that always 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.820
 at the level normal moped has but 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.610
 just over seven ps so in city traffic 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.880
 is that really good 50 it works 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.140
 even reasonably good at 70 just 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 I also drove highway 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.619
 and well with that one weighs with 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 because more than 85 is not there 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.490
 not actually with trucks 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.600
 matched the overtake one and you can 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.350
 then just in the wind shadow 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 hang 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 and if you got lucky times 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.250
 a Czech long-distance driver of the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.320
 asked Dachau the cruise control at 95 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.990
 has and then you can go back 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.780
 after a quick as soon as you want to overtake 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.150
 at the latest at the third axis of the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.160
 trailer will be overhauled again 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.400
 yes but that's no problem for everyone 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.080
 the city is just excellent 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.180
 conceptualized it also looks 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 insanely good in my opinion 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.350
 it is already clear what it is about 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.290
 until november verschnitt be 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.060
 You can tell that from the front headlight 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.100
 the tail light and the integrated 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.780
 but turn signals to the round shape this 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.600
 not bad it just succeeded 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.300
 The color of this model is white 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.739
 black or brown and it is such a 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.510
 metallic seebronn that just looks 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.410
 really good he also offers a lot 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.360
 pleasant comfort features 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.100
 you can see the tank cap of the tank 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.090
 in the apron quite easily per 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.280
 open steering lock 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.790
 that works with his 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.769
 Tug works perfectly yamaha 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.530
 great quality also the fittings 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.330
 bit of a vespa imitated in the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.570
 classic outfit work though 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.120
 also faultless you have in front 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.680
 you still have a small compartment at the front 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.930
 the right side is open 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.860
 not lockable but it fits too 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.880
 small utensils into the one just 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 not necessarily wind and weather 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.209
 must protect and if Sonic is well then 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.310
 Of course you can go that way 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.959
 The trunk is very easy 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.980
 open once 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.370
 by remote unlock the tray 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.709
 well develop fits in well 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.660
 other shows also a full sight 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.019
 Unfortunately, bright does not fit into it 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.420
 on the other hand with its city scooter 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.989
 you anyway mainly with a chat 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.329
 be on the way and in the city has 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.890
 he just has his authority in the city 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.989
 work excellent the the 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.570
 line has as always there 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.190
 Chassis and brake system you notice 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.100
 also that the delight mainly for 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:03.010
 which was conceived city 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.900
 front 180 - I 'll say a single one 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.730
 the goals actually not even that way 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.840
 bad only from very high 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.989
 speeds 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.480
 although 95 or 90 km h are not now 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.340
 It's hard to be that high 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.019
 the rear brake really needs 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.459
 mainly support from 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.199
 require like others roll that 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.669
 the rear pulls stronger that is when 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.870
 maybe not necessarily the case 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.789
 rear is relatively weak one 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.139
 drum brake but it is okay too 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:32.410
 Chassis scooter just small tires 12 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.300
 inch tires therefore a bit wobbly but in 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.030
 Reality the 98 kilo 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.000
 You can literally turn it on 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.550
 so so a very easy handling 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.080
 So the delight actually works too 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.940
 a lot of fun because the engine 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.620
 so strong is that one too 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.380
 country road pace swim along very well 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.210
 But can the handling of a moped 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.070
 his one of a very small rollers so 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.070
 that's funny with the delite
