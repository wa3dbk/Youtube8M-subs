00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.108
When people are on a stage and hold talks using a computer,

00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:09.099
they control the computer with a small manageable remote.

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.800
This may work or not. But it can also be simpler,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.150
like a magician in a Walt Disney film

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.149
simply controlling the computer with a hand gesture.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:24.348
Two Viennese Wizards have now found out 
how to do this with Microsoft Kinect.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:33.000
Unexpected things... Hopeful things....

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.500
...so beautiful could the world be.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.620
Since spring the movement sensor Kinect is available not only just for funny console games but also for Windows.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.280
The possibilities are endless.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.679
The reality does look a bit different as in the advertisement video.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.399
Just with the device it is not possible to do much,

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.479
the right software is missing and so there is just a demo

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.619
which allows to move a few presorted photos to the left and right.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.739
This was no enough for these two - Viennese Alexander Pfeiffer and Alexander Seewald.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.390
I have imported the Kinect for windows from Germany...

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.400
in March and wanted to start right away...

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.609
... and do my presentations with it, that was my vision.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.340
Then I did a bit of research what finished software was available.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.400
And I noticed that Microsoft had announced a development competition in the USA...

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.500
where great projects arise.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.569
Arising meaning that they are not yet available.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.509
So both shortly afterwards developed their own control software for Kinect...

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.239
a Universal Remote, this means that it is possible to control any Windows program via hand gestures.

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:38.679
The device translates the gestures virtually into a keystroke.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.770
The kinect is delivered with a software program akak interface which recognizes humans.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.820
You stand in front of the kinect, within a few seconds the sensor knows you are standing in front of it...

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.119
the sensor knows where your shoulders, ellbows, hands, knees, feet, etcetera, are.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.209
The goal was to build a truly robust system, where people who are acquainted with tablets and know all the multitouch gestures...

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:11.530
left, right, zoom-in, zoom-out, can stand in front of the system and work with it instantly without having to change anything.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.449
Clearly Word and Excel is hard to control with this.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.659
However it is ideal for presentations using Powerpoint or Prezi.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.289
And this is how it works!

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.979
With Universal Remote we can use diverse gestures to control the presentation.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.899
The simplest things are left/right movements. We take the hand to the front, move it to the left

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.430
- we can imagine sitting in front of a Tablet-PC - and exactly in this order the slides are moved.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.509
Then there are zoom gesture, which can be inverted, i.e. freely adapted.

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:48.079
Here we would start a zoom-in.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:54.079
And in the other direction a zoom-out.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.598
Which diagonal is irrelevant, this means I can also move my hands like this to get the same gesture.

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:04.909
Another feature is to press the mouse button, the left one, and can then move the screen around freely...

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:13.060
this means, hand up equals press mouse button, and move the screen freely with the other hand.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.939
Obviously the inventor can control his software.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.930
We do the W.24 test.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.590
And conclude that, if one stand at the right distance and especially alone in front of the device it recognizes the commands perfectly.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.090
While developers in the USA are still tinkering, there is now a universally applicable kinect software made in Vienna.

00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:37.219
Even old games like Tetris can be controlled like this.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.519
Did it really need two Viennese to develop the first really functioning control software for this?

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.870
Apparently yes, we were also surprised that there was nothing suitable.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.430
The basic version for simple presentations is available at just 10 EUR.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.769
The Kinect hardware costs around 200 EUR.

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:01.030
The gesture control will become really interesting with Windows 8, which has been designed for touch control and hand gestures.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.598
But the both developers have different ideas as well.

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:13.899
Imagine, the Kärtner-Straße (Vienna shopping street) on a Sunday (shops are closed on Sundays) - a provider for clothes has the kinect in a shopping window, it goes through glass, this is wonderful...

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.339
and so you could scroll through the products while you pass time or wait for the bus or so.
