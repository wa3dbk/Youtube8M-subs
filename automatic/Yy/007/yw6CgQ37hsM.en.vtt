00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
edge onto the circular part of the face

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.770 
edge onto the circular part of the face
triangles<00:01:36.799> then<00:01:37.490> sew<00:01:37.729> them<00:01:37.909> together<00:01:40.780> after

triangles then sew them together after

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.630 
triangles then sew them together after
that<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.409> short<00:01:42.740> side<00:01:42.920> of<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.130> large<00:01:43.369> body

piece<00:01:43.850> together<00:01:44.500> you<00:01:45.500> should<00:01:45.649> end<00:01:45.799> up<00:01:45.890> with

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
piece together you should end up with

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.170 
piece together you should end up with
something<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.430> looks<00:01:46.549> like<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:48.549> next<00:01:49.549> pin

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
something that looks like this next pin

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.430 
something that looks like this next pin
and<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.780> outer<00:01:50.990> edges<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.320> the
