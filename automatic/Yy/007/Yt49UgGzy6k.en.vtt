pull<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.650> too<00:04:22.800> tight<00:04:23.450> but<00:04:24.450> that's<00:04:24.660> what<00:04:24.870> it's

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
pull it too tight but that's what it's

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.170 
pull it too tight but that's what it's
going<00:04:25.349> to<00:04:25.440> look<00:04:25.590> like<00:04:25.700> and<00:04:26.700> you're<00:04:26.970> going<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
going to look like and you're going to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.260 
going to look like and you're going to
see<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:28.200> raw<00:04:28.349> edges<00:04:28.620> but<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.460> like<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:30.000> look<00:04:30.150> of

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
see the raw edges but I like the look of

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.820 
see the raw edges but I like the look of
the<00:04:30.510> raw<00:04:30.660> edges<00:04:32.270> some<00:04:33.270> people<00:04:33.660> don't<00:04:33.960> but<00:04:34.500> I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the raw edges some people don't but I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.820 
the raw edges some people don't but I
think<00:04:35.220> that<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.849> adds<00:04:36.090> an<00:04:36.330> element<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:37.050> it<00:04:37.380> that

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
think that it adds an element to it that

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.940 
think that it adds an element to it that
makes<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.430> less<00:04:38.760> oh<00:04:41.030> nice<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.800> quilt

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
makes it less oh nice and quilt

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.370 
makes it less oh nice and quilt
quilty<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.849> a<00:04:44.940> little<00:04:45.210> bit<00:04:45.360> more<00:04:45.599> ragged<00:04:45.930> and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
quilty and a little bit more ragged and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.200 
quilty and a little bit more ragged and
rugged<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.340> handmade<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.960> that's<00:04:49.229> my<00:04:49.500> opinion

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
rugged and handmade so that's my opinion

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.529 
rugged and handmade so that's my opinion
um<00:04:51.590> when<00:04:52.590> I<00:04:52.889> run<00:04:53.250> out<00:04:53.430> of<00:04:53.460> thread<00:04:54.560> I'm<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:56.070> to

to<00:05:18.120> change<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.570> thread<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:18.930> my<00:05:18.960> needle<00:05:19.110> I<00:05:19.680> pick

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
to change the thread in my needle I pick

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.760 
to change the thread in my needle I pick
another<00:05:20.370> color<00:05:20.940> like<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:22.289> know<00:05:22.380> just

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
another color like you know just

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.240 
another color like you know just
something<00:05:23.250> else<00:05:24.289> so<00:05:25.289> it's<00:05:25.469> not<00:05:25.620> just<00:05:25.680> yellow

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
something else so it's not just yellow

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.040 
something else so it's not just yellow
all<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.550> way<00:05:26.729> around<00:05:27.030> because

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
all the way around because

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.650 
all the way around because
it<00:05:28.620> just<00:05:28.860> makes<00:05:29.040> them<00:05:29.220> more<00:05:29.250> interesting<00:05:29.660> so

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
it just makes them more interesting so

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.140 
it just makes them more interesting so
then<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:30.990> next<00:05:31.200> thread<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:31.980> I<00:05:32.040> do<00:05:32.160> again<00:05:32.880> I'm

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
then the next thread that I do again I'm

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.580 
then the next thread that I do again I'm
just<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.510> to<00:05:33.600> I'm<00:05:34.170> going<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.350> poke<00:05:34.470> it

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
through from the front to back again

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.330 
through from the front to back again
that<00:05:37.110> little<00:05:37.380> knots<00:05:37.590> going<00:05:37.770> to<00:05:37.890> kind<00:05:38.130> of<00:05:38.190> be

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340

going when you get to the corner okay so
when<00:05:51.930> you<00:05:52.050> get<00:05:52.200> to<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.470> corner<00:05:52.800> like<00:05:53.040> this

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
when you get to the corner like this

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.800 
when you get to the corner like this
you're<00:05:55.440> going<00:05:55.590> to<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:56.540> kind<00:05:57.540> of<00:05:59.630> turn<00:06:00.630> this

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
you're going to just kind of turn this

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.730 
you're going to just kind of turn this
over<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:02.520> then<00:06:02.550> I'm<00:06:03.210> going<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:03.960> I'm<00:06:04.260> putting

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
over and then I'm going to I'm putting

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.610 
over and then I'm going to I'm putting
the<00:06:04.860> needle<00:06:04.890> right<00:06:05.610> and<00:06:06.000> the<00:06:06.240> edge<00:06:06.450> of<00:06:07.440> the

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
the needle right and the edge of the

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.970 
the needle right and the edge of the
fabric<00:06:07.830> the<00:06:08.220> corner<00:06:08.580> of<00:06:08.700> it<00:06:09.740> there's<00:06:10.740> really

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
fabric the corner of it there's really

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.280 
fabric the corner of it there's really
no<00:06:11.280> right<00:06:11.550> or<00:06:11.580> wrong<00:06:11.790> way<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.180> do<00:06:12.450> a<00:06:12.480> corner<00:06:12.930> but

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
no right or wrong way to do a corner but

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.290 
no right or wrong way to do a corner but
that's<00:06:13.530> how<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:13.740> do<00:06:13.920> it<00:06:14.130> so<00:06:14.460> it's<00:06:14.730> kind<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.150> is

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
that's how I do it so it's kind of is

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.570 
that's how I do it so it's kind of is
already<00:06:15.510> going<00:06:15.900> over<00:06:16.230> like<00:06:16.410> that<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:17.100> then<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
already going over like that and then I

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.310 
already going over like that and then I
just<00:06:17.910> continue<00:06:18.480> on<00:06:19.220> this<00:06:20.220> side<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:21.240> it's<00:06:21.960> okay

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
just continue on this side and it's okay

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.370 
just continue on this side and it's okay
if<00:06:22.470> it's<00:06:22.680> not<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:24.560> exact<00:06:25.560> corner<00:06:26.840> or<00:06:27.840> if<00:06:28.080> it's<00:06:28.260> a

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
if it's not a exact corner or if it's a

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.490 
if it's not a exact corner or if it's a
weird<00:06:28.680> corner<00:06:29.240> it's<00:06:30.240> not<00:06:30.540> really<00:06:30.960> a<00:06:30.990> big<00:06:31.260> deal

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
weird corner it's not really a big deal

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.480 
weird corner it's not really a big deal
so<00:06:32.750> go<00:06:33.750> all<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.230> way<00:06:34.260> around<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:35.220> I'm<00:06:35.340> going

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
so go all the way around and I'm going

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.300 
so go all the way around and I'm going
to<00:06:35.550> show<00:06:35.700> you<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:35.940> next<00:06:36.120> step
