00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.850 
student so it's just so mind-boggling I
mean<00:01:10.450> I<00:01:10.570> just<00:01:10.600> cannot<00:01:11.260> even<00:01:11.320> begin<00:01:11.710> to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
mean I just cannot even begin to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.240 
mean I just cannot even begin to
comprehend<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:13.659> she<00:01:13.720> even<00:01:14.290> thought<00:01:14.680> about<00:01:14.830> it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
comprehend how she even thought about it

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.200 
comprehend how she even thought about it
or<00:01:15.610> did<00:01:15.790> this<00:01:16.000> I<00:01:16.360> just<00:01:16.780> thought<00:01:17.280> why<00:01:18.280> not<00:01:18.490> I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
or did this I just thought why not I

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.789 
or did this I just thought why not I
mean<00:01:19.930> what<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:21.070> there<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.549> lose<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:23.229> when

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
mean what is there to lose so so when

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.560 
mean what is there to lose so so when

how do you begin to understand it first
it<00:01:30.340> was<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.520> little<00:01:30.610> bit<00:01:30.939> overwhelming<00:01:31.659> but<00:01:32.200> I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
it was a little bit overwhelming but I

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.140 
it was a little bit overwhelming but I
found<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.799> it<00:01:33.040> almost<00:01:33.460> became<00:01:33.909> like<00:01:34.119> a

found that it almost became like a

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.999 
found that it almost became like a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.069 

here's<00:01:56.200> what<00:01:56.380> I<00:01:56.409> did<00:01:56.770> get<00:01:57.360> Angela's<00:01:58.360> idea<00:01:58.720> was

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
here's what I did get Angela's idea was

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.800 
here's what I did get Angela's idea was
to<00:01:59.290> mix<00:01:59.500> cancer<00:02:00.070> medicine<00:02:00.579> in<00:02:00.700> a<00:02:00.790> polymer<00:02:01.210> that

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
to mix cancer medicine in a polymer that

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.310 
to mix cancer medicine in a polymer that
would<00:02:01.960> attach<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.680> these<00:02:02.970> nanoparticles

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
would attach to these nanoparticles

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.630 
would attach to these nanoparticles
nanoparticles<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.710> would<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.040> attach<00:02:06.399> to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
nanoparticles that would then attach to

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.419 
nanoparticles that would then attach to

cancer cells and show up on an MRI so

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.280 
cancer cells and show up on an MRI so
doctors<00:02:09.849> could<00:02:10.059> see<00:02:10.299> exactly<00:02:10.599> where<00:02:11.169> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
tumors are then she thought what if you

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.980 
tumors are then she thought what if you
aimed<00:02:14.499> in
