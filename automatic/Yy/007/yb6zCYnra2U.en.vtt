00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.800 
wondered why lampposts in games are like
really<00:06:29.370> like<00:06:29.730> always<00:06:29.970> on<00:06:30.270> completely

them<00:06:32.930> there's<00:06:33.930> only<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.110> few<00:06:34.260> games<00:06:34.440> I<00:06:34.620> think

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
them there's only a few games I think

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.410 
them there's only a few games I think
that<00:06:34.890> actually<00:06:35.070> have<00:06:35.370> solid<00:06:35.730> lampposts

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 
that actually have solid lampposts

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.090 
that actually have solid lampposts
I<00:06:36.470> think<00:06:37.470> mafia<00:06:37.830> two<00:06:38.190> possibly<00:06:39.000> may<00:06:39.480> be<00:06:39.540> wrong

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
I think mafia two possibly may be wrong

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.380 
I think mafia two possibly may be wrong
I'm<00:06:41.100> sure<00:06:41.160> there's<00:06:41.400> a<00:06:41.430> game<00:06:41.640> though<00:06:41.850> well<00:06:42.300> they

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
I'm sure there's a game though well they

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.060 
I'm sure there's a game though well they
are<00:06:42.510> solid<00:06:43.020> and<00:06:43.110> is<00:06:43.230> a<00:06:43.260> real<00:06:43.470> likely<00:06:43.770> because

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
are solid and is a real likely because

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.440 
are solid and is a real likely because
you<00:06:44.220> expect<00:06:44.700> you<00:06:44.850> better<00:06:45.030> go<00:06:45.180> straight

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
you expect you better go straight
