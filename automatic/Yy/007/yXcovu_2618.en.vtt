00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
store where I bought the adopters so we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.170 
store where I bought the adopters so we
have<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.710> adapter<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.880> seems<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
have the adapter here and it seems to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.150 
have the adapter here and it seems to
work<00:00:27.300> pretty<00:00:27.480> well<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> does<00:00:28.740> got

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
work pretty well or I think it does got

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.520 
work pretty well or I think it does got
this<00:00:29.369> nice<00:00:29.910> own<00:00:31.309> coyly<00:00:32.309> thing<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.360> guess<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this nice own coyly thing I guess and

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.270 
this nice own coyly thing I guess and
one<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> ends<00:00:35.579> goes<00:00:35.790> straight<00:00:36.450> into<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
one of the ends goes straight into the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
one of the ends goes straight into the
the<00:00:38.280> audio<00:00:38.610> device<00:00:38.910> out<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.480> audio

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

the audio device out of your audio
recording<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.640> basic

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
recording it's just like a it's a basic

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.819 
recording it's just like a it's a basic
my<00:00:42.270> kind<00:00:42.480> of<00:00:42.570> headphone<00:00:43.200> jack<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> get

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.560 
my kind of headphone jack like you get
like<00:00:44.040> your<00:00:44.280> buds<00:00:44.460> or<00:00:44.700> something<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.180> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
where the headphone jack goes the bigger

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240 
where the headphone jack goes the bigger
of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> two<00:00:59.160> plugs<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.379> splits<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> goes

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
of the two plugs and splits and it goes

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
of the two plugs and splits and it goes
into<00:01:02.550> again<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> audio<00:01:03.870> recorder<00:01:04.290> and

into again to the audio recorder and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
into again to the audio recorder and
then<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.610> comes<00:01:05.790> down<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.390> this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
then it all comes down to the other this

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.700 
then it all comes down to the other this
other<00:01:07.790> plug<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.909> guess<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> could<00:01:09.360> call<00:01:09.710> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
other plug I guess you could call and

other plug I guess you could call and
this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> goes<00:01:11.369> into<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> headphone<00:01:12.530> port<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
this is goes into the headphone port of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.039 
this is goes into the headphone port of
the<00:01:14.040> intercom<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> plane<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the intercom of the plane so it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
the intercom of the plane so it
basically<00:01:16.320> takes<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:16.799> headphone<00:01:17.100> jack<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
basically takes your headphone jack it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.520 
basically takes your headphone jack it
splits<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> into<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:19.110> goes<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
splits it into two one goes into the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320 
splits it into two one goes into the
audio<00:01:19.740> recorder<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.310> other<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> goes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
audio recorder and the other one goes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
audio recorder and the other one goes
straight<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:21.750> into<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.439> guy<00:01:22.619> which<00:01:23.009> goes

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
straight down into this guy which goes

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.980 
straight down into this guy which goes
straight<00:01:23.460> into<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> plane<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.180> haven't<00:01:24.930> had

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
straight into the plane I haven't had

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.410 
straight into the plane I haven't had
any<00:01:25.259> problems<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.040> interference<00:01:26.880> or<00:01:27.119> hasn't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
any problems with interference or hasn't

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.030 
any problems with interference or hasn't
altered<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:28.610> NR<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> headset<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.710> I

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
altered my NR in my headset at all so I

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.140 
altered my NR in my headset at all so I
mean<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:33.060> recommend<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.930> about

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
mean I would recommend this it was about

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
mean I would recommend this it was about
$37<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.360> my<00:01:36.570> pilot<00:01:37.079> store<00:01:37.259> i<00:01:37.290> think<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> was

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
$37 on my pilot store i think that was

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.420 
$37 on my pilot store i think that was
even<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.250> sale<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.390> pretty<00:01:40.430> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
even on sale so it's a pretty pretty a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.399 
even on sale so it's a pretty pretty a
phone<00:01:41.790> call<00:01:41.939> cheap<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.450> less<00:01:42.750> expensive

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
phone call cheap but less expensive

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.230 
phone call cheap but less expensive
alternative<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:44.340> buying<00:01:44.520> those<00:01:44.729> really

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
alternative to buying those really

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
alternative to buying those really
expensive<00:01:45.680> $400<00:01:48.110> audio<00:01:49.110> devices<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.009> clears

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
expensive $400 audio devices it clears

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
expensive $400 audio devices it clears

playing<00:02:02.270> field<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:03.050> that<00:02:03.260> and<00:02:03.800> yeah<00:02:04.370> that's

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
playing field of that and yeah that's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.130 
playing field of that and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:04.610> much<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:04.910> so<00:02:05.330> can<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.600> call<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.930> glow<00:02:06.050> if
