comparison<00:00:26.699> between<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.570> Sony<00:00:27.840> Xperia<00:00:28.170> z3

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
comparison between the Sony Xperia z3

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.580 
comparison between the Sony Xperia z3
compact<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.970> samsung<00:00:30.420> galaxy<00:00:30.449> a5<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
compact and the samsung galaxy a5 and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.900 
compact and the samsung galaxy a5 and
the<00:00:31.679> only<00:00:31.920> reason<00:00:32.219> why<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.399> doing<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.730> video

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the only reason why I'm doing this video

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
the only reason why I'm doing this video
is<00:00:33.210> simply<00:00:33.510> because<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.200> handsets<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.190> going

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
is simply because the handsets are going

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.880 
is simply because the handsets are going
to<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.760> around<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.239> same<00:00:36.450> price<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.559> before

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
to be around the same price so before

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.110 
to be around the same price so before
you<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.520> out<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> purchase

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you actually go out there and purchase

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.100 
you actually go out there and purchase
either<00:00:39.600> one

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
either one

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.869 
either one

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
compact now in terms of the build

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
compact now in terms of the build
quality<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> design<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.540> handset<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> an

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
quality and the design the handset is an

quality and the design the handset is an
aluminium<00:01:07.500> bill<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:08.939> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.299> feel

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
aluminium bill so it's not going to feel

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.010 
aluminium bill so it's not going to feel
as<00:01:09.750> premium<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.979> Samsung<00:01:11.549> Galaxy<00:01:11.670> a5<00:01:12.150> but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
as premium as the Samsung Galaxy a5 but

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750 
as premium as the Samsung Galaxy a5 but
with<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.409> said<00:01:13.740> there's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.250> lot<00:01:14.549> of

with that said there's a lot of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
with that said there's a lot of
advantages<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.560> build<00:01:16.770> quality<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.220> the

advantages to the build quality of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.999 
advantages to the build quality of the
Sony<00:01:17.610> experience<00:01:18.150> head<00:01:18.299> free<00:01:18.540> compact<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.590> we

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
Sony experience head free compact now we

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380 
Sony experience head free compact now we
go<00:01:20.220> ahead<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.549> actually<00:01:20.670> look<00:01:20.970> at<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> weight

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
go ahead and actually look at the weight

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.350 
go ahead and actually look at the weight
so<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.720> terms<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.080> weight<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> handset<00:01:22.890> weighs

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
so in terms of weight the handset weighs

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
so in terms of weight the handset weighs
129<00:01:24.360> grams<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.920> around<00:01:26.369> eight<00:01:26.700> point

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
129 grams and it is around eight point

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.030 
129 grams and it is around eight point
six<00:01:27.360> millimeters<00:01:27.630> thick<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.770> that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
six millimeters thick so it's not that

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
six millimeters thick so it's not that
thick<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.790> not<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> heavy<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.350> so

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
thick and it's not that heavy what is so

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
thick and it's not that heavy what is so
special<00:01:31.590> about<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.310> design<00:01:32.640> aspect<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> these
