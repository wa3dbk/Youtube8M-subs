00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.360
 hello youtube friends how are you 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.950
 It is a video tutorial where he will teach you 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.290
 to make a doorbell 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:19.500
 common and current for your house 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:22.550
 and good to do your home account is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.769
 brick I do not know 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.279
 and I in this case nothing else to represent 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.279
 on the wall 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.690
 and here 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.960
 but the smaller one followed more 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 little bigger does not matter 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.510
 then we put the door 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.399
 and a button to ring 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 and they can also ring 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.490
 automatic with price plate more 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.330
 complicated 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:03.320
 then you will see here the button 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.320
 then just back 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.530
 we will put red sound 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.190
 like stone 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.450
 two 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.100
 sometimes 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.100
 and we drive it 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.750
 my block of notes and we already press five 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.750
 times 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.939
 since it has five times we will put a 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.939
 repeater 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.110
 to the maximum 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.630
 and nothing else we put one 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 then the first part are arias 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.579
 and we would have to put 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.180
 several reasons 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.350
 and we put 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.900
 and the repeater all to the maximum 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.020
 maybe the music burns 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.020
 but the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.430
 or 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.989
 and if they want him to get more spaced 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.989
 nothing else they put the repeated now yes 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.090
 with the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.090
 one 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.550
 and well there should be a room 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.140
 special I do not know how to divide by one 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.920
 the brick 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.920
 here 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.910
 so it does not look so ugly 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.400
 and well I hope you liked the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.800
