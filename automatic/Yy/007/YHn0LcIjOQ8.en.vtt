00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.500
 description even if you just that 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 It was easy for him to enter 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.620
 is now so it is about this settled 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.700
 which you can ask very simple 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.930
 we have known the cd aborted 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.780
 canceled 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.760
 Here the list was from will still 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.500
 looked at the ears 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.140
 that is what classic just coq au 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:43.510
 vin the list is looked I 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.120
 have often shown that small four 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 weeks with the suggestion not practical 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.680
 if that 's it 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.720
 had 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.060
 and he explains how to do this here 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.739
 the simplest way to do a part of it 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:03.320
 you have seen or seen her well 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:07.240
 So then I watch you give the name a 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:13.200
 okay she could be 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 then that should be loud and good 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.540

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.070
 in the list have in and after 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.200
 No matter where you can get here now 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.720
 Above you can see the short information like that 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.990
 blue that trailer video now the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.750
 evaluation came and evaluations give genre- 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.250
 and the way you like it so much here 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.610
 one there 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.590
 somehow I am so astonished to believe 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.770
 is straight and the most important is that 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.770
 here 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:53.790
 while it is on here to look at one 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.790
 and down here on memory 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.950
 the short 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:05.390
 or longer 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.220
 svp edit there you can see that it is in 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.220
 fourth floor it works again 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.590
 Oh come on you do not fit so long 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.420
 while absorbing that too 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.220
 it's hard to do now you see here 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.170
 impression was presented comments 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.750
 edit and delete newspaper 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.879

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.100
 do a post-mortem 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 you also go a little bit longer 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:44.680
 29 if you look around now 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.060
 you should get this xi here somewhere now 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.470

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.670
 and if I am but now 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.930

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.690

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.090
 lisa graf user no company profile 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.230
 to work this out 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.349
 that means I have now here for 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.349
 example 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.159
 coco connect has already looked 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.480
 to edit 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.480
 that will still be nice 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.350
 then it should be a good loading time 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.800
 would take longer with rap song 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.930
 I could come to witness 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.180
 in here is now even now 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.959

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.890
 yes, I have the coco connect here 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.030
 could write comment or exactly 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.129
 The same information is given by the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.049
 before something on the buttocks 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.150
 I do not write down a comment 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.640
 I think I should come better if 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.680
 it makes it I am pastor season 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:56.409
 rewards simply save here 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.409
 it's nice to see 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.500
 then loads it up a few years well 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.660
 have worked 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.310
 So maybe you see here 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.720
 just cancel and come here too 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.790
 now delete this request that is 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.660
 that's why you do not know why 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.519
 napoleon walks when you look at others 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.220
 want to show me that martin delete 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.980
 or so does not know why you do that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.080
 said you should be correct somewhere here 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.080
 be and that has happened here 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.819
 then here i have no rating 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.819
 given with rating of 0 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.169
 and then I already saw it that way 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:46.449
 agreed that you have seen that 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.539
 but many have hardly happened 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.030
 may 2012 2012 it's just this control 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.729
 Rewe have you ever previously watched 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.569
 twelve objects 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.839
 he could do that 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.960
 actually still uncertain is also in it 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.960
 his 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.980
 mirko connect is in there 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.140
 the series was not a comment then can 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.950
 evaluation of options 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.240
 that was actually a little tutorial 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.310
 her about that and hope it helps further 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.350
 and in case it gets in the way, it's easy 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.540
 to ignore 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.400
 it's only for a few people 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.120
 somehow to have a bit of a problem 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.160
 although that's pretty over right 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.130
 ordered to find what to say right away where it is 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.160
 good work is all about and where are they 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.410
 admira and mini city tours of the 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.970
 website and which can record 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.800
 this page here because they exist too 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.600
 in english off with the title and up 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.450
 German does not subtitle 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.310
 So what I licensed to 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.490
 at some point in a let's play or 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.490
 so
