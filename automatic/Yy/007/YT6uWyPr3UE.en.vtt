 How to use adobe premiere elements Fade in this time 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:15.940
 I use fade out 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:19.800
 And pretty but is popular expensive do this is using because drop curtain effect drop curtain 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.170
 I think I would like to remind you a little 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.050
 Even though it is so in Toka Civic Center at Toka recital 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.420
 movies 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.750
 That's right, but that curtain goes up 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.120
 By raising the curtain 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.250
 So far 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.300
 That with the screen 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.390
 It is the effect that the discomfort is max 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.790
 For example, if it gets packed up 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.110
 If you are looking at it I'll be surprised and may switch take up any slack in 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.620
 But for example it's especially true it is better to do now youtube 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:56.160
 Screen is back heard Kappa pursuers of what this 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.450
 The Tteyuu where I'll harden the water got surprised 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:06.550
 You can be less surprised by using the notepad effect 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:09.890
 But this fade in the sense that you can see Sundai be to reduce the surprise 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.990
 That the pretty Tteyuu-in fade-out 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.299
 It is expensive and do some necessary 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:22.369
 Incorporated with Yeah Do it usually also you'llcome who think Naa's pretty well usually 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:26.030

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.159

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.060
 I will do it 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.729
 This time to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:41.120
 Before that, let's say that what I did last time was to cut a portion of corn or about a second 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.900
 A pong sound was coming here and it was dragging it 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.900
 Put the Aso 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.840
 If you look at this part as a whole, this part 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:02:01.640
 It is a story that you can not do it normally because it is really a matter of a few seconds 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.640
 If you can find the pong sound by stretching it and you can cut it 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:12.720
 For example, I do not change the screen here, but there is no economy 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.720
 why now to keep money 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.340
 I have a click 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:06.930
 Because there is no right click like this on a mac side, it is useless if you don't choose it by all means 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.930
 There hen I smell is the place

 Please look at this little effect 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:35.319
 By having fade in 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.319
 There will be fewer vertical flights 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.849
 It will be easy to understand if the screen changes a little more 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.230
