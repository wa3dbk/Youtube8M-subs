today<00:00:16.510> I'm<00:00:16.630> going<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:16.840> talk<00:00:17.020> to<00:00:17.170> you<00:00:17.290> about<00:00:17.470> the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
today I'm going to talk to you about the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.070 
today I'm going to talk to you about the
tuck<00:00:17.980> cast<00:00:18.280> the<00:00:19.000> tuck<00:00:19.210> cast<00:00:19.450> is<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.660> very<00:00:19.900> useful

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
tuck cast the tuck cast is a very useful

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.050 
tuck cast the tuck cast is a very useful
cast<00:00:20.500> when<00:00:21.040> you're<00:00:21.160> fishing<00:00:21.310> with<00:00:21.490> nymphs<00:00:21.910> and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
cast when you're fishing with nymphs and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.400 
cast when you're fishing with nymphs and
you're<00:00:22.180> trying<00:00:22.390> to<00:00:22.420> get<00:00:22.540> those<00:00:22.660> nips<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:23.080> sink

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
you're trying to get those nips to sink

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.830 
you're trying to get those nips to sink
very<00:00:23.590> quickly<00:00:24.010> what<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.030> Tuck<00:00:25.240> cast<00:00:25.540> does

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
very quickly what the Tuck cast does

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.190 
very quickly what the Tuck cast does
when<00:00:26.560> you<00:00:26.680> make<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.920> cast<00:00:27.250> upstream<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.240> can

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
when you make a cast upstream you can

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.900 
when you make a cast upstream you can
actually<00:00:29.410> apply<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.770> little<00:00:29.950> quick<00:00:30.310> lift<00:00:30.640> with

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
actually apply a little quick lift with

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.819 
actually apply a little quick lift with
the<00:00:31.000> rod<00:00:31.180> tip<00:00:31.420> that<00:00:31.869> will<00:00:32.020> cause<00:00:32.289> those<00:00:32.529> flies

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
the rod tip that will cause those flies

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.099 
the rod tip that will cause those flies
to<00:00:33.100> kick<00:00:33.429> and<00:00:33.670> swing<00:00:34.089> down<00:00:34.120> getting<00:00:34.960> those

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:35.109 
to kick and swing down getting those

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.229 
to kick and swing down getting those
flies<00:00:35.409> to<00:00:35.679> land<00:00:35.859> first<00:00:36.249> so<00:00:36.879> when<00:00:36.999> you<00:00:37.089> have<00:00:37.210> a

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
flies to land first so when you have a

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.970 
flies to land first so when you have a
weighted<00:00:37.600> fly<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:38.019> allows<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.440> to<00:00:38.530> sink<00:00:38.829> down

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
weighted fly it allows it to sink down

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.309 
weighted fly it allows it to sink down
to<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.190> bottom<00:00:39.280> quickly<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.329> we<00:00:40.960> can<00:00:41.109> catch

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.319 
to the bottom quickly so we can catch

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to the bottom quickly so we can catch
more<00:00:41.530> fish<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.809> do<00:00:43.989> this<00:00:44.140> tuck<00:00:44.409> cast<00:00:44.679> we<00:00:45.129> want

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
more fish to do this tuck cast we want

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.700 
more fish to do this tuck cast we want
to<00:00:45.399> make<00:00:45.519> our<00:00:45.640> basic<00:00:46.059> cast<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.719> imagine<00:00:47.559> we're

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
to make our basic cast and imagine we're

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.439 
to make our basic cast and imagine we're
casting<00:00:48.159> upstream<00:00:48.609> we're<00:00:48.789> casting<00:00:49.149> up<00:00:49.269> into

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
casting upstream we're casting up into

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.360 
casting upstream we're casting up into
the<00:00:49.539> top<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.019> run<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:50.499> we're<00:00:50.920> trying<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.219> get

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
the top of a run and we're trying to get

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.910 
the top of a run and we're trying to get
those<00:00:51.579> flies<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.239> drift<00:00:52.539> down<00:00:52.600> nice<00:00:52.960> nice<00:00:53.710> and

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
those flies to drift down nice nice and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.950 
those flies to drift down nice nice and
deep<00:00:54.100> to<00:00:54.789> try<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:54.999> catch<00:00:55.179> those<00:00:55.359> bigger<00:00:55.629> fish

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
deep to try to catch those bigger fish

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.439 
deep to try to catch those bigger fish
what<00:00:56.620> we<00:00:56.739> want<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.039> do<00:00:57.159> is<00:00:57.339> make<00:00:57.550> this<00:00:57.760> cast<00:00:58.120> and

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
what we want to do is make this cast and

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.809 
what we want to do is make this cast and
once<00:00:58.929> we<00:00:59.109> stop<00:00:59.440> that<00:00:59.649> rod<00:00:59.889> tip<00:01:00.129> apply<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.609> quick

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:00.819 
once we stop that rod tip apply a quick

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:02.849 
once we stop that rod tip apply a quick
little<00:01:01.149> lift<00:01:01.449> which<00:01:02.049> will<00:01:02.199> cause<00:01:02.379> those<00:01:02.589> flies

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
little lift which will cause those flies

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.400 
little lift which will cause those flies
to<00:01:03.069> hitch<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.449> when<00:01:04.600> we're<00:01:04.720> making<00:01:05.020> this<00:01:05.140> Tuck

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
to hitch so when we're making this Tuck

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.260 
to hitch so when we're making this Tuck
cast<00:01:05.680> we're<00:01:06.250> going<00:01:06.370> to<00:01:06.430> make<00:01:06.550> our<00:01:06.670> basic<00:01:07.060> cast

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
cast we're going to make our basic cast

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.510 
cast we're going to make our basic cast
let's<00:01:07.510> four<00:01:07.780> just<00:01:08.590> for<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.770> sake<00:01:08.980> of<00:01:09.010> the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
let's four just for the sake of the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.890 
let's four just for the sake of the
situation<00:01:10.060> let's<00:01:10.210> imagine<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:10.840> is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
situation let's imagine that this is

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.420 
situation let's imagine that this is
upstream<00:01:11.650> here<00:01:11.910> my<00:01:12.910> flies<00:01:13.270> are<00:01:13.480> downstream

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
upstream here my flies are downstream

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.920 
upstream here my flies are downstream
that's<00:01:15.430> at<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:15.880> end<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.330> drift<00:01:16.720> I'm

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
that's at the end of that drift I'm

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.600 
that's at the end of that drift I'm
going<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> make<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.620> cast<00:01:17.920> upstream<00:01:18.220> then

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
going to make this cast upstream then

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.640 
going to make this cast upstream then
apply<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.850> quick<00:01:19.060> little<00:01:19.390> lift<00:01:19.660> and<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.260> lift

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
apply a quick little lift and that lift

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.290 
apply a quick little lift and that lift
is<00:01:20.890> going<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.160> allow<00:01:21.400> those<00:01:21.610> flies<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.060> kick

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
is going to allow those flies to kick

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.960 
is going to allow those flies to kick
and<00:01:22.510> land<00:01:22.540> in<00:01:23.140> landing<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.920> water<00:01:24.190> fly<00:01:24.550> first

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
and land in landing the water fly first

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.780 
and land in landing the water fly first
so<00:01:25.660> here's<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:26.080> cast<00:01:26.380> again<00:01:26.770> there's<00:01:27.610> that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
so here's that cast again there's that

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.120 
so here's that cast again there's that
little<00:01:27.940> lift<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:29.050> flies<00:01:29.320> landed<00:01:29.830> first

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
little lift and the flies landed first

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.770 
little lift and the flies landed first
along<00:01:30.670> those<00:01:30.940> flies<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.330> get<00:01:31.480> down<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.660> little

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
along those flies to get down a little

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:45.469 
along those flies to get down a little
bit<00:01:32.110> quicker<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.680> that's<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.400> Tuck<00:01:33.550> cast

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.180 

when<00:01:46.479> making<00:01:46.750> this<00:01:46.990> tuck<00:01:47.229> cast<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.920> want<00:01:48.130> to

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
when making this tuck cast we want to

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.740 
when making this tuck cast we want to
make<00:01:48.310> sure<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:48.700> don't<00:01:48.790> apply<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.450> lift

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
make sure that we don't apply that lift

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.540 
make sure that we don't apply that lift
too<00:01:50.110> aggressively<00:01:50.710> that<00:01:50.920> will<00:01:51.040> bounce<00:01:51.280> those

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
too aggressively that will bounce those

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.760 
too aggressively that will bounce those
flies<00:01:51.850> actually<00:01:52.090> back<00:01:52.450> towards<00:01:52.840> us<00:01:52.990> if<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.590> make

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
flies actually back towards us if I make

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.250 
flies actually back towards us if I make
an<00:01:53.890> aggressive<00:01:54.190> lift<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.300> see<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:56.050> fly

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
an aggressive lift you can see that fly

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.290 
an aggressive lift you can see that fly
landed<00:01:56.619> all<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> way<00:01:56.979> back<00:01:57.220> here<00:01:57.580> it's<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.090> a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
landed all the way back here it's just a

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.990 
landed all the way back here it's just a
subtle<00:01:58.630> lift<00:01:58.990> subtle<00:01:59.710> little<00:01:59.830> lift<00:02:00.790> of<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
subtle lift subtle little lift of the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.120 
subtle lift subtle little lift of the
rod<00:02:01.240> tip<00:02:01.540> that<00:02:02.200> helps<00:02:02.470> get<00:02:02.560> those<00:02:02.710> flies<00:02:02.979> to

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
rod tip that helps get those flies to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.820 
rod tip that helps get those flies to
