days because I had somewhere to go and I
wanted<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.739> here<00:02:29.010> because<00:02:29.129> it's<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.430> like

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670

big and voluptuous I love that hair but
i<00:02:33.500> reinstalled<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.040> realize<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
i reinstalled this and I realize this

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.420 
i reinstalled this and I realize this
here<00:02:35.819> is<00:02:36.000> actually<00:02:36.299> quite<00:02:36.930> heavy<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.190> not

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
here is actually quite heavy it's not

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.490 
here is actually quite heavy it's not
super<00:02:39.030> heavy<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.599> if<00:02:39.780> you're<00:02:39.959> used<00:02:40.290> to

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
super heavy but if you're used to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.190 
super heavy but if you're used to
lighter<00:02:40.799> hair<00:02:41.160> extensions<00:02:41.819> then<00:02:42.569> this<00:02:42.900> might

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
lighter hair extensions then this might

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.280 
lighter hair extensions then this might
be<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> little<00:02:44.190> bit<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.819> heavier<00:02:45.239> side<00:02:45.290> but

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
be a little bit on the heavier side but

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.589 
be a little bit on the heavier side but
I<00:02:46.319> kind<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.650> like<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:48.209> actually

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
I kind of like that because it actually

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.309 
I kind of like that because it actually
feels<00:02:49.049> really<00:02:49.290> nice<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.099> silky<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.930> still

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
feels really nice and silky and it still

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.400 
feels really nice and silky and it still
moves<00:02:52.620> around<00:02:53.099> but<00:02:53.640> at<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.299> same<00:02:54.540> time<00:02:54.840> when

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
moves around but at the same time when

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.690 
moves around but at the same time when
you<00:02:55.500> have<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.739> hair<00:02:55.950> blowing<00:02:56.190> in<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.430> car

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you have your hair blowing in the car

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.190 
you have your hair blowing in the car
it's<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.209> to<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.450> stay<00:02:57.720> straight<00:02:58.049> up

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
it's not going to just stay straight up

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.809 
it's not going to just stay straight up
in<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.349> air<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:59.040> going<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> go<00:02:59.519> back<00:02:59.790> to

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
in the air it's going to go back to

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.089 
in the air it's going to go back to
wherever<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.629> was<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.200> begin<00:03:01.319> with<00:03:01.680> which<00:03:01.920> I
