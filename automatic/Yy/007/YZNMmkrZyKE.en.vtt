I'm burger Butler from pc audio labs and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150 
I'm burger Butler from pc audio labs and
the<00:00:15.340> you<00:00:16.180> know<00:00:16.330> we<00:00:17.140> have<00:00:17.320> we<00:00:17.650> have<00:00:17.740> this<00:00:17.890> brief

the you know we have we have this brief
moment<00:00:18.640> where<00:00:18.790> the<00:00:19.029> processors<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:20.529> ram<00:00:20.830> the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
moment where the processors the ram the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.880 
moment where the processors the ram the
the<00:00:22.060> OS<00:00:22.420> everything<00:00:22.869> is<00:00:22.960> actually<00:00:23.110> mature<00:00:23.590> at

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
the OS everything is actually mature at

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.510 
the OS everything is actually mature at
the<00:00:23.980> same<00:00:24.340> time<00:00:25.439> which<00:00:26.439> is<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.949> really<00:00:27.189> is<00:00:27.310> rare

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
the same time which is it really is rare

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.429 
the same time which is it really is rare
usually<00:00:27.730> one<00:00:28.150> thing<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:28.510> really<00:00:28.840> you<00:00:29.350> know

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
usually one thing is really you know

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.990 
usually one thing is really you know
just<00:00:29.650> coming<00:00:29.980> in<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.100> screwing<00:00:30.580> up<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.850> whole

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
just coming in and screwing up the whole

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.400 
just coming in and screwing up the whole
system<00:00:31.240> and<00:00:31.600> everybody's<00:00:31.960> got<00:00:32.110> to<00:00:32.199> kind<00:00:32.349> of

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
system and everybody's got to kind of

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.729 
system and everybody's got to kind of
backtrack<00:00:32.619> and<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:34.720> next<00:00:35.140> challenge<00:00:35.410> for<00:00:35.710> us

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
backtrack and the next challenge for us

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.430 
backtrack and the next challenge for us
is<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:37.120> all<00:00:37.150> of<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.660> other<00:00:37.780> things<00:00:38.019> interface

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
is how all of the other things interface

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.009 
is how all of the other things interface
with<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.650> computer<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:40.059> it's<00:00:40.239> Thunderbolt<00:00:40.780> it's

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
with a computer so it's Thunderbolt it's

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.310 
with a computer so it's Thunderbolt it's
it's<00:00:41.260> usb3<00:00:42.000> its<00:00:43.000> mobility<00:00:43.360> questions<00:00:44.080> it's

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
it's usb3 its mobility questions it's

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.619 
it's usb3 its mobility questions it's
you<00:00:44.530> know<00:00:44.620> it's<00:00:44.650> ice<00:00:44.979> cream<00:00:45.339> sandwich<00:00:45.909> you

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
you know it's ice cream sandwich you

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.090 
you know it's ice cream sandwich you
know<00:00:46.750> it's<00:00:46.930> all<00:00:47.110> of<00:00:47.260> these<00:00:47.440> things<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.949> we're

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
know it's all of these things that we're

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.350 
know it's all of these things that we're
all<00:00:48.220> going<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.460> be<00:00:48.519> tying<00:00:48.820> together<00:00:48.970> and

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
all going to be tying together and

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.969 
all going to be tying together and
trying<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.600> figure<00:00:49.720> out<00:00:49.870> how<00:00:50.260> we<00:00:50.320> do<00:00:50.589> music

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:52.979 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:54.689

interacting with all of these other

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.759 
interacting with all of these other
devices<00:00:55.150> so<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.080> not<00:00:56.229> just<00:00:56.290> about<00:00:56.589> your

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
devices so it's not just about your

your laptop or to your desktop are you
you<00:01:03.970> know<00:01:04.119> going<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:04.930> use<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:05.320> interface<00:01:05.799> and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
you know going to use this interface and

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.469 
you know going to use this interface and
are<00:01:06.040> you<00:01:06.130> going<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.310> wait<00:01:06.490> for<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.820> card<00:01:07.210> for

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
are you going to wait for a card for

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.030 
are you going to wait for a card for
thunderbolt<00:01:07.990> and<00:01:08.170> make<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:08.470> work<00:01:08.710> or<00:01:08.890> not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
thunderbolt and make this work or not

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.160 
thunderbolt and make this work or not
you<00:01:09.610> know<00:01:09.729> all<00:01:10.299> of<00:01:10.330> these<00:01:10.570> different<00:01:10.750> things

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
you know all of these different things

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.539 
you know all of these different things
those<00:01:11.409> will<00:01:11.619> be<00:01:11.650> our<00:01:11.830> next<00:01:12.010> set<00:01:12.250> of<00:01:12.280> questions

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
those will be our next set of questions

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.540 
those will be our next set of questions
but<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.030> computer<00:01:13.390> itself<00:01:13.540> is<00:01:14.410> actually<00:01:15.310> very

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
but the computer itself is actually very

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.030 
but the computer itself is actually very
stable<00:01:16.030> right<00:01:16.360> now<00:01:16.390> it's<00:01:16.960> kind<00:01:17.050> of<00:01:17.290> a<00:01:17.410> magic

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
stable right now it's kind of a magic

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.380 
stable right now it's kind of a magic
moment<00:01:18.570> until

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
moment until

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.350 
moment until
windows<00:01:21.200> 8<00:01:21.590> or<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.610> know<00:01:22.729> whatever<00:01:22.940> whatever

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
windows 8 or you know whatever whatever

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.030 
windows 8 or you know whatever whatever
the<00:01:23.630> next<00:01:23.750> leap<00:01:24.020> is<00:01:24.260> which<00:01:24.470> isn't<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.860> fault

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
the next leap is which isn't the fault

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.070 
the next leap is which isn't the fault
of<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.370> leaf<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:25.850> everyone<00:01:26.750> trying<00:01:27.020> to

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
of the leaf it's everyone trying to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.609 
of the leaf it's everyone trying to
catch<00:01:27.260> up<00:01:27.470> with<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.770> leap<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.869> find<00:01:30.470> that

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
catch up with the leap so I find that

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.560 
catch up with the leap so I find that
that's<00:01:30.800> that's<00:01:31.190> our<00:01:31.490> moment<00:01:31.909> that's<00:01:32.210> what<00:01:32.450> we

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
that's that's our moment that's what we

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690 
that's that's our moment that's what we
have<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:32.869> deal<00:01:33.050> with<00:01:33.260> is<00:01:33.920> figuring<00:01:34.190> out<00:01:34.520> how<00:01:34.670> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
have to deal with is figuring out how to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.820 
have to deal with is figuring out how to
make<00:01:34.909> everyone<00:01:35.240> speak<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.110> each<00:01:36.229> other<00:01:36.440> or<00:01:36.619> not

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
make everyone speak to each other or not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.020 
make everyone speak to each other or not
not<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.580> computer<00:01:38.030> itself

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.649 

I<00:01:42.799> think<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:45.619> migration<00:01:46.619> to

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
I think that the the migration to

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.899 
I think that the the migration to
handheld<00:01:48.659> devices<00:01:49.080> or<00:01:49.740> two<00:01:50.070> highly<00:01:50.520> portable

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
handheld devices or two highly portable

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.590 
handheld devices or two highly portable
devices<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.869> inevitable<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
devices is inevitable you know so the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.380 
devices is inevitable you know so the
question<00:01:54.840> becomes<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:56.580> is<00:01:56.729> right<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
question becomes what is right for you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.920 
question becomes what is right for you
you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:58.770> about<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> when<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> say<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.899> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you know not about and when I say that I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.630 
you know not about and when I say that I
mean<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.409> instance<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:02.159> doing<00:02:02.460> work

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
mean like for instance you're doing work

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.070 
mean like for instance you're doing work
right<00:02:02.850> now<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.030> want<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.600> things<00:02:03.869> I'm<00:02:04.050> not

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
right now you want to do things I'm not

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.139 
right now you want to do things I'm not
when<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> think<00:02:05.369> about<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.610> i'm<00:02:05.729> not<00:02:05.850> worried

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
when I think about that i'm not worried

and<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:09.010> know<00:04:09.129> and<00:04:09.430> testing<00:04:09.879> out<00:04:10.000> ram<00:04:10.269> and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
and you know and testing out ram and

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.820 
and you know and testing out ram and
seeing<00:04:10.720> just<00:04:10.930> how<00:04:10.989> much<00:04:11.260> RAM<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.620> putting

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
seeing just how much RAM to putting

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.410 
seeing just how much RAM to putting
machine<00:04:12.010> what's<00:04:12.459> an<00:04:12.610> adequate<00:04:13.030> amount<00:04:13.060> we

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
machine what's an adequate amount we

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.110 
machine what's an adequate amount we
know<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.720> as<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.830> know<00:04:14.890> composer<00:04:15.489> or<00:04:15.790> someone

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
know is as you know composer or someone

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.960 
know is as you know composer or someone
working<00:04:16.329> you<00:04:16.660> know<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:17.530> know<00:04:17.650> what<00:04:18.609> your<00:04:18.760> kind

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
working you know you know what your kind

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.170 
working you know you know what your kind
of<00:04:19.030> limitations<00:04:19.660> are<00:04:19.840> from<00:04:20.019> not<00:04:20.169> using<00:04:20.199> around

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
of limitations are from not using around

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.300 
of limitations are from not using around
but<00:04:22.180> putting<00:04:22.389> it<00:04:22.570> all<00:04:22.660> together<00:04:22.949> there<00:04:23.949> really

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
but putting it all together there really

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.240 
but putting it all together there really
is<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> point<00:04:25.479> where<00:04:25.630> like<00:04:25.660> 16<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.380> 24<00:04:26.860> gigs<00:04:27.100> of

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
is a point where like 16 to 24 gigs of

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.040 
is a point where like 16 to 24 gigs of
RAM<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.639> really<00:04:28.120> great<00:04:28.270> space<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.720> be<00:04:29.020> in

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
RAM is a really great space to be in

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.900 
RAM is a really great space to be in
that's<00:04:29.710> not<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.040> say<00:04:30.220> that<00:04:30.250> aight<00:04:30.550> isn't

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
that's not to say that aight isn't

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.750 
that's not to say that aight isn't
really<00:04:31.300> strong<00:04:31.600> still<00:04:31.960> but<00:04:32.650> what<00:04:33.160> happens<00:04:33.610> is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
really strong still but what happens is

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.480 
really strong still but what happens is
when<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.210> 16<00:04:34.750> gigs<00:04:34.960> of<00:04:35.110> ram<00:04:35.320> suddenly<00:04:36.310> if

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
when you have 16 gigs of ram suddenly if

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.020 
when you have 16 gigs of ram suddenly if
you<00:04:37.020> want<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:38.260> load<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:38.650> all<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.580> pianos

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030

you want to load up all of the pianos
from<00:04:40.870> east<00:04:41.080> west<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.530> have<00:04:42.039> them<00:04:42.220> sitting<00:04:42.460> in

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
from east west and have them sitting in

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.620
