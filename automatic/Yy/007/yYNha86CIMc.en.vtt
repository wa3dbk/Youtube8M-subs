thing<00:01:36.820> we're<00:01:36.969> going<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.149> do<00:01:37.299> is<00:01:37.509> a<00:01:37.539> switch<00:01:38.159> from

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
thing we're going to do is a switch from

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:40.529 
thing we're going to do is a switch from
your<00:01:39.280> fighting<00:01:39.520> stance<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:40.119> we're<00:01:40.299> going<00:01:40.420> to

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
your fighting stance all we're going to

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.060 
your fighting stance all we're going to
do<00:01:40.719> is<00:01:40.899> switch<00:01:41.049> our<00:01:41.320> stance<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.890> we're

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
do is switch our stance so we're

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.029 
do is switch our stance so we're
mirrored<00:01:42.490> so<00:01:42.729> from<00:01:42.969> here<00:01:43.240> just<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.829> quick

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
mirrored so from here just a quick

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.930 
mirrored so from here just a quick
little<00:01:45.189> change<00:01:45.579> here

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.180 

so<00:01:53.940> on<00:01:54.030> type<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.210> note<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.600> strive<00:01:54.900> for

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
so on type of note we strive for

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.920 
so on type of note we strive for
ambidexterity<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.850> train<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.570> everything

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
ambidexterity we train to do everything

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.500 
ambidexterity we train to do everything
on<00:01:58.290> both<00:01:58.530> sides<00:01:58.830> equally<00:01:59.370> the<00:01:59.610> best<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.030> can

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
on both sides equally the best we can

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.870 
on both sides equally the best we can
that<00:02:00.840> way<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.440> adapt<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> our<00:02:02.010> opponent

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.059 

so<00:02:08.880> from<00:02:09.239> here<00:02:09.450> we're<00:02:09.959> going<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> basic

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
so from here we're going to do the basic

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.390 
so from here we're going to do the basic
step<00:02:12.110> so<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.470> step<00:02:13.709> we're<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> take

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
step so for the step we're going to take

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.880 
step so for the step we're going to take
our<00:02:14.550> rear<00:02:15.000> leg<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.540> we're<00:02:16.050> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.380> simply

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
our rear leg and we're going to simply

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.160 
our rear leg and we're going to simply
step<00:02:17.220> forward<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.569> we<00:02:18.720> are<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
step forward so that we are in the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.600 
step forward so that we are in the
opposite<00:02:19.680> stance<00:02:21.860> I'm<00:02:22.860> in<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> same<00:02:23.220> stance

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
opposite stance I'm in the same stance

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.479 
opposite stance I'm in the same stance
but<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.120> mirrored<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.069> then<00:02:26.069> again

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.699 

so<00:02:34.489> just<00:02:34.790> for<00:02:34.879> an<00:02:35.000> example<00:02:35.200> why<00:02:36.200> us<00:02:36.379> to<00:02:36.469> do<00:02:36.590> it

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
so just for an example why us to do it

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:47.780 
so just for an example why us to do it
from<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.890> side<00:02:37.129> stance<00:02:37.519> here

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:03:11.360 

you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.710 

so<00:03:12.370> from<00:03:12.580> there<00:03:12.790> now<00:03:13.090> we're<00:03:13.209> going<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.360> do<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
so from there now we're going to do the

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.410 
so from there now we're going to do the
back<00:03:14.050> step<00:03:14.500> every<00:03:15.400> movement<00:03:15.880> or<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.209> about

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.270 
back step every movement or just about
every<00:03:16.720> footwork<00:03:17.080> movement<00:03:17.500> has<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.950> reverse

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
every footwork movement has the reverse

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.040 
every footwork movement has the reverse
we<00:03:18.760> have<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> going<00:03:19.180> forward<00:03:19.660> and<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
we have the going forward and the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:37.520 
we have the going forward and the
retreating<00:03:20.530> or<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.860> opposite

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.620 

now<00:03:38.130> from<00:03:38.370> here<00:03:38.610> we're<00:03:38.880> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.270> the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
now from here we're going to do the

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.200 
now from here we're going to do the
bounce<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:41.040> we're<00:03:41.310> going<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.610> do<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.030> we're

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
bounce all we're going to do is we're

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.790 
bounce all we're going to do is we're
going<00:03:42.240> to<00:03:42.510> bring<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.050> heels<00:03:43.290> up<00:03:43.500> from<00:03:43.710> the

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
going to bring the heels up from the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.110 
going to bring the heels up from the
ground<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.310> we<00:03:44.580> are<00:03:44.610> going<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.240> hop<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.750> place

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
ground and we are going to hop in place

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.470 
ground and we are going to hop in place
okay<00:03:48.120> we're<00:03:48.330> not<00:03:48.450> doing<00:03:48.780> big<00:03:49.080> hops<00:03:49.590> like<00:03:49.830> this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
okay we're not doing big hops like this

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.290 
okay we're not doing big hops like this
just<00:03:51.480> enough<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.990> come<00:03:52.170> up<00:03:52.350> off<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.740> ground

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
just enough to come up off the ground

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.790 
just enough to come up off the ground
now<00:03:54.300> what<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.600> bounce<00:03:54.810> does<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.440> allows<00:03:55.770> us

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
now what the bounce does is it allows us

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.760 
now what the bounce does is it allows us
to<00:03:56.070> adjust<00:03:56.870> distance<00:03:57.870> going<00:03:58.080> forward<00:03:58.560> back

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
to adjust distance going forward back

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.300 
to adjust distance going forward back
side<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.430> small<00:03:59.820> unnoticeable<00:04:00.720> increments<00:04:01.320> or

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
side in small unnoticeable increments or

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.180 
side in small unnoticeable increments or
at<00:04:02.820> least<00:04:02.970> harder<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.510> notice<00:04:03.980> if<00:04:04.980> I'm

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
at least harder to notice if I'm

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.140 
at least harder to notice if I'm
bouncing<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.390> slowly<00:04:06.950> adjust<00:04:07.950> my<00:04:08.640> distance

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
bouncing I can slowly adjust my distance

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.400 
bouncing I can slowly adjust my distance
forward<00:04:09.510> or<00:04:10.970> slowly<00:04:11.970> adjust<00:04:12.720> my<00:04:12.900> distance

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
forward or slowly adjust my distance

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.380 
forward or slowly adjust my distance
backward<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:17.070> also<00:04:17.340> makes<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.030> little<00:04:18.239> bit

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
backward it also makes it a little bit

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.720 
backward it also makes it a little bit
harder<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:18.780> read<00:04:19.320> explosive<00:04:20.130> movements<00:04:20.579> if

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
harder to read explosive movements if

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.350 
harder to read explosive movements if
I'm<00:04:21.480> perfectly<00:04:21.930> still<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:23.460> explode<00:04:23.970> from

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
I'm perfectly still and I explode from

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.590 
I'm perfectly still and I explode from
my<00:04:25.200> stance<00:04:25.590> with<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.040> kick<00:04:26.310> well<00:04:27.060> it's<00:04:27.330> easy<00:04:27.510> to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
my stance with a kick well it's easy to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.659 
my stance with a kick well it's easy to
see<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.930> contrast<00:04:28.410> from<00:04:28.680> still<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.100> moving

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
see the contrast from still to moving

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.140 
see the contrast from still to moving
however<00:04:30.360> if<00:04:30.480> I'm<00:04:30.600> already<00:04:31.020> moving<00:04:31.880> it's<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:33.000> lot

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
however if I'm already moving it's a lot

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.590 
however if I'm already moving it's a lot
harder<00:04:33.360> to<00:04:33.600> see<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.840> explosion<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:35.600> movement

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
harder to see that explosion of movement

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.510 
harder to see that explosion of movement
because<00:04:36.900> my<00:04:37.050> body<00:04:37.290> was<00:04:37.410> moving<00:04:37.740> previously<00:04:38.370> so

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
because my body was moving previously so

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.480 
because my body was moving previously so
there's<00:04:38.669> not<00:04:38.820> much<00:04:39.000> contrast
