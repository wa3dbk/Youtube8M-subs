just off of an a minor pentatonic scale
and<00:01:00.190> I<00:01:00.250> really<00:01:00.460> liked<00:01:00.699> this<00:01:00.879> lick<00:01:01.149> mainly

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
and I really liked this lick mainly

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.630 
and I really liked this lick mainly
because<00:01:02.110> it's<00:01:02.410> so<00:01:02.770> important<00:01:03.339> and<00:01:03.430> so

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
because it's so important and so

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
because it's so important and so
ubiquitous<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.360> such<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.570> cool<00:01:04.809> sounding<00:01:05.290> like

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
ubiquitous and such a cool sounding like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990 
ubiquitous and such a cool sounding like
it's<00:01:06.640> also<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:09.070> just<00:01:09.280> sounds<00:01:09.460> awesome<00:01:09.640> and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
it's also it just sounds awesome and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.609 
it's also it just sounds awesome and
it's<00:01:10.119> fun<00:01:10.300> to<00:01:10.420> play<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.170> when<00:01:11.350> we<00:01:11.440> talk<00:01:11.590> about

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
it's fun to play so when we talk about

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.290 
it's fun to play so when we talk about
the<00:01:11.860> lick<00:01:12.009> and<00:01:12.430> there's<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:12.970> specific

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
the lick and there's a specific

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.149 
the lick and there's a specific
fingering<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.350> think<00:01:14.590> works<00:01:14.740> really<00:01:14.950> well

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
fingering that I think works really well

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.620 
fingering that I think works really well
to<00:01:15.310> get<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.759> together<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.300> first<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.600> is

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
lick when you slide back down is to not

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.600 
lick when you slide back down is to not
let<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.330> double<00:02:26.720> stop<00:02:26.930> slide<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.470> ring<00:02:28.459> out

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
let the double stop slide out ring out

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.800 
let the double stop slide out ring out
when<00:02:28.730> you're<00:02:28.819> going<00:02:28.940> through<00:02:29.330> those<00:02:29.510> two

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
when you're going through those two

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.740 
when you're going through those two
notes<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.900> I'm<00:02:32.959> gonna<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:34.300> grab<00:02:35.300> that<00:02:35.480> double

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
notes so I'm gonna do grab that double

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.030 
notes so I'm gonna do grab that double
stop<00:02:35.930> let<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.200> ring<00:02:36.320> and<00:02:36.440> then<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.769> slide

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
stop let it ring and then as I slide

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.490 
stop let it ring and then as I slide
back<00:02:37.250> down<00:02:37.360> I'm<00:02:38.360> kind<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.690> ghost<00:02:39.080> noting<00:02:39.410> this

I slide down there my third finger kind
of<00:02:52.430> flops<00:02:52.700> over<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.150> bit<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.380> mutes<00:02:54.590> that

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
of flops over a bit and then mutes that

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.140 
of flops over a bit and then mutes that
second<00:02:55.160> string<00:02:57.070> as<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.190> take<00:02:58.340> my<00:02:58.370> finger<00:02:58.760> off<00:02:58.790> of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
second string as I take my finger off of

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.910 
second string as I take my finger off of
it<00:02:59.300> so<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.959> takes<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.200> little<00:03:00.319> getting<00:03:00.440> used<00:03:00.830> to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
it so it takes a little getting used to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.500 
it so it takes a little getting used to
see<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.250> get<00:03:01.310> some<00:03:01.489> string<00:03:01.760> noise<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.239> what<00:03:02.420> it

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
see to get some string noise but what it

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.720 
see to get some string noise but what it
will<00:03:02.750> stop<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.350> you<00:03:03.709> getting<00:03:03.950> excess<00:03:04.519> string

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
will stop is you getting excess string

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:18.940 
will stop is you getting excess string
noise<00:03:14.680> that's<00:03:15.680> a<00:03:15.769> pretty<00:03:16.010> cool<00:03:16.310> lick<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:17.950> if

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
noise that's a pretty cool lick and if

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.050 
noise that's a pretty cool lick and if
you<00:03:19.130> notice<00:03:19.430> at<00:03:19.549> one<00:03:19.670> point<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.940> was<00:03:20.030> just
