00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.950
 hello friends followers and just 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.170
 viewers today at our unpacking 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.080
 another coil from china 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.970
 Yes, I ask once a little wrong began 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.369
 tell you about this coil 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.890
 and there was another but nothing terrible I 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.540
 I will tell you more 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.390
 how does she highlight his website 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.829
 what do we write about her Chinese that this 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.789
 model dk 3011 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:39.190
 ball bearing ratio 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:41.680
 5 2 to one 262 grams and these are 9 and 2 oz and 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.630
 so but why did I go wrong last time 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.010
 because this reel is cheaper 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:50.200
 we took him 798 rubles now it costs 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.930
 1260 it is cheaper than the previous coil 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.290
 and appreciated it more expensive for some reason 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.540
 look it costs 13 dollars 22 cents 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.600
 it says that this is a coil 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.210
 went by the way I didn't say page 1 got these 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.899
 two coils literally instantly for 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.149
 China's 98 days can be very 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.369
 quickly came for this for fishing we 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.499
 ordered wobblers these wobblers too 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.020
 very quickly came literally there I already 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:19.119
 I do not remember how much but the link will be below 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.039
 on unpacking these cranks can 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.609
 look so let's uncover and 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.490
 let's see what's inside so I already 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.920
 I see the box start mask in the box 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.770
 again, too, I do not know this is Chinese 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.189
 copy is either some kind of original 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.240
 chinese coil now we're all 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:45.210
 look at the faculty 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.820
 easier to get here with such a wonderful 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.820
 boxes our coil as we can see 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:54.030
 everything is written in Chinese practically neither 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.500
 one english word here is honest 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 written model of tea 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.000
 if on the previous coil we have everything there 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.820
 It was written in English that here 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.830
 opposite everything is in chinese 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.439
 let's get and see here 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.269
 About the same scheme we only have 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.209
 now this is not a separate circuit 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:20.459
 printed right on the box here we have 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:23.400
 something is written so it is clear yes well let's 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.680
 let's see the coil wire coil itself 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.780
 there's nothing more than a box postponed 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.790
 aside 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.730
 the coil I already see it come in full 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.630
 okay nothing is bent and not broken 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.349
 everything is fine 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.080
 latch 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.630
 that is, we open the latch on 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.230
 and we have more I will not lay down until it clicks 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.410
 this button after that only add 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:55.049
 also we lay out the move at the coil very 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.560
 smooth you can see very smoothly and 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.340
 works very gently 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.340
 I really like 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.020
 This coil she universal on right 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:13.060
 hand on your left hand can be turned off here 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:17.580
 here's a little thing unscrew 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.700
 take out imagine on the other side and 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.120
 spinning 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.800
 will we already have a coil sent this 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.380
 the coil is made of metal 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.820
 it is completely metal not alone me 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.710
 plastic parts do not see 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.500
 the only wooden detail here is this 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.730
 the pen is very pretty and look 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.400
 lacquered 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.120
 from wood again show how she 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.520
 works very very smooth alassana 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.870
 works so here it is spinning in 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.560
 back to the side 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.420
 below there is such a box when we 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.610
 sacred all we have the opposite side not 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.190
 spinning only forward with nazar in 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.580
 there is no mechanism at all, that is, here we are 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.340
 back trying and immediately it comes but 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.280
 still a small move back there here 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.040
 if so here is seen yes a little bit 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.630
 back move there but i don't know it is plus or 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.160
 minus 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.560
 probably it is not a plus plus for rice 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.140
 whether or not minus so generally no gaps 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.260
 there is no backlash no all very 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:23.590
 great if we try like this 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.400
 watering cues like this without trying to move 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.190
 also no backlash summer all gathered 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.940
 we have very high quality here 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.940
 such a nose 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:41.389
 many enough turns but who 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:46.360
 understands to know for what how 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.360
 try to disassemble it show inside 

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:55.360
 hear yeah what is metal same sight as 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:58.490
 as if forged into the plans we analyze further 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:07.300
 unscrew my already from the cusins 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:12.229
 filar almost like she flicks everything 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:18.740
 shoot choose oh yeah this thing or 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:20.899
 like a glass called metal this 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.009
 less side got 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.349
 very hard fish 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.729
 the coil was starting to leave you a fishing line that in 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:31.969
 form a line so here you hear yes how 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:34.399
 it crunches here I turn enough 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:36.849
 it turns easily that is when a fish 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:40.209
 she hooks about to cut off the line 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:44.539
 make more hard 

00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:49.210
 turns I press still I can not 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:52.240
 turn the brake works fine 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:57.790
 here is this wire this leskoukladyvatelya 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:03.890
 it can be raised up and all the coil 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:07.040
 snaps and in of course there is but she doesn't 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.280
 moves we drop have it all again 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.950
 works here in this place here 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.640
 such a thing I do not know whether it will be seen on 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:20.540
 The camera is such a sleeve, it also turns 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:23.030
 Now Iâ€™m focusing on trying not to know 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.080
 probably not seen how it lies but here 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.930
 there is a sleeve 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.760
 she's a bandage she's spinning too she doesn't 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.610
 I understand whether the bearings either just 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.980
 on the sleeve but it turns this fact 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.250
 Well, in general, it looks very beautiful 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.730
 the coil is made impersonal clearances all 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.040
 wonderful metal from this detail 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.870
 so plastic but this is some kind of cap 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.150
 I think for my money it is very 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.580
 good coil and it will work fine 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.710
 in order to fish with her and so
