blog and today what I want to do is a
review<00:00:04.770> on<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.950> clamp<00:00:05.190> style<00:00:05.370> multimeter<00:00:06.089> made

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
review on a clamp style multimeter made

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.660 
review on a clamp style multimeter made
by<00:00:06.480> ideal<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.020> it's<00:00:07.470> a<00:00:07.620> sixty<00:00:07.980> one<00:00:08.130> seven<00:00:08.460> four

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
by ideal and it's a sixty one seven four

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.870 
by ideal and it's a sixty one seven four
six<00:00:08.910> so<00:00:09.090> let's<00:00:09.240> get<00:00:09.330> right<00:00:09.510> into<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.900> review

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
six so let's get right into this review

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.950 
six so let's get right into this review
now<00:00:11.880> when<00:00:12.300> we<00:00:12.389> first<00:00:12.540> look<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.870> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
now when we first look at this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.020 
now when we first look at this
multimeter<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:14.280> thing<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.580> gotta<00:00:14.759> take

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
multimeter the one thing you gotta take

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.640 
multimeter the one thing you gotta take
into<00:00:15.210> consideration<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.020> doesn't<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.440> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
into consideration this doesn't have the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.980 
into consideration this doesn't have the
diverse<00:00:17.070> range<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.609> operation<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:18.960> I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
diverse range of operation and what I

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
diverse range of operation and what I
mean<00:00:19.199> is<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.470> doesn't<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.949> ability<00:00:20.369> to

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
mean is it doesn't have the ability to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.550 
mean is it doesn't have the ability to
measure<00:00:20.640> small<00:00:21.000> signals<00:00:21.449> such<00:00:21.600> as<00:00:21.630> milliamps

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
measure small signals such as milliamps

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.650 
measure small signals such as milliamps
and<00:00:22.740> micro<00:00:23.039> amps<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.359> meant

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and micro amps this is going to be meant

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.640 
and micro amps this is going to be meant
for<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> big<00:00:25.080> jobs

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
for the big jobs

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
for the big jobs
so<00:00:25.980> some<00:00:26.160> able<00:00:26.460> reserve<00:00:26.760> electricity<00:00:27.390> with

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so some able reserve electricity with

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.259 
so some able reserve electricity with
true<00:00:27.990> RMS<00:00:28.260> values<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.920> well<00:00:29.429> as<00:00:29.490> measuring

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
true RMS values as well as measuring

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.659 
true RMS values as well as measuring
current<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> 600<00:00:31.470> amps<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.890> when<00:00:32.550> you're

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
current up to 600 amps so when you're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.010 
current up to 600 amps so when you're
looking<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.149> tool<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.390> think<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.840> more

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
looking at this tool I think it's more

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.930 
looking at this tool I think it's more
or<00:00:34.140> less<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.290> compliment<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.280> an<00:00:35.520> already

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
or less a compliment to an already

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.760 
or less a compliment to an already
existing<00:00:36.090> multimeter<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.290> won't<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.620> able

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
existing multimeter this won't be able

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.889 
existing multimeter this won't be able
to<00:00:37.829> cover<00:00:38.010> every<00:00:38.160> job<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.149> concerning<00:00:39.719> its

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
to cover every job but concerning its

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.440 
to cover every job but concerning its
optimum<00:00:40.559> range<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.070> current<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.910> ridiculous

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
optimum range of current it's ridiculous

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.030 
optimum range of current it's ridiculous
and<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.870> does<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.290> diversify<00:00:43.800> what

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
and really does and diversify what

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040 
and really does and diversify what
you're<00:00:44.190> able<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.460> do<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:44.820> your<00:00:44.940> job<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.960> now

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you're able to do at your job so now

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.090 
you're able to do at your job so now
when<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.379> take<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.590> look<00:00:46.770> at<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:46.950> thing

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
when we take a look at this thing

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.880 
when we take a look at this thing
physically<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.789> tiny<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.450> mean<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.440> linesman

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
physically it's tiny I mean the linesman

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.500 
physically it's tiny I mean the linesman
plugs<00:00:50.100> right<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.520> almost<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:51.090> more<00:00:51.300> size

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
plugs right here I almost have more size

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
plugs right here I almost have more size
than<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.840> especially<00:00:52.350> when<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.890> compare<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
than this especially when you compare it

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.400 
than this especially when you compare it
to<00:00:53.280> something<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> ideal<00:00:54.239> 61<00:00:54.719> 340<00:00:55.260> was

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
to something like the ideal 61 340 was

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.439 
to something like the ideal 61 340 was
just<00:00:55.680> felt<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.910> great<00:00:57.149> for

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
just felt now this thing is great for

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.939 
just felt now this thing is great for
that<00:00:57.539> reason<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.350> service<00:00:58.770> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that reason one you can just service in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.170 
that reason one you can just service in
your<00:00:59.100> tool<00:00:59.280> bag<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> forget<00:00:59.910> about<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
your tool bag and you forget about it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.880 
your tool bag and you forget about it
now<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> doesn't<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.289> tilting<00:01:01.590> bail<00:01:01.739> on

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
now it doesn't have a tilting bail on

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.049 
now it doesn't have a tilting bail on
anything<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> won't<00:01:02.579> be<00:01:02.699> able<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> use

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
anything so you won't be able to use

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
anything so you won't be able to use
this<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.329> bench<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.320> once<00:01:04.470> again<00:01:04.559> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
this on a bench top but once again this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.500 
this on a bench top but once again this
isn't<00:01:05.070> meant<00:01:05.159> for<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> bench<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.450> is

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
isn't meant for a bench top this is

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
isn't meant for a bench top this is
meant<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.080> used<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> field<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> over

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
meant to be used on the field and over

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.310 
meant to be used on the field and over
one-hand<00:01:09.420> operation<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.110> lightweight

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one-hand operation so it's lightweight

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
one-hand operation so it's lightweight
obviously<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> got<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.640> size<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
obviously because it's got no size to it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
obviously because it's got no size to it
and<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:13.710> nice<00:01:13.830> convenient

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and it's got some really nice convenient

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.280 
and it's got some really nice convenient
features<00:01:14.640> first<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.479> its<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> rotary

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
features first off its got a rotary

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.510 
features first off its got a rotary
switch<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.920> works<00:01:17.100> well<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.400> your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
switch that just works well with your

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.590 
switch that just works well with your
thumb<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.939> you're<00:01:18.060> wearing<00:01:18.270> gloves<00:01:18.450> or

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
thumb so if you're wearing gloves or

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.700 
thumb so if you're wearing gloves or
anything<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.500> toggle

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
anything like that you can toggle

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.399 
anything like that you can toggle
between<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.880> abilities<00:01:21.630> no<00:01:22.049> problems

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
between you know abilities no problems

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
between you know abilities no problems
right<00:01:22.530> there<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.100> nice<00:01:23.369> interface<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
right there really nice interface and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.140 
right there really nice interface and
that<00:01:24.630> also<00:01:24.869> has<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> recessed<00:01:25.740> LCD<00:01:26.670> screen<00:01:27.000> on

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that also has a recessed LCD screen on

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.179 
that also has a recessed LCD screen on
there<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> mean<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
there and what I mean is that the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.310 
there and what I mean is that the
plastic<00:01:29.970> right<00:01:30.119> here<00:01:30.270> extrudes<00:01:30.810> beyond<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
plastic right here extrudes beyond this

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
plastic right here extrudes beyond this
so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> gives<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.520> protection

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so it gives you a little bit protection

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.399 
so it gives you a little bit protection
so<00:01:33.060> when<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.210> drag<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.540> across<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:34.229> not

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so when you drag that across you're not

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899 
so when you drag that across you're not
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.710> any<00:01:34.860> scratches<00:01:35.070> or<00:01:35.310> martyrs<00:01:35.729> on

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
going to get any scratches or martyrs on

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to get any scratches or martyrs on
there<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.750> nice<00:01:36.900> feature<00:01:37.490> overall<00:01:38.490> I'm

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
there really nice feature overall I'm

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.920 
there really nice feature overall I'm
really<00:01:38.700> impressed<00:01:39.150> by<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> physical

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
really impressed by the physical

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
really impressed by the physical
characteristics<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.220> really

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
characteristics of this it's just really

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.190 
characteristics of this it's just really
nicely<00:01:42.030> constructed<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.079> feels

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
nicely constructed and it just feels

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889 
nicely constructed and it just feels
like<00:01:43.380> it's<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.740> last<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.070> long<00:01:44.189> time<00:01:44.899> so

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
like it's going to last a long time so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
like it's going to last a long time so
what<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.619> two<00:01:47.009> multimeters<00:01:47.610> in

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
what I got here is two multimeters in

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.200 
what I got here is two multimeters in
order<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> compare<00:01:48.270> our<00:01:48.420> 61<00:01:48.990> 7<00:01:49.380> 4<00:01:49.560> 6<00:01:49.799> 2<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.880> what

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
order to compare our 61 7 4 6 2 now what

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.170 
order to compare our 61 7 4 6 2 now what
I'm<00:01:51.540> doing<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.020> running<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.740> volts<00:01:53.369> DC<00:01:53.549> into

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
I'm doing is running in volts DC into

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.090 
I'm doing is running in volts DC into
all<00:01:54.420> three<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> these<00:01:54.780> multimeters<00:01:55.470> they're

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
all three of these multimeters they're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
all three of these multimeters they're
all<00:01:56.189> jumpered<00:01:56.670> onto<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.119> same<00:01:57.360> measurement

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
all jumpered onto the same measurement

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
all jumpered onto the same measurement
and<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.380> are<00:01:58.530> using<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> basically<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
and they all are using the basically the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
and they all are using the basically the
same<00:02:00.420> lead<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.590> shouldn't<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.890> too<00:02:02.100> much

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
same lead so there shouldn't be too much

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.770 
same lead so there shouldn't be too much
of<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.430> voltage<00:02:02.790> drop<00:02:02.939> across<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.540> need<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
of a voltage drop across I need the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.350 
of a voltage drop across I need the
terminals<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.729> something<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.060> could

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
terminals but it is something that could

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.350 
terminals but it is something that could
occur<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> am<00:02:07.829> showing<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.729> just<00:02:09.179> how

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
occur so I am showing here is just how

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
occur so I am showing here is just how
proportional<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.920> my<00:02:11.069> fluke<00:02:11.280> 289

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
proportional these are now my fluke 289

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.830 
proportional these are now my fluke 289
which<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.390> be<00:02:12.480> our<00:02:12.629> standard

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
which is going to be our standard

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.650 
which is going to be our standard
reference<00:02:13.349> for<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
reference for the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.410 
reference for the
video<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.490> calibrated<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.640> that's<00:02:15.850> why<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.150> is

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
video is calibrated and that's why it is

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.730 
video is calibrated and that's why it is
other<00:02:16.720> than<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.020> fact<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.320> got<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.590> highest

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
other than the fact it's got the highest

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.530 
other than the fact it's got the highest
tolerance<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.880> as<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.270> see<00:02:19.390> it's

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
tolerance so as you can see it's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.920 
tolerance so as you can see it's
displaying<00:02:19.950> 26.4<00:02:20.950> oh<00:02:20.980> three<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.730> our<00:02:22.420> sixty

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
displaying 26.4 oh three and our sixty

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.110 
displaying 26.4 oh three and our sixty
one<00:02:23.140> seven<00:02:23.530> four<00:02:23.710> six<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.160> really<00:02:24.610> holding<00:02:24.970> up

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
one seven four six is really holding up

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180 
one seven four six is really holding up
as<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.230> it's<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.440> very<00:02:26.470> proportional

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
as you can see it's a very proportional

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.800 
as you can see it's a very proportional
reading<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.210> maintaining

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
reading to this and it's maintaining

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.020 
reading to this and it's maintaining
that<00:02:29.080> now<00:02:29.560> as<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.830> vary<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.190> vault<00:02:30.490> into<00:02:30.880> this

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
that now as we vary the vault into this

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.970 
that now as we vary the vault into this
system<00:02:31.240> let's<00:02:31.900> see<00:02:32.020> how<00:02:32.170> responsive<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.860> is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
system let's see how responsive it is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
system let's see how responsive it is
and<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.880> you<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.180> see<00:02:34.240> it's<00:02:34.600> just<00:02:34.720> really

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and as you can see it's just really

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.470 
and as you can see it's just really
catering<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.670> new<00:02:36.880> measurements<00:02:37.390> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
catering to the new measurements and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.600 
catering to the new measurements and
it's<00:02:37.720> really<00:02:38.080> keeping<00:02:38.350> up<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> date<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.040> it's

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
it's really keeping up to date and it's

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610 
it's really keeping up to date and it's
still<00:02:39.940> registering<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:40.870> proportional<00:02:41.470> to

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
still registering very proportional to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.800 
still registering very proportional to
what<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.830> Fluke<00:02:42.040> 289<00:02:42.460> just<00:02:42.820> blanked<00:02:43.180> really

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
what the Fluke 289 just blanked really

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.700 
what the Fluke 289 just blanked really
impressed<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:44.650> I<00:02:44.860> was<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.460> little<00:02:45.550> bit

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
impressed with this I was a little bit

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.810 
impressed with this I was a little bit
writing<00:02:47.710> this<00:02:47.800> off<00:02:47.950> at<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.190> start<00:02:48.400> of<00:02:48.520> it<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
writing this off at the start of it and

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.340 
writing this off at the start of it and
that's<00:02:49.000> only<00:02:49.210> because<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.750> resolution<00:02:50.260> of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
that's only because the resolution of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.680 
that's only because the resolution of
this<00:02:50.470> was<00:02:50.710> not<00:02:51.040> accurate<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:52.150> as<00:02:52.240> you<00:02:52.360> can<00:02:52.510> see

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
this was not accurate but as you can see

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.950 
this was not accurate but as you can see
all<00:02:53.020> my<00:02:53.050> thoughts<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.920> been<00:02:54.010> undermined<00:02:54.960> now

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
all my thoughts have been undermined now

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.540 
all my thoughts have been undermined now
before<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.380> plug<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.740> into<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.040> wall<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
before I plug this into the wall and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.760 
before I plug this into the wall and
measure<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> AC<00:02:58.510> voltage<00:02:58.870> which<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.380> next<00:02:59.590> in

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
measure the AC voltage which is next in

tell this thing's began to lose its

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.030 
tell this thing's began to lose its

it up to 5,000 Hertz you can see that

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.190 
it up to 5,000 Hertz you can see that
this<00:04:03.459> thing<00:04:03.520> really<00:04:04.030> begins<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.420> skew<00:04:04.750> off<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
ridiculous sensitivity as you can tell

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.310 
ridiculous sensitivity as you can tell
I'm<00:04:18.130> extremely<00:04:18.850> far<00:04:19.359> away<00:04:19.690> from<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> circuit

registers it from a very far distance
which<00:04:25.419> is<00:04:25.450> amazing<00:04:26.020> because<00:04:26.140> this<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.590> going

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
which is amazing because this is going

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.060 
which is amazing because this is going
to<00:04:26.800> quick

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
to quick

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.140 
that may not be able to be observed very
easily<00:04:31.480> it's<00:04:32.460> ridiculously<00:04:33.460> sensitive<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
easily it's ridiculously sensitive and

if there's multiple signals in the area

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.020 
if there's multiple signals in the area
that<00:04:35.800> can<00:04:36.010> be<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> consequence<00:04:36.640> because<00:04:36.850> you'll

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
that can be a consequence because you'll

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.030 
that can be a consequence because you'll
be<00:04:37.060> picking<00:04:37.450> up<00:04:37.570> on<00:04:37.720> both<00:04:37.900> of<00:04:38.080> them<00:04:38.200> but<00:04:38.740> really

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
be picking up on both of them but really

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.560 
be picking up on both of them but really
does<00:04:39.220> diversifies<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.970> ability<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.480> this

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
does diversifies the ability of this

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.170 
does diversifies the ability of this
tool<00:04:41.280> so<00:04:42.280> now<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:42.550> I<00:04:42.580> got<00:04:42.790> here<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.030> an

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
tool so now what I got here is an

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.820 
tool so now what I got here is an
induction<00:04:43.510> motor<00:04:43.840> and<00:04:44.170> I<00:04:44.290> want<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.560> see<00:04:44.680> how

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
induction motor and I want to see how

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.380 
induction motor and I want to see how
this<00:04:44.980> thing<00:04:45.130> does<00:04:45.310> for<00:04:45.940> resistance

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
this thing does for resistance

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.810 
this thing does for resistance
measurement<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.110> low<00:04:47.290> end<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:48.070> what<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.610> did

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
measurement on the low end so what I did

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.030 
measurement on the low end so what I did
is<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.150> took<00:04:49.180> a<00:04:49.660> 4<00:04:50.110> terminal<00:04:50.380> resistance

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
is I took a 4 terminal resistance

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.740 
is I took a 4 terminal resistance
measurement<00:04:51.490> of<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.180> got<00:04:52.330> one<00:04:52.570> point

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
measurement of this and I got one point

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.300 
measurement of this and I got one point
6<00:04:53.020> ohms<00:04:53.230> so<00:04:53.740> I'm<00:04:53.830> going<00:04:53.980> to<00:04:54.040> create<00:04:54.160> the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
6 ohms so I'm going to create the

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.470 
6 ohms so I'm going to create the
pathway<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:54.910> let's<00:04:55.090> see<00:04:55.210> what<00:04:55.330> we've

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
pathway and let's see what we've

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.850 
pathway and let's see what we've
registered<00:04:55.690> on<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.290> multimeter<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.620> once

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
registered on this multimeter and once

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.320 
registered on this multimeter and once
it<00:05:00.010> stabilizes<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.760> can<00:05:00.910> see<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.210> we're

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
it stabilizes you can see that we're

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.410 
it stabilizes you can see that we're
reading<00:05:01.570> 1.5<00:05:02.170> extremely<00:05:02.770> proportional<00:05:03.420> now

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
reading 1.5 extremely proportional now

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.240 
reading 1.5 extremely proportional now
going<00:05:04.750> right<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.110> the<00:05:05.260> exact<00:05:05.590> opposite<00:05:05.980> end<00:05:06.130> of

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
going right to the exact opposite end of

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.950 
going right to the exact opposite end of
the<00:05:06.340> spectrum<00:05:06.550> I<00:05:06.850> have<00:05:07.150> a<00:05:07.180> 1<00:05:07.540> mega<00:05:07.840> ohm

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the spectrum I have a 1 mega ohm

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.870 
the spectrum I have a 1 mega ohm
resistor<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.560> line<00:05:08.860> with<00:05:09.010> this<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.340> as<00:05:09.820> you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
resistor in line with this and as you

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.160 
resistor in line with this and as you
can<00:05:10.090> see<00:05:10.210> it's<00:05:10.540> reading<00:05:10.840> directly

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
can see it's reading directly

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.960 
can see it's reading directly
proportional<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.950> what<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.370> resistor<00:05:12.820> is

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
proportional to what that resistor is

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.000 
proportional to what that resistor is
this<00:05:13.600> meter<00:05:13.840> has<00:05:14.050> an<00:05:14.200> amazing<00:05:14.620> ability<00:05:14.710> to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
this meter has an amazing ability to

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.920 
this meter has an amazing ability to
measure<00:05:15.280> resistance<00:05:15.610> it<00:05:16.270> really<00:05:16.630> definitely

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
measure resistance it really definitely

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.870 
measure resistance it really definitely
stands<00:05:17.200> out<00:05:17.350> in<00:05:17.470> this<00:05:17.590> test<00:05:17.830> now<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.580> next

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
stands out in this test now the next

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.910 
stands out in this test now the next
setting<00:05:19.030> we<00:05:19.120> dropped<00:05:19.450> down<00:05:19.600> to<00:05:19.660> is<00:05:20.050> continuity

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
setting we dropped down to is continuity

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.430 
setting we dropped down to is continuity
and<00:05:21.280> as<00:05:21.880> you<00:05:22.000> can<00:05:22.120> see<00:05:22.270> it's<00:05:22.480> not<00:05:22.780> responsive

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
and as you can see it's not responsive

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.560 
and as you can see it's not responsive
so<00:05:24.070> when<00:05:24.250> we<00:05:24.370> hold<00:05:24.670> it<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:24.970> place<00:05:25.120> for<00:05:25.420> a<00:05:25.450> while

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
so when we hold it in place for a while

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.240 
so when we hold it in place for a while
you<00:05:25.750> definitely<00:05:26.080> register<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:26.920> it<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.220> a

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
you definitely register that it is a

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.310 
you definitely register that it is a
good<00:05:27.820> connection<00:05:28.270> and<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.870> gives<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.170> off<00:05:29.290> a

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
good connection and it gives it off a

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.680 
good connection and it gives it off a
nice<00:05:29.650> audio<00:05:29.980> beep<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.880> it's<00:05:31.060> not<00:05:31.240> really<00:05:31.450> fast

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
nice audio beep but it's not really fast

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.560 
nice audio beep but it's not really fast
on<00:05:31.840> the<00:05:31.960> get-go<00:05:32.790> now<00:05:33.790> as<00:05:33.850> we<00:05:34.030> scroll<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.480> our

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
on the get-go now as we scroll to our

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.120 
on the get-go now as we scroll to our
next<00:05:34.810> function<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.440> have<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.770> ability<00:05:36.100> to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
next function we have the ability to

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.880 
next function we have the ability to
measure<00:05:36.400> current<00:05:36.670> for<00:05:37.510> a<00:05:37.540> range<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.200> 40<00:05:38.470> amps

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
measure current for a range of 40 amps

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.040 
measure current for a range of 40 amps
and<00:05:39.010> 600<00:05:39.550> amps<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.240> what<00:05:40.390> I<00:05:40.420> have<00:05:40.660> here<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:40.930> an

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
and 600 amps and what I have here is an

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.500 
and 600 amps and what I have here is an
isolated<00:05:41.590> power<00:05:41.770> supply<00:05:42.130> line<00:05:42.370> going<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.240> my

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
isolated power supply line going to my

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.780 
isolated power supply line going to my
AC<00:05:43.870> to<00:05:44.410> DC<00:05:44.440> converter<00:05:45.070> from<00:05:45.250> my<00:05:45.370> laptop

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
AC to DC converter from my laptop

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.940 
AC to DC converter from my laptop
and<00:05:45.970> once<00:05:46.750> again<00:05:46.840> this<00:05:47.110> is<00:05:47.170> isolated<00:05:47.800> because

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
and once again this is isolated because

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.740 
and once again this is isolated because
if<00:05:48.130> you<00:05:48.280> measure<00:05:48.430> both<00:05:48.700> you<00:05:48.910> won't<00:05:49.150> establish

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
if you measure both you won't establish

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.060 
if you measure both you won't establish
your<00:05:49.900> reading<00:05:50.140> because<00:05:50.380> you<00:05:50.560> have<00:05:50.710> two

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
your reading because you have two

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.440 
your reading because you have two
currents<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.580> they<00:05:51.730> cancel<00:05:52.090> each<00:05:52.120> other<00:05:52.300> out

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
currents and they cancel each other out

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.860 
currents and they cancel each other out
and<00:05:52.810> now<00:05:53.380> I<00:05:53.410> have<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.890> uei<00:05:54.370> current<00:05:55.090> meter<00:05:55.270> in

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
and now I have a uei current meter in

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.020 
and now I have a uei current meter in
line<00:05:56.350> with<00:05:56.920> this<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.460> it's<00:05:57.610> going<00:05:57.730> to<00:05:57.820> give<00:05:57.940> us

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
line with this so it's going to give us

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.580 
line with this so it's going to give us
something<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.360> make<00:05:58.600> a<00:05:58.630> relative<00:05:59.080> comparison

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
something to make a relative comparison

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.890 
something to make a relative comparison
to<00:05:59.770> so<00:06:00.430> we<00:06:00.520> clamp<00:06:00.760> this<00:06:00.910> on<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.300> let's<00:06:01.570> see<00:06:01.720> how

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
to so we clamp this on and let's see how

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.560 
to so we clamp this on and let's see how
proportional<00:06:02.470> those<00:06:02.650> readings<00:06:03.010> are<00:06:03.160> and<00:06:03.570> as

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
proportional those readings are and as

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.060 
proportional those readings are and as
you<00:06:04.750> can<00:06:04.870> see<00:06:05.020> it's<00:06:05.230> extremely<00:06:05.710> well<00:06:05.890> within

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
you can see it's extremely well within

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.640 
you can see it's extremely well within
its<00:06:06.280> tolerance<00:06:06.990> now<00:06:07.990> even<00:06:08.320> though<00:06:08.410> this<00:06:08.590> is

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
its tolerance now even though this is

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.070 
its tolerance now even though this is
not<00:06:09.010> as<00:06:09.190> accurate<00:06:09.340> is<00:06:09.610> this<00:06:09.820> it's<00:06:10.420> extremely

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
not as accurate is this it's extremely

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.960 
not as accurate is this it's extremely
well<00:06:11.260> worth<00:06:11.440> it<00:06:11.680> this<00:06:12.190> first<00:06:12.520> off<00:06:12.670> the<00:06:12.820> major

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
well worth it this first off the major

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.520 
well worth it this first off the major
advantage<00:06:13.420> to<00:06:13.510> having<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.810> clamp<00:06:14.080> style<00:06:14.290> is

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
advantage to having a clamp style is

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.380 
advantage to having a clamp style is
you're<00:06:14.800> able<00:06:15.160> to<00:06:15.190> measure<00:06:15.460> massive<00:06:16.000> amounts

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
you're able to measure massive amounts

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.570 
you're able to measure massive amounts
of<00:06:16.480> current<00:06:16.810> first<00:06:17.380> off<00:06:17.620> this<00:06:18.220> thing<00:06:18.400> can

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
of current first off this thing can

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.700 
of current first off this thing can
measure<00:06:18.670> up<00:06:18.790> to<00:06:18.880> 600<00:06:19.570> amps<00:06:19.810> where<00:06:20.080> this<00:06:20.350> unit

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
measure up to 600 amps where this unit

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.230 
measure up to 600 amps where this unit
can<00:06:20.800> only<00:06:20.980> measure<00:06:21.160> up<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:21.400> 10<00:06:21.670> amps<00:06:21.910> which<00:06:22.090> is

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
can only measure up to 10 amps which is

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.470 
can only measure up to 10 amps which is
very<00:06:23.250> common<00:06:24.250> for<00:06:24.430> most<00:06:24.520> multimeters<00:06:25.210> of<00:06:25.330> this

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
very common for most multimeters of this

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.030 
very common for most multimeters of this
style<00:06:25.750> there's<00:06:26.350> some<00:06:26.500> like<00:06:26.620> a<00:06:26.710> measure<00:06:26.830> up<00:06:27.010> to

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
style there's some like a measure up to

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.950 
style there's some like a measure up to
20<00:06:27.430> but<00:06:27.670> nowhere<00:06:28.090> near<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.480> what<00:06:28.630> this<00:06:28.750> thing

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
20 but nowhere near to what this thing

20 but nowhere near to what this thing
can<00:06:29.050> do<00:06:29.200> and<00:06:29.410> 600<00:06:29.920> amps<00:06:30.130> is<00:06:30.280> definitely

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
can do and 600 amps is definitely

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.580 
can do and 600 amps is definitely
something<00:06:30.880> you'll<00:06:31.120> see<00:06:31.270> on<00:06:31.360> industry<00:06:31.870> so<00:06:32.440> it's

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
something you'll see on industry so it's

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.710 
something you'll see on industry so it's
one<00:06:32.800> great<00:06:32.950> benefit<00:06:33.370> to<00:06:33.400> the<00:06:33.550> tool<00:06:33.790> next<00:06:34.420> is

one great benefit to the tool next is

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.870 
one great benefit to the tool next is
the<00:06:34.870> safety<00:06:35.140> in<00:06:36.010> order<00:06:36.220> to<00:06:36.310> get<00:06:36.400> this<00:06:36.550> in<00:06:36.760> the

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
the safety in order to get this in the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.340 
the safety in order to get this in the
connection<00:06:37.360> I<00:06:37.480> had<00:06:37.630> to<00:06:37.720> make<00:06:37.870> a<00:06:37.900> makeshift

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
connection I had to make a makeshift

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.840 
connection I had to make a makeshift
connection<00:06:38.830> which<00:06:38.980> is<00:06:39.010> not<00:06:39.520> over-the-top

safe

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.999 
safe
but<00:06:41.050> when<00:06:41.169> you<00:06:41.229> look<00:06:41.380> at<00:06:41.440> something<00:06:41.650> like<00:06:41.740> this

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
but when you look at something like this

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.150 
but when you look at something like this
and<00:06:42.250> you<00:06:42.490> have<00:06:42.520> purely<00:06:43.360> insulated<00:06:43.900> material

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160

and<00:06:46.900> the<00:06:47.830> other<00:06:47.949> thing<00:06:48.100> about<00:06:48.130> this<00:06:48.520> is<00:06:48.729> just

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
and the other thing about this is just

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.730 
and the other thing about this is just
the<00:06:49.090> overall<00:06:49.330> convenience<00:06:49.810> as<00:06:49.990> you<00:06:50.470> can<00:06:50.620> see

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
the overall convenience as you can see

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.439 
the overall convenience as you can see

the<00:06:52.569> stuff<00:06:52.750> for<00:06:52.900> this<00:06:53.050> is<00:06:53.259> a<00:06:53.340> very<00:06:54.340> long<00:06:54.849> time

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
the stuff for this is a very long time

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.960 
the stuff for this is a very long time
in<00:06:55.240> comparison

boundary<00:07:40.040> cap<00:07:40.520> goes<00:07:40.700> on<00:07:40.850> so<00:07:41.480> after<00:07:41.720> a

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930 
boundary cap goes on so after a

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.450 
boundary cap goes on so after a
repetitive<00:07:42.200> opening<00:07:42.800> and<00:07:42.950> closing<00:07:43.250> of<00:07:43.340> this

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:43.460 
repetitive opening and closing of this

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.040 
repetitive opening and closing of this
it<00:07:43.640> will<00:07:43.790> ultimately<00:07:43.910> where<00:07:44.480> you<00:07:44.750> have<00:07:44.930> to

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
it will ultimately where you have to

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.920 
it will ultimately where you have to
replace<00:07:45.320> it<00:07:46.090> so<00:07:47.090> what<00:07:47.240> are<00:07:47.360> my<00:07:47.420> final<00:07:47.720> thoughts

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930 
replace it so what are my final thoughts

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.110 
replace it so what are my final thoughts
on<00:07:48.050> this<00:07:48.200> multimeter<00:07:48.620> great<00:07:49.340> investment<00:07:49.910> well

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 
on this multimeter great investment well

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.710 
on this multimeter great investment well
worth<00:07:50.150> the<00:07:50.450> money

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
worth the money

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.930 
worth the money
it<00:07:51.230> really<00:07:51.530> diversified<00:07:52.160> the<00:07:52.400> range<00:07:52.610> of<00:07:52.760> what

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:52.940 
it really diversified the range of what

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:54.850 
it really diversified the range of what
your<00:07:53.090> existing<00:07:53.540> multimeter<00:07:53.930> can<00:07:54.140> do<00:07:54.320> you're

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:54.860 
your existing multimeter can do you're

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.230 
your existing multimeter can do you're
going<00:07:54.950> to<00:07:55.010> be<00:07:55.070> able<00:07:55.190> to<00:07:55.400> hit<00:07:55.550> those<00:07:55.670> high<00:07:55.910> amps

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 
going to be able to hit those high amps

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.520 
going to be able to hit those high amps
and<00:07:56.390> plus<00:07:56.630> the<00:07:56.750> non-contact<00:07:57.320> voltage

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.530 
and plus the non-contact voltage

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.990 
and plus the non-contact voltage
detector<00:07:58.010> on<00:07:58.160> this<00:07:58.310> it's<00:07:58.460> ridiculously

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.000 
detector on this it's ridiculously

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.910 
detector on this it's ridiculously
sensitive<00:07:59.450> and<00:07:59.720> it<00:08:00.050> has<00:08:00.170> no<00:08:00.350> footprint<00:08:00.800> so

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:00.920 
sensitive and it has no footprint so

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.080 
sensitive and it has no footprint so
this<00:08:01.040> is<00:08:01.160> going<00:08:01.310> to<00:08:01.400> take<00:08:01.490> up<00:08:01.610> any<00:08:01.730> room<00:08:01.970> in

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.090 
this is going to take up any room in

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.700 
this is going to take up any room in
