00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.310

 only fab buy the book you already that one 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.539
 little knowledge of the proposal with 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:36.840
 Personal Abe Talking Player Buys 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.360
 Books I do not really like to adore 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.820
 buy is because I'm buying now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.829
 absorb a little know you absorb the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 little time the gym is paying 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.039
 gym even if you do not go lose weight 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 paying blog linked could use this 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 same analogy with snacks if you leave 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 with your wife for dinner and 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.770
 woman by big mac 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.550
 I 'm not going to eat anything was a big mac your 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:06.900
 Mouth if I ate the small piece of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.020
 those who like asking to be logical not know 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.970
 My question is will those books 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.430
 they take more boys they are there 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.500
 because we were admitted the they were over 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 sold because I'm there I had to talk 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.810
 But you're the guy from the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.340
 the right theories 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.850
 so I think you had to talk 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.180
 I understand that most people say I have 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.650
 I have the improvement is the following books 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 best sellers 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.450
 they are older than they are on the list 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.070
 understood the opposite is to sell the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.650
 book the best-selling book to the whole world 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.200
 because it is best for my book to be 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.810
 say it does not work because it eats 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 Barcelo is the translation that best seller 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
 the best seller is to say that the parcel 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.560
 that greater disbursement or something else 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.720
 difficult, right? 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.640
 according to the book that what is at stake 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.890
 here you seem to books is that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.840

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.820
 Felipe Scolari only the name of the book is 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.820
 the man behind scolari 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.140

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.640
 his wife by his employer 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.950

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.130
 suggestion that did not 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.040

 that talks about how to be effective 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.400
 with the technician but it is to stay and such 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.360
 only I discovered what is effective all over 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.790
 world knows the affection that I really have 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.700
 time here I discovered that the eighth 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:37.280
 habit to be effective eighth habit is 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:39.680
 expect the pocket version of the books as 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.940
 say everything in English on the written page 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.700

 I gaucho scheme is clichÃ© but was 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.570
 r is the way it is built 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.060
 Gaucho joke 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.820
 because in fact that of the micro-trends 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.980
 She talks about it, too. 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.760
 But then she's the same clichÃ© but she's 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.530
 hides better justice worked that was 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.290

 That's when you look at this faith, get off the plate. 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.680

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.210

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.270
 there is more that passage of a man 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.270
