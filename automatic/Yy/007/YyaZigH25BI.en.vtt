so<00:00:26.250> both<00:00:26.609> pistols<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.300> some<00:00:27.480> pretty<00:00:27.689> obvious

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
so both pistols have some pretty obvious

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.480 
so both pistols have some pretty obvious
similarities<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> know<00:00:28.920> they're<00:00:29.070> both<00:00:29.189> semi

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
similarities you know they're both semi

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.890 
similarities you know they're both semi
automatics<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.029> they're<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.779> two

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
automatics and they're the first two

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.240 
automatics and they're the first two
pistols<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> unlock<00:00:31.619> however<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pistols you unlock however the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.530 
pistols you unlock however the
differences<00:00:32.610> between<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:33.059> two<00:00:33.239> weapons

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
differences between these two weapons

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.030 
differences between these two weapons
are<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.840> really<00:00:33.870> sets<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.590> apart<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
are what really sets them apart and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
are what really sets them apart and
makes<00:00:35.309> each<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.489> useful<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.210> different

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
makes each one useful for different

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.389 
makes each one useful for different
players<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:37.020> different<00:00:37.260> play<00:00:37.410> styles<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.190> as

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
players and different play styles so as

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.560 
players and different play styles so as
always<00:00:38.670> I'm<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.090> quickly<00:00:39.270> going

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
always I'm going to be quickly going

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.910 
always I'm going to be quickly going
over<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> stats<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> characteristics<00:00:40.860> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
over the stats and characteristics of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.590 
over the stats and characteristics of
these<00:00:41.040> weapons<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.550> try<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.879> explain<00:00:42.149> which

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
these weapons and try to explain which

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.750 
these weapons and try to explain which
gun<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.809> prefer<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.350> different<00:00:43.649> situations<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
gun I prefer in different situations so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.889 
gun I prefer in different situations so
starting<00:00:45.059> off<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> damages<00:00:45.719> both

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
starting off with the damages both

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.049 
starting off with the damages both
weapons<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.379> 55<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.070> 19<00:00:47.399> point<00:00:47.640> damage

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
weapons have a 55 to 19 point damage

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.580 
weapons have a 55 to 19 point damage
which<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> two<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> six<00:00:48.899> shots<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> kill

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
which is two to six shots to kill

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
which is two to six shots to kill
however<00:00:50.190> even<00:00:50.309> though<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> maximum<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
however even though the maximum and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.910 
however even though the maximum and
minimum<00:00:51.480> damages<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> same<00:00:52.500> they're

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
minimum damages are the same they're

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
minimum damages are the same they're
actually<00:00:53.250> quite<00:00:53.460> different<00:00:53.969> first<00:00:54.300> off<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
actually quite different first off the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually quite different first off the
572<00:00:55.230> shot<00:00:55.530> kill<00:00:55.739> range<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> like<00:00:56.219> an<00:00:56.340> arm's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
572 shot kill range is like an arm's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
572 shot kill range is like an arm's
length<00:00:56.670> away<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.239> meter<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.899> most<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.500> can

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
length away a meter at most so you can

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
length away a meter at most so you can
basically<00:00:58.800> chalk<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> three<00:00:59.969> shots

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
basically chalk it up as a three shots

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically chalk it up as a three shots
to<00:01:00.329> kill<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.510> weapon<00:01:00.809> while<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> tac-45<00:01:01.739> two

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
to kill a weapon while the tac-45 two

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.500 
to kill a weapon while the tac-45 two
shot<00:01:02.340> kill<00:01:02.520> range<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.969> three<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> four

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
shot kill range is like three to four

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.060 
shot kill range is like three to four
times<00:01:03.690> at<00:01:03.989> distance<00:01:04.409> which<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.860> why<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
times at distance which is why the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
times at distance which is why the
damage<00:01:05.400> bars<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> creative<00:01:06.180> class<00:01:06.299> men

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
damage bars in the creative class men

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
damage bars in the creative class men
you<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.110> different<00:01:07.409> both<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.040> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
you are just so different both of the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
you are just so different both of the
three<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.460> four<00:01:08.640> shot<00:01:08.820> kill<00:01:09.030> ranges<00:01:09.299> are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
three or four shot kill ranges are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.060 
three or four shot kill ranges are
pretty<00:01:09.630> much<00:01:09.750> identical<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.470> 57<00:01:10.920> has<00:01:11.040> a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
pretty much identical the 57 has a

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.649 
pretty much identical the 57 has a
slight<00:01:11.430> edge<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> three<00:01:12.090> shot<00:01:12.270> distance

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
slight edge in the three shot distance

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.270 
slight edge in the three shot distance
but<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:13.080> much<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.740> also<00:01:13.860> has<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> slight

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
but not by much it also has a slight

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.620 
but not by much it also has a slight
advantage<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.850> five<00:01:15.030> shot<00:01:15.270> kill<00:01:15.479> range

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
advantage in the five shot kill range

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
advantage in the five shot kill range
and<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:16.229> course<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.979> weapons

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and of course you know these weapons

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.649 
and of course you know these weapons
will<00:01:17.369> take<00:01:17.580> more<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:17.909> six<00:01:18.180> bullets<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.630> kill

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
will take more than six bullets to kill

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.210 
will take more than six bullets to kill
now<00:01:19.140> taking<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> look<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> rates<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.189> fire

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
now taking a look at the rates of fire

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.100 
now taking a look at the rates of fire
this<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.759> where<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> first<00:01:21.810> big

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this is where you see like the first big

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
this is where you see like the first big
difference<00:01:22.500> between<00:01:22.740> these<00:01:22.860> two<00:01:22.920> pistols<00:01:23.400> 57

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
difference between these two pistols 57

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.630 
difference between these two pistols 57
fires<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.600> 600<00:01:25.110> RPM<00:01:25.439> while<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> tac-45<00:01:26.159> fires

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
fires at 600 RPM while the tac-45 fires

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.330 
fires at 600 RPM while the tac-45 fires
at<00:01:26.790> 515<00:01:27.600> RPM<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.680> course<00:01:28.860> both<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> these

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
at 515 RPM and of course both of these

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.039 
at 515 RPM and of course both of these
are<00:01:29.520> semi-automatic<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.659> their<00:01:30.750> max

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
are semi-automatic so this is their max

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.420 
are semi-automatic so this is their max
rate<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.380> fire<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:31.860> obviously<00:01:31.950> shoot<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
rate of fire you can obviously shoot it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
rate of fire you can obviously shoot it
slower<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> choose<00:01:33.240> but<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.689> any<00:01:33.960> faster

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
slower if you choose but not any faster

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
slower if you choose but not any faster
if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> have<00:01:34.890> used<00:01:35.100> these<00:01:35.310> pistols<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> know

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
if you have used these pistols you know

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
if you have used these pistols you know
how<00:01:36.329> much<00:01:36.509> easier<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.110> shoot<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> 57<00:01:38.040> at

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
how much easier it is to shoot the 57 at

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.950 
how much easier it is to shoot the 57 at
a<00:01:38.400> nice<00:01:38.640> consistent<00:01:39.329> fire<00:01:39.570> rate<00:01:39.780> especially

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
a nice consistent fire rate especially

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.780 
a nice consistent fire rate especially
of<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> fast<00:01:40.500> trigger<00:01:40.710> finger<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.549> attack

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
of a fast trigger finger but with attack

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.609 
of a fast trigger finger but with attack
45<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> shoots<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.140> uneven

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
45 it shoots it like a really uneven

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
45 it shoots it like a really uneven
pattern<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> odd<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.850> that's<00:01:45.360> because

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pattern kind of odd and that's because

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.359 
pattern kind of odd and that's because
it's<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.049> easy<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> over<00:01:46.770> sample<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.250> try

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
it's really easy to over sample and try

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.889 
it's really easy to over sample and try
to<00:01:47.430> shoot<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.729> fast<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.479> pulling<00:01:48.630> trigger

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
to shoot it fast you're pulling trigger

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.710 
to shoot it fast you're pulling trigger
faster<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:49.470> 515<00:01:50.159> rpm<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.000> tac-45<00:01:51.390> will

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
faster than 515 rpm the tac-45 will

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.450 
faster than 515 rpm the tac-45 will
essentially<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> lock<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
essentially kind of lock up and that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
essentially kind of lock up and that's
why<00:01:53.610> fires<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.149> such<00:01:54.329> an<00:01:54.450> audit<00:01:54.780> matter<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
why fires in such an audit matter so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.539 
why fires in such an audit matter so
again<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.979> fairly<00:01:56.280> capable

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
again if you have a fairly capable

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
again if you have a fairly capable
trigger<00:01:57.000> finger<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> 57<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.320> best<00:01:58.500> bet

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
trigger finger the 57 is your best bet

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.170 
trigger finger the 57 is your best bet
and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.310> gets<00:01:59.430> even<00:01:59.549> better<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.149> because

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
and it gets even better for you because

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.270 
and it gets even better for you because
the<00:02:00.509> 57<00:02:01.079> holds<00:02:01.350> twice<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> amount<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.950> bullets

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the 57 holds twice the amount of bullets

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
the 57 holds twice the amount of bullets
and<00:02:02.430> its<00:02:02.520> magazine<00:02:02.790> compared<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.509> tac-45

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
and its magazine compared to the tac-45

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.630 
and its magazine compared to the tac-45
and<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.950> area<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.189> really

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and this is the one area that really

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.819 
and this is the one area that really
hurts<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> tac-45<00:02:06.420> because<00:02:06.930> yeah<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.680> kills

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
hurts the tac-45 because yeah it kills

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.619 
hurts the tac-45 because yeah it kills
slightly<00:02:08.369> faster<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> certain<00:02:09.239> range

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
slightly faster up to a certain range

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.869 
slightly faster up to a certain range
but<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> 57<00:02:10.830> holds<00:02:11.009> twice<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> ammo<00:02:11.550> and

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
but the 57 holds twice the ammo and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.320 
but the 57 holds twice the ammo and
shoots<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.510> faster

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
shoots a lot faster

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.700 
shoots a lot faster
and<00:02:13.390> with<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.660> amount<00:02:13.870> of<00:02:13.990> ammo<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.260> think

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
and with this amount of ammo you think

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.590 
and with this amount of ammo you think
the<00:02:14.860> 57<00:02:15.340> reload<00:02:15.640> time<00:02:15.850> would<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.360> high

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
the 57 reload time would be really high

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.970 
the 57 reload time would be really high
but<00:02:16.960> they're<00:02:17.080> actually<00:02:17.230> both<00:02:17.500> pretty<00:02:17.800> much

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
but they're actually both pretty much

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.890 
but they're actually both pretty much
the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.310> around<00:02:18.700> two<00:02:18.910> seconds<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.810> can

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the same around two seconds and you can

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
the same around two seconds and you can
easily<00:02:20.140> reload<00:02:20.680> council<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.250> know<00:02:21.370> around

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
easily reload council you know around

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.430 
easily reload council you know around
one<00:02:21.910> second<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:22.750> that's<00:02:22.870> obviously<00:02:23.080> really

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
one second in so that's obviously really

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.170 
one second in so that's obviously really
helpful<00:02:23.860> getting<00:02:24.310> that<00:02:24.340> quick<00:02:24.640> reload<00:02:24.940> time

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
helpful getting that quick reload time

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.820 
helpful getting that quick reload time
and<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.780> goes<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.110> both<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.380> these<00:02:26.440> weapons

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
and that goes for both of these weapons

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.380 
and that goes for both of these weapons
but<00:02:27.190> when<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.430> all<00:02:27.550> said<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.820> done<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:28.030> can't

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
but when it's all said and done I can't

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.150 
but when it's all said and done I can't
honestly<00:02:28.690> pick<00:02:29.200> which<00:02:29.410> pissed<00:02:29.620> i<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.950> better

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
honestly pick which pissed i like better

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.740 
honestly pick which pissed i like better
i<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:30.850> sounded<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.210> i<00:02:31.390> was<00:02:31.420> more<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
i know it sounded like i was more in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.690 
i know it sounded like i was more in
favor<00:02:31.900> than<00:02:32.170> 57<00:02:32.710> but<00:02:33.160> i<00:02:33.190> always<00:02:33.490> have<00:02:33.670> a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
favor than 57 but i always have a

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
favor than 57 but i always have a
primary<00:02:33.940> weapon<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.420> anyways<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:34.990> typically

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
primary weapon on anyways so I typically

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.780 
primary weapon on anyways so I typically
just<00:02:35.470> use<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.860> finish<00:02:36.160> off<00:02:36.310> an<00:02:36.430> already

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
just use it to finish off an already

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.580 
just use it to finish off an already
weak<00:02:36.850> enemy<00:02:37.330> player<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.380> situation

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
weak enemy player so in that situation

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.410 
weak enemy player so in that situation
you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> large<00:02:39.610> two<00:02:39.880> shot<00:02:40.090> kill<00:02:40.270> range

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you know the large two shot kill range

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.360 
you know the large two shot kill range
is<00:02:40.570> very<00:02:40.810> helpful<00:02:41.080> but<00:02:41.560> at<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> same<00:02:41.950> time<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
is very helpful but at the same time the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.280 
is very helpful but at the same time the
57<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.030> just<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.570> fun<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> use<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.200> can

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
57 is just really fun to use you can

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.110 
57 is just really fun to use you can
shoot<00:02:44.500> it<00:02:44.560> really<00:02:44.920> fast<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.880> really

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
shoot it really fast and is really

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.490 
shoot it really fast and is really
accurate<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.020> was<00:02:47.110> only<00:02:47.260> running<00:02:47.350> a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
accurate and if I was only running a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.530 
accurate and if I was only running a
secondary<00:02:47.830> I'd<00:02:48.040> probably<00:02:48.220> choose<00:02:48.460> the<00:02:48.640> 57<00:02:49.150> but

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
secondary I'd probably choose the 57 but

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.390 
secondary I'd probably choose the 57 but
again<00:02:49.750> it's<00:02:49.930> really<00:02:50.350> close<00:02:50.560> at<00:02:50.830> least<00:02:51.040> for<00:02:51.250> me

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
again it's really close at least for me

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.650 
again it's really close at least for me
so<00:02:51.760> what<00:02:51.940> do<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.060> guys<00:02:52.120> think<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.570> which
