00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
without being too obvious and then you

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.940 
without being too obvious and then you
want<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.149> use<00:02:08.270> some<00:02:08.390> black<00:02:08.660> liner<00:02:08.990> just<00:02:09.530> as<00:02:09.709> a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
want to use some black liner just as a

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.780

810 brush and I kind of like it better

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.449 
810 brush and I kind of like it better
than<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.360> brush<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.500> normally<00:02:15.920> use<00:02:15.950> cuz

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
than the brush that I normally use cuz

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.520 
than the brush that I normally use cuz
it's<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:17.000> lot<00:02:17.180> thinner<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:17.959> you<00:02:18.080> can<00:02:18.230> create<00:02:18.410> a

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it's a lot thinner so you can create a

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.650 
it's a lot thinner so you can create a
much<00:02:18.680> finer<00:02:18.920> line<00:02:19.310> because<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.420> look

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
much finer line because this is a look

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.790 
much finer line because this is a look
where<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.870> want<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.080> create<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.350> very<00:02:21.590> very

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
where you want to create a very very

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.110 
where you want to create a very very
skinny<00:02:22.100> on<00:02:22.250> line<00:02:22.400> because<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.790> create<00:02:22.910> too

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
skinny on line because if you create too

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.430 
skinny on line because if you create too
much<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.450> thick<00:02:23.660> line<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.080> it's<00:02:24.230> going<00:02:24.350> to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
much of a thick line then it's going to

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.500 
much of a thick line then it's going to
look<00:02:24.530> too<00:02:24.709> heavy<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.700> gonna<00:02:25.820> start<00:02:26.270> in<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
look too heavy it's gonna start in the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.500 
look too heavy it's gonna start in the
middle<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.790> go<00:02:28.790> outwards

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.479 

so<00:02:36.959> I'll<00:02:37.050> just<00:02:37.230> give<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.650> subtlest<00:02:38.190> end

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
so I'll just give you the subtlest end

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:46.600

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.610 

this<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.510> look<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:48.020> would<00:02:48.140> definitely<00:02:48.290> go

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
this is a look that would definitely go

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.560 
this is a look that would definitely go
really<00:02:48.950> well<00:02:49.070> just<00:02:49.580> black<00:02:49.820> mascara<00:02:50.060> but

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
really well just black mascara but

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.390 
really well just black mascara but
because<00:02:50.870> I've<00:02:50.990> got<00:02:51.140> very<00:02:51.350> sparse<00:02:51.710> lashes<00:02:52.040> I'm

because I've got very sparse lashes I'm

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.830 
because I've got very sparse lashes I'm
gonna<00:02:52.550> use<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> false<00:02:52.970> watch<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.630> it<00:02:53.690> looks

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
gonna use a false watch and it looks
