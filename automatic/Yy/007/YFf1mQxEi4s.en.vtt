well<00:00:32.040> I've<00:00:32.309> changed<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.880> opinion<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.750> I

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.440 
well I've changed my opinion on it I
usually<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.890> feel<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.820> show<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.420> a

usually I feel like I show a show a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.670 
usually I feel like I show a show a
squad<00:00:36.719> report<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> end<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> season<00:00:37.590> I

think I think it all should be like a go
and<00:00:39.239> show<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> end<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.690> season<00:00:40.020> I'm<00:00:40.079> going

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.900 
really gonna really gonna fix up the
defense<00:05:10.140> but<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.950> be<00:05:11.070> honest<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.460> three<00:05:11.670> five

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
defense but to be honest the three five

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.220 
defense but to be honest the three five
three<00:05:11.940> three<00:05:12.660> four<00:05:13.440> ones<00:05:14.100> who<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.430> think<00:05:14.670> it<00:05:14.760> is

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
three three four ones who I think it is

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.290 
three three four ones who I think it is
the<00:05:16.230> three<00:05:16.380> five<00:05:16.530> two<00:05:16.710> I<00:05:16.980> have<00:05:17.970> been<00:05:18.090> playing

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
the three five two I have been playing

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.900 
the three five two I have been playing
this<00:05:18.480> formation<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:19.260> lot<00:05:19.800> like<00:05:20.220> obviously<00:05:20.790> I've

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
this formation a lot like obviously I've

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.250 
this formation a lot like obviously I've
done<00:05:21.090> six<00:05:21.300> seasons<00:05:21.660> with<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.810> Manchester

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
done six seasons with the Manchester

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.320 
done six seasons with the Manchester
United<00:05:22.620> crew<00:05:22.830> made<00:05:23.010> swap<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.640> out<00:05:23.700> in<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:23.940> bar

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
United crew made swap it out in the bar

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.360 
United crew made swap it out in the bar
so<00:05:24.570> one<00:05:24.780> but<00:05:25.620> I'm<00:05:25.770> probably<00:05:25.920> more<00:05:26.100> comfortable

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
so one but I'm probably more comfortable

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.560 
so one but I'm probably more comfortable
playing<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.880> with<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.030> four<00:05:27.180> one<00:05:27.270> two<00:05:27.420> one

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
playing that with the four one two one

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.110 
playing that with the four one two one
two<00:05:27.600> but<00:05:28.440> I<00:05:28.740> think<00:05:29.190> we've<00:05:29.400> got<00:05:29.520> so<00:05:29.970> much

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
two but I think we've got so much

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.530 
two but I think we've got so much
midfielders<00:05:30.930> we<00:05:31.200> have<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:32.070> talent<00:05:32.670> and<00:05:32.850> the

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
midfielders we have the talent and the

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.090 
midfielders we have the talent and the
players<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.140> hold<00:05:34.410> it<00:05:34.560> up<00:05:34.650> in<00:05:34.770> the<00:05:34.890> midfield

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
players to hold it up in the midfield

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.640 
players to hold it up in the midfield
and<00:05:35.630> basically<00:05:36.630> sort<00:05:36.870> of<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.170> formation<00:05:37.560> is

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
and basically sort of the formation is

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.630 
and basically sort of the formation is
you<00:05:37.710> really<00:05:37.830> need<00:05:37.920> a<00:05:38.040> whole<00:05:38.160> lot<00:05:38.400> because<00:05:38.460> you

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:38.640 
you really need a whole lot because you

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.070 
you really need a whole lot because you
obviously<00:05:38.700> don't<00:05:38.970> have<00:05:39.090> those<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.750> extra

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
obviously don't have those that extra

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.480 
obviously don't have those that extra
defender<00:05:40.380> up<00:05:40.590> back<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.010> we've<00:05:41.100> got<00:05:41.220> solid

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
defender up back but we've got solid

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.490 
defender up back but we've got solid
defenders<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.300> I'm<00:05:42.690> gonna<00:05:43.050> give<00:05:43.230> it<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.350> go

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
defenders so I'm gonna give it a go

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.310 
defenders so I'm gonna give it a go
against<00:05:43.770> AC<00:05:43.920> Milan<00:05:44.250> it's<00:05:44.730> probably<00:05:45.180> risky<00:05:45.660> my

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
against AC Milan it's probably risky my

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.080 
against AC Milan it's probably risky my
first<00:05:46.590> Champions<00:05:47.250> League<00:05:47.430> match<00:05:47.640> I<00:05:47.760> did<00:05:47.940> play

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
first Champions League match I did play

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.090 
first Champions League match I did play
I<00:05:48.120> did<00:05:48.360> simulate<00:05:48.840> some<00:05:49.020> other<00:05:49.170> matches<00:05:49.440> simply

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
I did simulate some other matches simply

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.020 
I did simulate some other matches simply
because<00:05:51.560> we're<00:05:52.560> probably<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.920> best<00:05:53.220> group<00:05:53.850> in

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
because we're probably the best group in

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.000 
because we're probably the best group in
there<00:05:54.180> but<00:05:54.510> we<00:05:54.960> do<00:05:55.140> have<00:05:55.290> his<00:05:55.470> latter<00:05:55.710> and

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
there but we do have his latter and

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.940 
there but we do have his latter and
facing<00:05:56.640> his<00:05:56.790> former<00:05:57.180> club<00:05:57.480> AC<00:05:57.810> Milan<00:05:58.530> for<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
facing his former club AC Milan for the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.750 
facing his former club AC Milan for the
