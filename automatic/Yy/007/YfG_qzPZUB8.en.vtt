sincerity<00:03:38.190> perhaps<00:03:38.730> but<00:03:38.970> an<00:03:39.150> authentic

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
sincerity perhaps but an authentic

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.510 
sincerity perhaps but an authentic
electricity<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.890> us<00:03:40.920> up<00:03:41.250> and

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
electricity that will get us up and

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.890 
electricity that will get us up and

anybody else I think the closest we have
to<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.500> Fiorina<00:03:46.890> if<00:03:47.160> Biden<00:03:47.670> enters<00:03:48.030> the
