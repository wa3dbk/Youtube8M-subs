00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
contraption is only for his ID and then

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.340 
contraption is only for his ID and then
it<00:02:04.160> tests<00:02:04.640> for<00:02:04.670> every<00:02:05.300> player<00:02:05.540> with<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.140> idea

it tests for every player with the idea
of<00:02:06.380> 1<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.179> this<00:02:08.179> output<00:02:08.690> here<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.470> going<00:02:09.800> to

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.600 
a short time and then it summons the
cloud<00:02:39.530> particles<00:02:41.470> where<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.709> entity<00:02:43.070> with

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
cloud particles where the entity with

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.710 
cloud particles where the entity with
the<00:02:43.760> name<00:02:43.970> ID<00:02:44.239> 1<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:47.450> entity

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the name ID 1 is and this entity

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.270 
the name ID 1 is and this entity
actually<00:02:48.260> is<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:48.680> an<00:02:48.910> invulnerable<00:02:49.910> squid

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
actually is just an invulnerable squid

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280 
actually is just an invulnerable squid
and<00:02:52.280> he's<00:02:52.700> invisible<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.510> he<00:02:53.690> has<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.810> custom

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
and he's invisible and he has a custom

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.580 
and he's invisible and he has a custom
name<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.860> ID<00:02:55.130> 1<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.850> we<00:02:55.970> need<00:02:56.120> one<00:02:56.330> squid<00:02:56.810> for

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
name of ID 1 so we need one squid for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.220 
name of ID 1 so we need one squid for
every<00:02:58.160> player<00:02:58.540> so<00:03:00.070> if<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:01.370> make<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.820> squid<00:03:02.810> not

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
every player so if I make that squid not

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.920 
every player so if I make that squid not
so<00:03:03.769> invisible<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.489> can<00:03:04.700> actually<00:03:05.090> remove<00:03:05.959> that

has the name ID one and he's always

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.190 
has the name ID one and he's always
attached<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.329> player<00:03:25.510> with<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.689> ID<00:03:25.930> one

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
player is dead alga damnit this particle

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.710 
player is dead alga damnit this particle
effect<00:03:49.750> gets<00:03:50.049> played<00:03:51.180> where<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.299> squid<00:03:52.569> is

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
effect gets played where the squid is

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.550 
effect gets played where the squid is
I'm<00:03:53.459> making<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.930> simulation<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.170> lightning

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
I'm making the simulation of a lightning

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.990 
I'm making the simulation of a lightning
and<00:03:56.970> can<00:03:57.970> respond<00:03:58.739> this<00:04:00.000> contraption

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
and can respond this contraption

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.390 
and can respond this contraption
actually<00:04:01.629> needs<00:04:03.209> well<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.950> need<00:04:06.310> this

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
actually needs well and you need this

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.240 
actually needs well and you need this
contraption<00:04:06.760> once<00:04:07.060> for<00:04:07.239> every<00:04:07.329> player<00:04:07.840> that's

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
contraption once for every player that's

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.030 
contraption once for every player that's
in<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.400> map<00:04:10.319> just<00:04:11.319> for<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.650> simple<00:04:12.010> reason

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
in the map just for the simple reason

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.620 
in the map just for the simple reason
that<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.900> cannot<00:04:14.260> test<00:04:14.739> for<00:04:15.209> every<00:04:16.209> player<00:04:16.419> if

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
that you cannot test for every player if

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.420 
that you cannot test for every player if
he's<00:04:16.780> dead<00:04:16.989> at<00:04:17.260> once<00:04:17.500> that's<00:04:17.799> a<00:04:17.949> little<00:04:18.280> bit

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
he's dead at once that's a little bit

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.140 
he's dead at once that's a little bit
yeah<00:04:19.120> I<00:04:20.250> don't<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.340> what's<00:04:21.579> motoring<00:04:21.970> did

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
yeah I don't know what's motoring did

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.650 
yeah I don't know what's motoring did
there<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:22.539> if<00:04:23.289> you<00:04:23.620> have<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:24.340> total<00:04:24.910> death

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
there but if you have a total death

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.120 
there but if you have a total death
account<00:04:26.409> objective<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.539> it<00:04:28.539> only<00:04:29.130> increments

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
account objective and it only increments

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.560 
account objective and it only increments
by<00:04:30.280> 1

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
by 1

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.899 
by 1
once<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.750> respawn<00:04:32.229> and<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:33.250> do<00:04:33.400> not<00:04:33.520> want<00:04:33.789> to

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
once you respawn and you do not want to

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.860 
once you respawn and you do not want to
have<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.180> lightning<00:04:34.479> where<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.690> player

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
have the lightning where the player

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.719 
have the lightning where the player
responds<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:35.550> actually<00:04:36.550> where<00:04:36.789> he<00:04:36.970> dies<00:04:38.729> this

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
responds but actually where he dies this

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:40.909 
responds but actually where he dies this
is<00:04:39.849> funny

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
is funny

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.330 
is funny
and<00:04:42.419> so<00:04:43.419> yeah<00:04:43.690> I<00:04:44.020> think<00:04:44.380> I'm<00:04:44.830> just<00:04:44.979> going<00:04:45.250> to

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
and so yeah I think I'm just going to

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.810 
and so yeah I think I'm just going to
summon<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.300> squid<00:04:46.659> again

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.870 

and<00:04:50.770> this<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.920> just<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> way<00:04:52.460> it<00:04:52.550> works<00:04:52.730> I

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
and this is just the way it works I

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.270 
and this is just the way it works I
think<00:04:53.090> it's<00:04:53.290> really<00:04:54.290> awesome<00:04:56.950> now<00:04:57.950> you<00:04:58.010> can

think it's really awesome now you can
have<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:59.380> effect<00:05:00.380> yeah<00:05:01.340> in<00:05:01.970> your<00:05:02.540> own

have this effect yeah in your own
survival<00:05:03.380> games<00:05:03.740> in<00:05:03.980> vanilla<00:05:04.250> minecraft<00:05:04.550> this

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
survival games in vanilla minecraft this

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.690 
survival games in vanilla minecraft this
is<00:05:05.090> really<00:05:05.840> good<00:05:06.020> for<00:05:06.110> meth<00:05:06.290> makers<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.950> have<00:05:07.550> to

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
is really good for meth makers I have to

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.580 
is really good for meth makers I have to
say<00:05:07.970> thanks<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.330> drag<00:05:08.690> moss<00:05:09.730> which<00:05:10.730> I<00:05:11.440> saw<00:05:12.440> his

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
say thanks to drag moss which I saw his

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.530 
say thanks to drag moss which I saw his
lightning<00:05:12.950> video<00:05:13.220> in<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.940> little<00:05:14.150> Minecraft

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
lightning video in the little Minecraft

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.540 
lightning video in the little Minecraft
end<00:05:15.490> so<00:05:16.490> I<00:05:16.880> took<00:05:17.360> advantage<00:05:17.600> of<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.550> took

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
end so I took advantage of that and took

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.030 
end so I took advantage of that and took
the<00:05:19.730> cloud<00:05:19.970> effect<00:05:20.120> and<00:05:20.600> the<00:05:21.170> night<00:05:21.680> vision

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
the cloud effect and the night vision

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.060 
the cloud effect and the night vision
but<00:05:23.030> yes<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:24.230> is<00:05:24.440> how<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:24.680> find<00:05:24.920> out

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
but yes so this is how you find out

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.620 
but yes so this is how you find out
where<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> player<00:05:25.640> dies<00:05:25.850> and<00:05:26.180> remember<00:05:26.540> it

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
where a player dies and remember it

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:31.870 
where a player dies and remember it
correctly<00:05:27.790> see<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:28.880> the<00:05:29.000> next<00:05:29.090> video<00:05:29.270> bye
