00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.990
 Greetings from Slayer fat and 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.749
 welcome to this video of achievements of the 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.450
 Heart campaign hive is 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.759
 it's about shooting the messenger 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.380
 again I get the same improvements 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.050
 for this mission they only charge that 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.840
 here I immediately use the improvement of 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.570
 those of workers who are divided 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.009
 in two it is an excellent improvement when 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.380
 the map starts the first thing you have 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.820
 what to do is create workers saturate 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.800
 the base as quickly as possible 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.110
 immediately after that you will send 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 your army to the right side to 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.129
 side of the right side of the base 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.350
 main there is an expansion 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.199
 The first thing you're going to do is attack that 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.899
 expansion do yours and after that 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:50.290
 make it yours to saturate it when they have 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.940
 the two saturated bases are going to see 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.230
 three main objectives 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.630
 the first objective 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 saturate the bases the second objective 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.850
 transition to fines the third 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.150
 goal to eliminate absolutely everything 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.760
 but that nothing gigi that's all that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.430
 you have to make the defense from the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.190
 portal is very easy very simple what 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 has to do is destroy everything that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.610
 come about your territory so 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 simple with how much it is for you to have 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.860
 well saturated raisins you never get 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.860
 forget to make both supreme workers 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.140
 many when you do not have my gas for 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.530
 take out many more 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.409
 toulouse to be lynch to be gays us and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.990
 jiji that's all brothers everything 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.020
 important this spreads the crit on 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 everything in this area as you see it here is very 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.729
 important and on the right side of the 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:55.799
 expansion there is another exit for 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.060
 protos transport there is another portal like this 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.479
 that in these areas continues to spread 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.420
 sb exit suscripta and destroys what 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.569
 is here and with a few 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 spores that's in case the friend because if 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.599
 Something is wrong and you can throw yourself 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.720
 mattress just in case so that not 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.250
 miss the game foolishly keep the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.019
 production of many blankets the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.310
 xardÃ­ns production keep the 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.720
 overlord production and it was little by little 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.379
 eliminating everything that is achieved in the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.780
 periphery of the bases after that you 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:34.170
 I recommend that you take out at least 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.080
 34 hrs about 34 larvae is important 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.319
 because like here you can not inject as 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.440
 multiplayer you can not inject larvae in 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.480
 the larvae need production of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.610
 larvae and simply builds 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 enough larvae to have the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.319
 as much larva as possible and for 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.120
 course builds a very quantity 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.459
 decent sports 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.950
 that is not 100% necessary and exclusive is 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.610
 recommended is highly recommended because 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.690
 if it does not give you a chance to defend one of 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.730
 the exit doors 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.360
 you can let things do the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.530
 work and that's all this basis also 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.810
 he recommended that he hold on everything 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 for gas it is very important that you hold 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.920
 gas to maintain a production 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.480
 constant excess flecks and what 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.440
 you can use to take out the trolleys 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 light when you feel like attacking the base 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.040
 of protos you have enough time 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.750
 You need to destroy 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 the three portals before the arrival 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.030
 fourth the fifth transport of products 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.099
 so you have enough time trying to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.660
 do it fast but it's not a race 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.700
 against one hundred percent time and 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.950
 when you have enough or more 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.430
 Lopez is to say how much they see that I have more 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.349
 or less about 30 to 35 minutes to get there 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.569
 at the moment that the mutas are going to finish 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.160
 with everything simply 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.930
 go attacking 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.120
 like for example so I realized 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.650
 that were coming in the transport 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.140
 consumption 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.480
 with your escort just get the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.950
 fines the uach or that Aaron and jiji 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.439
 after that you simply send them to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.439
 attack and with the best 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.829
 attacks on armored units 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.709
 heavy simply the fines pulled 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.169
 all annihilate everything in large numbers 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.330
 see how each time they play at once 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.919
 only the mutations made a 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.510
 incredible damage and the other base 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.070
 just go back and go 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.479
 in front of another call for other 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.199
 fewer units defending this 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:36.300
 simply attack the base and jiji sister 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.270
 while they call me what else could you say 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:42.060
 I can tell you more nothing you won is 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 another achievement facilitated a simple achievement 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.650
 I hope you liked within 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.380
 I'm going to do more videos about it 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.919
 this city is alaior fat until the 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.919
 next
