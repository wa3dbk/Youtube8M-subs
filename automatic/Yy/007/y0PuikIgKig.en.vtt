 let's see below 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.450
 the temperature I know it's been presented 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.120
 today as the minimum the day of

 in veracruz to continuous rains 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.309
 let's see our next image in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 where we can see what it is that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.899
 is going through front system number 19 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.480
 continues to affect part of the northeast 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.550
 of our country a little bit out there in it 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 north is presented as stationary what 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.300
 important for coming days is that 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.740
 arriving a new frontal system 1 that 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.300
 will affect very little 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.950
 significant and other than good because 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.350
 comes floodgate I'm talking about the 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.910
 number 21 of the season that could 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.920
 promote winds that could overcome 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.200
 the 60 kilometers per hour winds 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.210
 chilly cold winds but especially in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.500
 the north- eastern north of our country to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.420

 the border area of chihuahua greetings 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.630
 for Ciudad Juárez in the center of the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.010
 Mexican Republic there is a bit of 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.170
 instability in time and for 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.610
 next days I repeat what is important is 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.470
 that again we will have humidity 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.450
 part of the pacific by the goal 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.280
 because again, therefore, the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.480
 probability of precipitation both in 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.460

 presented in our country that 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.670
 they practically appear as null and 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.350
 that does a little bit out there in the zones 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.530
 precipitation that for tomorrow 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.209
