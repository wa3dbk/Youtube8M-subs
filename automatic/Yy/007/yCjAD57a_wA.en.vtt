00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.150
 if you chaves again here we will give them 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.369
 a topic about how to make your 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.830
 horses be a little more honest 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.860
 giving sides or reguilete as I can 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.370
 call different people this many 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.430
 things that looked at foals 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.990
 that start the horses already done is 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.320
 that people make them stay in 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.780
 giving sides or giving reguilete there 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.910
 what to try is an example you have to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.850
 try that the place where they are giving 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.410
 rehilete you have to loosen them and leave it 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.330
 know if they want to leave if they want 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.150
 I'll leave you to see an example with this 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.280
 horse is an example that is a time 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.230
 of my pattern works jr 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.660
 He uses a lot in his technique to train 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.550
 reining horses we hope this 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.320
 help them not with pointed out he did not want 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.030
 a lot of nothing bad is going to walk for 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 in front and then then offer to him 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.870
 osc left the left side Here 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.820
 will offer that from sides that will put 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.740
 at least you can consume that you're going nothing 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.480
 more I'll return it then put 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.850
 little the sides and lower my hands another 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.560
 time and there the horse this horse knows 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.900
 what he is doing is and the horse or 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.480
 the horse just stood talking sides 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.090
 about this horse you already know what 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.750
 is doing but we are saying by 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.250
 example if when they put the horse what 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.100
 they start to give sides when they put 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.080
 the hands here the horse is wanted or the 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 horse wants to go there what 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.260
 have to do is come back a little bit 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.390
 backwards 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.640
 use your like your foot and as soon as 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.870
 horse begins to give sides loosen it and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 you have to let him know that the horse 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.860
 start to stay there little by little if 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.870
 Your horse is not ready to do that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.270
 is not ready to put more speed 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.250
 is not ready to stay two 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 three sides there you have to try to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
 that the first the horse as soon as 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.940
 get the one that knows that that's where 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 is the rest I will not try for the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.230
 On the other hand, I hope the horse 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.820
 want to leave so you can see an example 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.920
 only the only thing I'm going to do is nothing 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.920
 bad I'm going to loosen what I'm going to offer 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 down 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.799
 only this horse does not want to be 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.810
 he wants to go it's going very well but 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.420
 try to grab a colt to for 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.880
 look at an example a little bit more more 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.300
 remarkable 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.220
 but it is something is something very simple of this 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.260
 horse I could not, could not, could not 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.380
 do very well already know the good to stay 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.360
 but if the horse wants to go, not what 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.600
 stop and just let him go 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.310
 return to give sides and loosen or in 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.010
 sides is the most important thing that can 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.470
 do and is a is is a way of 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.040
 do it and they can treat it to see if they 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.320
 it works because that's nothing more than a 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.590
 example for you and we hope that you 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.590
 help
