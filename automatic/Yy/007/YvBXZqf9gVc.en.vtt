enough<00:06:23.509> just<00:06:23.780> random<00:06:24.319> ufp<00:06:24.740> silliness<00:06:25.280> to<00:06:25.310> make

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
enough just random ufp silliness to make

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.930 
enough just random ufp silliness to make
it<00:06:25.849> fun<00:06:26.060> regardless<00:06:27.370> don't<00:06:28.370> know<00:06:28.610> if<00:06:28.729> there's

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
a whole lot to say about this one as it

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.670 
a whole lot to say about this one as it
was<00:06:31.159> just<00:06:31.580> this<00:06:31.819> parody<00:06:32.509> that<00:06:33.259> didn't<00:06:33.530> really

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
was just this parody that didn't really

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.180 
was just this parody that didn't really
establish<00:06:34.400> anything<00:06:34.759> new<00:06:34.940> but<00:06:35.360> it<00:06:35.720> was

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
establish anything new but it was

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.370

certainly<00:06:37.190> enjoyable<00:06:40.840> rarity<00:06:41.840> was<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.139> best

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
certainly enjoyable rarity was the best

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.740 
imagine that would be a fun episode to
work<00:06:57.379> with<00:06:57.590> lots<00:06:58.340> of<00:06:58.550> rainbow<00:06:59.000> acting<00:06:59.449> like<00:06:59.569> an

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
the ufp characterization anyway I hope

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.040
