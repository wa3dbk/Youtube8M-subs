00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 beautiful ciracÃ¬ of this brand new of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.200
 mycroft position is here today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.179
 new me to bring a new fashions 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 since you like fashion videos 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.500
 precisely today I am here to vote for a 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.900
 other as you have his title this 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.010
 light center way the sprint la or 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.930
 run and shift or snake would be 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.600
 the modality that makes us shorten 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.760
 Minecraft here remotely simple 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 isolating it the reopening is like a species 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 of apk easily installable 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.370
 install it from the description 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.219
 again they were there as an ad homs 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.629
 the minecraft passion would be what 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.360
 Here we find here is that as you see 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.190
 then it will be enough to activate it as you see 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.500
 activate the add ons and it will be activated 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.550
 just so very very simple 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 install 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.309
 let's go on to see a little bit like 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 it works then it is very simple too 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.039
 this will cost us as microsoft appears 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.770
 twice on the run on the key makes for 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.440
 go ahead type 1 and 2 color will make us 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.000
 it runs much faster and was one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.360
 very useful if maybe we want 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 do faster parkour or 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.250
 also the servers for this way can use 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 even in servers never considered a bit like 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 one at the end because the race therefore yes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.979
 then the other function I mention burns in 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.080
 this fashion is the shift or the thing 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 that makes us squat here must do 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.170
 check just click twice 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.810
 to go back 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 we can then release the ritual then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.439
 we can go on has again in 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.960
 net will not make us fall from the block of 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.150
 see a very useful thing four races 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.670
 for buildings and for the place of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.200
 was a thing with the author we can 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.939
 so flying is not much laundry either 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.250
 because it will be bugatti liked to do not there 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.380
 liked to fly more than things 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.890
 that I'm discovering then maybe 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 therefore it shows us how to show it later 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.060
 another auser you will see will come back 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 normal then then the description 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.370
 download 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.250
 you will also find the credits of the author of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.330
 this time it's really beautiful 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.280
 end of memories there was a nice one 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.740
 I like her right this video there 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.550
 writes to the mayor rewrites harmful 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.270
 coming 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.270
 hello hello
