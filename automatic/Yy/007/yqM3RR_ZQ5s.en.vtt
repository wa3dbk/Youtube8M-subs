I<00:00:55.980> like<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.699> design<00:00:57.059> however<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:58.050> though

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
I like this design however even though

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
I like this design however even though
it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.379> plastic<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.190> does<00:00:59.430> feel<00:00:59.699> very<00:00:59.730> solid

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it is plastic it does feel very solid

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
it is plastic it does feel very solid
and<00:01:00.629> doesn't<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.079> any<00:01:01.199> creaks<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.800> flexes

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and doesn't have any creaks or flexes

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
and doesn't have any creaks or flexes
when<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.640> move<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.290> front<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
when you move it around on the front the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
when you move it around on the front the
final<00:01:05.339> glass<00:01:05.580> display<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.720> no<00:01:06.930> buttons

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
final glass display with no buttons

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
final glass display with no buttons
except<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> sleep<00:01:08.400> wake<00:01:08.610> button<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
except for a sleep wake button on the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
except for a sleep wake button on the
top<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:10.229> volume<00:01:10.530> rock<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> side<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
top and a volume rock on the side the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
top and a volume rock on the side the
operating<00:01:12.270> system<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:12.900> gesture-based

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
operating system is very gesture-based

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.429 
operating system is very gesture-based
so<00:01:14.220> there<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> no<00:01:15.299> home<00:01:15.570> button<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> front

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so there is no home button on the front

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.469 
so there is no home button on the front
or<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.159> button<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.850> might<00:01:18.000> find<00:01:18.240> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
or a back button as you might find on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
or a back button as you might find on
other<00:01:18.509> devices<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.530> example<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.400> want<00:01:20.549> to

other devices for example if you want to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
other devices for example if you want to
switch<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> phone<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.229> flick<00:01:22.500> the

pixels<00:01:29.130> per<00:01:29.280> inch<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.700> easily<00:01:30.299> competes<00:01:30.720> for

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
pixels per inch it easily competes for

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.590 
pixels per inch it easily competes for
something<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.530> iPhone<00:01:31.890> 5<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.509> not

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
something like the iPhone 5 but it's not

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.539 
something like the iPhone 5 but it's not
really<00:01:33.900> competing<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.979> something<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> has

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
really competing with something that has

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.270 
really competing with something that has
a<00:01:35.579> full<00:01:35.850> HD<00:01:36.180> display<00:01:36.360> but<00:01:37.350> frankly<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
a full HD display but frankly the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
a full HD display but frankly the
typical<00:01:38.670> person<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.090> there<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.390> not<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
typical person out there is not going to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
typical person out there is not going to
notice<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.259> difference<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:41.280> terms<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.670> specs

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
notice the difference in terms of specs

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.300 
notice the difference in terms of specs
it's<00:01:42.479> pretty<00:01:42.750> much<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> same<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> any<00:01:43.829> premium

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it's pretty much the same as any premium

on the other hand we do feel that the
software<00:05:22.190> is<00:05:22.430> in<00:05:22.670> need<00:05:22.880> of<00:05:22.910> a<00:05:23.120> lot<00:05:23.360> of<00:05:23.480> new<00:05:23.720> apps

software is in need of a lot of new apps
but<00:05:24.650> it's<00:05:24.770> actually<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> brilliant<00:05:25.340> operating

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
but it's actually a brilliant operating

the<00:05:28.730> question<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.180> rather<00:05:29.360> whether<00:05:29.660> existing

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
the question is rather whether existing

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.650 
the question is rather whether existing
blackberry<00:05:30.770> users<00:05:31.190> will<00:05:31.730> actually<00:05:32.180> switch<00:05:32.450> to

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660

this device even without the bis plan in
our<00:05:37.130> opinion<00:05:37.370> it's<00:05:37.670> a<00:05:37.880> decent<00:05:38.270> upgrade

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
our opinion it's a decent upgrade

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.350 
our opinion it's a decent upgrade
because<00:05:39.290> blackberry<00:05:39.950> has<00:05:40.100> really<00:05:40.670> needed<00:05:41.000> to

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
because blackberry has really needed to
