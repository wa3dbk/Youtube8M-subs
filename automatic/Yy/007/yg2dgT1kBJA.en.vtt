00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.700 
right well anyway he's like the I guess
like<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.710> soda<00:03:05.490> hoses<00:03:05.970> or<00:03:06.090> whatever<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.840> yeah

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
like the soda hoses or whatever and yeah

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.750 
like the soda hoses or whatever and yeah
this<00:03:07.860> supposed<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.070> be<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.370> bar<00:03:08.520> back

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
this supposed to be like the bar back

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.100 
this supposed to be like the bar back
here<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> weird<00:03:09.960> little

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
here that just kind of a weird little

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.060 
here that just kind of a weird little
design<00:03:11.420> so<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.450> think<00:03:12.570> that's<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.020> for<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.350> like

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
design so I think that's it for the like

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.550 
design so I think that's it for the like
the<00:03:14.400> restaurant<00:03:15.000> area<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:16.050> restaurant

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the restaurant area of the restaurant

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.100 
the restaurant area of the restaurant
but<00:03:16.890> that's<00:03:17.040> not<00:03:17.220> all<00:03:17.400> over<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.630> we<00:03:18.930> got<00:03:19.050> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
but that's not all over here we got the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.990 
but that's not all over here we got the
kitchen<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.610> then<00:03:20.700> this<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:20.940> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
kitchen in here and then this is the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.700 
kitchen in here and then this is the
bathrooms<00:03:21.390> so<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.050> ever<00:03:22.110> been<00:03:22.260> an<00:03:22.350> outback

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710
