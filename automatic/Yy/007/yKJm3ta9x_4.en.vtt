00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.190 
when we say ethnic facial plastic

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.480 
when we say ethnic facial plastic
surgery<00:00:20.790> what<00:00:21.690> we<00:00:21.840> mean<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.350> changes<00:00:23.190> made<00:00:23.460> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
surgery what we mean is changes made to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.440 
surgery what we mean is changes made to
the<00:00:23.910> face<00:00:24.410> with<00:00:25.410> him<00:00:25.590> ethnic<00:00:26.100> noms<00:00:26.370> mean<00:00:27.210> and

the face with him ethnic noms mean and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.540 
the face with him ethnic noms mean and
it<00:00:27.540> takes<00:00:27.780> into<00:00:28.170> consideration<00:00:28.550> features

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it takes into consideration features

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
it takes into consideration features
that<00:00:29.670> are<00:00:29.850> ethnically<00:00:30.530> defines<00:00:31.530> someone's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.529 
surgery and seeks to balance the face
without<00:00:55.260> making<00:00:56.010> features<00:00:56.819> look<00:00:57.089> out<00:00:57.329> of

without making features look out of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.579 
without making features look out of
place<00:00:57.839> so<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.069> example<00:00:59.550> if<00:01:00.300> someone<00:01:00.629> who<00:01:01.109> has

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
place so for example if someone who has

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.799 
place so for example if someone who has
an<00:01:01.920> Asian<00:01:02.489> background<00:01:02.639> comes<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> me<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
an Asian background comes to me and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.870 
an Asian background comes to me and
wants<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.680> reshaping<00:01:05.159> done<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.579> the<00:01:05.700> face

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
wants some reshaping done to the face

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.139 
wants some reshaping done to the face
and<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.829> has<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> know<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
and you have one has to know how the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.649 
and you have one has to know how the
Asian<00:01:09.630> skin<00:01:10.670> responds<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.969> surgery<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
Asian skin responds to surgery and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.050 
Asian skin responds to surgery and
factor<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> surgery<00:01:14.790> when

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
factor it into into that surgery when

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060 
factor it into into that surgery when
they<00:01:15.149> are<00:01:15.210> planning<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.750> surgery<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.920> also

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
they are planning the surgery one also

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
they are planning the surgery one also
has<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.340> take<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.030> consideration<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.990> jaw

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
has to take in consideration the jaw

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.950 
has to take in consideration the jaw
structure<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:20.070> people<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.880> Asian<00:01:21.600> ethnicity

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
structure of people of Asian ethnicity

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.350 
structure of people of Asian ethnicity
so<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> surgical<00:01:23.610> techniques<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so that all the surgical techniques that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.120 
so that all the surgical techniques that
I<00:01:24.420> developed<00:01:24.840> will<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.079> will<00:01:25.740> be<00:01:25.770> congruent

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
I developed will be will be congruent

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.670 
I developed will be will be congruent
with<00:01:26.579> yes<00:01:26.759> basically<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.990> same<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.380> true<00:01:28.409> for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
with yes basically the same is true for

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980 
with yes basically the same is true for
someone<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.430> African<00:01:29.909> background<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.960> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
someone of African background they are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
someone of African background they are
prone<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> skerin<00:01:32.039> so<00:01:32.490> whereas<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:32.939> one

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
prone to skerin so whereas in one

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
prone to skerin so whereas in one
particular<00:01:33.930> ethnic<00:01:34.289> group<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.890> sessions<00:01:35.430> can

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
particular ethnic group in sessions can

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.450 
particular ethnic group in sessions can
be<00:01:35.700> liberally<00:01:36.270> made<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.740> air<00:01:37.979> someone

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
be liberally made in the air someone

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
be liberally made in the air someone
with<00:01:38.609> an<00:01:38.729> African<00:01:39.210> background<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.049> would<00:01:40.140> be

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
with an African background you would be

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.349 
with an African background you would be
very<00:01:40.649> careful<00:01:41.159> where<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> place<00:01:41.670> incisions

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
very careful where you place incisions

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.499 
very careful where you place incisions
so<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.899> these<00:01:43.200> features<00:01:43.469> and<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.850> means<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
so all these features and a means of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.679 
so all these features and a means of
would<00:01:46.079> heal<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.350> I'll<00:01:46.649> factor<00:01:47.219> into<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
would heal and I'll factor into the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.099 
would heal and I'll factor into the
ethnic<00:01:49.140> sensitive<00:01:49.859> facial<00:01:50.609> plastic<00:01:50.670> surgery

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.719 

so<00:01:57.109> ethnic<00:01:57.530> sensitive<00:01:57.950> rhinoplasty<00:01:58.549> is<00:01:58.609> a

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
so ethnic sensitive rhinoplasty is a

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.809 
so ethnic sensitive rhinoplasty is a
term<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.060> is<00:01:59.299> being<00:01:59.869> increasingly<00:02:00.409> used<00:02:00.819> to

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
term that is being increasingly used to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.859 
term that is being increasingly used to
define<00:02:02.710> nasal<00:02:03.710> reshaping<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:05.209> is<00:02:05.359> agnes

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
define nasal reshaping that is agnes

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.139 
define nasal reshaping that is agnes
ethnically<00:02:06.380> congruent<00:02:07.219> what<00:02:07.729> do<00:02:07.850> I<00:02:07.880> mean<00:02:08.090> by

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
ethnically congruent what do I mean by

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.289 
ethnically congruent what do I mean by
that<00:02:08.509> if<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.410> see<00:02:09.679> anyone<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:10.459> Hispanic

that if I see anyone of Hispanic

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.759 
that if I see anyone of Hispanic
background<00:02:11.750> there<00:02:11.959> are<00:02:12.049> some<00:02:12.230> features<00:02:12.440> on

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
background there are some features on

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.979 
background there are some features on
their<00:02:12.950> face<00:02:13.129> that<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:13.489> can<00:02:13.760> tells<00:02:14.299> me<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.900> a
