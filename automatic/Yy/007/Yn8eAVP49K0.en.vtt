I can go into golurk try to set up I can
go<00:03:17.670> into<00:03:17.819> gorebyss<00:03:19.160> although<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.190> think<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.550> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
go into gorebyss although I think it's a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.280 
go into gorebyss although I think it's a
little<00:03:20.700> too<00:03:20.819> early<00:03:20.940> with<00:03:21.480> lappers<00:03:21.989> hanging

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
little too early with lappers hanging

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.320 
little too early with lappers hanging
around<00:03:23.269> so<00:03:24.269> I'm<00:03:24.360> gonna<00:03:24.450> go<00:03:24.599> into<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:26.330> I'm

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
around so I'm gonna go into this and I'm

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.320 
around so I'm gonna go into this and I'm
actually<00:03:27.480> gonna<00:03:27.690> go<00:03:27.959> for<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.200> deep<00:03:28.500> punch

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
actually gonna go for a deep punch

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.880 
actually gonna go for a deep punch
because<00:03:30.330> deep<00:03:30.569> punch<00:03:30.780> hurts<00:03:31.080> everything<00:03:31.470> he's

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
because deep punch hurts everything he's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.130 
because deep punch hurts everything he's
gonna<00:03:32.010> expect<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.610> earthquake<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.420> don't

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
gonna expect the earthquake I don't

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.280 
gonna expect the earthquake I don't
really<00:03:34.290> need<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.980> uh<00:03:35.599> except<00:03:36.599> for<00:03:36.750> rock<00:03:36.900> polish

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
really need to uh except for rock polish

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.449 
really need to uh except for rock polish
because<00:03:37.409> nothing<00:03:37.800> on<00:03:37.890> those<00:03:37.950> teams<00:03:38.220> really

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
because nothing on those teams really

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.630 
because nothing on those teams really
fast<00:03:38.909> anyway<00:03:39.260> he's<00:03:40.260> got<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.709> slow<00:03:41.250> team

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
fast anyway he's got a really slow team

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.000 
fast anyway he's got a really slow team
it's<00:03:42.209> like<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> bulky<00:03:42.870> offense<00:03:43.319> team<00:03:43.650> which<00:03:43.860> is

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
it's like a bulky offense team which is

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.460 
it's like a bulky offense team which is
kind<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> cool<00:03:44.629> if<00:03:45.629> you<00:03:45.780> don't<00:03:45.840> see<00:03:46.019> those<00:03:46.200> too

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
kind of cool if you don't see those too

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.420 
kind of cool if you don't see those too
often<00:03:46.680> either<00:03:48.409> so<00:03:49.409> let's<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.650> dynamic<00:03:50.220> punch

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
often either so let's just dynamic punch

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
often either so let's just dynamic punch
say<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:52.049> earthquake<00:03:52.379> is<00:03:52.530> so

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
say it the earthquake is so

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.470 
say it the earthquake is so
obvious<00:03:53.400> but<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:56.280> know<00:03:56.430> them's<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> breaks

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
obvious but you know them's the breaks

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.920 
obvious but you know them's the breaks
there<00:03:57.870> we<00:03:57.989> go<00:03:58.170> there's<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:59.629> so<00:04:00.629> that<00:04:00.750> things

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
there we go there's that so that things

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.360 
there we go there's that so that things
out<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.260> way<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:03.409> as<00:04:04.409> long<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.709> bashed<00:04:05.099> you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
out of the way and as long as bashed you

swellow comes in and has a field day so

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.420 
swellow comes in and has a field day so
he's<00:04:13.319> probably<00:04:13.530> gonna<00:04:13.830> puke<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
he's probably gonna puke for a

first-term wake no he's not he's just

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.979 
first-term wake no he's not he's just
gonna<00:04:16.830> let<00:04:16.979> it<00:04:17.010> die<00:04:17.390> well<00:04:18.390> there<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.630> go

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
gonna let it die well there you go

Lapras I know Lapras is slow I know
Lapras<00:04:28.650> is<00:04:28.800> slow<00:04:29.840> if<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:30.990> can<00:04:31.169> weaken<00:04:31.530> this

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
Lapras is slow if I can weaken this

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.110 
Lapras is slow if I can weaken this
thing<00:04:31.979> and<00:04:32.220> get<00:04:32.310> it<00:04:32.340> confused

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
thing and get it confused
