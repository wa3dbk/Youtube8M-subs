I showed you the head gasket with the I

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.379 
I showed you the head gasket with the I
mean<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:12.030> looked<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:13.549> the<00:00:14.549> leak<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
mean that looked like the leak from the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.970 
mean that looked like the leak from the
mysterious<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.139> leak<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.619> showing<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
mysterious little leak I was showing I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.960 
mysterious little leak I was showing I
was<00:00:17.130> talking<00:00:17.640> about<00:00:19.189> what<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> did<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.460> fix<00:00:20.730> it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
was talking about what I did to fix it

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.640 
was talking about what I did to fix it
was<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> took<00:00:21.420> off<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.630> valve<00:00:21.960> cover<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.560> I

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
was I took off the valve cover or I

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.160 
was I took off the valve cover or I
thought<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.070> leaking<00:00:23.369> from<00:00:23.640> there

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
thought I was leaking from there

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.640 
thought I was leaking from there
originally<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.980> saw<00:00:26.580> oil<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:28.320> ledge

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
originally I saw oil on here this ledge

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
originally I saw oil on here this ledge
right<00:00:28.680> here<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.429> cleaned<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:29.970> but

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
right here I just cleaned it off but

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.860 
right here I just cleaned it off but
there<00:00:30.300> was<00:00:30.420> oil<00:00:30.630> right<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.320> ledge

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
there was oil right here on this ledge

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.770 
there was oil right here on this ledge
like<00:00:33.870> right<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.380> head<00:00:34.559> gasket<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
like right where the head gasket is I

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
like right where the head gasket is I
cleaned<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:38.540> I<00:00:40.010> thought<00:00:41.010> originally

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
cleaned it up and I thought originally

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
cleaned it up and I thought originally
it<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.879> coming<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> valve<00:00:42.690> cover<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it was coming from the valve cover so I

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
it was coming from the valve cover so I
took<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.950> off<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.399> applied<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> gasket<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
took that off we applied the gasket I

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.500 
took that off we applied the gasket I
snugged<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.969> everything<00:00:47.969> looks<00:00:48.239> fine

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
snugged it all up everything looks fine

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.869 
snugged it all up everything looks fine
there's<00:00:49.020> no<00:00:49.170> leaks<00:00:49.590> coming<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> valve

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
there's no leaks coming from the valve

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.170 
there's no leaks coming from the valve
cover<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.890> checked<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.879> cam

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
cover I know that and I checked the cam

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
cover I know that and I checked the cam
seal<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.840> someone<00:00:55.199> said<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> could<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.680> been

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
seal to someone said it could have been

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
seal to someone said it could have been
the<00:00:55.829> cam<00:00:56.100> seal<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> looked<00:00:57.660> at<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.170> was

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
the cam seal so I looked at that it was

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
the cam seal so I looked at that it was
dry<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> mean<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> brand<00:00:59.670> new<00:00:59.789> cam<00:01:00.149> seal

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
dry I mean it's a brand new cam seal

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.330 
dry I mean it's a brand new cam seal
this<00:01:00.780> engine<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.440> fact<00:01:01.680> has<00:01:01.829> we've<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.190> been

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
this engine in fact has we've just been

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
this engine in fact has we've just been
rebuilt<00:01:02.699> it's<00:01:03.239> only<00:01:03.390> has<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.719> 2,000<00:01:04.170> miles

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
rebuilt it's only has like 2,000 miles

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
rebuilt it's only has like 2,000 miles
on<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.090> um<00:01:06.890> we<00:01:07.890> may<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> looking<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.700> me<00:01:09.570> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
on it so um we may be looking at me it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.880 
on it so um we may be looking at me it
could<00:01:09.960> be<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.110> head<00:01:10.350> gasket<00:01:10.470> issue<00:01:12.890> what

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
could be a head gasket issue what

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.950 
could be a head gasket issue what
happened<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> engine<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.869> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
happened was I put the engine I put the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.620 
happened was I put the engine I put the
head<00:01:16.140> gasket<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.939> first<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> was

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
head gasket on first time when I was

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.920 
head gasket on first time when I was
rebuilding<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.210> backwards<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.190 
rebuilding it I put on backwards and I
talked<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> hit<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.979> down<00:01:23.030> backwards<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> I

backwards<00:01:47.790> position<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.360> may<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.659> done<00:01:48.960> a

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
backwards position I may have done a

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.100 
backwards position I may have done a
name<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> forum<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> gasket<00:01:50.820> somehow<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
name of the forum the gasket somehow you

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
name of the forum the gasket somehow you
know<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> may<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.439> crushed<00:01:52.890> part<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
know I may have crushed part of it and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.370 
know I may have crushed part of it and
one<00:01:54.210> part<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> or<00:01:54.780> something<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.200> know

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
one part of it or something I don't know

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.899 
one part of it or something I don't know
it<00:01:55.619> could<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> been<00:01:55.920> anything<00:01:56.250> but<00:01:56.520> maybe<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
it could have been anything but maybe I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.340 
it could have been anything but maybe I
didn't<00:01:57.240> work<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> head<00:01:57.869> bolts<00:01:58.170> down

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
didn't work it the head bolts down

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
didn't work it the head bolts down
enough<00:02:01.130> because<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:02.759> know<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.719> or

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
enough because I don't know what is or

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.289 
enough because I don't know what is or
maybe<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.259> block<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.680> not<00:02:04.829> true<00:02:05.310> maybe<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
maybe the block is not true maybe the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.479 
maybe the block is not true maybe the
block<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.659> uneven<00:02:07.320> in

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
block is uneven in

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.149 
block is uneven in
you<00:02:09.489> know<00:02:09.579> I<00:02:10.230> thought<00:02:11.230> I'd<00:02:11.409> checked<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.829> out<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:12.159 
you know I thought I'd checked it out to

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:19.020 
you know I thought I'd checked it out to
see<00:02:12.370> if<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.609> was<00:02:12.700> true<00:02:12.760> but<00:02:13.180> anyways<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:18.030> this

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
see if it was true but anyways this this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.979 
see if it was true but anyways this this
head<00:02:19.569> gasket<00:02:20.849> kind<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.999> peculiar<00:02:22.540> thing

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
head gasket kind of peculiar thing

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.610 
head gasket kind of peculiar thing
because<00:02:24.239> doesn't<00:02:25.239> show<00:02:25.750> any<00:02:25.989> signs<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.500> a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
because doesn't show any signs of a

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.789 
because doesn't show any signs of a
traditional<00:02:28.349> head<00:02:29.349> gasket<00:02:29.799> leak<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:31.239> oil<00:02:31.799> is

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
traditional head gasket leak the oil is

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.869 
traditional head gasket leak the oil is
perfectly<00:02:33.340> normal

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
perfectly normal

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.429 
perfectly normal
color<00:02:34.689> and<00:02:35.579> the<00:02:36.579> coolant<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.079> perfectly

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
color and the coolant is a perfectly

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:46.379 
color and the coolant is a perfectly
normal<00:02:39.120> color<00:02:40.120> as<00:02:40.329> well<00:02:42.120> nice<00:02:43.120> green<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:46.090> see

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
normal color as well nice green you see

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:54.599 
normal color as well nice green you see
there<00:02:46.599> it's<00:02:47.230> perfectly<00:02:47.769> normal<00:02:48.719> and<00:02:52.049> no<00:02:53.609> you

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
there it's perfectly normal and no you

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.220 
there it's perfectly normal and no you
know<00:02:54.699> maybe<00:02:54.879> it's<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.329> head<00:02:55.599> gasket<00:02:55.780> maybe

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
know maybe it's not a head gasket maybe

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.550 
know maybe it's not a head gasket maybe
I'm<00:02:56.469> thinking<00:02:56.650> wrong<00:02:57.040> but<00:02:58.230> maybe<00:02:59.230> someone

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
I'm thinking wrong but maybe someone

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.580 
I'm thinking wrong but maybe someone
could<00:02:59.739> tell<00:02:59.919> me<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.609> know<00:03:00.760> what<00:03:01.419> it<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.719> but<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
could tell me you know what it is but I

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.959 
could tell me you know what it is but I
think<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.040> know<00:03:03.129> maybe<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.579> not<00:03:03.699> a<00:03:03.730> head

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969 
think you know maybe it's not a head

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:10.140 
think you know maybe it's not a head
gasket<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:05.620> um<00:03:07.889> underneath<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.040> engine<00:03:09.280> as

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
gasket but um underneath the engine as

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.589 
gasket but um underneath the engine as
you<00:03:10.299> saw<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.659> the<00:03:10.719> first<00:03:10.900> video<00:03:13.169> you<00:03:14.169> saw<00:03:14.439> oil

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
you saw in the first video you saw oil

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.369 
you saw in the first video you saw oil
near<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.689> block<00:03:18.930> possible<00:03:19.930> that's<00:03:20.079> what<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
near the block possible that's what it

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.319 
near the block possible that's what it
is

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
is

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.339 
is
could<00:03:22.329> be<00:03:22.509> the<00:03:22.659> head<00:03:22.840> gasket<00:03:23.349> could<00:03:24.189> be

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
could be the head gasket could be

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.679 
could be the head gasket could be
anyways<00:03:28.680> I'm<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.519> don't<00:03:31.150> know<00:03:31.299> what<00:03:31.449> I'm<00:03:31.540> really

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
anyways I'm I don't know what I'm really

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.800 
anyways I'm I don't know what I'm really
gonna<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:32.169> right<00:03:32.409> now<00:03:33.509> probably<00:03:34.509> just<00:03:34.750> gonna

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
gonna do right now probably just gonna

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.929 
gonna do right now probably just gonna
torque<00:03:35.169> down<00:03:35.349> the<00:03:35.409> head<00:03:35.709> bolts<00:03:36.129> see<00:03:36.819> if

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:36.939 
torque down the head bolts see if

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.020 
torque down the head bolts see if
they're<00:03:37.180> right<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.310> go<00:03:39.310> from<00:03:39.519> there<00:03:39.699> and<00:03:39.729> see

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
they're right and go from there and see

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.069 
they're right and go from there and see
if<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.299> fixes<00:03:40.689> it<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.079> doesn't<00:03:41.319> fix<00:03:41.439> it<00:03:41.590> then

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
if it fixes it if it doesn't fix it then

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.879 
if it fixes it if it doesn't fix it then
you're<00:03:44.079> probably<00:03:44.169> gonna<00:03:44.409> have<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.590> take<00:03:44.799> the

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
you're probably gonna have to take the

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.849 
you're probably gonna have to take the
cylinder<00:03:45.189> head<00:03:45.430> off<00:03:45.459> which<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.650> kind<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.739> a

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
cylinder head off which is kind of a

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.469 
cylinder head off which is kind of a
pain<00:03:48.069> I'm<00:03:48.459> gonna<00:03:48.609> have<00:03:48.759> to<00:03:48.849> take<00:03:49.060> off<00:03:49.269> the

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:49.479 
pain I'm gonna have to take off the

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.520 
pain I'm gonna have to take off the
exhaust<00:03:50.079> manifold<00:03:50.799> intake<00:03:51.370> manifold

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
distributor power steering see I think

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.449 
distributor power steering see I think
the<00:03:57.370> alternator<00:03:57.939> to<00:03:58.299> not<00:03:58.780> wait<00:03:59.129> no<00:04:00.129> not<00:04:00.340> the

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the alternator to not wait no not the

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.899 
the alternator to not wait no not the

alternator but the power steering I mean

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.929 
alternator but the power steering I mean
it's<00:04:04.449> just<00:04:04.719> a<00:04:05.079> lot<00:04:05.229> of<00:04:05.259> work<00:04:05.560> probably<00:04:06.519> they

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
it's just a lot of work probably they

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.270 
it's just a lot of work probably they
are<00:04:06.969> -<00:04:08.189> it's<00:04:09.189> gonna<00:04:09.310> be<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.549> pain<00:04:10.439> yeah<00:04:11.439> I<00:04:11.620> can<00:04:12.129> do

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:15.969 
the work but it's just you know not

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.439 
the work but it's just you know not
nearly<00:04:16.299> as<00:04:16.510> bad<00:04:16.719> as<00:04:16.930> having<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.349> overhaul<00:04:18.070> it

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
nearly as bad as having to overhaul it

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.930 
nearly as bad as having to overhaul it
just<00:04:19.449> like<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.779> took<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.079> engine<00:04:20.320> out

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
just like it took the engine out

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.430 
just like it took the engine out
I<00:04:21.350> usually<00:04:22.350> put<00:04:22.680> new<00:04:22.890> parts<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:24.440> new

transmission<00:04:45.230> but<00:04:46.230> anyways<00:04:49.310> yeah<00:04:50.310> I<00:04:50.340> hope<00:04:50.850> I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
transmission but anyways yeah I hope I

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.840 
transmission but anyways yeah I hope I
don't<00:04:51.030> have<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.330> take<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:51.950> reinstall<00:04:52.950> you

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
don't have to take the reinstall you

don't have to take the reinstall you
know<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.420> head<00:04:54.600> gasket<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.380> hope<00:04:55.530> everything

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
know the head gasket I hope everything

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.370 
know the head gasket I hope everything
works<00:04:56.280> after<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.060> took<00:04:57.210> these<00:04:57.570> bolts<00:04:57.900> down<00:04:58.050> and

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380
