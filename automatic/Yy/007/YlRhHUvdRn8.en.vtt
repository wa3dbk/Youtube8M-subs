plucking pattern pretty simple

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.520 
plucking pattern pretty simple
it'll<00:02:13.130> be<00:02:13.280> plucking<00:02:13.850> using<00:02:14.209> these<00:02:15.019> bottom

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
it'll be plucking using these bottom

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
the I'll show you the plucking for the C

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:43.979 
the I'll show you the plucking for the C
chord<00:02:36.700> I'm<00:02:37.700> plucking<00:02:39.609> this<00:02:40.609> the<00:02:42.130> fifth<00:02:43.130> string

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989

third<00:02:47.130> string<00:02:47.630> first<00:02:48.630> string<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:57.209> reason

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
third string first string and the reason

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.059 
third string first string and the reason
why<00:02:57.630> I'm<00:02:57.750> plucking<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.410> string<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.920> bass

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
why I'm plucking this string is the bass

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.020 
why I'm plucking this string is the bass
nut<00:02:59.340> is<00:03:00.000> because<00:03:00.330> that's<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.810> lowest<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
nut is because that's the lowest the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.330 
nut is because that's the lowest the
lowest<00:03:03.060> note<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:04.290> I'm<00:03:04.530> actually<00:03:04.739> holding

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
down in this position it doesn't sound

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.530 
down in this position it doesn't sound
right<00:03:08.819> if<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.030> pluck<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:10.489> yeah<00:03:11.489> so

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:22.820 

that's<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.720> seat<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.819> G<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:22.500> top<00:03:22.680> is

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
that's the seat for the G the top is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.900 
that's the seat for the G the top is
gonna<00:03:22.950> be<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.220> bass<00:03:23.370> note<00:03:23.640> because<00:03:23.760> you're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
gonna be the bass note because you're

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.620 
gonna be the bass note because you're
actually<00:03:24.030> holding<00:03:24.450> down<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.840> top<00:03:25.019> string<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
actually holding down the top string and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:44.629 
actually holding down the top string and
again<00:03:28.730> six<00:03:29.900> two<00:03:30.900> three<00:03:32.000> one

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:56.250 

and<00:03:47.310> so<00:03:50.849> so<00:03:51.849> sound<00:03:52.150> goes<00:03:52.299> like<00:03:52.510> this<00:03:54.840> fall
