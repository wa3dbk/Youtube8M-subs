plays<00:02:08.110> pretty<00:02:08.470> well<00:02:08.710> with<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> analogs<00:02:09.429> I

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
plays pretty well with the analogs I

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.600 
plays pretty well with the analogs I
mean<00:02:10.179> with<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> d-pad<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.899> stuff<00:02:11.620> don't<00:02:12.490> have

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
mean with the d-pad and stuff don't have

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.990 
mean with the d-pad and stuff don't have
to<00:02:12.730> worry<00:02:12.820> about<00:02:12.880> any<00:02:13.120> buttons<00:02:13.540> getting<00:02:13.900> stuck

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
to worry about any buttons getting stuck

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.390 
to worry about any buttons getting stuck
but<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.120> does<00:02:16.330> play<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.900> good<00:02:17.970> with<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
but it does play pretty good with the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.180 
but it does play pretty good with the
buttons<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.140> yeah<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.890> cutout

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
buttons and yeah so we have the cutout
