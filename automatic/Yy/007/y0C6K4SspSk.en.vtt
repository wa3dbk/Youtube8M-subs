00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
instrument and that's one reason I think

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.150 
instrument and that's one reason I think
I<00:02:26.739> used<00:02:27.739> it<00:02:27.950> for<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:29.060> for<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.019> arrangement<00:02:30.950> I

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
I used it for the for the arrangement I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.130 
I used it for the for the arrangement I
think<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:34.299> artists<00:02:35.299> that<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.480> learned<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.959> lot

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
think the artists that I learned a lot

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.199 
think the artists that I learned a lot

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
from who didn't use the roads a lot but

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.530 
from who didn't use the roads a lot but
we<00:02:38.900> did<00:02:39.140> some<00:02:39.320> recordings<00:02:39.920> usually<00:02:40.400> like

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
we did some recordings usually like

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.160 
we did some recordings usually like

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
that's another thing after learn how to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400 
that's another thing after learn how to
do<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.670> how<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> coordinate<00:03:21.450> what<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.140> would

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
do is how to coordinate what I would

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.440
