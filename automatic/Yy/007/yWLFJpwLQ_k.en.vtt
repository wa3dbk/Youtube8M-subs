blame the Russian well during the Apollo
missions<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.530> Russians<00:01:13.920> were<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> bad<00:01:14.369> guys

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
missions the Russians were the bad guys

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.660 
missions the Russians were the bad guys
and<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.380> example<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.830> black<00:01:17.130> ops<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and like for example like black ops the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.870 
and like for example like black ops the
Russians<00:01:17.970> are<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> bad<00:01:18.390> guys<00:01:19.159> because<00:01:20.159> that's

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Russians are the bad guys because that's

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.510 
Russians are the bad guys because that's
who<00:01:21.270> were<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.750> war<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.590> mean<00:01:23.250> during

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
who were we're at war with I mean during

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.890 
who were we're at war with I mean during
World<00:01:23.729> War<00:01:23.820> two<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.030> Russians<00:01:24.450> for<00:01:24.570> good<00:01:24.689> guys

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
World War two the Russians for good guys

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
World War two the Russians for good guys
that's<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> story<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.979> compelling<00:01:26.490> but

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that's the story that is compelling but

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.580 
that's the story that is compelling but
the<00:01:27.420> reason<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> Russians<00:01:28.020> are<00:01:28.049> always<00:01:28.380> bad

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
the reason the Russians are always bad

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
the reason the Russians are always bad
is<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.040> half<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.400> products<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:29.970> make

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
is because half the products we make

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.330 
is because half the products we make
yourself<00:01:30.570> cannot<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.079> sold<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.380> Russia<00:01:31.590> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
yourself cannot be sold in Russia so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890 
yourself cannot be sold in Russia so
instead<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> picking<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.329> country<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.750> we're

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
instead of picking a country that we're

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620 
instead of picking a country that we're
friendly<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.380> say<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> Chinese<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.420> can't

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
friendly with say the Chinese you can't

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
friendly with say the Chinese you can't

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
movie just as hopelessness about it I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.540 
movie just as hopelessness about it I
don't<00:03:16.740> think<00:03:16.950> any<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.160> them<00:03:17.250> are<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.490> to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
don't think any of them are going to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.510 
don't think any of them are going to
survive<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:19.110> think<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.740> fact<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.160> there<00:03:20.370> is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
survive and I think the fact is there is

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.040 
survive and I think the fact is there is
going<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> build<00:03:21.180> up<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.420> one<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.720> them<00:03:21.810> might

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
going to build up to one of them might

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.210 
going to build up to one of them might
survive<00:03:23.300> but<00:03:24.500> it's<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.950> atmosphere

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
survive but it's just the atmosphere

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.040 
survive but it's just the atmosphere
just<00:03:26.700> being<00:03:27.030> there<00:03:27.180> i<00:03:27.210> love<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.810> that
