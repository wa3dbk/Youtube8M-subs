00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
through to here we want to make this
solid<00:01:09.229> what<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.440> do<00:01:10.619> now<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:11.869> also

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
solid what I'm gonna do now is also

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.310 
solid what I'm gonna do now is also
working<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.710> direction<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.910> I<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:16.080> fur

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
working the direction if I see the fur

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.990 
working the direction if I see the fur
lying<00:01:16.649> in<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.399> bottom<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.759> be<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
lying in down the bottom would be the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
lying in down the bottom would be the
same<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.750> I'm<00:01:18.810> coming<00:01:19.020> away<00:01:19.350> rather<00:01:19.920> than

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
same so I'm coming away rather than

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
same so I'm coming away rather than
doing<00:01:20.460> anything<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.910> this<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:22.020> might<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
doing anything like this it might be

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.899 
doing anything like this it might be
easier<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:22.770> do<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.190> it's<00:01:25.729> it's<00:01:26.729> not

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
easier to do it that way it's it's not

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
easier to do it that way it's it's not
the<00:01:27.060> way<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> want<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.470> I'm<00:01:28.530> gonna

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.420 
the way I want to do it so I'm gonna
bring<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> back

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
and I will continue that until this is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.170

using<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.560> point<00:03:00.769> I'm<00:03:00.859> twisting<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> pencil

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
using the point I'm twisting the pencil

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.430 
using the point I'm twisting the pencil
as<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:01.849> do<00:03:01.909> it<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:03.560> allows<00:03:03.859> me<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:05.290> retain<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
as I do it that allows me to retain the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.800 
as I do it that allows me to retain the
point<00:03:09.549> that's<00:03:10.549> all<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.879> want<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.150> do<00:03:11.269> just<00:03:11.480> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
point that's all I want to do just a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:22.690 
point that's all I want to do just a
little<00:03:20.109> then<00:03:21.109> we<00:03:21.139> need<00:03:21.379> to<00:03:21.530> put<00:03:22.190> some<00:03:22.400> shading

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
little then we need to put some shading

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.180 
little then we need to put some shading
in<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:26.810> most<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.739> paper<00:03:28.430> now<00:03:29.319> has<00:03:30.319> been

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
in if most of the paper now has been

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.789 
in if most of the paper now has been
filled<00:03:31.459> in<00:03:31.609> it's<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.419> the<00:03:32.810> odd<00:03:33.199> little<00:03:33.620> bit

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
filled in it's just the odd little bit

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.400 
filled in it's just the odd little bit
of<00:03:34.459> paper<00:03:35.030> shining<00:03:35.389> through<00:03:35.629> like<00:03:35.870> just<00:03:36.199> there

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
of paper shining through like just there

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.680 
of paper shining through like just there
and<00:03:36.769> just<00:03:36.889> there<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.180> don't<00:03:38.239> mind<00:03:38.599> that

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and just there and I don't mind that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.770 
and just there and I don't mind that
because<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.139> can<00:03:39.319> just<00:03:39.530> pick<00:03:39.859> up<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.510> little<00:03:41.510> bit

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
because I can just pick up a little bit

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.059 
because I can just pick up a little bit
stronger<00:03:42.169> color<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:44.540> will<00:03:45.109> fade<00:03:45.410> away<00:03:45.440> that

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
stronger color that will fade away that

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.369 
stronger color that will fade away that
of<00:03:46.250> mouth<00:03:46.519> so<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.599> can<00:03:47.750> taper<00:03:48.109> that<00:03:48.139> out<00:03:50.379> now

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
of mouth so we can taper that out now

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.099 
of mouth so we can taper that out now
because<00:03:51.500> on<00:03:51.980> this<00:03:52.160> particular<00:03:52.519> picture<00:03:53.109> as

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
because on this particular picture as

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:59.339 
because on this particular picture as
it's<00:03:54.440> a<00:03:54.560> starter<00:03:54.949> pack<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.819> a<00:03:56.540> simple<00:03:57.280> subject

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
it's a starter pack and a simple subject

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.259 
it's a starter pack and a simple subject
we've<00:04:00.349> kept<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.889> pencils<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.940> minimum

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
we've kept to the pencils to a minimum

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.930 
we've kept to the pencils to a minimum
so<00:04:02.419> I've<00:04:02.510> only<00:04:02.599> got<00:04:02.810> six<00:04:03.519> on<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.549> picture<00:04:04.849> of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
so I've only got six on a picture of

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.659 
so I've only got six on a picture of
this<00:04:05.060> kind<00:04:05.419> I<00:04:05.690> could<00:04:06.620> use<00:04:06.799> as<00:04:06.980> many<00:04:07.160> as<00:04:07.340> 20

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
this kind I could use as many as 20

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.710 
this kind I could use as many as 20
colors<00:04:08.199> but<00:04:09.199> that<00:04:09.319> would<00:04:09.440> be<00:04:09.560> very<00:04:09.680> confusing

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
colors but that would be very confusing

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.039 
colors but that would be very confusing
which<00:04:11.720> means<00:04:12.019> that<00:04:12.639> when<00:04:13.639> I<00:04:13.720> want<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.810> shade

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
which means that when I want to shade

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.469 
which means that when I want to shade
much<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.709> normally<00:04:16.190> situation<00:04:16.789> I'll<00:04:16.940> use<00:04:17.449> a

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
much a normally situation I'll use a

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.219 
much a normally situation I'll use a
grey<00:04:17.810> here<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.320> have<00:04:19.099> to<00:04:19.220> use<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.579> colors<00:04:20.229> it's

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
grey here I have to use the colors it's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.759 
grey here I have to use the colors it's
okay

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
okay

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.790 
okay
it<00:04:22.130> still<00:04:22.340> works<00:04:22.520> well<00:04:24.970> so<00:04:25.970> I've<00:04:26.120> got<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.800> I'm

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
it still works well so I've got that I'm

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.880 
it still works well so I've got that I'm
using<00:04:28.010> my<00:04:29.110> 187

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.190 

all<00:04:33.890> righty<00:04:34.100> okay<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.210> won't<00:04:35.390> continue

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.120 

all<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.230> way<00:04:39.410> around<00:04:39.680> here<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:42.130> what

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
all the way around here but that what

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.520 
all the way around here but that what
I'm<00:04:43.220> also<00:04:43.370> going<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:43.730> do<00:04:43.850> is<00:04:43.880> usually<00:04:46.270> 176<00:04:47.530> and

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
I'm also going to do is usually 176 and

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.030 
I'm also going to do is usually 176 and
this<00:04:48.830> will<00:04:49.100> allow<00:04:49.340> me<00:04:49.550> just<00:04:49.700> to<00:04:50.770> it's<00:04:51.770> all<00:04:51.980> of

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
this will allow me just to it's all of

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.780 
this will allow me just to it's all of
us<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:53.660> gives<00:04:53.810> me<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.050> gray<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:55.100> not<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> gray<00:04:55.580> of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
us it gives me a gray it's not a gray of

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.630 
us it gives me a gray it's not a gray of
course<00:04:56.060> is<00:04:56.240> in<00:04:56.390> combi<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.830> by<00:04:58.040> putting<00:04:58.400> it<00:04:58.520> in

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
course is in combi but by putting it in

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.190 
course is in combi but by putting it in
as<00:04:59.240> I'm<00:04:59.450> doing<00:04:59.720> now

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
as I'm doing now

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.420 
as I'm doing now
especially<00:05:00.740> around<00:05:00.830> there<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:03.740> gives<00:05:03.980> me<00:05:04.190> a

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
especially around there it gives me a

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.500 
especially around there it gives me a
shading<00:05:05.240> which<00:05:05.450> is<00:05:05.600> perfectly<00:05:06.080> acceptable

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
shading which is perfectly acceptable

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.510 
shading which is perfectly acceptable
your<00:05:08.510> mouth<00:05:09.970> and<00:05:10.970> have<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.240> do<00:05:11.360> too<00:05:11.570> much<00:05:11.750> there

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
your mouth and have to do too much there

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.130 
your mouth and have to do too much there
and<00:05:13.520> I'm<00:05:13.790> very<00:05:14.060> conscious<00:05:14.390> from<00:05:14.630> there<00:05:14.810> that

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
and I'm very conscious from there that

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.130 
and I'm very conscious from there that
be<00:05:15.290> here<00:05:16.010> we<00:05:16.730> come<00:05:16.970> if<00:05:17.180> we<00:05:17.330> put<00:05:17.510> it<00:05:17.630> just<00:05:17.780> a<00:05:17.900> line

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.140 
be here we come if we put it just a line

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.940 
be here we come if we put it just a line
in<00:05:18.410> there<00:05:18.620> it's<00:05:19.130> going<00:05:19.370> to<00:05:19.490> look<00:05:19.640> rather<00:05:20.360> odd

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
in there it's going to look rather odd

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.710 
in there it's going to look rather odd
as<00:05:21.950> it<00:05:22.100> is<00:05:22.250> in<00:05:22.400> with<00:05:22.610> these<00:05:22.760> little<00:05:23.120> whisker

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
as it is in with these little whisker

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.070 
as it is in with these little whisker
holes<00:05:24.040> so<00:05:25.040> we<00:05:25.070> kind<00:05:25.520> of<00:05:25.670> to<00:05:26.570> be<00:05:26.600> conscious<00:05:27.050> of

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
holes so we kind of to be conscious of

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.830 
holes so we kind of to be conscious of
the<00:05:27.260> fact<00:05:27.290> that<00:05:27.560> what<00:05:27.740> we're<00:05:27.890> doing<00:05:28.010> is

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.600 

putting<00:05:33.580> developing<00:05:34.580> fur<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:37.130> you<00:05:37.220> can<00:05:37.370> see

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
putting developing fur and you can see

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.440 
putting developing fur and you can see
that<00:05:38.470> that's<00:05:39.470> working<00:05:39.740> well<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.970> here<00:05:41.210> just

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
that that's working well and here just

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.660 
that that's working well and here just
grade<00:05:41.960> that<00:05:42.260> out<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.470> little<00:05:42.710> bit<00:05:42.860> so<00:05:42.950> we<00:05:43.910> get<00:05:44.060> a

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
grade that out a little bit so we get a

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:54.300 
grade that out a little bit so we get a
better<00:05:50.020> effect

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.470 

that's<00:05:55.000> good<00:05:55.240> and<00:05:55.720> just<00:05:55.960> just<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.620> smidgen<00:05:57.160> here

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
that's good and just just a smidgen here
