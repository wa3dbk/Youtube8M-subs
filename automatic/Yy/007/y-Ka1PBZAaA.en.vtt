00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.630 
and how long do they have to take the
pills<00:02:09.810> for<00:02:10.020> they<00:02:10.530> did<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.039> 12<00:02:11.340> weeks

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
pills for they did it for 12 weeks

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.300 
pills for they did it for 12 weeks
owners<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.530> want<00:02:13.740> yes<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.220> guys

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
owners that you want yes you guys

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.600 
owners that you want yes you guys
interested<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.760> this

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.050 

this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.600> raw<00:02:19.810> material<00:02:20.440> for<00:02:20.650> coffee<00:02:21.460> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
this is the raw material for coffee that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.310 
this is the raw material for coffee that
we<00:02:22.120> drink<00:02:22.390> why<00:02:22.540> would<00:02:22.750> just<00:02:22.960> drinking<00:02:23.290> coffee

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
we drink why would just drinking coffee

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.740 
we drink why would just drinking coffee
do<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.950> yeah<00:02:24.340> because<00:02:24.640> when<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.480> coffee

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
do this yeah because when the coffee

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.720 
do this yeah because when the coffee
that<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.200> drank<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.830> roasted<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.490> when<00:02:27.610> they

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that we drank is roasted and when they

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.140 
that we drank is roasted and when they
roast<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.210> they<00:02:28.360> roasted<00:02:28.810> at<00:02:28.950> 475<00:02:30.150> degrees

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.140 
roast it they roasted at 475 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:02:32.110> so<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:32.980> changes<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.400> color<00:02:33.700> turns

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.270 
Fahrenheit so it changes the color turns
brown<00:02:34.480> changes<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.140> aroma<00:02:35.500> changes<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
brown changes the aroma changes the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.190 
brown changes the aroma changes the
taste<00:02:36.610> changes<00:02:36.910> everything<00:02:37.480> but<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> most

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
taste changes everything but the most

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.170 
taste changes everything but the most
important<00:02:38.860> thing<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.100> does<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.790> removes

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
important thing it does is it removes

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.440 
important thing it does is it removes
the<00:02:40.570> chlorogenic<00:02:41.050> acid<00:02:41.920> that's<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.970> key<00:02:43.210> to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.449 
the chlorogenic acid that's the key to
what<00:02:43.630> we're<00:02:43.810> talking<00:02:44.230> about<00:02:44.320> today<00:02:44.709> so<00:02:45.370> how

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
what we're talking about today so how

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.090 
what we're talking about today so how
does<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.640> work<00:02:45.700> well<00:02:46.690> it's<00:02:47.020> amazing<00:02:47.260> it's<00:02:47.920> what

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
does it work well it's amazing it's what

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.920 
does it work well it's amazing it's what
we<00:02:48.190> call<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.400> triple<00:02:48.670> threat<00:02:48.850> okay

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
we call a triple threat okay

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.540 
we call a triple threat okay
and<00:02:50.020> it's<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.410> chlorogenic<00:02:50.770> acid<00:02:51.430> that

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
and it's the chlorogenic acid that

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.190 
and it's the chlorogenic acid that
causes<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:52.090> effect<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.690> works<00:02:52.870> three

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
causes the effect and it works three

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.980 
causes the effect and it works three
ways<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.650> first<00:02:53.860> way<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:55.150> goes<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.870> it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
ways the first way is it goes in and it

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.710 
ways the first way is it goes in and it
causes<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.680> body<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.160> burn<00:02:57.400> glucose<00:02:58.090> or<00:02:58.330> sugar

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
causes the body to burn glucose or sugar

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.170 
causes the body to burn glucose or sugar
and<00:02:58.930> burn<00:02:59.650> fat<00:02:59.980> namely<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> liver<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
and burn fat namely in the liver the

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
and burn fat namely in the liver the
second<00:03:01.989> way<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> most<00:03:02.650> important<00:03:03.070> way<00:03:03.190> is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
second way and the most important way is

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750 
second way and the most important way is
it<00:03:03.880> slows<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.720> release<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.380> sugar<00:03:05.730> into<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
it slows the release of sugar into the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.150 
it slows the release of sugar into the
bloodstream<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:08.230> when<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.500> don't<00:03:08.739> have<00:03:08.890> sugar

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.070 
bloodstream so when you don't have sugar
building<00:03:09.640> up<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:09.910> bloodstream<00:03:10.360> you<00:03:10.840> don't

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
building up in the bloodstream you don't

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.650 
building up in the bloodstream you don't
have<00:03:11.320> fat<00:03:11.650> building<00:03:12.130> up<00:03:12.250> because<00:03:12.580> sugar<00:03:12.940> turns

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
have fat building up because sugar turns

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.340 
have fat building up because sugar turns
to<00:03:14.050> fat<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.530> everybody<00:03:14.980> must<00:03:15.520> remember<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
to fat and everybody must remember that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.470 
to fat and everybody must remember that
when<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.440> two<00:03:17.650> are<00:03:17.800> combined<00:03:18.310> together<00:03:18.580> you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
when the two are combined together you

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.810 
when the two are combined together you
get<00:03:19.660> this<00:03:19.900> synergistic<00:03:20.560> effect<00:03:21.220> that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
get this synergistic effect that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.600 
get this synergistic effect that
basically<00:03:22.420> burns<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:23.049> blocks<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:23.709> stops<00:03:24.130> fat

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.830 
basically burns in blocks and stops fat
but<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.600> also<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:26.640> natural<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:27.820> safe<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.630> folks

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
but it also is natural and safe to folks

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.530 
but it also is natural and safe to folks
have<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.140> take<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.470> order<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.680> get<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.920> benefit

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
have to take in order to get the benefit

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.390 
have to take in order to get the benefit
800<00:03:31.540> milligrams<00:03:32.019> twice<00:03:32.290> a<00:03:32.440> day<00:03:32.739> and<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.250> want

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
800 milligrams twice a day and you want

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.030 
800 milligrams twice a day and you want
to<00:03:33.489> take<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.820> before<00:03:34.030> meals<00:03:34.959> about<00:03:35.410> 30<00:03:35.709> minutes

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
to take it before meals about 30 minutes

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.460 
to take it before meals about 30 minutes
before<00:03:36.160> with<00:03:36.549> a<00:03:36.580> large<00:03:36.880> glass<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.450> water<00:03:37.780> and

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
before with a large glass of water and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.770 
before with a large glass of water and
it<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.730> right<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.480> it's

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
it just it looks like this right so it's

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.150 
it just it looks like this right so it's
counseling<00:03:41.320> capsule<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:41.860> you're<00:03:41.950> not<00:03:42.010> gonna

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
counseling capsule so you're not gonna

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.620 
counseling capsule so you're not gonna
take<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.519> actual<00:03:42.760> beam<00:03:42.970> you're<00:03:43.150> not<00:03:43.239> having<00:03:43.570> a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
take the actual beam you're not having a

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.840 
take the actual beam you're not having a
coffee<00:03:43.870> variant<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.370> probably<00:03:45.670> wouldn't

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.699 
coffee variant it probably wouldn't
taste<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.120> great<00:03:46.239> anyway<00:03:46.690> so<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.320> capsules

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
taste that great anyway so the capsules

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.949 
taste that great anyway so the capsules
you<00:03:47.769> can<00:03:47.920> buy<00:03:48.070> where<00:03:48.459> you<00:03:48.730> buy<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:48.940> online<00:03:49.150> you

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
you can buy where you buy it online you

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.479 
you can buy where you buy it online you
want<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.140> make<00:03:50.320> sure<00:03:50.350> that<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:50.860> is<00:03:51.040> important

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
want to make sure that this is important

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.310 
want to make sure that this is important
