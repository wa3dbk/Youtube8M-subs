00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.670 
piccolo all right
so<00:02:00.950> open<00:02:01.950> these<00:02:02.040> up<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:02.730> I<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.300> they<00:02:03.680> said

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
so open these up now I know they said

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.780 
so open these up now I know they said
they<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.070> at<00:02:05.220> random<00:02:07.040> but<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.100> believe<00:02:08.430> the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
they are at random but I believe the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.180 
they are at random but I believe the
personality<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:10.110> from<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.710> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
personality that you get from there the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.770 
personality that you get from there the
structure<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.790> focused<00:02:12.180> more<00:02:12.300> towards<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.840> so

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
structure is focused more towards it so

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.369 
structure is focused more towards it so
we<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.650> piccolo
