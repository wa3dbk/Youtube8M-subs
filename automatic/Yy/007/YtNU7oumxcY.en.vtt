 in a bowl he quoted before 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.270
 to see if it is in good condition 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.560

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.759
 put water but preferably milk 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.150

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.370

 hot how long do I watch them 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.210
 I recommend preheating the pan 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.250
 about seven minutes earlier if you do not 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.290
 preheat in the heat is not going to 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.210
 distribute evenly and it's 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.190
 when the cupcake is a little golden 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.300
 one side and the other side of others we describe 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.940
 that is parejito we are going to put oil or 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.420
 butter what you want with a 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.740
 napkin so that it does not go to 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.900
 paste 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.810

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.740

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.070
 with a spoon we will distribute 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.620
 so that it is redondito 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.290
 let's give it a minute so that it 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 cook so that it is done 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.480
 perfectly and what while 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.310
 you make good is to beat the cheese 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.940
