developers<00:02:35.019> are<00:02:35.380> able<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:35.800> do<00:02:36.180> well<00:02:37.180> for

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
developers are able to do well for

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.839 
developers are able to do well for
themselves<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:38.650> not<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.920> bad<00:02:39.160> idea<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.700> learn

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
themselves it's not a bad idea to learn

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.089 
themselves it's not a bad idea to learn
how<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> code<00:02:40.450> if<00:02:40.959> you're<00:02:41.560> serious<00:02:42.040> about

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
how to code if you're serious about

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.039 
how to code if you're serious about
making<00:02:42.370> some<00:02:42.700> extra<00:02:42.819> money<00:02:43.030> online<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.930> then

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
making some extra money online and then

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.270 
making some extra money online and then
you<00:02:44.170> can<00:02:44.290> bid<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.470> these<00:02:44.680> higher<00:02:44.950> paying

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
you can bid on these higher paying

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.339 
you can bid on these higher paying
really<00:02:45.790> high<00:02:46.060> demand<00:02:46.299> available<00:02:46.930> jobs<00:02:47.170> so

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
really high demand available jobs so

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.839 
really high demand available jobs so
there's<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.739> not<00:02:47.890> enough<00:02:47.950> programmers<00:02:48.670> all

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
there's just not enough programmers all

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.390 
there's just not enough programmers all
around<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.170> anyway<00:02:50.410> let's<00:02:50.739> say<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:50.920> don't

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
around so anyway let's say you don't

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.830 
around so anyway let's say you don't
really<00:02:51.549> have<00:02:51.760> any<00:02:51.970> skills<00:02:52.299> but<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.630> want<00:02:52.780> to
