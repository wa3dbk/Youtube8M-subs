00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.140
 during the summer season fell in the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 silvretta montafon regularly mountains 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 Exercises on different 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.700
 lift facilities instead 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.190
 so that all employees for the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.609
 If necessary, the train is ready 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.199
 once stands and nothing works 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.689
 Today is an exercise below the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 Walliser train mountain station to the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.609
 Exercise is very simple 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 ground on the car rested him 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.580
 forced or over the elderly too 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.679
 consequences 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.750
 on the part of the authorities there are the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.820
 default that a cable car within 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.040
 three and a half hours must be cleared 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.290
 you read it two years ago 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 great exercise peter nowak with bergrettung 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.149
 fire department and all German as if he 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.280
 fully occupied track of my view 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.710
 do that in three stages and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.710
 vacated light to have to have much 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 league match team practice a lot around before 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 aste of all 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.710
 manager because it gives the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 possibility that you operate the goods 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.190
 brings and then should not be there too much 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 a lot of time pass that one 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090
 actually vineyards can start 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.590
 equipment the rescuer will be in such 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.360
 sealed boxes on three 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.460
 different places amberg 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.710
 Keep everything the same 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.970
 is at hand 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 besides, it is important that everyone 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.500
 Railway staff always up to date 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.659
 knowledge and processes for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.150
 the emergency can be optimized 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.270
 the rescuers are at any time of the exercise 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.549
 doubly secured this happens here in 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 15 meters in height and under the strict 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.840
 eyes of georg wachter of the security 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.400
 confidant of the in boards montafon 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.380
 nothing escapes 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.229
 even if the rescuer for the first time in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.880
 use is like here christoph fit yes 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 I organize the whole year anyway 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.040
 that actually lures regular exercises 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.720
 take place because more 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.880
 by the authority have one annually 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.100
 prescribed and that is on and for 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.320
 have little or no people 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 even a little routine and the routine 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.830
 there is only practice with sixth christoph 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.420
 looking forward to security but if you 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.090
 if you look a bit finger 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.580
 after all that is an activity or where 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.810
 actually the heavy who weighs 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.340
 until deadly injuries happen 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.430
 if that does not fit or that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.650
 every handle fit and fit that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.600
 without the one you practice and and one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.330
 beginner of course you change or 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.709
 another attack and attack 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.350
 there you look at that too 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.540
 while practicing is accident free and still the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.760
 routine because seriousness should come 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.980
 which one does not hope or that in there 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.350
 Just go through the routine for the first one 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.950
 it has the 22 year old but good 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.440
 made 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.200
 the effect of such a height should be 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 one should not underestimate the vile memory there 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.620
 he lies himself and hears you and the logger 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.510
 that guest musicians make sense and just stop 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.720
 safety is the highest bid, the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.690
 show so in class just have it easy 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.510
 and the mazda with the simple must 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.790
 Consumers on the way back and 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.610
 it's just about reciprocity 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.950
 the exact procedure works like 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.989
 The rescuer comes from the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.530
 nearest support medium pulley 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.260
 driving to the gondola opens the door and 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.180
 slowly paying off to the guests 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 then with the help of a specific 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.130
 dishes and a helper at the foot of the 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.780
 gondola with the rope from left until it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.590
 again firm ground under the feet 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.840
 to have 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.330
 the rescuer then climbs again 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.070
 the gondola to either the next 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.530
 to save people from rolling 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.360
 or how to break down everything here and yourself 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.850
 to rappel yourself 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.160
 daniel vinegar has such an exercise already 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.560
 made more often and the task sovereign 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.240
 solved 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.310
 permanently it is very important and is 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.200
 very good that we also have those wire ropes 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.300
 and switched her translate he will 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.880
 more and more experienced it is just a lot 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.600
 Cliffs where you have and it's easy 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.840
 as a rescuer 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.750
 Seeger was hunger-hunger and likely 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.160
 The more adventurous it gets 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.630
 grow faster and blasted 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.420
 everyone will relax again if 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.670
 I mean art was said that 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.300
 the tuscany who owns more work 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.390
 himself who roll with the message 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.579
 So with a great team and are 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.890
 really glad that it is a sport itself 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.230
 certainly also hides the 53 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.300
 year old georg wacker is satisfied like 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.880
 Almost everywhere in life is also here 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.010
 Exercise makes the champion and hopefully 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.660
 the savior of the silvretta needed 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.680
 Montafon you can 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.680
 for the serious
