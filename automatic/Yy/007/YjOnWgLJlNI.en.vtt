I'm excited to release a tutorial so

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.010 
I'm excited to release a tutorial so
most<00:00:32.309> magicians<00:00:32.640> know<00:00:32.940> how<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.120> gamble<00:00:33.300> they

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
most magicians know how to gamble they

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
most magicians know how to gamble they
might<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.559> how<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.800> put<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.190> practice

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
might not know how to put it in practice

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.050 
might not know how to put it in practice
but<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.500> methods<00:00:37.920> behind<00:00:38.130> how<00:00:39.000> to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.060 
but they know the methods behind how to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.190 
but they know the methods behind how to
cheat<00:00:39.660> at<00:00:39.780> cards

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
cheat at cards

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.190 
cheat at cards
and<00:00:41.060> 95%<00:00:42.060> of<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> time<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.720> happens<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
and 95% of the time that happens in the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 
and 95% of the time that happens in the
dealer's<00:00:43.530> hand<00:00:43.740> so<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> dealer<00:00:44.400> has<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.790> have

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
dealer's hand so the dealer has to have

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
dealer's hand so the dealer has to have
contact<00:00:45.330> with<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> rest<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> deck<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.560> is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
contact with the rest of the deck he is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.500 
contact with the rest of the deck he is
to<00:00:46.770> shuffle<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.340> stack<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.880> cards<00:00:48.060> and<00:00:48.390> then

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
to shuffle and stack the cards and then

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.640 
to shuffle and stack the cards and then
deal<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:50.820> good<00:00:51.660> hands<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> partner

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
deal the the good hands to the partner

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.270 
deal the the good hands to the partner
and<00:00:52.829> himself

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and himself

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
and himself
so<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> cheating<00:00:54.060> really<00:00:54.360> does<00:00:54.540> occur<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so the cheating really does occur in the

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100 
so the cheating really does occur in the
dealing<00:00:55.980> process<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.120> did<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> know<00:00:57.870> there's

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
dealing process but did you know there's

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.600 
dealing process but did you know there's
a<00:00:58.170> new<00:00:58.380> method<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.890> which<00:00:59.040> you<00:00:59.220> can<00:00:59.370> cheat

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
a new method in which you can cheat

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.520 
a new method in which you can cheat
without<00:01:00.300> touching<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> cards<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.230> even

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
without touching the cards and even

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
without touching the cards and even
after<00:01:01.860> all<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.220> hands<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> been<00:01:02.940> dealt<00:01:03.470> now

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
after all the hands have been dealt now

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.160 
after all the hands have been dealt now
that<00:01:04.619> sounds<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.009> very<00:01:05.899> strange<00:01:06.899> concept

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that sounds like a very strange concept

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.870 
that sounds like a very strange concept
across<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:07.740> let<00:01:08.340> me<00:01:08.430> give<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.729> an<00:01:08.790> example

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
across but let me give you an example

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
across but let me give you an example
that's<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.049> idea<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.470> aces<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> gambler

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that's the idea for aces and the gambler

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940 
that's the idea for aces and the gambler
initially<00:01:12.170> wanted<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> deal<00:01:13.470> himself<00:01:13.800> four

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
initially wanted to deal himself four

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.390 
initially wanted to deal himself four
aces

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
aces

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.990 
aces
but<00:01:14.670> finalists<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.680> he<00:01:16.680> dealt<00:01:16.950> one<00:01:17.400> ace<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
but finalists take he dealt one ace to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600 
but finalists take he dealt one ace to
each<00:01:18.300> of<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> players<00:01:18.930> including<00:01:19.290> himself<00:01:19.710> so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
each of the players including himself so

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.210 
each of the players including himself so
now<00:01:20.790> he<00:01:21.150> wants<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> Aces<00:01:22.770> back<00:01:23.070> to

conclusion<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:16.370> obviously<00:03:17.370> he's<00:03:17.760> cheating

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
conclusion that obviously he's cheating

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.610 
conclusion that obviously he's cheating
he<00:03:18.150> stole<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> Aces<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:18.990> we<00:03:19.110> don't<00:03:19.320> want<00:03:19.500> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
he stole the Aces so we don't want that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.180 
he stole the Aces so we don't want that
to<00:03:19.800> happen

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
to happen

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.610 
to happen
so<00:03:20.850> instead<00:03:21.360> what<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> card<00:03:22.080> shot<00:03:22.260> would<00:03:22.410> do

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so instead what the card shot would do

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.650 
so instead what the card shot would do
is<00:03:22.800> instead<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.550> switching<00:03:23.850> history<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
is instead of switching history and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.200 
is instead of switching history and
different<00:03:24.990> cards<00:03:25.350> with<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.160> other<00:03:26.970> three

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
different cards with the other three

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.970 
different cards with the other three
aces<00:03:27.360> he<00:03:27.990> could<00:03:28.140> deal<00:03:28.290> himself<00:03:28.680> an<00:03:28.770> even

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
aces he could deal himself an even

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.810 
aces he could deal himself an even
better<00:03:29.220> him<00:03:29.690> namely<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:31.050> royal<00:03:32.120> flush<00:03:33.120> now<00:03:34.820> at

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
better him namely a royal flush now at

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.370 
better him namely a royal flush now at
this<00:03:35.910> point<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.270> is<00:03:36.330> very<00:03:36.720> good<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.170> it's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
this point this is very good but it's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.010 
this point this is very good but it's
not<00:03:37.560> over<00:03:37.980> yet<00:03:38.010> now<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.150> games<00:03:39.330> not<00:03:39.630> not

just<00:03:40.050> poker<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.620> don't<00:03:40.800> just<00:03:40.950> play<00:03:41.160> one<00:03:41.460> round

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
just poker you don't just play one round

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.590 
just poker you don't just play one round
so<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.270> must<00:03:42.660> set<00:03:43.020> up<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.100> cards<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:45.270> play<00:03:45.450> for

so you must set up the cards to play for

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.000 
so you must set up the cards to play for
the<00:03:45.660> next<00:03:45.810> round<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.260> can't<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.590> steal<00:03:46.709> only

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the next round you can't just steal only

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.470 
the next round you can't just steal only
one<00:03:47.190> good<00:03:47.400> hand<00:03:47.580> for<00:03:47.640> one<00:03:47.850> round<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.240> want

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
one good hand for one round if you want

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.320

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
to continue to earn money so you need to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.120 
to continue to earn money so you need to
know<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.690> exact<00:03:52.050> positions<00:03:52.650> are<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.950> good

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
know the exact positions are the good
