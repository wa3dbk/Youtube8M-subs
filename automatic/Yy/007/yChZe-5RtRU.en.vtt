00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
mail today this is the seam safety valve

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.029 
mail today this is the seam safety valve
and<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.570> really<00:00:16.109> neat<00:00:16.320> because<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.890> go

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
and it's really neat because it can go

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.689 
and it's really neat because it can go
from<00:00:18.949> go<00:00:19.949> from<00:00:20.130> 5<00:00:20.400> psi<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.260> 250<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.340> really

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
from go from 5 psi to 250 so it's really

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.609 
from go from 5 psi to 250 so it's really
adjustable<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.630> towards<00:00:25.140> perfect<00:00:25.529> for
