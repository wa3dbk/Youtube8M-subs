00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.030
 autumn is coming it's time to think about 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.590
 tom how to dress up cool time 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.360
 years here and against this decided such 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 make a small video reviewer 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.630
 tell about the jacket patriot company 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.430
 silicon that's what it is 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.430
 design features in brief about 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 all about this and so polestar material 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.550
 100% double fleece 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.570
 a density of 390 grams that's fine 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.460
 material retains body heat 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 provides air exchange drown from the inside 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.840
 excess couples output 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 effectively keeps body warm 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.190
 Now I construct the first thing we 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.559
 replace when we look specifically yet 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 I took such an olive color so that 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.989
 all Circuits here such were visible here 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.690
 This abundance of castles of any lightning here but 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.870
 each is not just like that each of them 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.430
 has its own direct purpose 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.670
 that's basically of course it's pockets in 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 difference consider this central lock 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 which everyone understands why they dressed 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.950
 attention on the left sleeve down a little higher 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.930
 wrists have such a small pocket 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:27.390
 somewhere here such a talk for small things 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.119
 fit perfectly here and 2 shoulder here 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.180
 also quite roomy plus is 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 whether more adjusted for spacious hands 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.650
 that is, in principle, there can be enough 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.290
 lot of things to put here we are or heavy 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.520
 and on the one and on the other hand there is 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.210
 such here velcro patches 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.369
 here you can attach some stripes 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.509
 what is here such here it is who has it 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.549
 how much fantasy is enough here 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:56.899
 the jacket below is governed by such 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.689
 puffs such an elastic court with 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.360
 fixer that is, we pulled up 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.430
 fixed everything is fine conveniently here 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.110
 two central parts on the chest 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 pockets here they are also on locks 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.890
 it seems to be at first unusual that they 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.690
 are here that is me such 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.210
 standard pockets like a jacket 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.680
 but during the operation understand that 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:24.060
 it is very, very convenient especially if 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.300
 when you are driving that is not 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.800
 you need to look for something somewhere down there 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.160
 here everything is always at hand 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.680
 even when walking something he is 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.010
 hands are always right here we are all very 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.800
 close here is a plus here still in the right 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.670
 there is such an inner pocket here 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.640
 bay here we can put 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.300
 easily some kind of a telephone of such medium 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.220
 sizes of phone mp3 player and plus more 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.630
 in addition there is such a way out here 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.570
 for the headset that is, we stretch 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.340
 headphones inside 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.459
 dress and listen to your music or else 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.430
 here is a collar enough here 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.989
 high he rests with us straight to 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.480
 parade with the top here here 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.830
 such a pad it closes the zipper 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.549
 Here we need nothing to rub and in 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.390
 principle for 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:20.670
 perfectly protect us from the wind 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.170
 cool weather here has become there some 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.150
 rain or cool i mean here's the hood 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.519
 cause the hood he is very comfortable head 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.500
 pny can twist as you like that is 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:34.140
 nothing constrains the movement he sits down 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.200
 excellent as the cap came coming here 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.299
 so not as usual patient so god 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.160
 plus there is a small visor that is 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.670
 if it rains or snows 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.489
 there is a street about us gets less like this 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.860
 he is regulated by puffing again too 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.049
 same such elastic cords plus 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.340
 clamps that is, we can like this 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.820
 easily pull up and all the hood here 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.820
 young 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.489
 there is also on the back of such 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:09.050
 specific pocket of 2 wavele Carl 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:10.940
 give dimon see through can you can it 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.530
 use like some kind of pocket for 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.910
 warehousing things that do not require 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.190
 emergency access ie we go there 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.380
 put some maybe card 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.739
 some notebook something else all that 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.150
 not too heavy here but of course 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.919
 It is mainly used for 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.180
 ventilation that is when we are active 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.820
 move that is, we become 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:35.300
 a little bit hot and there they opened 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:39.590
 the lower back and there is still such 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.350
 retirement that is, we cool the lower back 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.620
 but do not open it for drafts ie 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.110
 for the wind on the closed here is the tangent 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.740
 ventilation is also under the area 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.800
 underarms 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.540
 here are such scoops that is, again, we 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.880
 We start to overheat a little 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.220
 open these locks 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.310
 lightning stretch a little cold 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:06.310
 chilled everyone shut them down feel 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.530
 excellent move on like this 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.090
 cuffs are such a velcro panel and 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.830
 such a proprietary silicones ski tongue 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.220
 can also be adjusted in width 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.260
 we need to weaken weakened need 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.890
 tighten 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.890
 tightened too here just want to note 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.600
 more distinctive features namely 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.770
 original phones of these things 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.830
 must be present here on 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.120
 this rubber not frames 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:41.990
 logo of the manufacturers 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.320
 clip he's here left to the bottom too 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.229
 such a rubber patch 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.500
 sewn too with logo drinks and 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:54.950
 sure here on this one 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.130
 patches should be indicated what is it that 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.870
 This is a patriot and a label sticker should 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.600
 be surely flashed 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.410
 i.e. this is not some print there yet 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.870
 what it is 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.729
 sure that it should be flashed 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.039
 Well, in the fall 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.949
 such mild weather can be fine 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.330
 wear it in outerwear 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.150
 it gets colder it can be easily 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.770
 use as some 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.160
 wear casts some winter 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.590
 the jacket perfectly retains heat here or 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.080
 In principle, you will not name . 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.169
 Well, actually , that's all for this thanks for 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.169
 Attention
