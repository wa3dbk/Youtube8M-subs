00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.599 
load may extend in front of a car this
is<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> trick<00:00:25.920> question

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
is kind of a trick question

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.900 
is kind of a trick question
there's<00:00:27.090> no<00:00:27.269> answer<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:28.080> terms<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:29.189> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
there's no answer in terms of the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.479 
there's no answer in terms of the
distance<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.539> front<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> car<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
distance in front of the car because the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.000 
distance in front of the car because the
measurement<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> taken<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.469> front<00:00:34.770> edge

measurement is taken from the front edge
of<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> front<00:00:35.640> seat<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.899> load<00:00:37.230> can

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
of the front seat and your load can

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.700 
of the front seat and your load can
extend<00:00:38.390> three<00:00:39.390> meters<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.050> front<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.620> the

extend three meters in front of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
extend three meters in front of the
front<00:00:40.980> edge<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> front<00:00:41.670> seat<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.540> have

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
front edge of the front seat if you have

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.170 
front edge of the front seat if you have
a<00:00:42.719> very<00:00:42.960> long<00:00:43.170> bonnet<00:00:43.489> then<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.700> might<00:00:44.940> not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
a very long bonnet then that might not

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
a very long bonnet then that might not
be<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.390> five<00:00:45.750> front<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> car<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
be very five front of the car and if you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.040 
be very five front of the car and if you
have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.760> short<00:00:48.000> bonnet<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.899> it's

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
have a very short bonnet then it's

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
have a very short bonnet then it's
obviously<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> be<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.039> further<00:00:50.250> so

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
obviously going to be a lot further so

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
obviously going to be a lot further so
the<00:00:51.149> answer<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.809> question<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:53.039> three

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the answer to this question is be three

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
the answer to this question is be three
metres<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.090> front<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> front<00:00:54.809> edge<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
metres in front of the front edge at the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.000 
metres in front of the front edge at the
front<00:00:55.980> seat

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.700 

who<00:01:00.579> can<00:01:00.910> legally<00:01:01.180> stop<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.140> perform<00:01:02.649> a

legally stop you and perform a roadside
check<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.690> your<00:01:10.810> vehicle

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120 

what<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> maximum<00:01:16.350> legal<00:01:16.619> speed<00:01:16.829> limit

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
what is the maximum legal speed limit

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
what is the maximum legal speed limit
for<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.789> car<00:01:18.119> towing<00:01:18.539> a<00:01:18.750> trailer<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.350> open

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
for a car towing a trailer on the open

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.690 
for a car towing a trailer on the open
road<00:01:21.049> when<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.079> car<00:01:22.350> tows<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> trailer<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
road when a car tows a trailer the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.230 
road when a car tows a trailer the
stopping<00:01:24.149> distance<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.840> increased<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.240> its

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
stopping distance is increased and its

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.140 
stopping distance is increased and its
cornering<00:01:27.630> ability<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:28.289> reduced

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
cornering ability is reduced

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.150 
cornering ability is reduced
therefore<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.690> maximum<00:01:30.870> legal<00:01:31.440> speed<00:01:31.620> is

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
therefore the maximum legal speed is

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.520 
therefore the maximum legal speed is
also<00:01:32.460> reduced<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.690> answer<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.140> 90

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
also reduced and the answer is 90

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.370 
also reduced and the answer is 90
kilometers<00:01:35.010> now

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.590 

who<00:01:39.920> is<00:01:40.159> responsible<00:01:40.850> for<00:01:41.030> making<00:01:41.360> a

their safety belt

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
their safety belt
it's<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.310> passengers<00:01:47.850> responsibility<00:01:48.720> if

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
it's the passengers responsibility if

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's the passengers responsibility if
they're<00:01:49.470> 15<00:01:49.830> years<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.220> over<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.060> on

their safety belt if the passenger is
under<00:01:55.080> 15<00:01:55.440> years<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.760> will<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
under 15 years then it will be the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.399 
under 15 years then it will be the
drivers<00:01:57.510> responsibility

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 

if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> restricted<00:02:03.149> license<00:02:03.569> when
