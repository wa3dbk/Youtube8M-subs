tutorial in this tutorial I will show

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
tutorial in this tutorial I will show
you<00:00:10.050> how<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> add<00:00:10.530> crosswalks<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.370> long<00:00:11.550> roads

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
you how to add crosswalks to long roads

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.390 
you how to add crosswalks to long roads
in<00:00:11.969> city<00:00:12.330> skylines<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.740> usually<00:00:14.190> when<00:00:14.309> you

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
in city skylines so usually when you

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.829 
in city skylines so usually when you
make<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.580> road<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.030> know<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.210> just<00:00:15.630> make<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
make a road you know you just make a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.330 
make a road you know you just make a
road<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.170> this<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.529> there's<00:00:16.680> nowhere<00:00:16.949> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
road like this and there's nowhere for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
road like this and there's nowhere for
the<00:00:17.460> pedestrians<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> cross<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.570> what<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the pedestrians to cross so what you you

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.290 
the pedestrians to cross so what you you
should<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.310> crossroad<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.060> this

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
should do is make a crossroad like this

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
should do is make a crossroad like this
and<00:00:21.600> then<00:00:22.350> they<00:00:22.529> will<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.830> able<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.070> cross<00:00:23.279> but

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and then they will be able to cross but

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
and then they will be able to cross but
this<00:00:23.820> causes<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> lot<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.689> traffic<00:00:24.900> issues<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
this causes a lot of traffic issues I

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.679 
this causes a lot of traffic issues I
will<00:00:25.590> show<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> right<00:00:26.220> now<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:27.119> for<00:00:27.269> example

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
will show you right now so for example

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
will show you right now so for example
in<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:27.810> lovely<00:00:28.349> city<00:00:28.859> there<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.429> other

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
in my lovely city there are some other

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.540 
in my lovely city there are some other
problems<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.260> these<00:00:32.250> cars

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
problems because of the of these cars

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.130 
problems because of the of these cars
and<00:00:32.730> pedestrians<00:00:32.880> crossing<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.630> road<00:00:33.809> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and pedestrians crossing the road you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.160 
and pedestrians crossing the road you
know<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> car<00:00:34.920> slows<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.809> here<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
know here a car slows down here we have

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
know here a car slows down here we have
a<00:00:37.200> total<00:00:37.739> mess<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.660> just

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
a total mess and when it this is just

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.350 
a total mess and when it this is just
terrible<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.730> only<00:00:41.940> this

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
terrible and this is this is only this

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.119 
terrible and this is this is only this
is<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> total<00:00:43.200> mess<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.739> only

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
is just a total mess and this is only

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
is just a total mess and this is only
caused<00:00:44.460> by<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:44.850> pedestrians<00:00:45.480> crossing

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
caused by these pedestrians crossing

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540 
caused by these pedestrians crossing
because<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:46.950> too<00:00:47.129> many<00:00:47.280> pedestrians

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
because there are too many pedestrians

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.000 
because there are too many pedestrians
and<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.719> just<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.020> total<00:00:49.170> mess<00:00:49.530> let's<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.890> if

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and it's just a total mess let's see if

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670 
and it's just a total mess let's see if
we<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.190> another<00:00:50.430> example<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.469> just

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we have another example this is just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.650 
we have another example this is just
going<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> ship<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
going to be a ship this is it's just a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to be a ship this is it's just a
mess<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.320> terrible<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.640> know

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
mess it's just terrible and you know

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
mess it's just terrible and you know
there<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.000> ways<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> fix<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> by<00:00:57.989> adding

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
there are ways to fix this by adding

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
there are ways to fix this by adding
crosswalks<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.550> will<00:00:59.940> show<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> add

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
crosswalks so I will show you how to add

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990 
crosswalks so I will show you how to add
crosswalks<00:01:01.050> right<00:01:01.230> now<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.250> all<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> need<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
crosswalks right now so all you need to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
crosswalks right now so all you need to
do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.660> want<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:04.140> large<00:01:04.500> roads<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
do is if you want to use large roads you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
do is if you want to use large roads you
will<00:01:05.129> need<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> use<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> medium<00:01:06.210> road<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.720> all

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
will need to use a medium road so all

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.200 
will need to use a medium road so all
you<00:01:07.380> will<00:01:07.650> need<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.869> make<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.170> line<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
you will need to do is make one line of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
you will need to do is make one line of
medium<00:01:12.210> road<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.990> place<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
medium road like this place it there and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.320 
medium road like this place it there and
then<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.310> both<00:01:14.520> sides<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.180> add<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:17.060> lot<00:01:18.060> road

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
then on both sides you add a lot road

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.120 
then on both sides you add a lot road
here<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.290> go<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.659> we<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> can

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
here we go and here we go so as you can

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.820 
here we go and here we go so as you can
see<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.430> middle<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.820> created<00:01:24.240> our<00:01:24.390> own

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
see in the middle we created our own

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.230 
see in the middle we created our own
crosswalks<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.009> possessions<00:01:26.790> were<00:01:26.909> actually

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
crosswalks and possessions were actually

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.370 
crosswalks and possessions were actually
use<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.640> let<00:01:29.640> me<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.259> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
use that so let me see so we have this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
use that so let me see so we have this
total<00:01:31.560> mess<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.280> there's<00:01:32.520> too<00:01:32.759> many

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
total mess right here there's too many

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
total mess right here there's too many
people<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> actually<00:01:34.680> follow<00:01:34.860> these

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
people and we can actually follow these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.670 
people and we can actually follow these
people<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> did<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> before<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
people but I did that before so what you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.859 
people but I did that before so what you
have<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.640> happens<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> these<00:01:39.479> people<00:01:39.780> from

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
have what happens is these people from

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
have what happens is these people from
here<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.409> all<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> way<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.430> cross

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
here that go all the way here to cross

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.639 
here that go all the way here to cross
and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.180> they<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.049> hospital<00:01:43.259> for

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and then they go to the hospital for

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.700

do<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> near<00:02:14.700> hospital<00:02:15.180> obviously<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:17.190> we

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
do it near hospital obviously so here we

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.559 
do it near hospital obviously so here we
go<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.670> then<00:02:17.880> we<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.240> place<00:02:18.600> those<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
go and then we can place those so now we

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.809 
go and then we can place those so now we
have<00:02:21.780> created<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.260> crossroad<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.700> know

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
have created a crossroad and you know

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.280 
have created a crossroad and you know
this<00:02:24.030> will<00:02:24.240> actually<00:02:24.420> slow<00:02:24.840> down<00:02:25.050> traffic

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
this will actually slow down traffic

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.380 
this will actually slow down traffic
here<00:02:25.770> but<00:02:26.100> that's<00:02:26.520> not<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.819> problem<00:02:27.030> at<00:02:27.270> all

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
here but that's not a problem at all

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.460 
here but that's not a problem at all
because<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:28.020> will<00:02:28.319> never<00:02:28.940> create<00:02:29.940> any

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
because this will never create any

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.080 
because this will never create any
traffic<00:02:31.470> issues<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.160> big<00:02:32.430> ones<00:02:32.610> at<00:02:32.850> least

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
traffic issues not big ones at least

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.090 
traffic issues not big ones at least
I've<00:02:33.330> never<00:02:33.360> seen<00:02:33.900> one<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.140> people<00:02:34.830> are<00:02:34.950> seen

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
I've never seen one and people are seen

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400 
I've never seen one and people are seen
using<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.580> right<00:02:35.700> now<00:02:35.850> which<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.110> which<00:02:37.110> really

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
using it right now which is which really

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.380 
using it right now which is which really
helps<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> lot<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.069> which<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.640> what<00:02:39.060> is<00:02:39.209> also

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
helps a lot and which is what is also

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.830 
helps a lot and which is what is also
very<00:02:39.540> good<00:02:39.750> if<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.230> use<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.860> bus<00:02:41.070> lines<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.840> when

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
very good if you use a bus lines is when

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.420 
very good if you use a bus lines is when
you<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.140> bus<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.530> mean<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.920> example<00:02:43.950> here

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
you have a bus I mean for example here

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.729 
you have a bus I mean for example here
it's<00:02:44.670> very<00:02:45.060> good<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:46.110> crossroad

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
it's very good to have a crossroad

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.910 
it's very good to have a crossroad
let's<00:02:47.040> say<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.489> add<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.200> when<00:02:49.410> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
let's say we add it to here so when the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.229 
let's say we add it to here so when the
bus<00:02:50.130> stops<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.640> people<00:02:50.910> need<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> go

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
bus stops here and people need to go

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.240 
bus stops here and people need to go
here<00:02:51.510> what<00:02:52.050> they<00:02:52.170> did<00:02:52.380> before<00:02:52.739> is<00:02:52.860> they<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.130> all

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
here what they did before is they go all

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.150 
here what they did before is they go all
the<00:02:53.370> way<00:02:53.400> here<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.530> they<00:02:55.530> cross<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.980> road

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the way here and they cross the road

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160 
the way here and they cross the road
here<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.580> then<00:02:56.730> they<00:02:57.030> go<00:02:57.239> to<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.600> hospital<00:02:58.050> or

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
