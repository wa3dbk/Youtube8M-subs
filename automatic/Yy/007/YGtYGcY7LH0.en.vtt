finished increasing on every third

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.670 
finished increasing on every third
stitch<00:04:38.300> now<00:04:39.300> I'm<00:04:39.510> going<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.810> decrease<00:04:40.320> on

stitch now I'm going to decrease on
every<00:04:41.039> third<00:04:41.280> stitch<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.930> I<00:04:42.960> would<00:04:43.310> crochet

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
every third stitch so I would crochet

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.320

I<00:06:10.849> made<00:06:11.120> here<00:06:11.659> I<00:06:11.900> did<00:06:12.710> a<00:06:12.889> row<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.939> just

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
I made here I did a row of just

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.920 
I made here I did a row of just
crocheting<00:06:15.169> round<00:06:15.680> each<00:06:16.009> round<00:06:16.460> between<00:06:17.029> the

crocheting round each round between the
rounds<00:06:18.289> of<00:06:18.379> decrease<00:06:18.969> just<00:06:19.969> to<00:06:20.090> give<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.330> a

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
rounds of decrease just to give it a

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.439 
rounds of decrease just to give it a
more<00:06:20.740> cylindrical<00:06:21.740> shape<00:06:22.300> when<00:06:23.300> you've

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
more cylindrical shape when you've

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:28.269 
more cylindrical shape when you've
achieved<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:24.860> final<00:06:25.370> decreases<00:06:26.150> of<00:06:27.279> every
