00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
I think it's pretty pretty funny that

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.950

shows you that you've got like four four

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.259 
shows you that you've got like four four
players<00:00:48.260> when<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:48.860> just<00:00:49.219> put<00:00:49.430> them<00:00:49.520> I'm

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
players when it's just put them I'm

00:00:50.269 --> 00:01:00.169 
players when it's just put them I'm
playing<00:00:50.570> by<00:00:50.719> myself<00:00:50.870> at<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.289> moon

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:02.790 

but<00:01:01.179> yes<00:01:01.420> if<00:01:01.690> I<00:01:01.809> hadn't<00:01:02.170> been<00:01:02.230> able<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.530> kill

but yes if I hadn't been able to kill

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.760 
but yes if I hadn't been able to kill
one<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.339> them<00:01:03.550> I'm<00:01:04.239> not<00:01:04.780> sure<00:01:05.080> I<00:01:05.350> think<00:01:05.619> you

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
one of them I'm not sure I think you

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.179 
one of them I'm not sure I think you
have<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:05.979> actually<00:01:07.350> throw<00:01:08.350> your<00:01:08.649> weapons<00:01:08.979> at

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
have to actually throw your weapons at

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.080 
have to actually throw your weapons at
them<00:01:09.369> or<00:01:09.580> set<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.180> the<00:01:10.390> right<00:01:10.570> on<00:01:10.869> time<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:12.549> just

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
them or set on the right on time I just

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.380 
them or set on the right on time I just
get<00:01:13.330> I<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:14.680> get<00:01:14.860> one<00:01:15.159> hit<00:01:15.399> and<00:01:15.670> I'm<00:01:16.119> dead

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
get I just get one hit and I'm dead

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.880 
get I just get one hit and I'm dead
instantly<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.500> I<00:01:18.689> think<00:01:19.689> this<00:01:20.110> is<00:01:20.170> my<00:01:20.380> second

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
instantly so I think this is my second

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:28.200 
instantly so I think this is my second
try<00:01:21.039> doing<00:01:21.399> this<00:01:21.640> sir<00:01:26.580> Justin<00:01:27.580> I'm<00:01:27.789> guessing

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
try doing this sir Justin I'm guessing

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.510 
try doing this sir Justin I'm guessing
as<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.810> gets<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.049> tell<00:01:29.259> whether<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:30.280> go

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
as you gets to tell whether you go

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.850 
as you gets to tell whether you go
allowed<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.909> melee<00:01:31.330> or<00:01:31.360> get<00:01:31.600> close<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:32.020> them<00:01:32.140> so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
allowed to melee or get close to them so

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.449 
allowed to melee or get close to them so
