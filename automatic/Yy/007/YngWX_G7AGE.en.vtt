00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.410
 hello everyone I'm guincho development 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.450
 indie video game and today I come to talk to you 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.710
 of what I think about game maker for 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.969
 those who do not know him is a 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.090
 tool that allows you to create your 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.650
 own video games for windows mac 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.660
 Android iOS and many more systems 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.859
 even now a module has come out for 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.210
 to be able to export the games in a 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.010
 digital to playstation 34 vita and xbox one 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.810
 Well, I've been using it for eight years now 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.100
 I've often heard criticism from people who 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.020
 says it only serves to make a thousand 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.000
 simple games and there comes the question 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.640
 today game maker can make games 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.320
 professionals the answer is yes and for 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.000
 prove it mention some games that 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.070
 They have been successful and some that have 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.710
 even come to market like this 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.690
 that we go there is true that they have 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.850
 made many simple games but for 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.410
 what then because it is an easy tool 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.910
 to use that anyone with 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.620
 little knowledge can do its 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.210
 own game someone who does not know 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.309
 program can get to do a pacman 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.989
 simple or the typical game of ships of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.700
 kill Martians and try a little 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.079
 and I think that is the vision that has 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.059
 many people who have tried the program 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.219
 that I hope the game was done alone 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.930
 come down from the sky or something and like 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.609
 final they only managed to make a mini game 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.649
 simple they stay with the idea that the 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:13.240
 program does not give for more 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.770
 however if you take it seriously and in 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.539
 instead of using the blocks of drag and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.069
 drop you set to code with a code 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.409
 you will really see that he has a lot 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.670
 potential and I do not say it is that what 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.469
 you can check in many games 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.179
 well- known professionals that maybe 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.159
 you did not even know they were made with this 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.380
 program so like it's easy 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.029
 make a game say shabby if you put on 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.130
 to work seriously you will see that also 

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:34.869
 You can make more ambitious projects and 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.249
 even more commercial games 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.469
 easily than using another 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.569
 platform these are some examples of 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.859
 good games I'll start with one that 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.380
 sure you know because some 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:46.810
 Youtubers record and upload games is the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.789
 case of live for example is a game that 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.970
 is for windows mac playstation 3 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.890
 playstation 4 prevents 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.290
 what to tell you he has a style 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.670
 artistic very curious movements 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.070
 they are very fast and you have to have many 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.530
 reflexes but it is not the only one 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 is for example savant ascend is a 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.220
 game about the famous Norwegian musician 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.200
 Shaaban Notice that graphics and what action 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.820
 so fast for you to see that you can 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.860
 do barbarities if you work hard 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.080
 this is both for pc and for 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.030
 mobile we also have to damn 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 castilla a game that has also been 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.750
 created by a Spanish has graphics 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.490
 retro but that's not why it's a bad game neither 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 much less has it been very well received 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.959
 on the part of the press another one would be the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.880
 example of clinton the top of the house or 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.520
 game that won a prize of 10,000 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.740
 dollars in 2009 is a game that calls the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.270
 attention for its setting the drawings 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.130
 they seem taken out like from a book of 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.510
 stories we must add that this case 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.040
 concrete was also made with a version 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.140
 of a pretty old game maker and 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.140
 limited compared to the current one so 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.210
 that has enough merit 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.160
 and even the famous Miami hotline has 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.380
 been developed in game maker and now 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.030
 can be downloaded on playstation3 and 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.190
 this game as you know has had very 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 good reception and very good reviews for 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.920
 that you see the scope of the program 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.390
 graphically I'm left with sheets on 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.860
 the best example I found so that 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.140
 you see that the program does not limit the 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.730
 visual section the limits puts them in 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.860
 your skills in photoshop or the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 program that you use to draw mirad 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.490
 I'm going to compare what you think on one side 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.140
 people the image they have when 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.150
 they hear the word of maker and the other 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.720
 side I'm going to put the game savant do 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.570
 so you notice is the difference 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.370
 if they have nothing to do and now 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.380
 I wonder what they all have in common 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.630
 the good games that I mentioned so 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.980
 that are games in two dimensions so 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.980
 so much now we will see the case of your 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.750
 3d games I tell you the program is 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.850
 thought to do mainly games 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.860
 in 2d has some functions in 3-d 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.480
 but the effects are quite limited 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.120
 of lighting are not enough 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.620
 advanced and the number of polygons that 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.020
 can show on the screen is pretty 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.730
 actually reduced if you look at the editor of 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.740
 scenarios that the program takes you will see 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.880
 which is a plane in 2d so for 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.410
 make a game in 3-d you have to 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.780
 invent a system to place 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.190
 objects at different heights you can only 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.110
 set the x coordinate and gift 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.290
 normally and in some way you'll have 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.790
 that represent your z axis then what 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.500
 what happens is that the games do not have 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.570
 all the quality that one would expect if the 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.940
 did with another program like juniti 3d 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.350
 As is logical, each one is focused on 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.120
 a different field 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.520
 however despite its limitations 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 there are people who perform well I 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.030
 seen some experiments on youtube 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.970
 as is the case of blanket game with its 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.380
 game flowers rich another user called 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.660
 jared 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.710
 they are not bestial graphics but I consider 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.140
 that are fine for what is the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.880
 program and they look pretty polished like that 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.950
 that not all 3D games are like 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.510
 miami traffic 3 even if it has more merit 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.820
 of what you think achieved a game like that 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.100
 but you will not find level games either 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.750
 graphic from the leaves obviously on 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.220
 conclusion we can summarize that the game 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.990
 maker is a tool focused on 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.580
 develop games in 2d that you 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.920
 will allow to see pretty results 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.930
 fast that's why when you're at 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.520
 worldwide scope usually appear 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.960
 many games created by people who do not 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.210
 has never programmed and that does not draw 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 well enough but that's not 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.540
 determines the true potential of 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.580
 program because if you learn to program 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.350
 and you use it in an advanced way you will see 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.750
 that you can do great jobs with 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.100
 Professional appearance and proof are 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.710
 those video games that have had 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.750
 obviously you can create some success 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.210
 enrolled in call of duty but if you can 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.830
 create great games in 2d maybe 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.540
 you can think that the 2 of it is not so 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.670
 popular among pc games when 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.050
 there are others like Skyrim and others and it's because 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.150
 that the program also exports to 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.670
 mobile devices where there is 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.560
 I takes more s2 also want to add that 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.630
 the graphic limit in 2d is set by you 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.820
 skill drawing and is that game mayer 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.800
 it will not put barriers 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.660
 so someone chases me can 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.250
 make professional games but in the 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.680
 area in which he is focused is to say 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.360
 two-dimensional games I think 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.490
 that the question then would not be game 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.350
 maker can make professional games 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.830
 but rather you are able to make a 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.830
 professional game 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.910
 so I do not expect anything to have convinced you 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.680
 that the program is so worth it 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.810
 because well employed can offer very 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.960
 good results greetings and even the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.960
 next 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.280
 ah 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.990
 ah
