depends<00:04:03.540> where<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.660> come<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.900> against<00:04:04.170> but<00:04:04.380> I've

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
depends where I come up against but I've

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.460 
depends where I come up against but I've
got<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> strike<00:04:05.430> force<00:04:05.730> now<00:04:06.000> I've<00:04:06.420> got<00:04:06.810> left<00:04:07.019> mid

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
got a strike force now I've got left mid

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.979 
got a strike force now I've got left mid
and<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.860> right<00:04:08.069> mid<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.700> i<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.420> i<00:04:09.660> could<00:04:09.720> do

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
