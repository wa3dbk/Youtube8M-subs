00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.770
 Macy's glad of my 1 1 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.870
 welcome to the recipes reality 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 My name is precisely and I still interesting 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 recipes do everything up to gram 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.320
 as said or written and checked 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 as far as reality fits 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.029
 the declared pictures all the dishes I cook 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.800
 first time and without prior 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.560
 training and today I will try 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.810
 make homemade cream cheese 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.670
 Philadelphia Recipes 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.219
 making philadelphia cheese in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 home conditions very much but always 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.780
 there is a risk that instead of gentle creamy 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.760
 cheese will just curd more 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 I just liked two recipes 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 one very simple of yogurt and sour cream 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.800
 and the second recipe is from professionals with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 using a special leaven 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.520
 enzymes and calcium chloride 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590
 these recipes are so different that i 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.289
 decided to try cooking two at once 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.420
 options and compare which one is more 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.289
 just like a real philadelphia cheese 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.290
 and I'll start the simplest recipe and for 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.799
 I need this sour cream fat 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.080
 30-40 percent 200 grams natural 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.780
 natural type yogurt without natural 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.210
 supplements 500 grams and fine salt 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.619
 about half a teaspoon or a little 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.000
 more to your taste 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.369
 take the sieve we place it over the bowl and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.040
 we put a drainage bag in it or 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.360
 gauze folded in 4 layers in the bag 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.400
 Put yoghurt sour cream and salt and gently 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.110
 mix 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.320
 up bear gently tuck and 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 press down with a weight of about 1 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.360
 I use the kilogram for this 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.170
 a saucepan with water is needed in order 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.920
 Serum from the future to the start of cheese 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.920
 to separate 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.040
 then put this whole construct in 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.080
 refrigerator and watch as soon 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.080
 whey will stop separating cheese 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.290
 ready for it may take about 12 days 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.020
 and now the professional recipe for 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:13.660
 olga azure's lesson link to the source 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.910
 you will find in the description under this video and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.390
 here for making cream cheese and me 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.700
 need milk 4 liters of cream 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.120
 fat content of 20-25 percent 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.880
 1 liter calcium chloride solution 1 8 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.820
 a teaspoon is not zafer on i ferment 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.150
 quarter teaspoon and water solution 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.790
 rennet 6 6 drops if you 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340
 calcium chloride and rennet, and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.610
 dry as I dilute 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.130
 their water according to the instructions on the package 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.800
 but if you suddenly decide to make cheese from 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.750
 milk factory after the wonderful enzyme 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.900
 add can not milk and cream 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.270
 mix and heat to a temperature of 36 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.290
 degrees I have no thermometer therefore 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.120
 I will focus on my feelings 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.239
 add calcium chloride solutions and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.700
 rennet enzyme sprinkle top 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.940
 mesophilic sourdough and wait a couple of minutes 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.450
 until the powder absorbs moisture and then 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.910
 mix we cover with a lid and 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.850
 leave alone for a few hours and 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.950
 wait until the clot is formed 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.550
 covered with a thin layer on top 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.340
 serum I happened after 10 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.310
 hours and as soon as this happened you need 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.830
 shift the future cheese drain bag and 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.830
 hang for 8-10 hours or overnight 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.750
 in the morning put the bag on the sieve and 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.720
 open at this stage the mass should 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.880
 be a little watery inside if you 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.070
 will do classic philadelphia 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.800
 add salt to about one two canteens 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.690
 spoons to your taste and if you will 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.360
 make cheese for cheesecake then salt 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.730
 no need to add 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.800
 further to squeeze out the remaining serum 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.640
 we tie the bag and cover with the top 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.320
 cargo weighing approximately 2-3 kilograms 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.810
 thus pressing future cheese 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.390
 about 5 hours during this time mass 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.320
 should be compacted and the cheese can be 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.049
 use as intended also from watering can 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.720
 my philadelphia cheese is finally ready 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.570
 departure is not just remarkably smooth 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.700
 smooth and shiny looks very similar 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.220
 try on real cream cheese 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:39.820
 Perhaps I'll start and yogurt cheeses and 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:42.100
 sour cream so cutting which in section 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.760
 Sort of like a little bit tight. 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.040
 such a soft time can be smeared 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.960
 Well, if you have a little longer 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.690
 by hold it will be such 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.479
 tighter course of the matter at the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.479
 It's important to try here now 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:10.440
 but by consistency it is very similar to 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.880
 cream cheese but still i have 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.530
 there is a very strong kind 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 sour milk note he 's still 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.420
 something like cottage cheese close course to 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.840
 creamy side all the same something is not a 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.520
 so now look at the cheese 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.520
 professional recipe 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:37.410
 what it will notice 4 what it is 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.210
 here pay attention drainage thread 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.990
 pouch 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.270
 I hope it does not affect the taste but 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.810
 it is also the same consistency as 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.810
 the first 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840
 this is just a real cheese poured 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.660
 Philadelphia 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:09.070
 in it's it feel to some 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:17.030
 such a creamy taste is a great recipe 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:19.700
 surely he is the first issue price 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.950
 what is the cost i will describe in detail in 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.470
 description under this video and what am i 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.200
 I prepare this cream cheese you 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.600
 will find out in the next issue and I am with you 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.820
