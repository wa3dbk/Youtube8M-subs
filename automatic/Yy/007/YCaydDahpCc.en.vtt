motors<00:02:17.080> over<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.380> crap<00:02:17.650> man<00:02:17.800> so<00:02:18.070> we

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
motors over here this crap man so we

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.770 
motors over here this crap man so we
have<00:02:18.520> that<00:02:18.640> sorted<00:02:18.850> out<00:02:18.970> now<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:22.260> we<00:02:23.260> have<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
have that sorted out now and we have the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.130 
have that sorted out now and we have the
pace<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.320> standard<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.710> is<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.010> heavy

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
pace of the standard this is the heavy

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.630 
pace of the standard this is the heavy
bastard<00:02:29.140> I've<00:02:29.350> no<00:02:29.830> idea<00:02:29.950> heavier<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.520> is

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
bastard I've no idea heavier this is

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.060 
bastard I've no idea heavier this is
really<00:02:30.910> happy<00:02:31.060> maybe<00:02:31.410> one<00:02:32.410> kilometer<00:02:32.830> perhaps

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
really happy maybe one kilometer perhaps

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.830 
really happy maybe one kilometer perhaps
and<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:35.200> have<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:36.120> ever-important<00:02:37.120> metal

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
and we have the ever-important metal

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.000 
and we have the ever-important metal
thing<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:39.550> screws<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:40.120> there<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.960> then<00:02:41.860> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
thing that screws in there and then that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.180 
thing that screws in there and then that
screws<00:02:42.520> there<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.290> microphone<00:02:44.680> goes

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
screws there and the microphone goes

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.450 
screws there and the microphone goes
there<00:02:45.730> now<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.720> doesn't<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:48.010> could<00:02:48.430> I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
there now it doesn't have a I could I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.170 
there now it doesn't have a I could I

maybe fitter and shock absorber i have

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.060 
maybe fitter and shock absorber i have
no<00:04:59.780> idea<00:04:59.810> what<00:05:00.200> those<00:05:00.290> are<00:05:00.530> called<00:05:00.560> anymore

things<00:05:04.700> look<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:06.050> again<00:05:07.010> everything<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.550> there

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
things look so again everything in there

things look so again everything in there
goes<00:05:09.800> up<00:05:09.950> here<00:05:10.750> that<00:05:11.750> is<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.380> smallest<00:05:12.620> for

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
goes up here that is the smallest for

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.300 
goes up here that is the smallest for
track<00:05:13.640> recording<00:05:13.970> studio<00:05:14.270> in<00:05:15.130> podcasting<00:05:16.130> I

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
track recording studio in podcasting I

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.300 
track recording studio in podcasting I
think<00:05:17.120> maybe<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:18.410> go<00:05:18.530> along<00:05:18.740> with<00:05:18.770> my<00:05:19.040> most

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
think maybe to go along with my most

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.160 
think maybe to go along with my most
expensive<00:05:19.760> microphone<00:05:20.120> almost<00:05:20.390> most

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
expensive microphone almost most

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.470 
expensive microphone almost most
valuable<00:05:22.070> podcasting<00:05:22.580> on<00:05:22.640> microphone<00:05:23.360> and

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
valuable podcasting on microphone and

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.720 
valuable podcasting on microphone and
podcasting<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.080> again<00:05:25.040> I<00:05:25.130> can't<00:05:25.370> actually<00:05:25.580> I

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
podcasting and again I can't actually I

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.920 
podcasting and again I can't actually I
can<00:05:25.820> record<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.150> for<00:05:26.330> three<00:05:26.510> track<00:05:26.690> with<00:05:26.840> this

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
can record it for three track with this

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.630 
can record it for three track with this
because<00:05:27.170> only<00:05:27.740> have<00:05:27.890> one<00:05:28.010> set<00:05:28.490> bear

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
because only have one set bear

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.700 
because only have one set bear
microphone<00:05:29.000> use<00:05:29.480> microphones<00:05:30.020> cores<00:05:30.470> on<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.650> a

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
microphone use microphones cores on to a

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.930 
microphone use microphones cores on to a
separate<00:05:30.950> track<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:32.380> so<00:05:33.380> yes<00:05:33.590> I<00:05:33.820> hope<00:05:34.820> you

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
separate track and so yes I hope you

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.090 
separate track and so yes I hope you
like<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.240> I<00:05:35.450> like<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.470> I<00:05:36.640> think<00:05:37.640> it's<00:05:37.880> pretty
