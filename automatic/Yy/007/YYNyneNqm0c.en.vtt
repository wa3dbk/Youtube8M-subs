light has reached you it took about 200

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.300 
light has reached you it took about 200
milliseconds<00:00:18.619> congratulations<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.279> are

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
milliseconds congratulations you are

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.450 
milliseconds congratulations you are
about<00:00:20.609> 20<00:00:21.060> million<00:00:21.300> times<00:00:21.449> slower<00:00:22.279> and<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.400> you

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
about 20 million times slower and so you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.970 
about 20 million times slower and so you
can<00:00:23.580> see<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.570> speed<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> light<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.590> fast

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
can see the speed of light is so fast

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.359 
can see the speed of light is so fast
but<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> precedes<00:00:27.150> our<00:00:27.359> immediate<00:00:27.689> perception

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
but it precedes our immediate perception

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.279 
but it precedes our immediate perception
so<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.670> people<00:00:29.789> measure<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.390> more

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
so how do people measure it more

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.560 
so how do people measure it more
specifically<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:32.790> people<00:00:33.120> before<00:00:33.450> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
specifically how do people before the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
specifically how do people before the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
20th century try to measure it did they

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.920 
20th century try to measure it did they
