00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.110
 now it is clear 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.720
 Reinwald Waldbröl with not with No Well then nothing more change 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.629
 we wash 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.919
 Derek is a blacksmith 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.699
 LG Lois some the two are not Westerwelle 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.460
 But you also have to look 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.900
 there's nothing there 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.020
 cheap means for the rural Roger Corman of Return 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.840
 what shoud that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.839
 not sometime about 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:28.770
 from the middle of 20 is right 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.199
 yes 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.720
 But I have the please so closed the owner 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980
 more my dear friend has no percent of respondents 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.740
 also not friend suitably styled 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.990
 because I 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 m the last fault could not come 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.820
 because I do not choose to go because I do not know if I'm a starter or 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.040
 not a tactically little of all things and I believe so certainly 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.150
 thought and at all 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.530
 but as before, because the guests say goodbye 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.729
 He said in March 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.200
 the referee gives 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.050
 I spend a lot of time the top ten will not be bought then but not again 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.230
 to be built correctly 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.850
 - Penalty minutes worry us down yes yes 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.100
 8 GB are rumblings easily determined when over three opponents he comes canceled 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.270
 the world is coming and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.359
 Federer 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.430
 MMC will remain the court that is not an opponent that is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.370
 So comparing to the Clowns BLR comparison comes out compared to 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.040
 Victoria is getting lighter now is easy 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.109
 but something of simple Kohl spokesman Prof and there it is 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.640
 Axel the fatality 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 three parts shared Tai Chi Chi Chi Chi very beautiful da Caccia 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720
 and the game world is nothing anymore 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.730
 Although the reviewer said Cake is accepted, Dr pictures Oliver 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.450
 Brown occurs Rosberg was the hard to sting beautiful by thefts 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.860
 have years 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.300
 with every other pharmacist 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.330
 this could also make sense 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.530
 I find that nothing more can be said by other politicians 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 I do not think that they are all world politicians possible or far 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.270
 Certainly not mother I do not know it he himself said the clothes 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.129
 this weak 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.269
 what need 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.969
 yes yes comes closer still was attack once Jajah com 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.619
 cherish 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.619
 Fri yes there were also says 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.909
 sda at it were threatened maybe says 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:32.350
 we all 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.930
 now the game is easy and situation reports dapd somehow enough i have none 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.009
 Hope such a good time but continue in Bielefeld Castle more 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.659
 maybe at the same time just here 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.949
 Infineon became the classic station speaker 

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:51.129
 so a spokesman's point when I finished 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.840
 I'll be there with it and continue to secure the rifles here 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.519
 now also nothing mette-marit no longer sewn Krupp I at that time that 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.079
 Trainerbank from here or here 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.749
 but that's also maybe Macs with Brad Pitt reading in the book 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:12.159
 Ahrensburg determines more is not the flower sniffing in the rehearsal with 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:18.389
 DAX Kult Candlestick Macs Bet well grows Kurt Brand 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.069
 knock 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.159
 But often a bathroom Westerwald Manno cabaret can happen 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.340
 you are not ready 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.779
 maybe that's why it was decided, or only slightly, or like mine 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:31.349
 here again 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.710
 lay with Prof 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.810
 that's right, yes, yes I'm right and taken away 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.939
 therefore the control standards I can not really and what do I know 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.239
 activated skeptical 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.339
 40 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:47.309
 Georg Ismar and the work comes all the way everything is great all the GOP 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.909
 those at the spell gave it all 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.589
 Cisco Bosbach Archie require stress 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:59.099
 Sister he is denied the defendant 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.399
 4 Coop with becomes a potion Destruction lets the enemy out 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:10.289
 Death row flowering in these "fans" goals be Dr very nice that's good 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:14.219
 but now when she was gone it was again to see what you can do 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.299
 not very full but always one about 80 do not know if the Tauber 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.599
 good or not 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:20.709
 I have no idea 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.979
 «Sure it must be 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.250
 it's almost over the game Dr Schwesig threw 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.210
 it is wrong before the match 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.850
 then stormed 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.220
 at about SOP 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.600
 at Bayer now also here on my next project will continue 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.699
 hardened where the corner Swede did not turn out 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.780
 he goes saying he is weakened or I admit it 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.660
 hope that end this game because the war then 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.639
 thanks a lot watch traffic rolls on Porsche
