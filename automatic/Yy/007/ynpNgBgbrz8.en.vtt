hi<00:00:01.230> friends<00:00:01.620> today<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:02.040> will<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.310> comparing

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
hi friends today we will be comparing

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.970 
hi friends today we will be comparing
super<00:00:03.449> serves<00:00:03.689> our<00:00:03.929> entire<00:00:04.200> jaw<00:00:04.589> so<00:00:04.740> some

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
super serves our entire jaw so some

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.369 
super serves our entire jaw so some
people<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.520> doubt<00:00:05.910> then<00:00:06.180> both<00:00:06.660> these<00:00:07.109> are

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
people have a doubt then both these are

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.980 
people have a doubt then both these are
the<00:00:07.470> same<00:00:07.680> actually<00:00:08.340> supercell<00:00:09.030> turbocharger

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
the same actually supercell turbocharger

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.709 
the same actually supercell turbocharger
two<00:00:10.260> different<00:00:10.769> technologies<00:00:11.040> but<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
two different technologies but the

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.150 
two different technologies but the
purpose<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.290> same<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.650> they're<00:00:13.830> doing

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
purpose is the same what they're doing

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.240 
purpose is the same what they're doing
is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> same<00:00:14.820> they<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.570> used<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.320> improve<00:00:16.740> the

events<00:00:24.680> supercharger<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.890> called<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> superset

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
events supercharger is called a superset

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
events supercharger is called a superset
of<00:00:27.359> itself<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.349> temperature<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:29.099> been

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
shortfin we are calling it as

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.110 
shortfin we are calling it as
turbocharger<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.280> turbocharger<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
turbocharger so the turbocharger is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.090 
turbocharger so the turbocharger is
essentially<00:00:36.390> getting<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.230> drive<00:00:37.500> from<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
turbocharger but for a supercharger it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
turbocharger but for a supercharger it
is<00:00:45.149> getting<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> drive<00:00:45.899> directly<00:00:46.379> from<00:00:46.530> the

I<00:02:18.200> told<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.560> doing<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> same<00:02:19.549> propose<00:02:19.970> they

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
I told you doing the same propose they

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.449 
I told you doing the same propose they
had<00:02:20.290> producing<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:21.440> xp<00:02:21.950> for<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.160> next

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
had producing more xp for a next

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.130 
had producing more xp for a next
existing<00:02:23.090> engine<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.450> more<00:02:23.569> torque<00:02:23.840> for<00:02:24.049> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
existing engine and more torque for the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.680 
existing engine and more torque for the
existing<00:02:24.530> engine<00:02:24.799> thereby<00:02:25.549> provide<00:02:26.510> up

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
existing engine thereby provide up

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.530 
existing engine thereby provide up
making<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.709> smaller<00:02:28.430> engine<00:02:28.790> possible<00:02:29.269> to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
making a smaller engine possible to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.140 
making a smaller engine possible to
provide<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.870> higher<00:02:30.140> experience<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.790> hope

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
provide a higher experience so I hope

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.729 
provide a higher experience so I hope
you<00:02:32.299> understand<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.049> difference<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
you understand the difference of the

you understand the difference of the
comparison<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.150> turbocharger<00:02:35.750> and
