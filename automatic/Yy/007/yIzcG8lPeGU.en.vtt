00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.860 
the 24 hour body by am Tresemme now I
bought<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.370> just<00:00:09.030> because<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> wanted<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.840> for

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
bought this just because I wanted it for

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.839 
bought this just because I wanted it for
the<00:00:10.230> exfolia<00:00:10.710> thing<00:00:10.889> which<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.219> what<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> used

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the exfolia thing which is what I used

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.120 
the exfolia thing which is what I used
it<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.230> but<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.530> found<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.040> is

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
it for but I have found that it is

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.039 
it for but I have found that it is
really<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.460> good<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:15.299> basically<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.839> it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
really really good so basically this it

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.130 
really really good so basically this it
looks<00:00:16.320> like<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:17.010> was<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.310> 7<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.300> 8<00:00:18.359> year<00:00:19.109> I

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
looks like it was about 7 or 8 year I

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.830 
looks like it was about 7 or 8 year I
think<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:20.130> quite<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> big<00:00:20.460> bottle<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
think it's quite a big bottle and it's a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.450 
think it's quite a big bottle and it's a
spray<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.680> spray<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.010> your<00:00:23.130> hair<00:00:23.279> when

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
spray that you spray on your hair when

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
spray that you spray on your hair when
your<00:00:23.580> hair<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.730> wet<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.660> style<00:00:25.019> your

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
your hair is wet and then you style your

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
your hair is wet and then you style your
hair<00:00:25.199> normally<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.010> adds<00:00:26.220> volume<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.880> as

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
hair normally and it adds volume and as

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.019 
hair normally and it adds volume and as
you<00:00:27.300> can<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.810> has<00:00:27.960> added<00:00:28.490> some<00:00:29.490> amount<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you can see it has added some amount of

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.269 
you can see it has added some amount of
volume<00:00:30.179> into<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.720> hair<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.470> it's<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.710> 200<00:00:32.160> mil

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
volume into my hair so it's a 200 mil

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.630 
volume into my hair so it's a 200 mil

see the kind of shine it gives to hair

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.850 
see the kind of shine it gives to hair
and<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.630> also<00:03:12.810> kind<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.380> brings<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.739> the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
and it also kind of brings out the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.979 
and it also kind of brings out the
natural<00:03:14.010> contours<00:03:15.000> in<00:03:15.270> your<00:03:15.390> hair<00:03:15.600> as<00:03:15.780> well

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
because a lot of worsening thought that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.670 
because a lot of worsening thought that
I<00:03:17.670> dyed<00:03:17.910> my<00:03:17.940> hair<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> brown<00:03:18.720> color<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.530> was

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
I dyed my hair like a brown color it was

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.199 
I dyed my hair like a brown color it was
just<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.010> natural<00:03:20.430> kind<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.700> color<00:03:20.850> coming

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
just the natural kind of color coming

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.530 
just the natural kind of color coming
through<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:22.830> very<00:03:22.950> simple<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.459> use<00:03:23.610> I<00:03:24.000> am

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
through so it's very simple to use I am

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.790 
through so it's very simple to use I am
actually<00:03:24.720> gonna<00:03:24.959> give<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.320> four<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.770> half

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
actually gonna give it four and a half

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.380 
actually gonna give it four and a half
now<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> reason<00:03:26.610> why<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:26.790> giving<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.180> four

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
now the reason why I'm giving it four

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.300 
now the reason why I'm giving it four
and<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.570> half<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.930> because<00:03:28.290> sometimes<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:29.220> don't

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
and a half is because sometimes I don't

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.400 
and a half is because sometimes I don't
know<00:03:29.489> why<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.510> sometimes<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.050> doesn't<00:03:31.230> seem

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
know why but sometimes it doesn't seem

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.890 
know why but sometimes it doesn't seem
to<00:03:31.560> work<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.180> why<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.480> giving<00:03:33.660> it

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
to work and that is why I'm giving it

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.229 
to work and that is why I'm giving it
four<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.320> half<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.310> don't<00:03:35.940> know<00:03:36.030> why

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
four and a half and I don't know why

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.120 
four and a half and I don't know why
it's<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.600> like<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.380> first<00:03:37.410> time<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:37.830> used<00:03:38.010> it

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
it's just like the first time I used it

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.100 
it's just like the first time I used it
I<00:03:38.190> had<00:03:38.340> so<00:03:38.610> much<00:03:38.760> volume<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.480> now<00:03:39.660> this<00:03:39.870> time

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
I had so much volume and now this time

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.170 
I had so much volume and now this time
is<00:03:40.260> little<00:03:40.470> is<00:03:40.590> not<00:03:40.800> as<00:03:41.130> much<00:03:41.459> volume<00:03:41.880> so<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
is little is not as much volume so it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.940 
is little is not as much volume so it
kind<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.450> varies<00:03:42.690> I'm<00:03:43.350> not<00:03:43.500> sure<00:03:43.650> if<00:03:43.800> it's

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
kind of varies I'm not sure if it's

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.560 
kind of varies I'm not sure if it's
