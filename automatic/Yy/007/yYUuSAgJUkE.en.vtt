00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.830
 welcome to the channel kinder toy 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.630
 show today i would like to show you how 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.570
 you can arrange toys from the collection 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.029
 marvel super heroes we need 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.520
 cardboard 1 millimeter thick 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.020
 background image several rulers 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:42.890
 glue scotch knife scissors and pencil 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:42.890
 First, measure our figure 30 by 36 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
 8 to 9 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.160
 take a cardboard with a thickness of 1 millimeter 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.310
 mark up and cut out a piece of 180 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.410
 by 250 millimeters 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.050
 draw two lines at a distance of 110 and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.640
 180 millimeters 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.160
 now you need to push these two 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.200
 lines by some blunt object i 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.630
 I use for these purposes scissors 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.910
 further marking will be carried out in 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.450
 within a large rectangle for 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.580
 start it needs to be divided in half 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.970
 Now we divide our rectangle by more 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.430
 fine 30 millimeters wide receding 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.050
 at the same time from the edge of 5 millimeters and making 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.430
 distance between small 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.160
 rectangles too 5 millimeters 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.390
 note from our horizontal lines 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.470
 15 and 24 millimeters draw lines 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.690
 divide each small rectangle 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.220
 in half we draw lines we postpone by 4 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.670
 millimeter on each side of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.759
 drawn lines 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.450
 cut the resulting window should 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.160
 be careful working with a knife 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.860
 we smear a large rectangle with glue and 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.410
 impose our background should be paid 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.619
 note that the bottom of the background should 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.869
 be turned to the middle of the sheet 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.899
 when the glue dries a little we cut 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.930
 remnants of the background at the edges then begin 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.370
 cut a window 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.110
 we fold our design in two 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 bend lines fix tape 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.069
 so our stand is almost done 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:31.239
 it remains only to insert the figures and 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:32.890
 enjoy the result if the window 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.930
 cut right then 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.500
 figures do not require additional 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.500
 fixings 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 that's the way you can make your 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.079
 collection 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.959
 it doesn't have to be a background 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.030
 cosmos its i used because 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.599
 similarly used on liners to 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.150
 toys 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.439
 if you cannot print 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.379
 printer image 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.629
 then you can take for example the cover from 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.389
 comics get no worse and 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:06.219
 maybe even better now 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.129
 composition looks light 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.879
 unfinished but i'm sure that along with 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.500
 we will collect the entire collection by you 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.719
