than you could see that how white pieces

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.949 
than you could see that how white pieces
could<00:03:02.500> simply<00:03:02.799> develop<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.750> he<00:03:04.870> now

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
could simply develop just he now

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.800 
could simply develop just he now
following<00:03:05.379> a<00:03:05.530> 45<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.609> bishop<00:03:06.790> distri<00:03:07.269> so

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
following a 45 and the bishop distri so

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.039 
following a 45 and the bishop distri so
last<00:03:08.079> clip<00:03:08.260> tried<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.769> sacrifice<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.819> pawn<00:03:10.239> but

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
last clip tried to sacrifice a pawn but

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.770 
last clip tried to sacrifice a pawn but
just<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.470> slow<00:03:12.459> down<00:03:12.730> whites<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.389> developing

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
just to slow down whites in developing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.020 
just to slow down whites in developing
the<00:03:13.870> whites<00:03:14.049> initiative<00:03:14.560> but<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.730> was<00:03:15.910> not

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
the whites initiative but it was not

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.330 
the whites initiative but it was not
enough<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:17.049> rube<00:03:17.169> g8<00:03:17.530> was<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.980> best<00:03:18.190> move

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
enough so the rube g8 was the best move

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.770 
enough so the rube g8 was the best move
here<00:03:18.579> in<00:03:18.699> this<00:03:18.790> position<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.389> that<00:03:19.930> could

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
here in this position and that could

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.119 
here in this position and that could
create<00:03:22.780> more<00:03:23.109> fight<00:03:23.410> but<00:03:23.709> still<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.010> believe

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
create more fight but still I believe

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.970 
create more fight but still I believe
that<00:03:24.669> after<00:03:25.299> root<00:03:25.750> page<00:03:25.900> 6<00:03:26.230> Stannis<00:03:26.709> would<00:03:26.859> be

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
that after root page 6 Stannis would be

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.150 
that after root page 6 Stannis would be
dominant<00:03:27.370> so<00:03:27.940> your<00:03:28.389> plate<00:03:28.989> poor<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.919> root

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
dominant so your plate poor with a root

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.189 
dominant so your plate poor with a root
of<00:03:30.310> seven<00:03:30.639> I<00:03:30.819> think<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.180> was<00:03:31.209> quite<00:03:31.599> even

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
of seven I think it was quite even

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.990 
of seven I think it was quite even
