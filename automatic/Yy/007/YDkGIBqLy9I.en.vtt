you need to be walking forward yeah it's

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.530 
you need to be walking forward yeah it's
basic<00:00:50.540> science<00:00:50.900> that<00:00:50.930> if<00:00:51.200> you<00:00:51.829> if<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.910> shots

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
basic science that if you if the shots

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.229 
basic science that if you if the shots
are<00:00:53.720> based<00:00:53.930> from<00:00:54.440> right<00:00:54.860> here<00:00:55.400> at<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.910> dot

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
are based from right here at this dot

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.750 
are based from right here at this dot
and<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.430> move<00:00:58.760> forward<00:00:59.090> and<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:01.130> other

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
and you move forward and the other

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.749 
and you move forward and the other
bullets<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.320> watch<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.680> I'll<00:01:04.189> stop<00:01:04.579> I'll

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
bullets so you watch this I'll stop I'll

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.370 
bullets so you watch this I'll stop I'll
shoot<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:06.430> I'll<00:01:07.430> switch<00:01:08.299> weapons<00:01:08.780> but

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
shoot you and I'll switch weapons but

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.499

lot<00:01:09.979> battle<00:01:10.340> rifle<00:01:10.640> bullets<00:01:11.000> will<00:01:11.180> still<00:01:11.390> hit

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
lot battle rifle bullets will still hit

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:23.440 
lot battle rifle bullets will still hit
you

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.490 

there<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:29.150> yeah<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> shots<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.350> based

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
there so yeah if the shots are based

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.130 
there so yeah if the shots are based
from<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.700> move<00:01:32.850> forward<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.630> that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
from here and you move forward and that

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.740 
from here and you move forward and that
and<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.800> sauce<00:01:35.730> is<00:01:35.760> still<00:01:36.120> based<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.570> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and the sauce is still based on this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
and the sauce is still based on this
line<00:01:36.990> then<00:01:37.820> these<00:01:38.960> fossil<00:01:39.960> soup<00:01:40.350> from<00:01:40.560> here

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
line then these fossil soup from here

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.060 
line then these fossil soup from here
and<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:42.300> hit<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.470> ahead<00:01:43.710> of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
