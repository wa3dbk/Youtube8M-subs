wings<00:04:05.020> this<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:05.980> because<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.640> brush<00:04:06.880> is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
wings this is because the brush is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.020 
wings this is because the brush is

on<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.250> fuselage<00:04:18.760> notice<00:04:19.660> how<00:04:19.810> easy<00:04:20.080> it<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.440> to

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
on the fuselage notice how easy it is to

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.350 
on the fuselage notice how easy it is to

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.029 

finish<00:04:51.449> off<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.840> work<00:04:51.990> by<00:04:52.259> painting<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.830> tail

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
finish off the work by painting the tail

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.929 
finish off the work by painting the tail
of<00:04:53.219> the<00:04:53.310> plane<00:04:58.039> create<00:04:59.039> a<00:04:59.069> new<00:04:59.370> layer<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.879> name

of the plane create a new layer and name

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:08.959 
of the plane create a new layer and name
it<00:05:00.210> nose<00:05:06.889> switch<00:05:07.889> to<00:05:08.129> a<00:05:08.159> yellow<00:05:08.400> color<00:05:08.729> and

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
it nose switch to a yellow color and

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.200 
it nose switch to a yellow color and
paint<00:05:09.659> the<00:05:09.840> nose<00:05:10.020> of<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.319> airplane<00:05:12.770> if<00:05:14.210> you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
paint the nose of the airplane if you

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.450 
paint the nose of the airplane if you
make<00:05:15.569> a<00:05:15.599> mistake<00:05:15.810> hold<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.770> shift<00:05:17.009> key<00:05:17.279> and

make a mistake hold the shift key and

paint over the areas you want to erase

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:21.529 
paint over the areas you want to erase
this<00:05:20.069> is<00:05:20.279> faster<00:05:20.699> than<00:05:20.849> switching<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.419> the

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
this is faster than switching to the

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:33.940 
this is faster than switching to the
eraser<00:05:21.990> tool

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.220

switch to a brown color to paint the

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.940 
switch to a brown color to paint the
air-intake<00:05:37.690> instead<00:05:38.690> of<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.930> paintbrush<00:05:39.380> try
