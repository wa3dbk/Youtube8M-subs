in the next several lessons I'm going to
help<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> visualize<00:01:06.180> letter<00:01:06.990> spacing<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
help you visualize letter spacing in a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
help you visualize letter spacing in a
new<00:01:08.280> way<00:01:08.550> first<00:01:09.330> let's<00:01:09.870> cover<00:01:10.080> some<00:01:10.410> terms

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
new way first let's cover some terms

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
new way first let's cover some terms
when<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.610> comes<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.060> spacing<00:01:12.660> of<00:01:12.810> letters

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
when it comes to the spacing of letters

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.190 
when it comes to the spacing of letters
and<00:01:13.410> words<00:01:13.620> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.400> kerning<00:01:15.090> tracking<00:01:16.050> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
and words you have kerning tracking and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.190 
and words you have kerning tracking and
letting<00:01:17.040> kerning<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.479> spacing<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
letting kerning is the spacing of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.090 
letting kerning is the spacing of
individual<00:01:20.010> letter<00:01:20.280> pairs<00:01:20.900> tracking<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
individual letter pairs tracking is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740 
individual letter pairs tracking is
overall<00:01:23.100> letter<00:01:23.520> spacing<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.479> if<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
overall letter spacing so if you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.780 
overall letter spacing so if you
increase<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.380> tracking<00:01:25.740> value<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.580> word

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
increase the tracking value of a word

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.990 
increase the tracking value of a word
all<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> letters<00:01:28.369> increase<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.670> distance

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
all of the letters increase in distance

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
all of the letters increase in distance
from<00:01:30.390> each<00:01:30.540> other<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> they<00:01:31.410> spread<00:01:31.800> out

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
from each other and they spread out

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.790 
from each other and they spread out
evenly<00:01:32.479> letting<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:34.050> vertical<00:01:34.410> space

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
evenly letting is the vertical space

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.310 
evenly letting is the vertical space
between<00:01:35.280> rows<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.759> type<00:01:36.090> letting<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.080> spelt

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
between rows of type letting it's spelt

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.880 
between rows of type letting it's spelt
the<00:01:37.380> same<00:01:37.470> as<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:37.920> word<00:01:38.100> leading<00:01:38.940> le<00:01:39.450> ad<00:01:39.960> but

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the same as the word leading le ad but

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
the same as the word leading le ad but
it's<00:01:41.070> pronounced<00:01:41.520> letting<00:01:42.000> because<00:01:42.270> it's

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
it's pronounced letting because it's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.930 
it's pronounced letting because it's
derived<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.050> when<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.470> used<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.860> use<00:01:43.950> metal

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
derived from when we used to use metal

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.240 
derived from when we used to use metal
type<00:01:45.360> slugs<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.649> when<00:01:46.800> you<00:01:46.860> wanted<00:01:47.160> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
type slugs so when you wanted to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.430 
type slugs so when you wanted to
increase<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.640> vertical<00:01:48.240> spacing<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.290> would

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
increase the vertical spacing you would

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.790 
increase the vertical spacing you would
add<00:01:49.649> strips<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.670> lead<00:01:51.360> between<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> lines<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
add strips of lead between the lines and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.920 
add strips of lead between the lines and
to<00:01:53.190> this<00:01:53.310> day<00:01:53.550> we<00:01:53.820> still<00:01:53.850> refer<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> term

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
to this day we still refer to the term

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.380 
to this day we still refer to the term
as<00:01:55.170> letting<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.310> goal<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.090> three

as letting the goal of these three

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.420 
as letting the goal of these three
methods<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.870> spacing<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.620> create<00:01:58.920> even

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
texture throughout the piece you want

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.860 
texture throughout the piece you want
everything<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.549> look<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.690> want

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
everything to look right you want

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.350 
everything to look right you want
everything<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.290> look<00:02:04.409> similar<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.520> evenly

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
everything to look similar and evenly

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
everything to look similar and evenly
spaced<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.380> you're<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> find<00:02:08.070> out

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
spaced and what you're about to find out

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.969 
spaced and what you're about to find out
shortly<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.330> doesn't<00:02:09.899> always<00:02:10.080> mean<00:02:10.619> that

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
shortly is that doesn't always mean that

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.460 
shortly is that doesn't always mean that
the<00:02:11.430> spaces<00:02:11.850> are<00:02:12.000> technically<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.780> same<00:02:13.019> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the spaces are technically the same you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890 
the spaces are technically the same you
have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> create<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.400> illusion<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.660> they

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
have to create the illusion that they

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.860 
have to create the illusion that they
are<00:02:15.930> let's<00:02:16.709> talk<00:02:16.950> about<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.360> helps<00:02:18.720> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
are let's talk about that it helps to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.800 
are let's talk about that it helps to
picture<00:02:19.200> letters<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.739> basic<00:02:20.459> shapes<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.630> in

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
picture letters as basic shapes so in

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.900 
picture letters as basic shapes so in
this<00:02:21.930> case<00:02:22.190> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.340> kind<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this case this is kind of like the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.530 
this case this is kind of like the
letter<00:02:24.090> H<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:26.330> obviously<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.810> letter<00:02:28.019> O<00:02:29.540> now

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
letter H and obviously the letter O now

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.670 
letter H and obviously the letter O now
a<00:02:30.570> lot<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> letters<00:02:31.170> are<00:02:31.320> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> have

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
a lot of letters are going to have

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.820 
a lot of letters are going to have
either<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.340> straight<00:02:33.209> edge<00:02:33.420> or<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.110> curved<00:02:34.530> edge

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
either a straight edge or a curved edge

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
either a straight edge or a curved edge
and<00:02:35.100> certainly<00:02:35.400> there<00:02:35.640> are<00:02:35.670> some<00:02:35.790> exceptions

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
and certainly there are some exceptions

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.940 
and certainly there are some exceptions
and<00:02:36.690> some<00:02:36.930> different<00:02:37.320> shapes<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:37.769> we're

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
and some different shapes but we're

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.620 
and some different shapes but we're
going<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> get<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.340> those<00:02:38.430> exceptions<00:02:39.090> in<00:02:39.239> a

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
going to get to those exceptions in a

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.259 
going to get to those exceptions in a
later<00:02:39.930> lesson<00:02:40.320> now<00:02:41.130> in<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.489> previous<00:02:41.940> lesson<00:02:42.120> we

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
later lesson now in a previous lesson we

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.280 
later lesson now in a previous lesson we
talked<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.950> how<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.549> letter

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
talked about how if you have a letter

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.780 
talked about how if you have a letter
like<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.440> letter<00:02:46.680> O<00:02:46.890> that's<00:02:47.160> curved<00:02:47.489> at<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
like the letter O that's curved at the

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.240 
like the letter O that's curved at the
bottom<00:02:48.060> say<00:02:48.239> this<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.540> our<00:02:48.690> base<00:02:48.870> line<00:02:49.250> it

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
bottom say this is our base line it

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.080 
bottom say this is our base line it
needs<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.910> overshoot<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> base<00:02:53.280> line<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
needs to overshoot the base line just a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.699 
needs to overshoot the base line just a
little<00:02:54.329> bit<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.660> probably<00:02:54.989> should<00:02:55.230> exaggerate

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
little bit I probably should exaggerate

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.140 
little bit I probably should exaggerate
it<00:02:55.829> more<00:02:55.980> just<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.310> really<00:02:56.489> make<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.700> point<00:02:56.940> here

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
it more just to really make a point here

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.190 
it more just to really make a point here
it<00:02:58.110> needs<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.530> overshoot<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.370> base<00:02:59.550> line<00:02:59.849> and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
it needs to overshoot the base line and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.540 
it needs to overshoot the base line and
the<00:03:01.200> reason<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.950> if<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.400> just

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
the reason for that is if you just

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.990 
the reason for that is if you just
barely<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.480> touching

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
barely have it touching

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400 
barely have it touching
baseline<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.660> gonna<00:03:04.840> kind<00:03:05.140> of<00:03:05.200> look<00:03:05.350> like

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
baseline it's gonna kind of look like

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.520 
baseline it's gonna kind of look like
it's<00:03:05.740> floating<00:03:06.310> above<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.230> just<00:03:08.380> a

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
it's floating above so this is just a

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.920 
it's floating above so this is just a
little<00:03:08.800> visual<00:03:09.040> cheat<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:10.300> make<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> look<00:03:10.750> like

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
little visual cheat to make it look like

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.170 
little visual cheat to make it look like
it's<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.170> right<00:03:11.380> size<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:12.400> when<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.640> comes<00:03:12.880> to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
it's the right size now when it comes to

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.680 
it's the right size now when it comes to
letter<00:03:14.050> spacing<00:03:14.640> say<00:03:15.640> these<00:03:15.850> are<00:03:16.000> two<00:03:16.210> H's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
letter spacing say these are two H's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.900 
letter spacing say these are two H's
because<00:03:16.900> they<00:03:17.020> have<00:03:17.200> straight<00:03:17.620> edges<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
because they have straight edges and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.160 
because they have straight edges and
let's<00:03:19.120> say<00:03:19.360> this<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.600> going<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.200> define<00:03:22.170> space

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
let's say this is going to define space

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.070 
let's say this is going to define space
that<00:03:23.470> we<00:03:23.620> want<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.980> use<00:03:24.690> throughout<00:03:25.690> our

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
that we want to use throughout our

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.740 
that we want to use throughout our
composition<00:03:26.770> or<00:03:26.890> throughout<00:03:27.190> our<00:03:27.370> word<00:03:27.750> well

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
composition or throughout our word well

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.350 
composition or throughout our word well
even<00:03:29.110> though<00:03:29.230> over<00:03:29.590> here<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:33.280> point<00:03:33.640> from<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
even though over here the point from the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.500 
even though over here the point from the
very<00:03:34.750> edge<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.350> circle<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:37.209> square

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
very edge of this circle to the square

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.699 
very edge of this circle to the square
is<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.680> same<00:03:39.570> mathematically<00:03:40.570> as<00:03:40.780> this

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
is the same mathematically as this

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.440 
is the same mathematically as this
distance<00:03:42.190> over<00:03:42.370> here<00:03:42.489> with<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.880> two<00:03:43.060> squares

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
distance over here with the two squares

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.070 
distance over here with the two squares
the<00:03:44.200> problem<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.890> these<00:03:45.580> two<00:03:46.060> look<00:03:46.870> like

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
the problem is these two look like

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.320 
the problem is these two look like
they're<00:03:47.350> farther<00:03:47.590> apart<00:03:47.860> they<00:03:48.820> still<00:03:49.150> look

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
they're farther apart they still look

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.550 
they're farther apart they still look
like<00:03:49.360> they're<00:03:49.660> farther<00:03:50.020> apart<00:03:50.170> because

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
like they're farther apart because

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.100 
like they're farther apart because
there's<00:03:51.130> all<00:03:51.340> of<00:03:51.370> this<00:03:51.610> extra<00:03:52.330> space<00:03:52.600> in<00:03:52.870> here

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
there's all of this extra space in here

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.170 
there's all of this extra space in here
and<00:03:53.739> we're<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:53.980> compensating<00:03:54.730> for<00:03:54.910> it<00:03:55.030> so

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
and we're not compensating for it so

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.560 
and we're not compensating for it so
like<00:03:55.750> we<00:03:55.930> do<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.230> overshoot<00:03:56.739> up<00:03:56.980> here<00:03:57.640> with

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
like we do the overshoot up here with

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.690 
like we do the overshoot up here with
the<00:03:58.690> baseline<00:03:59.110> we<00:03:59.709> want<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.070> do<00:04:00.190> something

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
the baseline we want to do something

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.420 
the baseline we want to do something
similar<00:04:01.140> even<00:04:02.140> horizontally<00:04:03.070> when<00:04:03.220> we're

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
similar even horizontally when we're

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
similar even horizontally when we're
spacing<00:04:03.880> letters<00:04:04.209> at<00:04:04.360> least<00:04:04.510> that's<00:04:04.690> how<00:04:04.810> we

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
spacing letters at least that's how we

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.380 
spacing letters at least that's how we
want<00:04:05.170> to<00:04:05.230> think<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:06.090> so<00:04:07.090> you<00:04:07.150> would

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
want to think of it so you would

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.780 
want to think of it so you would
actually<00:04:07.840> cheat<00:04:08.769> this<00:04:09.010> in<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.280> little<00:04:09.549> bit

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
actually cheat this in a little bit

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.990 
actually cheat this in a little bit
I<00:04:10.650> say<00:04:11.650> cheat<00:04:11.920> but<00:04:12.130> it's<00:04:12.280> really<00:04:12.430> just<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.880> way

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
I say cheat but it's really just the way

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.820 
I say cheat but it's really just the way
that<00:04:13.180> you're<00:04:13.360> thinking<00:04:13.390> of<00:04:13.840> it<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.709> know

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
that you're thinking of it you know

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.580 
that you're thinking of it you know
having<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.310> be<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.820> little<00:04:16.209> bit<00:04:16.330> inside<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.049> so

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
having it be a little bit inside and so

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.650 
having it be a little bit inside and so
the<00:04:17.739> distance<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.549> you<00:04:18.880> want<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.120> measure<00:04:19.299> to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
the distance that you want to measure to

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.390 
the distance that you want to measure to
stay<00:04:19.900> consistent<00:04:20.140> with<00:04:20.620> your<00:04:20.709> other<00:04:20.890> pair<00:04:21.160> is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
stay consistent with your other pair is

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.719 
stay consistent with your other pair is
actually<00:04:22.270> from<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:23.440> cheated<00:04:24.040> line<00:04:24.280> that's<00:04:24.640> a

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
actually from this cheated line that's a

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.140 
actually from this cheated line that's a
little<00:04:24.940> bit<00:04:25.090> inside<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.750> curve<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.620> we<00:04:26.770> use

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
little bit inside the curve so if we use

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.159 
little bit inside the curve so if we use
this<00:04:28.150> measurement<00:04:28.570> down<00:04:29.080> here<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.930> would<00:04:32.050> look

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
this measurement down here it would look

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.290 
this measurement down here it would look
something<00:04:32.380> like<00:04:32.560> this<00:04:32.950> so<00:04:33.340> you<00:04:33.370> can<00:04:33.700> tell<00:04:34.000> now

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
something like this so you can tell now

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.530 
something like this so you can tell now
that<00:04:35.020> it's<00:04:35.830> not<00:04:36.040> quite<00:04:36.370> close<00:04:37.060> enough<00:04:37.090> it

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
that it's not quite close enough it

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420 
that it's not quite close enough it
needs<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:37.780> come<00:04:37.990> in<00:04:38.169> just<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.500> little<00:04:38.530> bit<00:04:38.800> now

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
needs to come in just a little bit now

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.430 
needs to come in just a little bit now
down<00:04:39.700> here<00:04:39.729> with<00:04:40.180> this<00:04:40.360> pair<00:04:40.660> I've<00:04:41.229> actually

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
down here with this pair I've actually

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.750 
down here with this pair I've actually
already<00:04:41.770> done<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:42.370> if<00:04:42.610> we<00:04:42.760> imagine<00:04:44.760> that

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
already done that so if we imagine that

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.080 
already done that so if we imagine that
line<00:04:46.590> being<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.650> little<00:04:47.979> bit<00:04:48.100> inside<00:04:48.520> just<00:04:48.910> to

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
line being a little bit inside just to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.700 
line being a little bit inside just to
compensate<00:04:49.630> for<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.870> fact<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.229> curb

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
compensate for the fact that curb

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.980 
compensate for the fact that curb
letters<00:04:51.160> look<00:04:51.850> like<00:04:52.150> they're<00:04:52.419> farther<00:04:52.690> away

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
letters look like they're farther away

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.190 
letters look like they're farther away
because<00:04:53.470> there's<00:04:53.680> only<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.919> very<00:04:54.250> small<00:04:54.970> point

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
because there's only a very small point

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.950 
because there's only a very small point
where<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:56.740> can<00:04:56.919> measure<00:04:57.100> this<00:04:57.340> distance<00:04:57.419> now

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.700 

we<00:05:01.960> have<00:05:02.200> something<00:05:02.770> that<00:05:04.290> lines<00:05:05.290> up<00:05:05.470> pretty

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
we have something that lines up pretty

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.010 
we have something that lines up pretty
well<00:05:05.860> with<00:05:06.040> the<00:05:06.700> consistent<00:05:07.270> spacing<00:05:07.540> we<00:05:07.810> want

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
well with the consistent spacing we want

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.460 
well with the consistent spacing we want
to<00:05:08.110> do<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:09.430> when<00:05:09.610> you're<00:05:09.700> comparing<00:05:10.150> how<00:05:11.050> close

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
to do so when you're comparing how close

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.610 
to do so when you're comparing how close
letters<00:05:11.950> are<00:05:12.070> going<00:05:12.280> to<00:05:12.370> be

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
letters are going to be

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.690 
letters are going to be
the<00:05:14.620> letters<00:05:14.980> that<00:05:15.010> are<00:05:16.470> square<00:05:17.470> are<00:05:18.340> going<00:05:18.610> to

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
the letters that are square are going to

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.580 
the letters that are square are going to
be<00:05:19.350> farthest<00:05:20.350> apart<00:05:21.660> right<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:23.260> letters<00:05:23.560> that

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
be farthest apart right the letters that

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.150 
be farthest apart right the letters that
are<00:05:23.770> square<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.610> circle<00:05:25.390> mixed<00:05:26.140> are<00:05:26.380> going<00:05:26.980> to

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
are square and circle mixed are going to

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.200 
are square and circle mixed are going to
be<00:05:27.480> the<00:05:28.680> next<00:05:29.680> closest<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.790> it's<00:05:30.910> going<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.090> be

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
be the next closest so it's going to be

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.820 
be the next closest so it's going to be
a<00:05:31.420> little<00:05:31.690> bit<00:05:31.900> closer<00:05:32.200> than<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.650> square

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
a little bit closer than the square

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.560 
a little bit closer than the square
because<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.370> square<00:05:33.550> only<00:05:33.790> comes<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.300> here

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
because the square only comes to here

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.540 
because the square only comes to here
the<00:05:35.200> circle<00:05:35.620> will<00:05:35.740> come<00:05:35.890> in<00:05:36.040> just<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.520> little

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
the circle will come in just a little

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.150 
the circle will come in just a little
bit<00:05:36.790> to<00:05:37.000> compensate<00:05:37.180> so<00:05:38.020> this<00:05:38.230> is<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.800> next

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
bit to compensate so this is the next

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.450 
bit to compensate so this is the next
closest<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.820> then<00:05:40.360> for<00:05:40.720> two<00:05:41.230> circles<00:05:41.860> or<00:05:42.100> say

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
closest and then for two circles or say

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.500 
closest and then for two circles or say
this<00:05:42.640> was<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:43.210> P<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.410> this<00:05:45.130> was<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.340> Q<00:05:45.820> so<00:05:46.390> you've

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
this was a P and this was a Q so you've

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.990 
this was a P and this was a Q so you've
got<00:05:46.660> these<00:05:46.810> two<00:05:46.890> rounded<00:05:47.890> edges<00:05:48.430> this<00:05:48.940> is

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
got these two rounded edges this is

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.330 
got these two rounded edges this is
going<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.450> be<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.690> very<00:05:49.870> closest<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:50.980> this<00:05:51.160> is

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
going to be the very closest so this is

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.540 
going to be the very closest so this is
the<00:05:51.520> third<00:05:52.620> pair<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:54.010> is<00:05:54.130> going<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.340> be<00:05:54.430> the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
the third pair this is going to be the

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.350 
the third pair this is going to be the
closest<00:05:54.910> because<00:05:55.270> we're<00:05:56.080> imagining<00:05:57.360> the

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
closest because we're imagining the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.240 
closest because we're imagining the
lines<00:05:58.660> are<00:05:59.080> slightly<00:05:59.650> inside<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.520> curves

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
lines are slightly inside the curves

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.830 
lines are slightly inside the curves
okay<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:03.520> this<00:06:03.790> gives<00:06:04.060> you<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> good<00:06:04.480> base<00:06:04.540> for

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
okay so this gives you a good base for

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.840 
okay so this gives you a good base for
dealing<00:06:05.410> with<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.650> most<00:06:05.830> common<00:06:06.400> shapes<00:06:06.640> of

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
dealing with the most common shapes of

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.670 
dealing with the most common shapes of
letters<00:06:07.180> we<00:06:07.660> learned<00:06:07.900> how<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.110> visually

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
letters we learned how to visually

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.590 
letters we learned how to visually
compensate<00:06:09.280> for<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:09.580> spacing<00:06:10.120> differences

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
compensate for the spacing differences
