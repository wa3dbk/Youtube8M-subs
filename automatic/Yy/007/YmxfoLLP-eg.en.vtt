00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:44.500
 12 group sampling phisher case 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:48.210
 report object 17 desmond miles object 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.159
 was dead time of death about 1:07 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.909
 conditions are favorable for taking samples 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:57.339
 dna we initially had doubts about 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.229
 security hall but thanks to the knowledge and 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:02.829
 group skills we were able to take valuable 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.449
 I personally requisitioned the material 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.549
 facility and after thorough inspection 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.759
 extracted a number of items for a comprehensive 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.759
 analysis 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.869
 on the right hand objects burns high 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.610
 degree bone about coal what indicates 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.240
 on the spontaneous impact of high 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.590
 temperatures to be honest, we see 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.869
 first time head neck torso remained 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 intact 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:37.850
 I personally selected agents for withdrawal 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.590
 blood and saliva samples then we started 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.469
 extract material and managed to keep 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:48.020
 several good samples we have already begun 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:52.340
 analysis and sorting of data that go 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.469
 exceptionally easy thanks to cloudy 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.890
 database and the third group to remove and 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:02.079
 samples Abstergo object 17 will continue 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.079
 existence as a pattern 17
