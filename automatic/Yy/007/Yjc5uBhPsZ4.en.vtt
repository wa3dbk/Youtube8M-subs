in<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:47.550> opinion<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.149> pretty<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.420> comes<00:00:48.629> down

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
in my opinion a pretty much comes down

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
in my opinion a pretty much comes down
to<00:00:48.930> what<00:00:49.050> happens<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.530> January<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.059> bit

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to what happens this January and a bit

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.920 
to what happens this January and a bit
of<00:00:51.270> februari<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.870> guess<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:53.010> man<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:54.030> they

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
of februari I guess now man you they

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
of februari I guess now man you they
need<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.350> midfielder<00:00:55.920> definitely<00:00:56.460> though<00:00:57.239> they

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
need a midfielder definitely though they

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.150 
need a midfielder definitely though they
can<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> injuries<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.890> think

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
can get over all the injuries I think

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.000 
can get over all the injuries I think
man<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.969> still<00:01:00.270> win<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.780> mean<00:01:01.500> man<00:01:01.710> city

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
man you can still win it I mean man city

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.030 
man you can still win it I mean man city

has shown they can sleep up some games

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.520 
has shown they can sleep up some games
maybe<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.369> bad<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.580> United<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:06.990> they<00:01:07.290> can

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
maybe not as bad as United but they can

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.520 
maybe not as bad as United but they can
slip<00:01:07.740> op<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.250> sure<00:01:08.570> if<00:01:09.570> Mancini<00:01:10.229> keep

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

opinion<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> think<00:01:45.630> Arsenal<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.649> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
opinion I think Arsenal will get it I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.889 
opinion I think Arsenal will get it I
think<00:01:47.280> Robbie<00:01:47.520> fan<00:01:47.759> Percy<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.390> be<00:01:48.540> too

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
think Robbie fan Percy will just be too

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.740 
think Robbie fan Percy will just be too
hard<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.200> stop<00:01:49.470> pretty<00:01:49.829> much<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.570> they'll<00:01:51.570> get

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
hard to stop pretty much and they'll get

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.499 
hard to stop pretty much and they'll get
the<00:01:51.840> fourth<00:01:52.079> spot<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:53.000> since<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> gang<00:01:54.270> Terry

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the fourth spot and since the gang Terry

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
the fourth spot and since the gang Terry
honoree<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.140> think<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.829> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.070> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
honoree I think that is going to make it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.649 
honoree I think that is going to make it
even<00:01:56.369> better<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.060> he's<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
even better and I think he's going to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
even better and I think he's going to be
most<00:01:58.500> busy<00:01:58.710> used<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.310> he'll<00:01:59.520> still<00:01:59.610> be

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
most busy used to be but he'll still be

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.230 
most busy used to be but he'll still be
good<00:01:59.969> for<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.810> fifth<00:02:01.799> spot<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.369> predict

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
good for them in fifth spot I predict

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.800 
good for them in fifth spot I predict
probably<00:02:04.189> Chelsea<00:02:05.189> will<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.780> I

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
probably Chelsea will get there I know I

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330 
probably Chelsea will get there I know I
think<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.170> one's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.799> bit<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> in

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
think this one's just a bit that in

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.710 
think this one's just a bit that in
Liverpool<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.000> Liverpool<00:02:09.390> has<00:02:09.509> been

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
Liverpool and Liverpool has been

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.809 
Liverpool and Liverpool has been
slipping<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.379> fair<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.550> Suarez

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
slipping up a fair bit and with Suarez

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.690 
slipping up a fair bit and with Suarez
out<00:02:12.150> for<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> while

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
out for a while

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.430 
out for a while
I<00:02:12.970> think<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.629> going<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.780> make<00:02:13.900> me<00:02:13.959> sleep<00:02:14.230> off

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
I think it's going to make me sleep off

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.369 
I think it's going to make me sleep off
the<00:02:14.560> hell<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.830> lot<00:02:15.629> six<00:02:16.629> and<00:02:16.810> seven<00:02:17.140> is

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
the hell of a lot six and seven is

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.170 
the hell of a lot six and seven is
pretty<00:02:18.040> hard<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> slide<00:02:18.580> between<00:02:18.760> loop<00:02:19.030> or

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
pretty hard to the slide between loop or

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.000 
pretty hard to the slide between loop or
Newcastle<00:02:19.540> but<00:02:19.959> I<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.290> Liverpool<00:02:20.590> should

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
Newcastle but I think Liverpool should

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.589 
Newcastle but I think Liverpool should
be<00:02:21.099> able<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.340> get<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:22.030> they'll<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.569> a

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
be able to get it I think they'll have a

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.839 
be able to get it I think they'll have a
nice<00:02:22.810> run<00:02:23.050> home<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.250> they<00:02:24.370> should<00:02:24.580> be<00:02:24.640> able<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
nice run home so they should be able to

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.580 
nice run home so they should be able to
do<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.060> right<00:02:25.180> now<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> team<00:02:26.260> who<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.470> think

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
do all right now the team who I think

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.420 
do all right now the team who I think
will<00:02:26.920> win<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.670> title<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:28.120> think<00:02:28.800> Manuel<00:02:29.800> win<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
will win the title I think Manuel win it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.250 
will win the title I think Manuel win it
might<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.120> because<00:02:31.330> I'm<00:02:31.510> manual<00:02:31.720> supporter

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
might be because I'm manual supporter

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.600 
might be because I'm manual supporter
but<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:32.950> obviously<00:02:33.160> think<00:02:33.340> they'll<00:02:33.489> be

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
but I just obviously think they'll be

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.160 
but I just obviously think they'll be
able<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> edge<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:33.970> out<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.390> win<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> comp<00:02:35.019> in

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
able to edge it out and win the comp in

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.410 
able to edge it out and win the comp in
the<00:02:35.200> end<00:02:35.410> we<00:02:36.250> always<00:02:36.459> seem<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.760> have<00:02:36.880> better<00:02:37.060> on

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
the end we always seem to have better on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.690 
the end we always seem to have better on
the<00:02:37.690> end<00:02:38.019> of<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.319> year<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.580> that's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the end of the year and I think that's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.869 
the end of the year and I think that's
how<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:39.910> going<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.239> again<00:02:41.220> anyway<00:02:42.220> TGN<00:02:42.610> I've
