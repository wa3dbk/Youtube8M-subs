technic 2014 review on the lego technic
container<00:00:18.090> truck<00:00:18.650> not<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.680> set<00:00:20.100> number<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.550> 42

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
container truck not the set number is 42

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.990 
container truck not the set number is 42
00<00:00:21.689> t<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.880> ages<00:00:23.880> 10<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.210> 16<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.789> it<00:00:26.789> has

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
00 t for ages 10 to 16 and it has

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.640 
00 t for ages 10 to 16 and it has
pneumatics<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> anyway<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:30.230> lift<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> box

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
pneumatics so anyway let's lift the box

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.880 
pneumatics so anyway let's lift the box
and<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.700> find<00:00:33.230> now<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and see what we can find now this is the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.770 
and see what we can find now this is the
full<00:00:35.100> container<00:00:35.730> truck<00:00:36.230> set<00:00:37.340> now<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.969> set<00:00:39.420> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
full container truck set now this set it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.920 
full container truck set now this set it
is<00:00:40.440> large<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.079> it<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> heavy<00:00:43.739> too<00:00:44.570> now<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> can

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
is large and it is heavy too now you can

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.920 
is large and it is heavy too now you can
see<00:00:46.170> us<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.620> switch<00:00:47.450> which<00:00:48.450> does<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
see us this switch which does the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.240 
see us this switch which does the
functions<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> anyway<00:00:51.390> let's<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
functions so anyway let's just get on to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.660 
functions so anyway let's just get on to
the<00:00:53.370> looks<00:00:54.140> now<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.219> design<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the looks now I like this the design of

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.240 
the looks now I like this the design of
this<00:00:56.969> coven<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> says<00:00:58.260> lego

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this coven you can see it says lego

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.090 
this coven you can see it says lego
technic<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.680> see<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.980> off

opening doors to I like that and you can
see<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.590> steering<00:01:14.340> wheel<00:01:15.530> these<00:01:16.530> wing

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
see of the steering wheel these wing

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.810 
see of the steering wheel these wing
mirrors<00:01:17.780> now<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> steering<00:01:20.189> function

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
mirrors now this is a steering function

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.719 
mirrors now this is a steering function
here<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.560> wheels<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.400> very

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here and now these wheels are all very

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.530 
here and now these wheels are all very
smoothly<00:01:27.330> actually<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
smoothly actually so I'm just going to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.880 
smoothly actually so I'm just going to
go<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.430> functions<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.640> techniques

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
go on to the functions and techniques

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.060 
go on to the functions and techniques
now<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.250> little<00:01:35.520> joystick<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:37.070> it

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
now this little joystick here it

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.310 
now this little joystick here it
controls<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.470> outriggers<00:01:40.470> there<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.320> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
controls the outriggers there and to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
controls the outriggers there and to
lift<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.890> container<00:01:44.610> box<00:01:45.030> here<00:01:46.880> now<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
lift this container box here now it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
lift this container box here now it
takes<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.350> few<00:01:49.619> steps<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:51.470> so<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:53.040> used<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
takes a few steps to so get used to the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.469 
takes a few steps to so get used to the
controls<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.909> there<00:01:57.180> are

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
controls but you can it there are

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.039 
controls but you can it there are
stickers<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.140> help<00:01:58.409> though<00:01:59.119> now<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.780> see

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.030 
stickers to help though now you can see
off<00:02:01.290> lots<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> cogs<00:02:02.490> there<00:02:02.960> or<00:02:03.960> gears<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> call

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
off lots of cogs there or gears the call

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.619 
off lots of cogs there or gears the call
it<00:02:06.500> I'm<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.770> gonna<00:02:07.950> show<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.060> functions

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it I'm just gonna show you the functions

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.309 
it I'm just gonna show you the functions
now

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
now

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.190 
now
clay<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.579> other<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.629> truck

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
clay on the other side of this truck

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.059 
clay on the other side of this truck
there's<00:02:14.159> a<00:02:14.219> guy<00:02:14.700> there<00:02:15.590> which<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.920> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
there's a guy there which when the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.679 
there's a guy there which when the
joystick<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.939> turned<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.510> certain<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
joystick is turned to a certain and

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.629 
joystick is turned to a certain and
direction<00:02:21.689> then<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.469> controls<00:02:23.069> different

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
direction then it controls different

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:28.250 
direction then it controls different
parts<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.239> trucks<00:02:24.810> of<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.829> truck<00:02:26.129> here<00:02:27.260> ok

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
parts of the trucks of the truck here ok

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.740 
parts of the trucks of the truck here ok
now<00:02:28.920> I'm<00:02:29.010> going<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.280> switch<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.939> ultra

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
now I'm going to switch it to the ultra

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:39.440 
now I'm going to switch it to the ultra
go<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.079> to<00:02:31.680> show<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:31.980> what<00:02:32.250> happens<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:39.239> can

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
go on to show you what happens you can

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.619 
go on to show you what happens you can
see<00:02:39.689> the<00:02:39.900> outriggers<00:02:40.590> 10<00:02:41.180> well<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.480> they

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
see the outriggers 10 well what they

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.500 
see the outriggers 10 well what they
went<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.169> so<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> if<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.579> container<00:02:45.060> box

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
went down so that if the container box

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.159 
went down so that if the container box
goes<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.680> Dell<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.700> know<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.480> ground<00:02:48.870> or

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
goes like Dell not know on the ground or

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:54.170 
goes like Dell not know on the ground or
just<00:02:49.650> tips<00:02:50.419> then<00:02:51.419> it<00:02:52.109> won't<00:02:52.650> topple<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.849> truck

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
just tips then it won't topple the truck

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.800 
just tips then it won't topple the truck
back<00:02:54.659> so<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:55.709> their<00:02:56.099> stabilizers<00:02:56.969> but<00:02:57.209> they

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
back so this their stabilizers but they

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.929 
back so this their stabilizers but they
don't<00:02:58.109> realistically<00:02:59.569> produce<00:03:00.569> any

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
don't realistically produce any

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.550 
don't realistically produce any
stabilisation<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:04.049> they're<00:03:04.260> pretty<00:03:04.469> much

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
stabilisation so they're pretty much

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.949 
stabilisation so they're pretty much
useless<00:03:05.099> it's<00:03:05.609> just<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:05.969> make<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.329> kind<00:03:06.870> of

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
useless it's just to make it kind of

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.399 
useless it's just to make it kind of
look<00:03:07.260> good<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:09.150> I've<00:03:09.329> switched<00:03:09.689> it<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.079> the

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
look good now I've switched it to the

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:26.550 
look good now I've switched it to the
container<00:03:10.949> one<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:12.150> show<00:03:12.359> you<00:03:12.419> what<00:03:12.689> happens

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.880 

now<00:03:27.560> if<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.400> outriggers<00:03:29.300> are<00:03:29.510> up<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
now if the outriggers are up then the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.010 
now if the outriggers are up then the
container<00:03:31.460> tips<00:03:32.180> its<00:03:32.870> thing<00:03:33.710> upside<00:03:34.190> down<00:03:35.020> but

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
container tips its thing upside down but

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.440 
container tips its thing upside down but
if<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.290> outriggers<00:03:37.130> are<00:03:37.250> down<00:03:37.550> let's<00:03:38.240> show

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
if the outriggers are down let's show

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:53.740 
if the outriggers are down let's show
you<00:03:38.570> what<00:03:38.720> happens<00:03:51.340> now<00:03:52.340> if<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.120> ultra<00:03:53.450> kazar

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
you what happens now if the ultra kazar

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.840 
you what happens now if the ultra kazar
down<00:03:53.990> then<00:03:54.320> it<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.680> lifts<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.310> container

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
down then it just lifts the container

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.760 
down then it just lifts the container
onto<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.450> floor<00:03:57.790> now<00:03:58.790> i<00:03:59.120> really<00:03:59.660> like<00:04:00.050> these

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
onto the floor now i really like these

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.130 
onto the floor now i really like these
functions<00:04:01.550> there<00:04:01.880> well<00:04:02.360> it<00:04:02.660> was<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.930> bit

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
functions there well it was a bit

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.340 
functions there well it was a bit
complicated<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:04.010> build<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.660> you've<00:04:05.810> got<00:04:05.840> cogs

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
complicated to build so you've got cogs

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.530 
complicated to build so you've got cogs
and<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.800> sign<00:04:07.130> there<00:04:08.740> now<00:04:09.760> one<00:04:10.760> thing<00:04:10.790> I<00:04:11.180> found

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
and a sign there now one thing I found

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.070 
and a sign there now one thing I found
out<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:13.070> you<00:04:13.520> can<00:04:13.730> actually<00:04:14.080> motorized

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
out is that you can actually motorized

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.960 
out is that you can actually motorized
this<00:04:15.730> by<00:04:16.730> adding<00:04:16.880> a<00:04:17.270> battery<00:04:17.989> box<00:04:18.230> under<00:04:18.620> one

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
this by adding a battery box under one

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.650 
this by adding a battery box under one
medium<00:04:19.970> motor<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:21.410> includes<00:04:22.010> it<00:04:22.820> requires

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
medium motor it includes it requires

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.010 
medium motor it includes it requires
just<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.290> few<00:04:24.590> steps<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.370> no<00:04:25.670> extra<00:04:26.150> pieces<00:04:26.480> and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
just a few steps and no extra pieces and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.250 
just a few steps and no extra pieces and
it<00:04:27.770> shows<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.460> an<00:04:28.580> instruction<00:04:29.000> booklet<00:04:29.600> to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
it shows you an instruction booklet to

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.070 
it shows you an instruction booklet to
now<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.460> just<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.910> power<00:04:32.120> functions<00:04:32.720> page

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
now it's just the power functions page

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.010 
now it's just the power functions page
there<00:04:33.910> now<00:04:34.910> what<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.180> do<00:04:35.300> is<00:04:35.360> take<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
there now what you do is take the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.620 
there now what you do is take the
container<00:04:36.590> box<00:04:36.980> off<00:04:37.370> oh<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:42.130> then<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.630> use

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
container box off oh and then you use

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.010 
container box off oh and then you use
these<00:04:44.960> two<00:04:45.350> pieces<00:04:46.120> which<00:04:47.120> are<00:04:47.360> on<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.630> truck

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
these two pieces which are on the truck

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.870 
these two pieces which are on the truck
there<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:49.400> take<00:04:49.700> them<00:04:50.000> off<00:04:50.650> then<00:04:51.650> this<00:04:52.280> then

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
there you take them off then this then

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.350 
there you take them off then this then
you'd<00:04:53.480> use<00:04:53.720> those<00:04:54.050> two<00:04:54.830> pieces<00:04:55.130> there<00:04:55.580> you

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
you'd use those two pieces there you

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.480 
you'd use those two pieces there you
pull<00:04:56.720> them<00:04:56.930> out<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:58.810> then<00:04:59.810> use<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.680> trip

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
pull them out and then use the trip

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.040 
pull them out and then use the trip
double-a<00:05:02.330> battery<00:05:02.870> box<00:05:03.610> which<00:05:04.610> goes<00:05:05.420> with

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
double-a battery box which goes with

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.530 
double-a battery box which goes with
those<00:05:06.350> two<00:05:06.680> pieces<00:05:07.480> there<00:05:09.430> now<00:05:10.430> that's<00:05:11.300> why

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
those two pieces there now that's why

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.180 
those two pieces there now that's why
you<00:05:11.620> battery<00:05:12.620> box<00:05:12.860> goes<00:05:13.280> and<00:05:14.680> that's<00:05:15.680> why<00:05:15.950> your

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
you battery box goes and that's why your

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.330 
you battery box goes and that's why your
motor<00:05:16.550> girls<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:21.500> can<00:05:21.710> actually<00:05:21.890> a<00:05:22.100> motor

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
motor girls and you can actually a motor

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.770 
motor girls and you can actually a motor
to<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:22.700> battery<00:05:23.210> box<00:05:23.510> there<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:26.180> now<00:05:26.450> it's

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
to the battery box there that now it's

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.010 
to the battery box there that now it's
ready<00:05:27.050> to<00:05:27.350> be<00:05:27.410> used<00:05:27.740> when<00:05:28.520> motorized

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
ready to be used when motorized

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.200 
ready to be used when motorized
now<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.259> a<00:05:31.530> cut<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.099> I<00:05:32.219> might<00:05:32.580> do<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.849> video

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
now if a cut and I might do a video

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.409 
now if a cut and I might do a video
where<00:05:33.719> I'll<00:05:34.439> get<00:05:35.099> the<00:05:35.280> power<00:05:35.610> functions<00:05:36.210> and

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
where I'll get the power functions and

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.939 
where I'll get the power functions and
actually<00:05:36.810> put<00:05:37.110> it<00:05:37.139> on<00:05:37.409> this<00:05:37.590> truck<00:05:38.990> now<00:05:39.990> the

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
actually put it on this truck now the

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:46.309 
actually put it on this truck now the
functions<00:05:41.699> work<00:05:42.509> very<00:05:43.020> slowly<00:05:43.680> by<00:05:44.219> hand<00:05:44.610> but<00:05:45.479> a

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
functions work very slowly by hand but a

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.330 
functions work very slowly by hand but a
lot<00:05:46.650> faster<00:05:47.219> by<00:05:47.370> power<00:05:47.729> functions<00:05:49.280> okay<00:05:50.280> so

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
lot faster by power functions okay so

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.059 
lot faster by power functions okay so
