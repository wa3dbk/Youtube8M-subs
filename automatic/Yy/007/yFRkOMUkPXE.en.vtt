 and now all here another video and in this 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.230
 Once we are in a video tutorial 

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.059
 about minecraft minecraft edition and 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.340
 because this time it's up to you in a way 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.349
 a mod that's good you know we're going to go 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.050
 going up mod and this time 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.529
 not with so much special because it's enough 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.620
 good is the dogma or items for our 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.690
 Minecraft 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.760
 good for those who do not know how is this 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.160
 You can also stay so that 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 see well how because I'll explain 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.240
 how to install because if the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.920
 installation of this is a little more 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:37.640
 different from how I had already taught 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.340
 previously I do not usually teach 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.090
 install a particular mode but then 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 this time yes because you see is a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 so special the installation of this of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.140
 this mod ok ok to be able to install 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 this way because first of all we 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.190
 we will have to go to the link that I leave in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.550
 the description of the video that is by 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.040
 assimilate you want to stop a page as well 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.070
 with many letters that day because that 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.780
 download or what we do here because this 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.080
 what we are going to do is copy the link 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.340
 that link is the link that is up here 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.380
 we are going to copy it we are going to give 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.539
 that link that is up here all this 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.659
 link that is up here we are going to 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:27.170
 copy absolutely everything well so we go 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.840
 to copy ok since we copy it we go 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.190
 to go to our well to our blog 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 launcher 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.750
 here where it says then we're going to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.360
 manage scripts mode 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.600
 let's go import and we will ask 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.930
 when in fact if they have seen each other 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.600
 we install some dots and points 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.430
 it does not tell us important that from where 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.010
 we want to import it appears 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.250
 simply 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.740
 select the folder and when we want 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.380
 install a motorcycle script if it does not come out 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.380
 import script from storage 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.020
 local official clip repo division web or 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 clipboard because we 're going to 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.810
 give the web address 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.239
 and here we have that so we have 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.310
 what to do take off that address 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.340
 We accept and what will happen then 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.190
 we will appear the take items as point 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.980
 js as if we gave a signal some 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.860
 file or the like this is how it 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.569

 we change it 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.290

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.100
 Well, nothing, guys. 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.409
 Well if you liked the mod you know here 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.119
 Well, just here, look 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:33.129
 if I 'm going to tell you in the blocks of 

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:35.080
 construction you can put the 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.279
 number of blocks that wanted to see me 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.510
 before leaving this the block for example 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:43.290
 lapis lazuli 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.290
 less 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.379
 sometimes we're restless because 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.650
 we are in survival we can choose 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:57.900
 the number of blocks for example land 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.400
 we can grab a stack or this is 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.569
 it would be here we can put the number that 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.569
 we want blocks 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.000
 in fact we can also change the damage 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.040
 that produces if we want a sword and 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.080
 we put a bigger damage because it is already 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.430
 today you will win a 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.010
 what kills me 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.860
 and well there we put it and there it puts 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.819
 a footballer who is going to look like that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:29.349
 this 64 d 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:31.240
 264 of what we choose to be that is 64 or 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.889
