over<00:00:58.260> pronation<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.190> another<00:00:59.370> nice<00:00:59.579> update<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over pronation so another nice update to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
over pronation so another nice update to
that<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.420> did<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> outsole<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> shoe

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
that they did to the outsole of the shoe

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.340 
that they did to the outsole of the shoe
was<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.789> made<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> back<00:01:03.899> portion<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
was that they made the back portion a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.899 
was that they made the back portion a
little<00:01:04.530> bit<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.739> shallow<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
little bit more shallow so a lot of

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.010 
little bit more shallow so a lot of
times<00:01:06.090> when<00:01:06.210> people<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.479> running<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.930> soon

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
times when people are running in as soon

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.600 
times when people are running in as soon
as<00:01:07.140> they<00:01:07.290> were<00:01:07.350> getting<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> ball

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
as they were getting those kind of ball

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.380 
as they were getting those kind of ball
or<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.790> lot<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> ice<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
or see things like that a lot of ice and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
or see things like that a lot of ice and
snow<00:01:12.869> would<00:01:13.110> also<00:01:13.260> accumulate<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.159> cut<00:01:14.369> out

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
snow would also accumulate that cut out

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300 
snow would also accumulate that cut out
here<00:01:14.760> where<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> fan<00:01:15.240> wave<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:17.159> they

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here where the fan wave is so they

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.260 
here where the fan wave is so they
actually<00:01:17.610> made<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.150> more

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
actually made that a little bit more

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.710 
actually made that a little bit more
shallow<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> really<00:01:19.380> nice<00:01:23.479> so<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
shallow which is really nice so one of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.300 
shallow which is really nice so one of
