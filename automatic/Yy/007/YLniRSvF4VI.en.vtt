00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.320
 try number 25 that something 1500th 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.820
 mobile phone 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.190
 So I have this device from the fox 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.109
 get senders address just look 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.160
 you can see it yes there always is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.330
 on it puppy logistics fulfillment 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.770
 Diamond Street 7 in 6 54 68 Trebur 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.530
 Germany interesting senders like that 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.740
 also advises 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:45.560
 it's a fancy 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.790
 This looks like the galaxy s 4 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.640
 but not that essential here 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:01:00.300
 more so to good grip of the city 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.199
 which was totally nice with the light 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.040
 very cool 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.840
 even the times you can 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.800
 scroll infinitely 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.110
 I know young, the on and off 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:18.420
 i cant know so then it fits 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.729
 the display for the price very very bright 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.100
 which is now less than 30 percent to 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 an attitude 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.659
 So therefore fits and it comes 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:34.830
 is very loud I have also to 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:38.009
 say so we'll have a look 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:49.009
 camera on widget to the funny to 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:49.009
 show camera like camera a photo 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.840
 I think it's very practical 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.280
 Everything in the winter glove has so 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.810
 that is not bad and if you then 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:11.770
 the pictures will look at everyone 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.209
 If not bad, I would say where 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.430
 it bothers you on this home 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.620
 screen if you happen to be up there 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.470
 On it one comes off 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 then he leafs through what god how far and 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.050
 I'm just in the beginning too 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.640
 preceded this is a defective on 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.600
 It was not what it was 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.130
 is not apparently had a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.890
 flashing so these funny leds the 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.060
 for decision makers completely otherwise 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.269
 I really say it's damned 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.190
 quickly do the part and standard things 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.180
 so and many many many apps already 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.180
 preinstalled 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.590
 and that's why I think he will 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.390
 so consume so much ram 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.780
 that is of course the question but the 2 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.819
 gb ram as fake that has or can not 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.659
 Unfortunately I do not say if you are 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:20.709
 At that time I feel very short 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:20.709
 Under the attitudes the world can do so 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:32.080
 better on enough so bad android 2.2 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:34.110
 get away less 345 from 2 september 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:42.010
 third was read nick 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:49.200
 Options are over don so very 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.200
 a lot more stuff if registered 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.020
 what you get displayed the 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.810
 Developer option so it is already 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:01.200
 Neat if I like my phone 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.200
 thinks I have only professional in it 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.290
 otherwise 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.040
 sometimes you have to keep testing that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.970
 was a very small overview of 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.549
 the device like that to show 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:25.670
 wlan is good so it is even better here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:28.050
 if we have one over my po what 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:33.690
 to do one 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.690
 jack still wanting 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.680
 Here about where you fit 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.240
 4 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.560
 So yes from the processing yes 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.210
 I can not say you can see that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.210
 really great 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.060
 gap dimensions 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.060
 should i with why 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.610
 that works only the case for 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.830
 rubber sleeve the device itself 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.830
 So everything is very solid 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.850
 What else is there to be important 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.220
 could now be very fast 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.780
 Unfortunately , I can not test control gps 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.610
 photos works too we already have 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:36.540
 tested led is not 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.890
 I 'll do that very briefly, we want that 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.480
 Not 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.930
 ringtones and maybe you can 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.650
 Let's rough the volume the victims 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.650
 fall 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:06:00.909
 that's already more loud though 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.530
 is not overdriven it is loud and 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.289
 is not overridden so no scratching 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.389
 or to hear that I think so 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.389
 really really good 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.349
 the led is also quite bright 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.570
 and everything else will show up soon 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.800
 I have my own I would sometimes 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.580
 look more closely and a little something 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.560
 show the thing 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.560
 okay that's it then first of me
