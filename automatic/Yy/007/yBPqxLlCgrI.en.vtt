00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.050 
determine the exact center of these two
boards<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.560> it's<00:02:17.890> pretty<00:02:18.400> easy<00:02:18.519> just<00:02:18.700> take<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
boards so it's pretty easy just take a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.780 
boards so it's pretty easy just take a
straightedge<00:02:19.620> go<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:20.860> corner<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.220> corner<00:02:21.310> on

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
straightedge go from corner to corner on

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.559 
straightedge go from corner to corner on
here<00:02:22.140> draw<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> pencil<00:02:23.440> line

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
here draw a pencil line

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.830 
here draw a pencil line
then<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.709> other<00:02:26.829> corner<00:02:27.249> to<00:02:27.340> corner<00:02:30.840> another

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
then the other corner to corner another

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.170 
then the other corner to corner another
pencil<00:02:32.200> line<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.519> you<00:02:33.609> know<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.969> that

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
pencil line and then you know that that

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.379 
pencil line and then you know that that
is<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.870> exact<00:02:35.260> center<00:02:35.859> of<00:02:35.889> that<00:02:36.670> rectangle

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:37.389 
is the exact center of that rectangle

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.729 
is the exact center of that rectangle
now<00:02:37.629> we'll<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.989> do<00:02:38.139> that<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.469> the<00:02:38.590> other

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
now we'll just do that to the other

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.589 
now we'll just do that to the other
board<00:02:38.980> make<00:02:39.730> sure<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.999> can<00:02:40.150> find<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.450> center

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
board make sure we can find the center

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.869 
board make sure we can find the center
of<00:02:40.719> this<00:02:42.599> okay<00:02:43.599> our<00:02:43.719> next<00:02:44.019> step<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:45.459> we<00:02:45.670> have<00:02:45.700> to

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
of this okay our next step is we have to

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.330 
of this okay our next step is we have to
cut<00:02:46.269> one<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:47.109> the<00:02:47.200> corners<00:02:47.650> off<00:02:47.859> of<00:02:48.010> each<00:02:48.159> of

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cut one of the corners off of each of

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.280 
cut one of the corners off of each of
these<00:02:48.430> boards<00:02:48.969> so<00:02:49.780> we<00:02:49.810> need<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.109> make<00:02:50.230> a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
these boards so we need to make a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.270 
these boards so we need to make a
rectangle<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.310> rectangle<00:02:51.689> cut<00:02:52.689> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.859> corner

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
rectangle a rectangle cut in the corner

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.869 
rectangle a rectangle cut in the corner
and<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:54.909> want<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.299> rectangle

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
and we want that rectangle

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.970 
and we want that rectangle
three-and-a-half<00:02:57.879> inches<00:02:58.590> by<00:02:59.590> five<00:02:59.950> inches

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
three-and-a-half inches by five inches

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.140 
three-and-a-half inches by five inches
wide<00:03:00.579> so<00:03:01.569> I'll<00:03:01.659> measure<00:03:01.870> down<00:03:02.969> three<00:03:03.969> and<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
wide so I'll measure down three and a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.179 
wide so I'll measure down three and a
half<00:03:04.299> inches<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.260> corner<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:07.859> then<00:03:08.859> of

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 
half inches on the corner here then of

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:14.849 
half inches on the corner here then of
course<00:03:09.430> five<00:03:09.669> inches<00:03:10.000> across<00:03:10.239> the<00:03:10.540> top<00:03:13.859> then

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
course five inches across the top then

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:27.179 
course five inches across the top then
I'll<00:03:14.980> mark<00:03:15.219> that<00:03:15.280> rectangle<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:27.040> now<00:03:27.159> I

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
I'll mark that rectangle out and now I

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.420 
I'll mark that rectangle out and now I
have<00:03:27.459> to<00:03:27.609> cut<00:03:27.909> this<00:03:28.480> rectangle<00:03:28.989> out<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:30.310> this

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
have to cut this rectangle out of this

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.429 
have to cut this rectangle out of this
board<00:03:30.729> and<00:03:30.970> I'll<00:03:31.389> do<00:03:31.599> that<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.959> both<00:03:32.169> of<00:03:32.349> these

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 
board and I'll do that to both of these

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:36.659 
board and I'll do that to both of these
pieces<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.150> have<00:03:34.479> our<00:03:34.629> two<00:03:34.840> 8<00:03:35.650> by<00:03:36.009> 16

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
pieces now we have our two 8 by 16
