00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
like gum sold almost it's not clear and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.410 
like gum sold almost it's not clear and
I<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> fact<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.910> clear<00:02:12.270> it's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
I like the fact that it's not clear it's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
I like the fact that it's not clear it's
kind<00:02:12.629> of<00:02:12.660> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
kind of this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.830 
kind of this
it<00:02:14.010> gives<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.340> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.519> an<00:02:14.640> aged<00:02:14.819> look<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.390> at

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it gives it kind of an aged look but at

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.880 
it gives it kind of an aged look but at
the<00:02:15.930> same<00:02:16.080> time<00:02:16.319> I'm<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.590> sure<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.800> that's

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
the same time I'm not sure if that's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.640 
the same time I'm not sure if that's
what<00:02:17.099> they<00:02:17.160> were<00:02:17.250> trying<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:18.019> obtain<00:02:19.019> but<00:02:19.440> it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
what they were trying to obtain but it

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.600 
what they were trying to obtain but it
looks<00:02:19.860> cool<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.190> opinion

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
looks cool in my opinion
