so<00:00:29.640> anyway<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.449> first<00:00:30.660> thing<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:30.960> they

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
so anyway the first thing I think they

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.240 
so anyway the first thing I think they
are<00:00:31.230> going<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:31.560> adding<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:31.980> next

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
are going to be adding in the next

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.479 
are going to be adding in the next
update<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:33.090> new<00:00:33.270> NPCs<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.079> mobs<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:35.040> think

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
update is some new NPCs and mobs I think

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
update is some new NPCs and mobs I think
that<00:00:35.640> they<00:00:35.820> are<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.630> iron<00:00:36.870> golems

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that they are going to be iron golems

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
that they are going to be iron golems
and<00:00:37.530> ocelots<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.280> hope<00:00:38.670> ocelots<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.450> least

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and ocelots I hope ocelots at least

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.450 
and ocelots I hope ocelots at least
because<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.710> are<00:00:40.800> hopefully<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.370> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
because they are hopefully going to be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
because they are hopefully going to be
adding<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.760> jungle<00:00:42.090> biome<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.510> well<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.899> that's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
adding a jungle biome as well so that's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
adding a jungle biome as well so that's
kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> three<00:00:43.649> things<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:43.980> hoping<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
kind of three things I'm hoping for the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.180 
kind of three things I'm hoping for the
jungle<00:00:44.820> biome<00:00:45.320> ocelots<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> iron<00:00:46.710> golems<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
jungle biome ocelots and iron golems I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.529 
jungle biome ocelots and iron golems I
think<00:00:47.370> iron<00:00:47.579> golems<00:00:47.879> are<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.030> long<00:00:48.270> time<00:00:48.510> coming

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
think iron golems are a long time coming

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.650 
think iron golems are a long time coming
with<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.469> villagers<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.250> end<00:00:50.510> so<00:00:51.510> i<00:00:51.539> think

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
with the villagers in the end so i think

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180 
with the villagers in the end so i think
that<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> villagers<00:00:52.500> now<00:00:52.710> need<00:00:52.890> somebody<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that the villagers now need somebody to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.130 
that the villagers now need somebody to
protect<00:00:53.489> them<00:00:53.640> from<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.809> nasty

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
protect them from the little nasty

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.350 
protect them from the little nasty
zombies<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.649> hopefully<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.039> future

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
zombies and then hopefully in the future

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.939 
zombies and then hopefully in the future
zombie<00:00:57.360> villagers<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.469> anyway<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.859> don't

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
zombie villagers but anyway i don't

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.930 
zombie villagers but anyway i don't
think<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.190> coming<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> next<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.910> I

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
think that's coming in the next one I

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.760 
think that's coming in the next one I
think<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.480> ocelots<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.230> iron<00:01:01.410> golems<00:01:01.710> are

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
think that ocelots and iron golems are

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
think that ocelots and iron golems are
probably<00:01:02.129> going<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> only<00:01:02.789> two<00:01:03.149> new

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
probably going to be the only two new

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.690 
probably going to be the only two new
NPCs<00:01:03.899> added<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.250> wrong<00:01:05.460> I'm

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
NPCs added I don't know if I'm wrong I'm

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.980 
NPCs added I don't know if I'm wrong I'm
wrong<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.180> let<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> guys

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
wrong but let me know what you guys

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530 
wrong but let me know what you guys
think<00:01:07.200> on<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.939> said<00:01:09.000> jungle

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
think on that and like I said jungle

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060 
think on that and like I said jungle
biomes<00:01:09.900> would<00:01:10.020> be<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.260> cool<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.740> add<00:01:10.860> some

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
biomes would be very cool to add some

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.429 
biomes would be very cool to add some
diversity<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> landscape<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
diversity to the landscape so you can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.370 
diversity to the landscape so you can
see<00:01:13.650> more<00:01:13.890> than<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.159> sand<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.180> dirt<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.229> get

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
see more than just sand and dirt you get

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830 
see more than just sand and dirt you get
to<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.619> bright<00:01:17.220> green<00:01:17.430> dirt<00:01:17.610> too<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.509> anyway

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
to see bright green dirt too so anyway

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
to see bright green dirt too so anyway
that's<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> things<00:01:19.770> I'm<00:01:19.920> hoping<00:01:20.159> for

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that's some of the things I'm hoping for

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's some of the things I'm hoping for
I'm<00:01:20.490> also<00:01:20.700> hoping<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.450> add<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
I'm also hoping that they add in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 
I'm also hoping that they add in
tripwire<00:01:22.350> because<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.310> will<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.640> expand

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
tripwire because it will really expand

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.270 
tripwire because it will really expand
the<00:01:24.509> ability<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> people<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.530> create<00:01:25.799> traps

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the ability of people to create traps

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
the ability of people to create traps
and<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.759> them<00:01:26.939> not<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.420> obvious<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.990> mean

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and have them not be obvious I mean

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.780 
and have them not be obvious I mean
pressure<00:01:28.860> plates<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.310> great<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.670> they're

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
pressure plates are great but they're

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.280 
pressure plates are great but they're
not<00:01:29.939> great<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> have<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> random

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
not great when you have a random

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.660 
not great when you have a random
pressure<00:01:31.710> plate<00:01:32.009> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> middle<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pressure plate in the middle of the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
pressure plate in the middle of the
desert<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> might<00:01:34.439> be

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
desert and people like and that might be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.289 
desert and people like and that might be
a<00:01:34.560> little<00:01:34.710> suspicious<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:35.909> tripwire

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a little suspicious but with tripwire

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
a little suspicious but with tripwire
you<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.689> kill<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.049> pretty<00:01:37.320> easily<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.920> they

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you can kill them pretty easily and they

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.469 
you can kill them pretty easily and they
would<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.340> absolutely<00:01:38.549> no<00:01:38.939> idea<00:01:38.970> what

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
would have absolutely no idea what

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
would have absolutely no idea what
happened<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.380> anyway<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.740> something<00:01:41.100> I'm

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
happened so anyway that's something I'm

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.609 
happened so anyway that's something I'm
hoping<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.610> as<00:01:41.729> well<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> last<00:01:43.409> thing

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
hoping for as well and the last thing

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.810 
hoping for as well and the last thing
and<00:01:43.799> probably<00:01:43.890> least<00:01:44.220> important<00:01:44.610> thing<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
and probably least important thing I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.039 
and probably least important thing I
think<00:01:44.850> they're<00:01:45.210> probably<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> add<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
think they're probably going to add is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.249 
think they're probably going to add is
upside<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.009> stairs<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.640> slabs<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
upside down stairs and slabs I think

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.210 
upside down stairs and slabs I think
that<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:49.590> going<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.040> simply

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that they're going to do this simply

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
that they're going to do this simply
because<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.960> least

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
because it would be I would at least

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.260 
because it would be I would at least
assume<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:52.979> easy<00:01:53.250> thing<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.759> add<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.119> i'm

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
assume a very easy thing to add in i'm

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
assume a very easy thing to add in i'm
not<00:01:54.450> sure<00:01:54.750> why<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.200> didn't<00:01:55.500> add<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> when

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
not sure why they didn't add it when

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
not sure why they didn't add it when
they<00:01:56.610> change<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.270> color<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.079> wood<00:01:58.530> planks

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they change the color on the wood planks

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
they change the color on the wood planks
you<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.210> would<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.540> easy<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you think that would be an easy thing to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.319 
you think that would be an easy thing to
add<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.530> an<00:02:01.649> upside<00:02:01.979> down<00:02:02.009> block<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.180> one

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
add just an upside down block of the one

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
add just an upside down block of the one
that<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.630> already<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.829> whatever<00:02:05.790> for

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that we already have but whatever for

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.580 
that we already have but whatever for
whatever<00:02:06.270> reason<00:02:06.540> they<00:02:06.630> didn't<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.200> i<00:02:07.229> hope

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
whatever reason they didn't so i hope

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.900 
whatever reason they didn't so i hope
that<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> next<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.729> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that they do that in the next one just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
that they do that in the next one just
to<00:02:09.149> add<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.660> more<00:02:09.690> aesthetics<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.739> allow<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
to add in more aesthetics and allow you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.880 
to add in more aesthetics and allow you
to<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.209> things<00:02:12.270> with<00:02:12.599> your<00:02:12.810> creation

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to do more things with your creation

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.350 
to do more things with your creation
anyway<00:02:14.220> those<00:02:14.430> are<00:02:14.460> again<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.970> things<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.330> I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
anyway those are again the things that I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360 
anyway those are again the things that I
think<00:02:15.810> compare<00:02:16.319> what<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
think compare what I think to what you

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.180 
think compare what I think to what you
thought<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:18.030> we<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.630> see<00:02:18.660> if<00:02:19.380> we<00:02:19.500> were<00:02:19.950> right

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
thought and we can see if we were right

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.280 
thought and we can see if we were right
or<00:02:20.430> way<00:02:20.700> wrong<00:02:20.940> which<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.750> probably<00:02:21.990> likely

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
or way wrong which is probably likely

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.809 
or way wrong which is probably likely
because<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> always<00:02:22.890> watch<00:02:23.130> these<00:02:23.250> videos<00:02:23.340> and

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
because I always watch these videos and

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.000 
because I always watch these videos and
then<00:02:23.910> people<00:02:24.060> who<00:02:24.330> did<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.720> were<00:02:25.170> way<00:02:25.380> off<00:02:25.560> so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
then people who did them were way off so

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.340 
then people who did them were way off so
I'm<00:02:26.130> sure<00:02:26.280> will<00:02:26.430> be<00:02:26.550> way<00:02:26.790> off<00:02:27.000> but<00:02:27.900> regardless

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
I'm sure will be way off but regardless

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.040 
I'm sure will be way off but regardless
it's<00:02:28.650> fun<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.160> speculate<00:02:29.850> spec<00:02:30.540> expect<00:02:30.959> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
it's fun to do speculate spec expect a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.490 
it's fun to do speculate spec expect a
speculation<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.940> good<00:02:33.209> thing<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.660> anyway<00:02:34.410> if

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
speculation is a good thing so anyway if

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.900 
speculation is a good thing so anyway if
