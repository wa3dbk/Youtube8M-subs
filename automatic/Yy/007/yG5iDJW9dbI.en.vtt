00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
that I just got some blocked wheels and

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.920 
that I just got some blocked wheels and
I'm<00:00:17.630> about<00:00:18.020> to<00:00:18.380> add<00:00:18.590> weight<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.310> them<00:00:19.700> to<00:00:20.510> give

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
I'm about to add weight to them to give

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.420 
I'm about to add weight to them to give
my<00:00:21.260> crawler<00:00:21.680> more<00:00:22.400> stability<00:00:23.290> so<00:00:24.290> these<00:00:25.070> are

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
my crawler more stability so these are

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.930 
my crawler more stability so these are
the<00:00:25.849> wheel<00:00:26.240> tablets<00:00:26.869> as<00:00:27.079> you<00:00:27.230> can<00:00:27.439> see

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
the wheel tablets as you can see

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.380 
the wheel tablets as you can see
let<00:00:29.300> me<00:00:29.570> give<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:29.840> a<00:00:30.050> quick<00:00:30.470> look<00:00:30.710> of<00:00:31.039> them<00:00:31.390> as

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
let me give you a quick look of them as

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.870 
let me give you a quick look of them as
you<00:00:33.290> can<00:00:33.470> see<00:00:33.650> these<00:00:33.980> are<00:00:35.620> tablets<00:00:36.620> these<00:00:37.610> are

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
you can see these are tablets these are

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.310 
you can see these are tablets these are
small<00:00:38.390> bars<00:00:38.660> that<00:00:39.410> you<00:00:39.440> can<00:00:40.129> bend<00:00:40.640> to<00:00:40.850> shape

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
small bars that you can bend to shape

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.020 
small bars that you can bend to shape
and<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.620> idea<00:00:42.890> is<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.070> wrap<00:00:43.340> it<00:00:43.520> around<00:00:43.610> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
and the idea is to wrap it around the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.080 
and the idea is to wrap it around the
wheel<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.850> let's<00:00:47.480> get<00:00:47.690> started<00:00:48.230> first<00:00:49.220> off<00:00:49.519> we

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
wheel so let's get started first off we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.740 
wheel so let's get started first off we
are<00:00:50.120> going<00:00:50.269> to<00:00:50.900> bend<00:00:51.620> them<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.239> wheel<00:00:53.420> tray

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
are going to bend them to the wheel tray

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.729 
are going to bend them to the wheel tray
so<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:54.350> can<00:00:54.800> grab<00:00:55.129> an<00:00:55.309> idea<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:56.030> how<00:00:56.870> many<00:00:56.930> we

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
so we can grab an idea of how many we

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.170 
so we can grab an idea of how many we
will<00:00:57.920> need<00:00:58.870> so<00:00:59.870> as<00:01:00.620> you<00:01:00.830> can<00:01:01.010> see<00:01:01.280> just<00:01:01.550> bending

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
will need so as you can see just bending

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.160 
will need so as you can see just bending
them<00:01:02.540> right<00:01:02.840> now<00:01:03.520> and<00:01:04.520> let's<00:01:05.300> grab<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:05.690> quick

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
them right now and let's grab a quick

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.480 
them right now and let's grab a quick
look<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.770> see<00:01:07.000> how<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.210> fits

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.690 

okay<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.460> need<00:01:14.670> a

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
okay as you can see we will need a

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.330 
okay as you can see we will need a
couple<00:01:15.000> more<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.140> whole<00:01:16.439> meal<00:01:18.049> so<00:01:19.340> I'll

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
couple more to the whole meal so I'll

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.520 
couple more to the whole meal so I'll
just<00:01:20.790> cut<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:22.380> pieces<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.979> three<00:01:23.310> you

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
just cut them to pieces of three you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.430 
just cut them to pieces of three you
you<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.340> see<00:01:25.640> that<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.180> just<00:01:26.390> peel<00:01:26.810> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
you can see that I can just peel the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.910 
you can see that I can just peel the
back<00:01:27.890> of<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.190> waist<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:29.590> also<00:01:30.590> see<00:01:30.890> that

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
back of the waist you also see that

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.310 
back of the waist you also see that
these<00:01:31.280> are<00:01:31.490> glued<00:01:31.909> or<00:01:32.210> these<00:01:32.510> have<00:01:32.720> glue<00:01:33.259> in

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
these are glued or these have glue in

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.249 
these are glued or these have glue in
the<00:01:33.500> back<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:35.180> need<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.570> press<00:01:35.960> them

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
the back so you just need to press them

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.039 
the back so you just need to press them
against<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.920> wheel<00:01:37.360> until<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.720> feel<00:01:39.020> it

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
against the wheel until you feel it

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:39.999 
against the wheel until you feel it
secure

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
secure

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.290 
secure
of<00:01:40.729> course<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:41.330> best<00:01:41.690> or<00:01:42.050> recommended<00:01:42.950> to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
of course it's best or recommended to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.969 
of course it's best or recommended to
not<00:01:44.300> use<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.320> wheel

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
not use the wheel

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.240 
not use the wheel
immediately<00:01:46.310> after<00:01:47.149> gluing<00:01:47.450> this<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:48.009> given<00:01:49.009> I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
immediately after gluing this a given I

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.249 
immediately after gluing this a given I
would<00:01:49.729> say<00:01:49.909> 24<00:01:50.570> hours<00:01:50.869> before<00:01:51.140> using<00:01:51.530> them<00:01:53.259> so

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
would say 24 hours before using them so

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.080 
would say 24 hours before using them so
I'll<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:55.580> fast<00:01:56.299> forward<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.009> you<00:01:58.460> guys<00:01:58.700> can

let's<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.570> assemble<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.350> other<00:03:01.380> one<00:03:02.240> okay

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
let's just assemble the other one okay

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.920 
let's just assemble the other one okay
so<00:03:03.530> before<00:03:04.530> going<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.520> other<00:03:05.670> tools<00:03:06.060> let

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
so before going to the other tools let

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.500 
so before going to the other tools let
me<00:03:07.050> show<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.410> these<00:03:07.830> tablets<00:03:08.280> have<00:03:08.670> 12

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
me show you that these tablets have 12

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.890 
me show you that these tablets have 12
bars<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.010> placed<00:03:11.400> fourteen<00:03:12.180> bars<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.810> the

bars and I placed fourteen bars on the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.920 
bars and I placed fourteen bars on the
front<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> wheels<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.640> we'll<00:03:15.030> add<00:03:15.210> twelve

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
front of the wheels and we'll add twelve
