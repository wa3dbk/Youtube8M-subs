00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.050
 Hello friends, our first you can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 say unofficial greetings with game 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.420
 2015 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.430
 why informal yes because 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.660
 the exhibition actually begins still 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.590
 only tomorrow but cunning developers 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.800
 today already managed to push their 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:38.550
 cozy nest press including 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 were and we with alexandra cost which 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.219
 probably already been waiting for when she 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.280
 have the opportunity to tell you 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.059
 o call of duty black ops 3 come on sasha 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 cheek 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.620
 Yes, I was given to play multiplayer call of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.840
 duty black ops 3 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.969
 his what I want to tell you is that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.239
 developers are trying something new 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.399
 bring to the game but it's also obvious that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.229
 they take these innovations from others 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 projects if you know what I mean 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.890
 but I suggest not to chop off the shoulder and not 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.869
 make hasty conclusions let's see 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.549
 we give call of duty a chance every year and 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.810
 give and in this but what I would like 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 note of innovations 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 this appearance of specialization is certain 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.070
 and the squirrels that appear your hero 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.260
 during the game such a great guy 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.630
 can hit the hands with the ground 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.840
 and in a certain radius everyone will die 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.910
 or I watched with my own eyes as one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.270
 Asian character in hands 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.370
 uber revolver appeared which she 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.740
 with one shot could make any 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.680
 the enemy so yes Sasha is all right 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 notices and what else do you want to say by 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.030
 I want to say something about us 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 are coming interviews and also play 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.470
 black ops 3 on pk as we were promised 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250
 developers so all the details we 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 still 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.890
 leave on later and now but now 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.560
 You can enjoy the footages which 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.500
 we recorded during the game and surely you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.039
 still see them in our 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.459
 video footage in the future but it is still 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.599
 not everything is different today 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.450
 remarkable event which 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.730
 prepared for the press 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.769
 piranha bytes company and studio 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.890
 developer nordic games presented 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.440
 new game called eleks 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.230
 it's quite an interesting mix of genres 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.620
 since it's actually gothic too 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.030
 a little reason in the world 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.310
 postapocalypse though by the glass 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.930
 postapocalypse there is not too much 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
 guess it seems to me all the same from 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.250
 fantasy there is also a lot of things yes 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.010
 as answered by the developers in this world 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.920
 have futurism weapons all these technologies 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.630
 but also there is magic in general on 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 in fact it looks like some kind of 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.640
 a little bit of a strange jumble of all that 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.579
 it occurred to piranhas 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.630
 so for now the babies of this year are early 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.110
 the impression is very twofold 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.180
 and developers are not sharing yet 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.860
 no serious details on 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.349
 about the game all the questions are answered 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.389
 rather extensive, so well, probably 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.660
 just wait what happens next they 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:13.170
 will therefore be able to provide the future 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.829
 will show how in principle and need and show 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.810
 other details from the game show 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.180
 which we will most certainly illuminate from all 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 its diverse sides and tomorrow 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.200
 we will run on these still deserted 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.150
 corridors to take interesting 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.769
 interview look no less interesting 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 presentations and provide this 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.950
 information in 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.010
 so wait for the video from us we will 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.819
 to do them quickly everything interesting to you 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.350
 let's tell you live almost live 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.060
 Well tomorrow will be a difficult day and 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.989
 today thank you for attention for you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.139
 worked 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:51.769
 Gleb Meshcheryakov and Alexandra no naryshkin 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.769
 forgiveness
