you're<00:06:02.010> not<00:06:02.130> constrained<00:06:02.850> by<00:06:02.850> what<00:06:03.450> lugs<00:06:03.960> you

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
you're not constrained by what lugs you

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.800 
you're not constrained by what lugs you
know<00:06:04.680> are<00:06:05.580> available<00:06:06.180> so<00:06:06.360> if<00:06:06.420> we're<00:06:06.510> gonna<00:06:06.600> do

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
know are available so if we're gonna do

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.990 
know are available so if we're gonna do
something<00:06:07.140> different<00:06:07.470> you<00:06:07.560> can<00:06:07.830> and<00:06:08.160> most<00:06:08.730> of

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
something different you can and most of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.640 
something different you can and most of
lugs<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:09.720> you<00:06:09.870> on<00:06:09.960> the<00:06:10.080> head<00:06:10.200> tube<00:06:10.470> they'll

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
lugs of you on the head tube they'll

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.770 
lugs of you on the head tube they'll
don't<00:06:11.190> do<00:06:11.310> the<00:06:11.430> sleeve<00:06:11.700> on<00:06:11.880> this<00:06:12.030> side<00:06:12.270> which

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
don't do the sleeve on this side which

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.000 
don't do the sleeve on this side which
actually<00:06:12.990> probably<00:06:13.350> makes<00:06:13.590> a<00:06:13.680> little<00:06:13.890> bit

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
actually probably makes a little bit

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.040 
actually probably makes a little bit
more<00:06:14.160> sense<00:06:14.400> structurally<00:06:15.120> or<00:06:15.690> you<00:06:15.810> can<00:06:15.930> do

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
more sense structurally or you can do

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.750 
more sense structurally or you can do
them<00:06:16.230> on<00:06:16.320> the<00:06:16.440> head<00:06:16.590> to<00:06:16.830> write<00:06:17.280> depends<00:06:17.610> you

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
them on the head to write depends you

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.490 
them on the head to write depends you
know<00:06:17.790> this<00:06:17.970> there's<00:06:18.540> so<00:06:18.690> many<00:06:18.810> things<00:06:18.930> you<00:06:19.200> can
