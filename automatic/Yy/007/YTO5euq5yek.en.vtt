00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.210
 hello for everyone to raÃºl with new 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.730
 videos we are in the fifth episode of 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.619
 liquid against xy as you see we are 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.619
 the c against water forte inprÃ©s 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.099
 I will jump when you want 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.099
 but that can be better today 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 in 36 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.230
 about 36 better 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.230
 very well 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 when 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:01:00.580
 how bad would be the plan to start 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.580
 to make the famous 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.329
 we will get decreased 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.189
 can fly summertime on the ground 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 and sometimes 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.960
 dirty 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.580
 I 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.920
 yes yes yes the union 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.789
 death 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.329
 lets go today 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.030
 he said it 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.430
 it's not worth the floor 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.530
 where you try 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:00.110
 come on, we won 1-0 to the next 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.110
 let's go next house spot 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.650
 which leads us nowhere 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.290
 placed 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.040
 alpha 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.530
 normal 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.930
 false 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.939
 served cheats chart current 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.310
 God is that I have to say that we 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.699
 we are taking a lot because someone 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.699
 knows 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.840
 its reach 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.840
 I liked 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.960
 but surely we have the windows of 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:34.960
 root 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.600
 one hour 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.580
 we saved the tiebreaker the windows of 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.100
 raid as I said and already 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.120
 before you with tactic ready 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.300
 how easy it is to put a little bit of cars 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.300
 and not 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.580
 and to be a little behind if it is 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.580
 it's going to be a first goodbye to first 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:09.120
 and tell him 10 who is a city to leave 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.969
 skip 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.689
 is that this can be 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:18.689
 fourth - comeback not 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:26.360
 Yes Yes 

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:29.219
 but it was that he was a Turk is not true not 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.960
 It's good, I hope I've already 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:33.750
 liked 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.860
 this video and as I always say to see if 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.860
 we go to 300 likes and all fired 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.860
 yes
