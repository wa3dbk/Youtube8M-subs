harpooning<00:00:32.880> let's<00:00:33.750> look<00:00:34.050> at<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> earliest

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
harpooning let's look at this earliest

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.670 
harpooning let's look at this earliest
of<00:00:35.430> sports<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.180> examined<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> art<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.380> ball

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

harpooning<00:00:38.370> together<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
harpooning together now this is one of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
harpooning together now this is one of
the<00:00:41.129> earliest<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.760> best<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> harpooning

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

the earliest and best of the harpooning
games<00:00:43.399> basically<00:00:44.399> you're<00:00:44.579> shooting<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
games basically you're shooting up a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
games basically you're shooting up a
weapon<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.780> has<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> rope<00:00:46.739> or<00:00:47.010> something

and one captured ball and you would

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.359 
and one captured ball and you would
think<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:12.720> easy<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.260> either<00:01:14.130> I'm

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369

each ball has its own different bounce
pattern<00:01:21.540> some<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.320> bounce<00:01:22.470> higher<00:01:22.770> some

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
smaller they bounce lower to the ground

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
smaller they bounce lower to the ground
giving<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.119> less<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> less<00:01:27.630> room<00:01:28.130> now<00:01:29.130> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
giving you less and less room now this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
giving you less and less room now this
particular<00:01:29.579> stage<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.810> ball<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
particular stage has just one ball but

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.810 
particular stage has just one ball but
there's<00:01:31.619> an<00:01:31.740> obstacle<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.460> middle

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
there's an obstacle in the middle

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.950 
there's an obstacle in the middle
the<00:01:32.909> board<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.330> prevents<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.780> going

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the board that prevents you from going

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
the board that prevents you from going
left<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.010> have<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.490> these

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
left to right so you have to use these

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.820 
left to right so you have to use these
ladders<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.330> go<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.720> down<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.620> of

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
ladders to go up and down which of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.760 
ladders to go up and down which of
course<00:01:37.909> wastes<00:01:38.909> its<00:01:39.030> time<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.380> makes<00:01:40.620> it

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
course wastes its time and it's makes it

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.770 
course wastes its time and it's makes it
easier<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.460> struck<00:01:41.760> by<00:01:41.910> the<00:01:42.390> bouncing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
easier to be struck by the bouncing

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.640 
easier to be struck by the bouncing
balls<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.660> get<00:01:45.900> different<00:01:46.080> kinds<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
balls now you do get different kinds of

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.859 
balls now you do get different kinds of
weapons<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.190> power-ups<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.479> course<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
weapons and power-ups and of course you

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.000 
weapons and power-ups and of course you
should<00:01:49.020> try<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.320> those<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.860> your

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
should try to use those to your

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.540 
should try to use those to your
advantage

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
power-ups you can see the pace is much

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.159 
power-ups you can see the pace is much
slower<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.459> beginning<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.180> does<00:04:15.600> quicken

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
slower in the beginning it does quicken
