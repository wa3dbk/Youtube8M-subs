00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.880
 With the new Beetle, Volkswagen kicks in after the next Kia wounded 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.169
 only moderately successful attempt with the predecessor New Beetle 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.989
 Picture VW now in the second attempt was finally past the cult 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:16.530
 Decades tie in finally belongs the original model with 21 2 05 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.160
 Millions sold copies of the three most successful vehicles so far 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 of the world 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.880
 technically nothing connects the new with his super father 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.720
 and its air-cooled boxer engine in the rear 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.090
 but that those are now returning as a modern copy interpretation 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.620
 the new beetle bends back to the roots away from the design 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.559
 of the New Beetle 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.339
 who looked forward and backward as if the new one showed the same 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.339
 classic proportions 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.520
 is his trademark 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
 a heartbreaker 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.830
 on the shirt stuck a bizarre of the sportiness of the new Beetle 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.880
 highlights 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.260
 in the trunk fit 310 liters so Kundert more than its predecessor 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 905 liters is the new maximum value 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.170
 The interior is much more serious and prompt is also the legendary flowers 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.170
 Bostock 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.440
 after all, the straps in tribute to the foot have been there 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.440
 with six engines, the title goes to the start, but not all 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 to have anywhere in the world 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.530
 our test has succeeded everywhere 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.950
 It is the most powerful petrol engine with 147 kW is known from Dieter Tast 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.119
 the Golf GTI 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:16.189
 With this, the latest beetle shoot shoots in seven municipalities 5 seconds to 100 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.939
 kmh 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.200
 which offers Sahlberg so she goes here 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.069
 lively on
