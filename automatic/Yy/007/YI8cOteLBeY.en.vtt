00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
in the loot the gold there in the middle

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.819 
in the loot the gold there in the middle
plug<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.030> with<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.600> town<00:01:48.869> whole<00:01:49.079> clan<00:01:49.619> castle

plug it with the town whole clan castle

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.460 
plug it with the town whole clan castle
once<00:01:50.189> again<00:01:50.430> centralized<00:01:51.079> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> this

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
once again centralized and you got this

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.889 
once again centralized and you got this
inferno<00:01:52.979> right<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:53.820> next<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> all<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
inferno right there next to all that to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.330 
inferno right there next to all that to
just<00:01:55.079> block<00:01:55.770> everything<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
just block everything out you got the

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.429 
just block everything out you got the
the<00:01:59.340> rhombus<00:01:59.820> their<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> right

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
the rhombus their way I think is right

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.590 
the rhombus their way I think is right
yeah<00:02:01.680> oh<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.490> trapezoid<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.479> say

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
yeah oh no trapezoid I don't want to say

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
yeah oh no trapezoid I don't want to say
rhombus<00:02:03.990> trapezoid<00:02:04.500> there<00:02:04.710> from<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> wizard

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
rhombus trapezoid there from the wizard

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.139 
rhombus trapezoid there from the wizard
towers<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.930> then<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> Expos

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
towers and then you can see the Expos

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.160 
towers and then you can see the Expos
expose<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> Triangle<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.959> pretty

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
expose are in the Triangle it's pretty

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.589 
expose are in the Triangle it's pretty
important<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.670> he's<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:11.940> his<00:02:11.970> giant<00:02:12.420> bombs

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
important and he's got his giant bombs

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.559 
important and he's got his giant bombs
there<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.020> pretty

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
there it's pretty

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.739 
there it's pretty
yeah<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:15.280> air<00:02:15.519> defenses<00:02:16.060> once<00:02:16.390> again

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:16.749 
yeah but then air defenses once again

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.500 
yeah but then air defenses once again
they're<00:02:17.049> making<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:17.939> almost<00:02:18.939> 2<00:02:19.209> square

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
they're making that almost 2 square

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.199 
they're making that almost 2 square
shape<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.189> then<00:02:21.189> you<00:02:21.310> got<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.609> canyons<00:02:22.090> and

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
shape and then you got the canyons and

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.330 
shape and then you got the canyons and
archer<00:02:22.450> towers<00:02:22.810> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.019> outside<00:02:23.469> mortars

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
archer towers on the outside mortars

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.000 
archer towers on the outside mortars
once<00:02:24.760> again<00:02:25.030> they're<00:02:25.209> also<00:02:25.389> in<00:02:25.629> a<00:02:25.689> triangle<00:02:26.139> so

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
once again they're also in a triangle so

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.849 
once again they're also in a triangle so
nice<00:02:27.639> base<00:02:27.969> here<00:02:28.329> it's<00:02:29.109> actually<00:02:29.439> got<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.739> my

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
nice base here it's actually got for my

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.640 
nice base here it's actually got for my
new<00:02:30.010> clan<00:02:30.629> hopefully<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.049> stay<00:02:32.319> here

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
got those wizards in that rhombus oh my

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.999 
got those wizards in that rhombus oh my
gosh<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.449> said<00:03:34.629> rhombus<00:03:35.019> can't<00:03:35.199> trapezoid<00:03:35.799> but

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009 
gosh I said rhombus can't trapezoid but

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.969 
gosh I said rhombus can't trapezoid but
yeah<00:03:36.159> and<00:03:36.370> then<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:38.290> else<00:03:38.470> we<00:03:38.620> got<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.859> look
