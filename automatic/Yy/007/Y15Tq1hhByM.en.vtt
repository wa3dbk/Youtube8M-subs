00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.820
 this world step app 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.650

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.040
 with the card you want it guaranteed 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.130
 if you download to your device yourself 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.790
 You'll go there if you take the file. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.140
 I suppose I party here 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.290
 it's the file you're on come 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.830
 here another movement to receive here 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.729
 in this room was over 70 here is the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.350
 internal memory and this sdk of one is the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.510
 SD card 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.320
 click ok moved it's ready on the card 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.540
 sd 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.810
 done that you make the first attempt 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.330
 is remembering that you have to download the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.260
 file according to the device left 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.350
 the 1021 system you download a txt file 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.080
 1021 separe for sister 1025 you 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:37.239
 have to download that they have 10 25 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:38.800
 if it does not work and comes with 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.209
 system update 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:50.070
 here already will detect updated neckel 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:52.630
 num 5 but in your kit kat things 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.340
 similar 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.340
 just changed the design 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.130
 so you start your device you 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.580
 Go there and try again. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:14.590
 understood an important thing is that the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:16.870
 your update the file is in the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.720
 sd card 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.360
 so he is with that number here 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:27.670
 or 22.20 1.22 this will recognize if the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.060
 Your upgrade is yes 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.430
 so if I 'm not going to leave it with 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.710
 this numbering already on the day does not need 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:43.180
 change nothing will be with that numbering 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.600
 here it gave you only recognizes if you're in 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.600
 this numbering 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.070
 then that's it 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.200
 from the moment you then moved 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.440
 for his card he gave his card 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.350
 memory of your device you restart 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.230
 your device 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:08.220
 you go there in settings on the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:12.340
 phone and system update 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.410
 a message will appear in the 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.930
 my old stove with the pressure to 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.020
 message on the right side here you go 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:24.400
 accepting and then starting to 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:28.570
 copy the update to begin with 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.250
