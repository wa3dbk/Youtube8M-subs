aerial<00:00:51.690> filmmaking<00:00:52.170> yeah<00:00:52.920> well<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.520> were

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
aerial filmmaking yeah well what we were

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.369 
aerial filmmaking yeah well what we were

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
doing that's what we're redefining what

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
doing that's what we're redefining what
the<00:00:55.770> notion<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.309> camera<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> this

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the notion of a camera really is this

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.319 
the notion of a camera really is this
entire<00:00:58.199> unit<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> camera<00:00:59.460> that's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> flying

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
entire unit is a camera that's a flying

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
like this so the landing gear which the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.260 
like this so the landing gear which the
speaks<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.440> phrases<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> inspired<00:01:54.000> yes

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
and that allows the camera to pan tilt

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.900 
and that allows the camera to pan tilt
pan<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.350> tilt<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:58.680> same<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.130> allowing

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for a second operator to get precise

for a second operator to get precise
aerial<00:02:03.060> cinematography<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.800> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.160> one

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
aerial cinematography so this is one

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.999 
aerial cinematography so this is one
operator<00:02:05.940> one<00:02:06.540> operator<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.259> at<00:02:07.350> inspire<00:02:07.740> one

operator one operator or at inspire one

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.609 
operator one operator or at inspire one
is<00:02:08.190> two<00:02:08.429> operator<00:02:08.940> correct<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.500> not

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
is two operator correct and I'm not

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
is two operator correct and I'm not
saying<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.190> can't<00:02:11.459> get<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> level<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
saying that you can't get a level of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.790 
saying that you can't get a level of
precision<00:02:12.540> aerial<00:02:12.989> cinematography<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:13.739> a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
precision aerial cinematography with a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.850 
precision aerial cinematography with a
p3<00:02:14.190> you're<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.940> little<00:02:15.180> limited<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.200> even

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
p3 you're just a little limited but even

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.380 
p3 you're just a little limited but even
the<00:02:16.950> way<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.220> camera<00:02:17.610> tilts<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.270> have

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the way this camera tilts so you have

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
the way this camera tilts so you have
something<00:02:18.900> down<00:02:19.140> slowly<00:02:19.500> tilting<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.160> can

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
something down slowly tilting up you can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.910 
something down slowly tilting up you can
finesse<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.780> construct<00:02:22.020> your<00:02:22.230> shot<00:02:22.440> you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
finesse that to construct your shot you

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.880 
finesse that to construct your shot you
just<00:02:23.130> can't<00:02:23.340> do<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.640> right<00:02:24.230> no<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> understand

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
just can't do this right no I understand

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.310 
just can't do this right no I understand
and<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> fun<00:02:27.630> things<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.989> working

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
and one of the fun things are working

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.400 
and one of the fun things are working
with<00:02:28.440> DJI<00:02:28.850> did<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.270> test<00:02:30.510> these<00:02:30.750> yes

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
with DJI did you get to test these yes

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.680 
with DJI did you get to test these yes
