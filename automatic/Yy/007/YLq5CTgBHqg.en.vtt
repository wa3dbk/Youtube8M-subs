used my friend and the man selling it to
him<00:00:41.829> told<00:00:42.730> him<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:43.030> air<00:00:43.210> conditioning<00:00:43.780> was

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
him told him the air conditioning was

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.430 
him told him the air conditioning was
working<00:00:44.320> great<00:00:45.330> I'd<00:00:46.330> say<00:00:46.570> take<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:47.020> for<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.200> test

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
working great I'd say take it for a test

drive they put the air conditioning on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.550 
drive they put the air conditioning on
was<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.280> little<00:00:52.060> cool<00:00:52.270> out<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.720> day<00:00:52.900> alright

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
was a little cool out that day alright

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.160 
was a little cool out that day alright
they<00:00:53.800> felt<00:00:54.040> some<00:00:54.250> cold<00:00:54.430> air<00:00:54.670> blowing<00:00:54.850> up

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
they felt some cold air blowing up

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.310 
they felt some cold air blowing up
figured<00:00:56.400> systems<00:00:57.400> working<00:00:58.110> looks<00:00:59.110> like<00:00:59.290> a

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
figured systems working looks like a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.480 
figured systems working looks like a
good<00:00:59.560> deal<00:01:00.030> by<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.060> car<00:01:02.100> starts<00:01:03.100> getting<00:01:03.340> hot

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.490 
good deal by the car starts getting hot

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.950 
good deal by the car starts getting hot
out<00:01:03.900> turns<00:01:04.900> on<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.259> air<00:01:05.379> conditioned<00:01:05.920> nothing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
out turns on the air conditioned nothing

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.399 
out turns on the air conditioned nothing
not<00:01:07.960> getting<00:01:08.200> cold<00:01:08.500> hold<00:01:09.460> enough<00:01:10.170> turns<00:01:11.170> out

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
not getting cold hold enough turns out

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.620 
not getting cold hold enough turns out
the<00:01:12.159> belt<00:01:12.430> was<00:01:12.729> missing<00:01:13.150> from<00:01:13.299> the<00:01:13.509> air

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
the belt was missing from the air

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.730 
the belt was missing from the air
conditioning<00:01:14.229> compressor<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.579> whole<00:01:15.789> time

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
conditioning compressor the whole time

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.459 
conditioning compressor the whole time
so<00:01:17.740> we've<00:01:18.310> got<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.549> car<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.840> air<00:01:19.929> conditioning

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
so we've got a car the air conditioning

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.370 
so we've got a car the air conditioning
hasn't<00:01:20.799> worked<00:01:20.950> in<00:01:21.070> years<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.810> compressor

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
hasn't worked in years the compressor

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.160 
hasn't worked in years the compressor
hasn't<00:01:23.740> spawning<00:01:24.159> years<00:01:24.820> which<00:01:25.450> is<00:01:25.659> bad<00:01:25.899> for

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
hasn't spawning years which is bad for

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.679 
hasn't spawning years which is bad for
the<00:01:26.200> compressor<00:01:27.030> because<00:01:28.030> even<00:01:28.450> when<00:01:28.600> you

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
the compressor because even when you

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.209 
the compressor because even when you
have<00:01:28.840> a<00:01:28.869> good<00:01:29.109> system<00:01:29.409> running<00:01:29.950> you're<00:01:30.069> going

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
have a good system running you're going

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.309 
have a good system running you're going
to<00:01:30.280> want<00:01:30.399> to<00:01:30.490> turn<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.880> on<00:01:30.969> every<00:01:31.270> couple<00:01:31.479> weeks

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
to want to turn it on every couple weeks

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.789 
to want to turn it on every couple weeks
to<00:01:32.799> keep<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.189> compressor<00:01:33.789> lubricated<00:01:34.569> and<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to keep the compressor lubricated and to

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.669 
to keep the compressor lubricated and to
keep<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.280> seal<00:01:36.579> lubricated<00:01:37.509> that<00:01:37.990> prevents

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
keep the seal lubricated that prevents

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.309 
keep the seal lubricated that prevents
the<00:01:38.829> refrigerant<00:01:39.429> from<00:01:39.549> getting<00:01:39.909> out<00:01:40.319> there's

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
the refrigerant from getting out there's

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.020 
the refrigerant from getting out there's
a<00:01:41.439> lot<00:01:41.469> of<00:01:41.619> oil<00:01:41.950> in<00:01:42.189> your<00:01:42.310> air<00:01:42.460> conditioning

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
a lot of oil in your air conditioning

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.940 
a lot of oil in your air conditioning
system<00:01:43.509> that<00:01:43.659> circulates<00:01:44.259> around<00:01:44.439> with

system that circulates around with
everything<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.869> why<00:01:47.109> we<00:01:47.259> want<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.530> keep<00:01:47.679> a

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
everything that's why we want to keep a

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.919 
everything that's why we want to keep a

this is environmentally friendly and it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.110 
this is environmentally friendly and it
works<00:02:20.610> pretty<00:02:20.910> much<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.240> same<00:02:21.630> way<00:02:21.690> hard<00:02:22.230> 12

now there are a few other refrigerants I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.530 
now there are a few other refrigerants I
want<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.570> warn<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.960> about<00:02:29.180> there's<00:02:30.180> some

refrigerant<00:04:41.389> with<00:04:42.289> our<00:04:42.469> 12<00:04:42.919> because<00:04:43.520> when<00:04:44.240> it

expanded or evaporated it took away a
lot<00:04:47.389> more<00:04:48.110> heat<00:04:48.439> ah<00:04:50.199> so<00:04:51.199> the<00:04:51.439> thermostat

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:52.369 
lot more heat ah so the thermostat

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:59.499 
lot more heat ah so the thermostat
actually<00:04:53.229> would<00:04:54.229> shut<00:04:57.999> again<00:04:58.999> it's<00:04:59.149> just<00:04:59.360> a

actually would shut again it's just a

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.350 
actually would shut again it's just a
dry<00:04:59.749> fitting<00:05:00.139> so<00:05:00.529> don't<00:05:01.429> over<00:05:01.789> tighten<00:05:01.999> that

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
dry fitting so don't over tighten that
