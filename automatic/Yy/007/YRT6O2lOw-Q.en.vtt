 personally call close to fair-skinned and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.130
 sometimes even about 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.550
 which light areas are somewhere more than me 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.640
 but alas, there are very few such pages. 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:57.770
 here is maria hill very young lady in this 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.869

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.110

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.010
 shit bitch 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:37.400
 something like that in the plot is simple 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.610
 like two fingers to piss off tony stark 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.739
 there is a new enemy 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.989
 son of his previous enemy who is also 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.410
 wants to kill that genius blah blah blah 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.739
 as usual even comics are written here 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.130

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.110
 matching fights with son who 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.090

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.769
 technology is not so much redid it 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.650

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.000
 billionaire philanthropist 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:22.459
 handsome in this interpretation and 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.640
 Mexico school or even somewhere Negro 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:31.660

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:35.000

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.340

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.850

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.700

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:54.000

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:09.780
 but Peter as usual as a little. 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:11.550
 In general, the person is worried about others 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 there is as usual years myself as a little 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.510

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.390

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:39.780
 short assessment of human life step number 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.090
 15 by the way, as noted by someone not 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.680
 Europe in the comments here we have Jeff 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.140
 Jones Yolanda from the previous jester that is 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.660
 open and look at completely different 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.440
 those at the helm that is so and these 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.040
 comrades in the disgracers that even decided on 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:04.890
 the cover of completely left-handed persons to put in order 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.630
 wash yourself some guilt can and so 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.580
 to tell 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.350
 liked this issue write 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.540
 necessarily in the comments especially 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.760
 coloring characters oven undo 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.550
 white people look like a white miracle 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.810
 on white people and because i don't like 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:28.410
 blacks because i want to look at 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:32.390
 white skin white people do it 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.360
 and so, too, it is difficult to separate the new 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:39.060
 Fantastic Four replaced 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.430

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.780
