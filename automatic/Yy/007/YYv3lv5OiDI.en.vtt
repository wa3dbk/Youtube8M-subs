new<00:00:20.850> black<00:00:21.359> ops<00:00:21.570> 2<00:00:21.930> map<00:00:22.410> pack<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.160> coming

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
new black ops 2 map pack that is coming

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.370 
new black ops 2 map pack that is coming
out<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.939> looks<00:00:24.210> just<00:00:24.300> like<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.720> revolution

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
out it looks just like the revolution

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.470 
out it looks just like the revolution
map<00:00:25.590> pack<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:27.529> remember<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:29.039> leaked

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
map pack I remember when it got leaked

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.610 
map pack I remember when it got leaked
there's<00:00:30.480> four<00:00:31.050> new<00:00:31.700> pictures<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.480> map<00:00:33.719> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
there's four new pictures of a map the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.220 
there's four new pictures of a map the
picture<00:00:35.430> will<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.570> video<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:37.170> now

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
picture will be on the video right now

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.440 
picture will be on the video right now
for<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> guys<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> look<00:00:38.250> at<00:00:38.399> yourself<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
for you guys to look at yourself the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.560 
for you guys to look at yourself the
first<00:00:39.750> map<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.410> called<00:00:40.920> water<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.180> quite

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
first map is called water I'm not quite

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.459 
first map is called water I'm not quite
sure<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:43.940> it's<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> real<00:00:45.809> name<00:00:46.170> or

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
sure if it's gonna be a real name or

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.080 
sure if it's gonna be a real name or
there's<00:00:46.590> going<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> prototype<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:47.940> if

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
there's going to be a prototype like if

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.319 
there's going to be a prototype like if
they're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> change<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> road

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
they're going to change it down the road

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.369 
they're going to change it down the road
I'm<00:00:51.329> guessing<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
I'm guessing it's going to be a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.240 
I'm guessing it's going to be a
water-based<00:00:53.340> map<00:00:53.640> hint<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.329> name<00:00:55.100> second<00:00:56.100> map

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
water-based map hint for name second map

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.240 
water-based map hint for name second map
is<00:00:56.579> self<00:00:57.059> Paul<00:00:57.449> I'm<00:00:58.050> guessing<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
is self Paul I'm guessing it's going to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.619 
is self Paul I'm guessing it's going to
be<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.670> jungle<00:01:00.329> based<00:01:00.600> map<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:02.210> then<00:01:03.210> stirred

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
be a jungle based map and then stirred

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
be a jungle based map and then stirred
map<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> picture<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> is

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
map what they have a picture of is

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.719 
map what they have a picture of is
called<00:01:06.390> mobile<00:01:06.900> really<00:01:07.770> can't<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.400> kind

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
called mobile really can't see it's kind

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.609 
called mobile really can't see it's kind
of<00:01:08.880> blurry<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.720> looks<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> ship<00:01:10.740> base<00:01:11.189> map

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
of blurry it looks like a ship base map

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
of blurry it looks like a ship base map
so<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.799> might<00:01:14.010> bring<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:15.049> from<00:01:16.049> cod4

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
so they might bring back that from cod4

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
so they might bring back that from cod4
that<00:01:17.070> would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.640> nice<00:01:19.040> then<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> last

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that would be kind of nice then the last

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.990 
that would be kind of nice then the last
one<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.640> called<00:01:20.970> plane<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.439> might<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.369> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
one is called plane it might be like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.149 
one is called plane it might be like
terminal<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.049> highly<00:01:25.590> doubt<00:01:25.740> they're<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
terminal I highly doubt they're going to

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399 
terminal I highly doubt they're going to
bring<00:01:26.310> back<00:01:26.520> terminal<00:01:27.270> since<00:01:27.570> terminals<00:01:28.170> kind

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
bring back terminal since terminals kind

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
bring back terminal since terminals kind
of<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.680> infinity<00:01:29.640> ward<00:01:29.939> based<00:01:30.650> map<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> next

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
of an infinity ward based map the next

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
of an infinity ward based map the next
thing<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.470> zombie<00:01:34.890> map<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
thing is a zombie map right in the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
thing is a zombie map right in the
middle<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> be<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> zombie<00:01:38.070> map

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
middle it it's going to be a zombie map

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.969 
middle it it's going to be a zombie map
or<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.600> new<00:01:39.900> map<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.680> turn

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
or it's going to be a new map for turn

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.670 
or it's going to be a new map for turn
it<00:01:41.340> looks<00:01:41.880> like<00:01:42.000> turn<00:01:42.450> hands<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.200> that's<00:01:43.470> why

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
it looks like turn hands so that's why

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
it looks like turn hands so that's why
I'm<00:01:43.799> guessing<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> turned<00:01:44.899> I'm<00:01:45.899> hoping

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
I'm guessing it can be turned I'm hoping

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.139 
I'm guessing it can be turned I'm hoping
it's<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> new<00:01:47.340> turn<00:01:47.579> map<00:01:47.820> because<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
it's gonna be a new turn map because I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.670 
it's gonna be a new turn map because I
really<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:48.840> type<00:01:49.049> turn<00:01:49.290> about<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
really like the game type turn about the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
really like the game type turn about the
same<00:01:49.890> times<00:01:50.159> i<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.570> zombies<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.259> i

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
same times i really like zombies so i

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.520 
same times i really like zombies so i
hope<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:52.920> zombie<00:01:53.250> map<00:01:54.110> then<00:01:55.110> below

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
hope it's a new zombie map then below

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.819 
hope it's a new zombie map then below
that<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.759> weapon<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.719> can't<00:01:57.990> see<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.530> name

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that is a weapon you can't see the name

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.639 
that is a weapon you can't see the name
of<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> weapon<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.119> picture<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
of the weapon because the picture is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.179 
of the weapon because the picture is
blocking<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.990> looks<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.680> sniper

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
blocking it out it looks like a sniper

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
blocking it out it looks like a sniper
rifle<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.240> rifle<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> high-powered

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
rifle or a rifle with a high-powered

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.180 
rifle or a rifle with a high-powered
scope<00:02:08.360> it's<00:02:09.360> gonna<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.690> cool<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
scope it's gonna be very cool if this is

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.400 
scope it's gonna be very cool if this is
confirmed<00:02:11.700> or<00:02:12.000> not

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
confirmed or not

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.910
