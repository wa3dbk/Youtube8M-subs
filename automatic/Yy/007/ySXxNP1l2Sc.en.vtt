00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
stopped getting all these anonymous and

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.190 
stopped getting all these anonymous and
you<00:02:40.890> don't<00:02:41.160> want<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.610> level<00:02:42.030> three<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.690> I'm

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you don't want the level three so I'm

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.670 
you don't want the level three so I'm
just<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> pretend<00:02:43.650> it's<00:02:43.980> all<00:02:44.160> done<00:02:45.680> all

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
just going to pretend it's all done all

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.700 
just going to pretend it's all done all
right<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:48.600> I'm<00:02:48.720> gonna<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:49.080> results<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> then

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
right and I'm gonna do results and then

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.650 
right and I'm gonna do results and then
you're<00:02:49.860> going<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.010> go<00:02:50.130> all<00:02:50.400> anonymous<00:02:50.850> proxies

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you're going to go all anonymous proxies

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050 
you're going to go all anonymous proxies
now<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.500> list<00:02:52.770> here<00:02:52.980> will<00:02:53.130> going<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.520> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
now all list here will going on and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.420 
now all list here will going on and
they'll<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> lot<00:02:54.510> more<00:02:54.570> than<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:56.070> yeah

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
they'll be a lot more than this so yeah

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.900 
they'll be a lot more than this so yeah
so<00:02:59.430> that's<00:02:59.640> that<00:03:01.550> don't<00:03:02.550> know<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.790> it's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
so that's that don't know if it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.720 
so that's that don't know if it's
cracked<00:03:03.240> any<00:03:03.600> stopping

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.030 

correct

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
correct

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.240 
correct
things

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
things

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.180 
things
anyway<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> will<00:03:12.510> crack<00:03:12.720> some<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.770> will

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
anyway when it will crack some it will

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.300 
anyway when it will crack some it will
come<00:03:14.460> right<00:03:14.490> here<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.240> will<00:03:15.270> say<00:03:15.770> it<00:03:16.770> would

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
come right here and it will say it would

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.130 
come right here and it will say it would
be<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.460> txt<00:03:18.030> file<00:03:18.390> cool<00:03:18.750> cracked<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:21.140> that's

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
be a txt file cool cracked and that's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.610 
be a txt file cool cracked and that's
really<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> stuff<00:03:22.860> will<00:03:23.040> come<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.520> look<00:03:23.820> like

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
really a stuff will come here look like

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.040 
really a stuff will come here look like
you'll<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.890> look<00:03:26.100> like<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.840> they'll

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
you'll just look like this and they'll

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.110 
you'll just look like this and they'll
be<00:03:31.200> they'll<00:03:31.590> be<00:03:31.740> cracked<00:03:32.040> user<00:03:32.580> names<00:03:32.880> in

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
be they'll be cracked user names in

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.210 
be they'll be cracked user names in
there<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:35.400> my<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:36.660> my<00:03:36.900> cracker<00:03:37.140> now<00:03:37.410> see

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
there so this my this my cracker now see

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.890 
there so this my this my cracker now see
the<00:03:38.370> thing<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.850> takes<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:39.180> lot<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.330> time<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
the thing is it takes a lot of time it

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870 
the thing is it takes a lot of time it
takes<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.230> lot<00:03:40.320> more<00:03:40.470> time<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:41.040> more<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.430> have<00:03:41.700> to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
takes a lot more time the more I have to

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.070 
takes a lot more time the more I have to
this<00:03:42.060> video<00:03:42.360> so<00:03:44.420> if<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.570> leave<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.810> running

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
this video so if you leave it running

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.710 
this video so if you leave it running

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
overnight I've cracked about 100 in one

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.740 
overnight I've cracked about 100 in one
night<00:03:48.959> which<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.860> our<00:03:49.980> load<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.910> if<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.600> can
