00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.910 
they're very easy to install I went and
I<00:02:54.760> soldered<00:02:55.269> all<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.599> connections<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.530> didn't

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
I soldered all the connections I didn't

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.580 
I soldered all the connections I didn't
worry<00:02:57.130> about<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:58.630> connections<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.470> be

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
worry about like my connections to be

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.370 
worry about like my connections to be
tight<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:01.019> didn't<00:03:02.019> use<00:03:02.049> all<00:03:02.380> those<00:03:02.560> adapters

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
tight so I didn't use all those adapters

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.880 
tight so I didn't use all those adapters
all<00:03:05.380> right<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.709> let's<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.160> coils<00:03:06.519> we<00:03:07.480> have

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
all right so let's go the coils we have

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.309 
all right so let's go the coils we have
the<00:03:11.730> right<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:12.940> sorry<00:03:13.239> I<00:03:13.390> know<00:03:13.599> it's<00:03:14.079> dark

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
the right here sorry I know it's dark

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.360 
the right here sorry I know it's dark
here

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
here

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.210 
here
you<00:03:16.150> got<00:03:16.329> an<00:03:16.510> orange<00:03:16.989> with<00:03:17.349> white<00:03:17.380> stripe<00:03:17.980> and

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
you got an orange with white stripe and

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.370 
you got an orange with white stripe and
a<00:03:18.340> blue<00:03:18.370> with<00:03:19.299> white<00:03:19.569> stripe<00:03:19.900> coming<00:03:20.200> out<00:03:20.260> of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
a blue with white stripe coming out of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.729 
a blue with white stripe coming out of
coil<00:03:21.540> basically<00:03:22.540> it's<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:23.109> nice<00:03:23.410> on<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
coil basically it's really nice on the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.590 
coil basically it's really nice on the
adapter<00:03:24.250> 2<00:03:24.700> because<00:03:24.940> it's<00:03:25.120> really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
adapter 2 because it's really

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.410 
adapter 2 because it's really
color-coded<00:03:26.440> you<00:03:26.560> got<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.859> blue<00:03:27.130> wire<00:03:27.459> going

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
color-coded you got the blue wire going

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.449 
color-coded you got the blue wire going
to<00:03:28.569> the<00:03:30.900> going<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.170> blue<00:03:32.530> with<00:03:32.739> white<00:03:32.980> stripe

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
to the going to blue with white stripe

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.809 
to the going to blue with white stripe
and<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.060> soldered<00:03:34.540> those<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.959> together<00:03:35.819> all

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and I soldered those in together all

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.390 
and I soldered those in together all
right<00:03:37.000> now<00:03:37.420> let's<00:03:37.750> try<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.590> see<00:03:38.829> if<00:03:38.920> we<00:03:39.100> can't

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
right now let's try and see if we can't

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.750 
right now let's try and see if we can't
get<00:03:39.549> around<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.660> front<00:03:41.560> coil<00:03:42.100> that's

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
get around to the front coil that's

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:51.440 
get around to the front coil that's
gonna<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.150> little<00:03:43.450> harder<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.989> see

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.570 

all<00:03:52.450> right<00:03:52.630> let's<00:03:52.930> see<00:03:53.200> if<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.380> can<00:03:53.560> shed<00:03:54.340> some

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
all right let's see if I can shed some

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.680 
all right let's see if I can shed some
light<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:55.330> here<00:03:57.240> hope<00:03:58.240> you<00:03:58.270> don't<00:03:58.510> get

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
light on this here hope you don't get

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.860 
light on this here hope you don't get
sick<00:03:59.020> this<00:03:59.260> video<00:03:59.830> I<00:04:00.100> put<00:04:00.700> this<00:04:00.880> neck<00:04:01.540> cover

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
sick this video I put this neck cover

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.830 
sick this video I put this neck cover
back<00:04:02.200> on<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.770> I<00:04:02.830> should<00:04:02.860> know<00:04:03.459> like<00:04:03.840> planning

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
back on and I should know like planning

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.640 
back on and I should know like planning
on<00:04:04.959> making<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:05.500> video<00:04:05.920> again<00:04:08.130> oh<00:04:10.440> well<00:04:11.440> you

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
on making this video again oh well you

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.210 
on making this video again oh well you
really<00:04:11.860> can't<00:04:12.310> see<00:04:12.520> that<00:04:12.700> Kenya<00:04:14.190> anyway<00:04:15.190> I

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
really can't see that Kenya anyway I

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.259 
really can't see that Kenya anyway I
guess<00:04:15.550> any<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.239> know<00:04:16.889> your<00:04:17.889> front<00:04:18.220> coil<00:04:18.489> is

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
guess any of you know your front coil is

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.819 
guess any of you know your front coil is
down<00:04:19.600> in<00:04:19.870> there<00:04:20.049> if<00:04:20.200> you're<00:04:20.320> gonna<00:04:20.470> do<00:04:20.650> this

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
down in there if you're gonna do this

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.030 
down in there if you're gonna do this
mod<00:04:21.100> then<00:04:22.320> you're<00:04:23.320> gonna<00:04:23.470> know<00:04:23.800> where

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
mod then you're gonna know where

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.159 
mod then you're gonna know where
everything's<00:04:24.580> at<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.450> your<00:04:25.600> front<00:04:25.930> cool

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
everything's at but your front cool

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.490 
everything's at but your front cool
front<00:04:26.830> coils<00:04:27.280> on<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.550> side<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.210> jug<00:04:28.510> you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
front coils on the side of the jug you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.290 
front coils on the side of the jug you
got<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.740> remove<00:04:30.040> this<00:04:30.310> cover<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:32.970> get<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.120> out<00:04:34.270> I

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
got to remove this cover to get it out I

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.350 
got to remove this cover to get it out I
will<00:04:34.900> show<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.110> get<00:04:35.230> in<00:04:35.380> there<00:04:35.560> for<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.919> guys

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
will show you get in there for you guys

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.180 
will show you get in there for you guys
but<00:04:37.360> um<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.850> there<00:04:39.970> goes<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.290> got<00:04:41.950> on<00:04:42.160> the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
but um so there goes and I got on the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.430 
but um so there goes and I got on the
wiring<00:04:42.669> diagram<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.180> saw<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.720> earlier<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.140> can't

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
wiring diagram I saw it earlier I can't

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.430 
wiring diagram I saw it earlier I can't
remember<00:04:44.770> what<00:04:45.100> color<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.840> wire<00:04:47.080> was<00:04:47.410> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
remember what color the the wire was I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.770 
remember what color the the wire was I
believe<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:48.220> black<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.850> believe<00:04:49.240> it's<00:04:49.389> yellow

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
believe it's black I believe it's yellow

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.630 
believe it's black I believe it's yellow
to<00:04:49.840> black<00:04:51.419> if<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.600> remember<00:04:53.080> correctly<00:04:53.640> all

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
to black if I remember correctly all

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.700 
to black if I remember correctly all
right<00:04:55.030> now<00:04:55.210> we're<00:04:55.360> gonna<00:04:55.450> look<00:04:55.630> at<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.050> this

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
right now we're gonna look at this this

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.610 
right now we're gonna look at this this
green<00:04:57.100> wire<00:04:57.400> right<00:04:57.820> here<00:04:57.960> this<00:04:58.960> green<00:04:59.290> wire<00:04:59.470> I

green wire right here this green wire I

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.409 
green wire right here this green wire I
had<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.830> put<00:04:59.979> an<00:05:00.070> extension<00:05:00.490> on<00:05:00.760> but<00:05:01.090> within

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
had to put an extension on but within

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.940 
had to put an extension on but within
the<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:03.729> wire<00:05:04.060> right<00:05:04.600> here<00:05:05.289> you<00:05:05.470> can<00:05:05.620> barely

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
the this wire right here you can barely

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.380 
the this wire right here you can barely
see<00:05:06.160> that<00:05:06.280> let<00:05:06.460> me<00:05:06.520> get<00:05:06.640> some<00:05:06.789> more<00:05:06.820> light<00:05:07.180> up

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
see that let me get some more light up

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.700 
see that let me get some more light up
here<00:05:07.600> all<00:05:08.229> right<00:05:08.320> now<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.710> see<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.070> better<00:05:10.710> you

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710

here all right now you see it better you
see<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:11.979> there's<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.280> yellow<00:05:12.990> yellow<00:05:13.990> stripe

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
see that there's a yellow yellow stripe

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.670 
see that there's a yellow yellow stripe
on<00:05:14.800> a<00:05:14.830> black<00:05:15.160> wire<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:15.970> will<00:05:16.660> tie<00:05:16.960> into<00:05:17.669> this

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
on a black wire that will tie into this

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.909 
on a black wire that will tie into this
this<00:05:20.680> green<00:05:21.450> wire<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:22.960> runs<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.680> black

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
this green wire and that runs the black

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.830
