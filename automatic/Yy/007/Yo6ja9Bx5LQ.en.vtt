00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.740
 in s 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.870
 she herself is interested in exchange as 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.150
 deep mount and as such requires 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.150
 ethical behavior and with more 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.519
 because the time to have lunch in these ideas 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.920
 what are you giving to think to lend 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.400
 to have an account in English we need to have the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.250
 first, but at the other electron point 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.510
 once again on the internet and above the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.860
 average 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 the first one always takes 6.50 as soon as the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.739
 people will start to function 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.739
 canha the thomas 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.170
 so we take it instead of having to read action 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:12.540
 action on ref 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 How do we sit there at some point? 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:24.560
 however over again renan 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:31.460
 She speaks a ka and we can see 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:34.470
 Boy must come by and here we take 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:41.450
 on another tip 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.450
 now it rings the next time I pass 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.179
 palm for her 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:12.379
 Let's allocate direction that gives a 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:17.060
 importance in the hour passed there 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:20.930
 in putting a point to 10 Dec 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:47.389
 who was there moved to live in 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:51.980
 There, we have finished the first 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.170
 garden and now we have to think up was 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:59.600
 tip 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:04.010
 for that English is similar in place 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.609
 to be one of the normal rights and not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.100
 we take 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:13.870
 he pointed out that it is about the rational 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:22.340
 that there is not the first point the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:38.500
 sintero and time is place teté by 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:42.500

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.630

 We're just upstairs and the room for her. 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:25.930
 broke the hi 91 presence more 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:29.610
 complicated to find a fiber hour or 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.610
 we got up 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.180
 kaka is a last point 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.600
 I always have a point of it all right 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:21.120
 simple symptom is the last point so 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:25.220
