three<00:03:12.940> by<00:03:13.090> five<00:03:13.329> flags<00:03:13.720> will<00:03:13.900> have<00:03:14.079> grommets

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
three by five flags will have grommets

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.800 
three by five flags will have grommets
on<00:03:15.100> it<00:03:15.390> so<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:17.319> just<00:03:17.350> took<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.069> a<00:03:18.810> grommet
