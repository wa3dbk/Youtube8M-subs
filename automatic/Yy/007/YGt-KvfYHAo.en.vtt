there's<00:00:15.360> some<00:00:15.599> issue<00:00:16.230> well<00:00:17.070> thanks<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.670> mobile

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
there's some issue well thanks to mobile

there's some issue well thanks to mobile
substrate<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.080> now<00:00:19.470> called<00:00:19.740> Cydia<00:00:20.039> substrate

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
substrate or now called Cydia substrate

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.240 
substrate or now called Cydia substrate
there<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.140> safe<00:00:22.560> mode<00:00:22.800> built-in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
there is actually a safe mode built-in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.130 
there is actually a safe mode built-in
that'll<00:00:23.519> actually<00:00:23.609> disable<00:00:24.150> itself<00:00:24.449> when<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that'll actually disable itself when you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.269 
that'll actually disable itself when you
boot<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.529> device<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.160> can

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
boot up the device so that way you can

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
boot up the device so that way you can
go<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.910> still<00:00:27.420> access<00:00:27.869> whatever<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.260> need

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
go in and still access whatever you need

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
go in and still access whatever you need
to<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> remove<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.880> jailbreaking<00:00:30.779> tweak

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to and remove the jailbreaking tweak

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.959 
to and remove the jailbreaking tweak
that's<00:00:31.349> causing<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.830> issue<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:32.880> this

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
that's causing the issue so in this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.940 
that's causing the issue so in this
video<00:00:33.090> I'm<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> show<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> get

them<00:00:47.510> this<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> our<00:00:48.780> kind<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> emergency

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
them this is our kind of emergency

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.369 
them this is our kind of emergency
shutoff<00:00:50.149> so<00:00:51.149> wait<00:00:51.300> till<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> Apple<00:00:52.320> logo

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
shutoff so wait till the Apple logo

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.630 
shutoff so wait till the Apple logo
comes<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> goes<00:00:53.699> away<00:00:53.879> again<00:00:55.460> then<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
comes up and goes away again then you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.340 
comes up and goes away again then you
can<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:56.910> go<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> now<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.020> device<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.770> off

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
can let go and now the device is off

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.470 
can let go and now the device is off
then<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.699> safe<00:01:02.969> mode<00:01:03.180> with

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
then to get it into the safe mode with

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
then to get it into the safe mode with
mobile<00:01:04.470> substrate<00:01:04.830> now<00:01:04.860> called<00:01:05.159> Cydia

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
mobile substrate now called Cydia

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
mobile substrate now called Cydia
substrate<00:01:05.909> we're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> turn<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.619> by

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
substrate we're going to turn on by

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.480 
substrate we're going to turn on by
holding<00:01:08.040> volume<00:01:08.820> up<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> power<00:01:10.159> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> same

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
holding volume up and power at the same

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.039 
holding volume up and power at the same
time<00:01:11.790> once<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> Apple<00:01:12.720> logo<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
time once you see the Apple logo you can

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.410 
time once you see the Apple logo you can
let<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> power<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.850> keep<00:01:15.030> holding

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
let go of power and just keep holding

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.550 
let go of power and just keep holding
volume<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:20.270> keep<00:01:21.270> holding<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.780> holding<00:01:22.439> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
volume up keep holding it and holding it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.120 
volume up keep holding it and holding it
and<00:01:22.650> holding<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.009> until<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.640> device<00:01:23.850> boots<00:01:24.390> up

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
and holding it until the device boots up

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
and holding it until the device boots up
and<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.490> basically<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.119> does<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> it'll

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and this basically what does is it'll

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
and this basically what does is it'll
disable<00:01:28.110> anything<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.650> was<00:01:28.770> using<00:01:29.040> mobile

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
disable anything that was using mobile

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
disable anything that was using mobile
substrate<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> disables<00:01:30.570> mobile

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
substrate because it disables mobile

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
substrate because it disables mobile
substrate<00:01:31.290> um<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.250> then<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.390> get

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
substrate um and then you can now get

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.730 
substrate um and then you can now get
into<00:01:34.140> whatever<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.220> need<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> get<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:37.110> be

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
into whatever you need to get into to be

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
into whatever you need to get into to be
able<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> go<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> Cydia<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.700> remove<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> apps

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
able to go to Cydia and remove the apps

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
able to go to Cydia and remove the apps
and<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.350> fun<00:01:40.530> stuff<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.860> once<00:01:41.100> this

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and all that fun stuff so once this

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.770 
and all that fun stuff so once this
comes<00:01:41.430> up<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:43.049> unlock<00:01:43.439> your<00:01:43.500> screen<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
comes up you can unlock your screen and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.050 
comes up you can unlock your screen and
like<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> said<00:01:46.430> you'll<00:01:47.430> see<00:01:47.640> when<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:47.970> into

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
like I said you'll see when we go into

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.740 
like I said you'll see when we go into
settings<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:50.030> you'll<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> had

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
settings here you'll see that I had

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.880 
settings here you'll see that I had
winterboard<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.350> some<00:01:52.439> other<00:01:52.560> things<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
winterboard and some other things that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.289 
winterboard and some other things that
were<00:01:53.100> listed<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.579> here<00:01:53.729> they're<00:01:54.000> no<00:01:54.149> longer

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
were listed in here they're no longer

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
were listed in here they're no longer
listed<00:01:54.780> because<00:01:55.280> mobile<00:01:56.280> substrate<00:01:56.610> isn't

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
listed because mobile substrate isn't

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
listed because mobile substrate isn't
working<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> know<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
working so that's how you know that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
substrate running and you will know if

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.470 
substrate running and you will know if
that<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.250> copra<00:02:39.580> or<00:02:39.640> not<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:39.940> it<00:02:40.060> wasn't

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
and you still in a boot loop you can

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.320 
and you still in a boot loop you can
just<00:02:42.130> repeat<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.520> process<00:02:42.730> until<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.180> get

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
just repeat this process until you get
