00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:06.170
 Well, hello hello teammates mitsubishi 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.290
 lancer 9 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.820
 club decided today to touch on the topic 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:17.710
 backlight that everyone is already fed up 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:22.489
 red means I thought 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:26.060
 panel was mounted smd 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:28.579
 LED backlight tricolor also 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.489
 control unit was connected with 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.970
 remote control so the remote you look like 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:39.170
 so here we have different 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.240
 colors well and, respectively, on 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.800
 this bullet can also be adjusted 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.230
 different brightness 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 glittering blinking so on also 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.110
 may turn off with the button at 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.510
 let's see how it looks right away 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.910
 I apologize for the quality because I rented 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.689
 on the phone 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:08.859
 so well, that's roughly changing with us 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.859
 thus highlighting 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 various color schemes green red 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:33.159
 yellow that's the way it happens 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:36.030
 strobe merge so on every 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.590
 will be able to pick up for yourself 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 arranging color so it looks in 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.740
 the general interior that I want to notice very 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 Conveniently, you can adjust the backlight under 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.009
 myself in this case I have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.539
 head device 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.050
 pioneer 7 500 which changes colors 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:03.630
 like buttons and display 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:06.580
 if we can change the backlight 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.100
 devices why not change and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.050
 tape recorder yes that is like this 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.050
 it's all regulated 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 and a similar situation we have with buttons 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.800
 that is, I liked someone more 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.920
 paint write in lichku 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.150
 how it all was done and accordingly 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.430
 I will describe the materials that were 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.790
 used everyone thanks for your attention 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.790
 until
