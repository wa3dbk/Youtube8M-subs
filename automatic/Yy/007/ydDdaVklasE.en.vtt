sibility this starts to have in about
one<00:00:54.510> second<00:00:55.020> sooner<00:00:55.170> maybe<00:00:55.949> around<00:00:56.340> three

seconds<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:58.230> pattern<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> little<00:00:59.280> bit

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
seconds and the pattern is a little bit

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.630 
seconds and the pattern is a little bit
tighter<00:01:01.070> when<00:01:02.070> you're<00:01:02.219> actually<00:01:02.399> using

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
tighter when you're actually using

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
tighter when you're actually using
stability<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> um<00:01:05.000> only<00:01:06.000> affects<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.659> gun<00:01:07.100> when

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
stability so um only affects a gun when

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.969 
stability so um only affects a gun when
you're<00:01:08.400> aiming<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:08.880> site<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.470> reset

you're aiming down site you can reset

this<00:01:26.509> prophecy<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:28.189> not<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.400> good<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
this prophecy is not that good if you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.200 
this prophecy is not that good if you
ask<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:31.159> switching<00:01:32.159> over<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.549> iron<00:01:32.820> side

ask me switching over to the iron side

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.359 
ask me switching over to the iron side
here<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:35.390> without<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.600> stability<00:01:37.189> notice<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
here and without the stability notice it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.780 
here and without the stability notice it
just<00:01:38.579> starts<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> move<00:01:39.210> around<00:01:40.250> if<00:01:41.250> you're

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
just starts to move around if you're

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.530 
just starts to move around if you're
right<00:01:42.000> watching<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> corner<00:01:44.180> overall<00:01:45.180> you're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
right watching a corner overall you're

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.090 
right watching a corner overall you're
looking<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.310> someone<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.880> head<00:01:48.119> glitch

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
looking at a someone time to head glitch

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.850 
looking at a someone time to head glitch
so<00:01:50.100> little<00:01:50.340> annoying<00:01:50.759> when<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.439> site<00:01:52.439> starts

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
so little annoying when that site starts

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.230 
so little annoying when that site starts
to<00:01:52.950> wander<00:01:53.220> around<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.259> just

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
to wander around so I get out of it just

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
to wander around so I get out of it just
stop<00:01:57.240> aiming<00:01:57.689> down<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> site<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.710> right

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
stop aiming down the site and go right

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.340 
stop aiming down the site and go right
back<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.759> you'll<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.540> target<00:02:00.990> run

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
back to it and you'll be on target run

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.080 
back to it and you'll be on target run
away

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
away

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.580 
away
it's<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.510> help<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> reco<00:02:04.200> pattern

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's not going to help the reco pattern

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.990 
it's not going to help the reco pattern
though<00:02:04.770> almonds<00:02:05.730> mentioned<00:02:06.180> earlier<00:02:06.570> today

this<00:02:09.000> ability<00:02:09.330> proficiency<00:02:10.110> does<00:02:10.500> nothing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
this ability proficiency does nothing

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.300 
this ability proficiency does nothing
for<00:02:11.280> recall<00:02:11.880> actually<00:02:13.010> makes<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> little

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
for recall actually makes it a little

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.620 
for recall actually makes it a little
bit<00:02:14.460> worse<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:16.590> seems<00:02:18.560> gonna<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.570> doing<00:02:21.570> a

bit worse it seems gonna be I'm doing a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.320 
bit worse it seems gonna be I'm doing a
series<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.110> stability<00:02:22.680> or<00:02:23.220> no<00:02:23.430> stability<00:02:23.700> and

like kick and no kick on the weapons

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.050 
like kick and no kick on the weapons
just<00:02:28.020> forgot<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.500> guys<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.890> see<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.790> true

just forgot you guys can see the true
impact<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:31.100> not<00:02:32.100> necessarily<00:02:32.450> comparing<00:02:33.450> the

two<00:02:33.980> when<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> initially<00:02:35.370> thought<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.900> that

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
two when I initially thought of that

two when I initially thought of that
idea<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.709> was<00:02:38.040> thinking<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> maybe

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
idea I was thinking that maybe

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.680 
idea I was thinking that maybe
instability<00:02:40.830> actually<00:02:41.550> kept<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:42.000> gun<00:02:42.180> centered

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
instability actually kept a gun centered

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.660 
instability actually kept a gun centered
longer<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.770> could<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.340> recall

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
longer it could have to recall

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.690 
longer it could have to recall

sway<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:55.250> don't<00:02:56.250> think<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.520> difference<00:02:56.730> is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
sway I don't think the difference is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.780 
sway I don't think the difference is
even<00:02:57.390> really<00:02:57.630> noticeable<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:59.610> should

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
even really noticeable you should

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.000 
even really noticeable you should
definitely<00:03:00.000> check<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.110> yourself<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.770> see

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
definitely check it out yourself and see

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.120 
definitely check it out yourself and see
if<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.370> worthy<00:03:03.140> being<00:03:04.140> used<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:04.830> um<00:03:07.130> think

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
if it's worthy being used but um think

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.210 
if it's worthy being used but um think
I'm<00:03:08.310> gonna<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.970> call<00:03:09.500> this<00:03:10.500> one<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.769> fell
