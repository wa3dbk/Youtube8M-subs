a really great job you could put this on
the<00:01:24.270> pencil<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.840> use<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.680> of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the pencil but I use a lot of

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
the pencil but I use a lot of
cooperative<00:01:26.490> learning<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.030> classroom<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
cooperative learning in my classroom and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.380 
cooperative learning in my classroom and
I<00:01:28.470> found<00:01:29.040> these<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.490> flags<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:29.970> really

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
I found these little flags to be really

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.999 
I found these little flags to be really
cool<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.900> could<00:01:31.140> give<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> pencil<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
cool so I could give a pencil with a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.520 
cool so I could give a pencil with a
flag<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:33.000> whether<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.720> leader<00:01:33.990> or<00:01:34.470> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flag to whether it's the leader or a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.179 
flag to whether it's the leader or a
specific<00:01:35.659> student<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.229> group<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:38.040> in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
specific student in the group that's in

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.280 
specific student in the group that's in
charge<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.970> specific<00:01:39.659> job<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.110> thought

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
charge of a specific job so I thought

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.710 
charge of a specific job so I thought
these<00:01:40.470> would<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:41.070> neat<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.520> very

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
these would be pretty neat and very

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.270 
these would be pretty neat and very
inexpensive<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.200> ten<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.040> pack

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
inexpensive and there are ten in a pack

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
inexpensive and there are ten in a pack
so<00:01:45.090> two<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.360> each<00:01:45.570> which<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.290> pretty<00:01:46.439> nice

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
so two of each which is pretty nice

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.770 
so two of each which is pretty nice
because<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.189> five<00:01:47.369> groups<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:48.329> lose<00:01:48.600> one

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
to put two on either level so two on one

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.030
