00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 The youtube people today, I'm going to do it. 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.650
 a take a review here need to 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.330
 block and gps test or nothing more than 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 gps this gps test it shows is when 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.660
 the satellites were connected here to 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.710
 do triangulation to do the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 position of the dodo where we are 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.939
 protect them a lot today instead of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 use only the indication that is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.710
 looking for gps all tapas toc toc first 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 you click on it รณ here're seeing that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.550
 are yellow and are connected 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.120
 others here are losing the signal 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 is very weak friends up tips 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 here o 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 how many meters the precision 10 meters in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.989
 use of satellites in use 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 believe file how many are up 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.520
 being seen personal touch 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 So what happened to that location? 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.090
 Here is Brazil, then Brazil and Brazil. 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.680
 does 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.960
 it shows all the connections of the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.810
 satellites on gps 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 done that who is going in on Google Maps is 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 very interesting 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:32.570
 He's going to point it out to us. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.570
 indicate to us where we are 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.619
 You can see that he has a 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.619
 Here setinha 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.000
 It's kind of the place where I am. 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.439
 according to the goal by turning the little set to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:04.340
 turn along also sing her turned training 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.340
 because of abuse 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.209
 So this one is more or less mine. 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:16.260
 location to deal with and as is 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.930
 according to the largest number of satellites 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:24.549
 smaller this ball around da da 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.340
 also had more precisely how and 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.560
 as I do because already I'm not 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.290
 connected to the internet as was the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.269
 map it is already curled on the tablet 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.549
 so that's why I have in life no 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.349
 It's just too much here he does not have it anymore 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.810
 one more map sees and carries a 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.870
 just a little bit I do not have much 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.150
 so blurred where I was already 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.180
 loaded personal touch 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.170
 this one was a gps test showing 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.060
 for you that you can connect to in a 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.840
 your region it indicates to you where you 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.090
 it is and load the seated gps 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.299
 connected to the Internet but if you leave 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.230
 scene since dodo closer to home 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.519
 here you will not you will not be able to 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.709
 Will you be able to have more map? 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.000
 Ok folks, I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.459
 gives the gps hint at video god the 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.459
 joinha, thank you and see you later
