so once you have learned all of the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.789 
so once you have learned all of the
basic<00:00:03.090> steps<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.720> beginner<00:00:04.049> section<00:00:04.560> it's

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
basic steps in the beginner section it's

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.320 
basic steps in the beginner section it's
a<00:00:05.100> lot<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.490> fun<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> try<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.060> put<00:00:06.180> them

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
a lot of fun to try and put them

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.600 
a lot of fun to try and put them
together<00:00:06.450> into<00:00:07.069> combinations<00:00:08.069> or<00:00:08.309> small

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
together into combinations or small

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.879 
together into combinations or small
routines<00:00:09.059> I've<00:00:09.360> made<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:09.960> an<00:00:10.080> example<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.679> for

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
routines I've made up an example one for

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.039 
routines I've made up an example one for
you<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> practice<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.550> I'll<00:00:12.450> show<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.929> you

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
you to practice with I'll show it to you

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.390 
you to practice with I'll show it to you
first<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.530> then<00:00:13.740> we'll<00:00:13.920> break<00:00:13.950> down<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
first and then we'll break down the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:27.880 
first and then we'll break down the
moves

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.859 

there's<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.099> combination<00:00:29.849> now<00:00:30.269> let's<00:00:30.630> break

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
there's our combination now let's break

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
there's our combination now let's break
down<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> moves<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.679> try<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:31.980> together<00:00:32.219> if

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
down the moves and try it together if

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.520 
down the moves and try it together if
you<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:33.989> some<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> steps

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
you don't know what some of the steps

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.709 
you don't know what some of the steps
are<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.399> always<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.880> back<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.329> basic

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
are you can always go back to the basic

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.630 
are you can always go back to the basic
videos<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.260> watch<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> individual<00:00:38.399> steps

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
videos and watch the individual steps

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.069 
videos and watch the individual steps
that<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:39.660> them<00:00:39.780> into<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that way you can put them into the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
that way you can put them into the
routine<00:00:40.410> starting<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.550> our<00:00:41.700> left<00:00:41.940> leg<00:00:42.059> we
