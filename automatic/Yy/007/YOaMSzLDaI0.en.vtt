starting a fire with the flashlight you
can't<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.509> right<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.409> start

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
can't just use this right here to start

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.969 
can't just use this right here to start
a<00:01:07.740> fire<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.670> need<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.950> of

work to get it to do that

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.680 
work to get it to do that
all<00:01:12.570> we're<00:01:12.810> doing<00:01:13.050> is<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.350> taking<00:01:13.440> the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
all we're doing is we're taking the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.900 
all we're doing is we're taking the
reflective<00:01:15.690> shape<00:01:15.960> that's<00:01:16.200> inside<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> this

shoot<00:01:19.710> light<00:01:20.280> along<00:01:20.550> distance<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> we're

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
shoot light along distance and we're

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.960 
shoot light along distance and we're
going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.960> running<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.410> through<00:01:22.970> different

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
going to be running it through different

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
going to be running it through different
things<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.479> act<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.810> magnifiers<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> see

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
things and act as magnifiers you can see

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.010 
things and act as magnifiers you can see
this<00:01:26.009> crystal<00:01:26.460> ball<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.880> an<00:01:27.479> excellent

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this crystal ball is an excellent

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.969 
this crystal ball is an excellent
magnifier<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.830> is<00:01:28.950> probably<00:01:30.950> 15<00:01:31.950> X<00:01:32.160> or<00:01:32.550> but

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
magnifier this is probably 15 X or but

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.690 
magnifier this is probably 15 X or but
it<00:01:34.979> also<00:01:35.130> spins<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.820> nicely<00:01:37.580> we're<00:01:38.580> going

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
it also spins really nicely we're going

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.010 
it also spins really nicely we're going
to<00:01:38.759> be<00:01:38.850> running<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> light<00:01:39.390> through<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
to be running the light through that and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.270 
to be running the light through that and
seeing<00:01:40.289> if<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.440> can<00:01:40.590> catch<00:01:40.800> something<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.100> fire

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
seeing if we can catch something on fire

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.700 
seeing if we can catch something on fire
okay<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.789> got<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> light<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.960> ball<00:01:43.170> set<00:01:43.560> up

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
okay I got the light and the ball set up

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
okay I got the light and the ball set up
and<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> turn<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> light<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
and I'm going to turn the light on and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.289 
and I'm going to turn the light on and
see<00:01:45.329> how<00:01:45.390> long<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> takes

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.300 

and<00:01:54.049> see<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.259> started<00:01:54.770> smouldering

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
and see that started smouldering

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:17.770 
and see that started smouldering
instantly<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.420> with<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:16.780> crystal

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
instantly so that is with the crystal

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.140 
instantly so that is with the crystal
bowl<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:21.760> small<00:02:22.760> magnifying

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
bowl now I have the small magnifying

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.309 
bowl now I have the small magnifying
glass<00:02:24.489> set<00:02:25.489> up<00:02:28.209> this<00:02:29.209> has<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> longer<00:02:29.959> focal

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
glass set up this has a longer focal

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:56.560 
glass set up this has a longer focal
point

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.970 

see<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.990> actually<00:02:58.230> didn't<00:02:58.620> put<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> hole

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
see that that actually didn't put a hole

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.020 
see that that actually didn't put a hole
in<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.280> but<00:02:59.460> it<00:02:59.550> did<00:02:59.730> start<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> scorch<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.840> and

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
in it but it did start to scorch it and

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.930 
in it but it did start to scorch it and
I<00:03:03.030> have<00:03:03.240> a<00:03:03.510> very<00:03:04.230> nice<00:03:04.500> small<00:03:05.040> 6-inch

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
I have a very nice small 6-inch

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.390 
I have a very nice small 6-inch
parabolic<00:03:06.510> mirror<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:08.100> going<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.280> be

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
parabolic mirror that I'm going to be

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.100 
parabolic mirror that I'm going to be
turning<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.150> light<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.690> I'm<00:03:09.930> going<00:03:10.080> to

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
turning the light on and I'm going to

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.930 
turning the light on and I'm going to
scoot<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.890> way<00:03:11.160> because<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.760> is

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
scoot it this way because this is

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.330 
scoot it this way because this is
reflective<00:03:12.770> so<00:03:13.770> we're<00:03:13.890> going<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.070> move<00:03:14.190> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
reflective so we're going to move this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:21.260 
reflective so we're going to move this
into<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.640> focal<00:03:15.030> point<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:20.850> can<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.120> because

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
into the focal point you can see because

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.750 
into the focal point you can see because
the<00:03:21.540> parabolic<00:03:21.840> mirror<00:03:22.290> has<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:23.100> larger<00:03:23.550> area

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the parabolic mirror has a larger area

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.100 
the parabolic mirror has a larger area
it's<00:03:24.060> collecting<00:03:24.450> more<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> light<00:03:24.960> and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
it's collecting more of the light and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.710 
it's collecting more of the light and
concentrating<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.920> this<00:03:26.760> has<00:03:26.970> very<00:03:27.540> good

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
concentrating it this has very good

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420 
concentrating it this has very good
optics<00:03:28.110> on<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.620> it's<00:03:28.770> actually<00:03:28.950> doing<00:03:29.370> a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
optics on it so it's actually doing a

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.390 
optics on it so it's actually doing a
really<00:03:29.460> good<00:03:29.850> job<00:03:30.060> really<00:03:30.360> fast<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:32.160> fact

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
really good job really fast in fact

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.380 
really good job really fast in fact
that's<00:03:32.550> probably<00:03:32.670> going<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.030> burst<00:03:33.210> into

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
that's probably going to burst into

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:44.360 
that's probably going to burst into
flames

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.050 

I<00:03:44.810> also<00:03:45.810> have<00:03:46.140> my<00:03:46.290> rpm<00:03:46.830> tester<00:03:47.280> which<00:03:47.459> has<00:03:47.760> a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
I also have my rpm tester which has a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.309 
I also have my rpm tester which has a
laser<00:03:48.569> on<00:03:48.900> it

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.690 

the<00:03:52.319> laser<00:03:52.590> pattern<00:03:53.010> looks<00:03:53.250> something<00:03:53.519> like

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the laser pattern looks something like

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.729 
the laser pattern looks something like
this

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
this

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.589 
this
and<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.459> can<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.730> how<00:03:56.790> wide<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.360> that's

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
and you can see how wide it is that's

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.240 
and you can see how wide it is that's
because<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.080> has<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.560> lens<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.190> there<00:03:59.480> so<00:04:00.480> that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
because this has a lens in there so that

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.380 
because this has a lens in there so that
gives<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.489> little<00:04:02.610> bit<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.060> different

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
gives it a little bit of a different

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.940 
gives it a little bit of a different
shape<00:04:04.370> what<00:04:05.370> I'm<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.640> do<00:04:06.260> is<00:04:07.260> shine<00:04:07.709> it

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
shape what I'm going to do is shine it

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.309 
shape what I'm going to do is shine it
into<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.400> parabolic<00:04:08.849> mirror<00:04:09.150> see<00:04:10.049> if<00:04:10.110> we<00:04:10.200> can

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
into the parabolic mirror see if we can

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.440 
into the parabolic mirror see if we can
focus<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:11.000> if<00:04:12.000> maybe<00:04:12.390> that'll<00:04:12.659> work

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
focus it if maybe that'll work

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.210 
focus it if maybe that'll work
so<00:04:15.450> I'm<00:04:15.599> shining<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.229> into<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.560> mirror<00:04:16.949> and

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
so I'm shining it into the mirror and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.050 
so I'm shining it into the mirror and
it's<00:04:18.180> bouncing<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:19.289> there<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.820> mirror

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
it's bouncing from there to the mirror

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.090 
it's bouncing from there to the mirror
back<00:04:21.419> over<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.049> our<00:04:22.079> target<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:25.289> I'm<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.039> to

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
back over to our target and I'm going to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:38.820 
back over to our target and I'm going to
bring<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:27.000> in<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.270> tighten<00:04:27.660> it

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.800 

you<00:04:39.520> can<00:04:39.670> see<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.000> it<00:04:40.150> tightens<00:04:40.480> it<00:04:40.600> down

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
you can see well it tightens it down

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.040 
you can see well it tightens it down
this<00:04:41.080> laser<00:04:42.090> won't<00:04:43.090> actually<00:04:43.300> burn<00:04:43.810> this

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
this laser won't actually burn this

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.600 
this laser won't actually burn this
material<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.710> do<00:04:44.770> have<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.010> laser<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.490> I'm

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
material I do have a laser that I'm

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.610 
material I do have a laser that I'm
going<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.760> show<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.000> in<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.150> future<00:04:46.360> video<00:04:46.620> well

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
going to show you in a future video well

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.800 
going to show you in a future video well
that<00:04:47.890> cuts<00:04:48.430> right<00:04:48.640> through<00:04:48.700> stuff<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.540> burns

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
that cuts right through stuff it burns

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.870 
that cuts right through stuff it burns
it<00:04:50.020> instantly<00:04:51.690> it's<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.810> legal<00:04:53.140> laser<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.880> show

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it instantly it's a legal laser to show

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.330 
it instantly it's a legal laser to show
you<00:04:54.940> where<00:04:55.210> you<00:04:55.300> can<00:04:55.420> get<00:04:55.570> them<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:57.070> now<00:04:57.190> what

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
you where you can get them so now what

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.640 
you where you can get them so now what
I've<00:04:57.460> done<00:04:57.610> is<00:04:57.820> I've<00:04:57.970> taken<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.510> light<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:59.560> the

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
I've done is I've taken the light to the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.980 
I've done is I've taken the light to the
parabolic<00:04:59.980> mirror<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.000> test<00:05:01.360> tube<00:05:01.450> filled

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
parabolic mirror to a test tube filled

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.940 
parabolic mirror to a test tube filled
with<00:05:02.110> some<00:05:02.710> black<00:05:03.610> screws<00:05:04.740> there's<00:05:05.740> also

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
with some black screws there's also

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.770 
with some black screws there's also
water<00:05:06.340> inside<00:05:06.820> of<00:05:06.880> there<00:05:07.210> and<00:05:07.450> I'm<00:05:07.630> going<00:05:07.750> to

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
water inside of there and I'm going to

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.630 
water inside of there and I'm going to
check<00:05:08.290> the<00:05:08.440> focal<00:05:08.800> point<00:05:08.980> make<00:05:09.340> sure<00:05:09.490> that

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
check the focal point make sure that

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.200 
check the focal point make sure that
we're<00:05:09.820> right<00:05:10.000> about<00:05:10.240> that<00:05:12.000> problem<00:05:13.000> with<00:05:13.090> the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
we're right about that problem with the

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.790 
we're right about that problem with the
parabolic<00:05:13.480> mirror<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:13.990> large<00:05:14.200> target<00:05:14.650> like

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
parabolic mirror and a large target like

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.530 
parabolic mirror and a large target like
this<00:05:15.010> is<00:05:15.190> you<00:05:15.280> actually<00:05:15.550> block<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.910> lot<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.450> the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
this is you actually block a lot of the

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.980 
this is you actually block a lot of the
light<00:05:17.100> so<00:05:18.100> they<00:05:18.820> work<00:05:19.000> best<00:05:19.300> on<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:19.630> finer

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
light so they work best on a finer

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.270 
light so they work best on a finer
target<00:05:20.500> like<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:22.740> we're<00:05:23.740> going<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.950> see<00:05:24.100> how

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
target like that we're going to see how

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.040 
target like that we're going to see how
long<00:05:24.430> this<00:05:24.640> takes<00:05:24.760> I'm<00:05:25.240> going<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.480> time<00:05:25.780> this

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
long this takes I'm going to time this

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.580 
long this takes I'm going to time this
and<00:05:26.490> stop<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.700> video<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.330> see<00:05:28.960> if<00:05:28.990> this

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
and stop the video and see if this

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.080 
and stop the video and see if this
actually<00:05:30.010> goes<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.460> you<00:05:30.490> don't<00:05:30.700> have<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.910> sit

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
actually goes so you don't have to sit

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:40.660 
actually goes so you don't have to sit
here<00:05:31.240> and<00:05:31.360> watch<00:05:31.510> me<00:05:31.780> make<00:05:31.900> water<00:05:32.170> boil

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:40.670 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:06:01.440 

you

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.640 

so<00:06:02.450> we<00:06:02.570> have<00:06:02.660> a<00:06:02.690> little<00:06:02.900> bit<00:06:03.080> of<00:06:03.200> a<00:06:03.260> boil<00:06:03.500> it

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
so we have a little bit of a boil it

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.640 
so we have a little bit of a boil it
took<00:06:03.830> eight<00:06:04.010> minutes<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.670> do<00:06:05.440> from<00:06:06.440> this

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
took eight minutes to do from this

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.640 
took eight minutes to do from this
flashlight<00:06:10.960> concentrated<00:06:11.960> by<00:06:12.050> this<00:06:12.110> six<00:06:12.470> inch

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
flashlight concentrated by this six inch

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:19.600 
flashlight concentrated by this six inch
parabolic<00:06:13.130> mirror<00:06:17.440> on<00:06:18.440> these<00:06:18.980> black<00:06:19.250> screws

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
parabolic mirror on these black screws

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.120 
parabolic mirror on these black screws
inside<00:06:20.000> of<00:06:20.150> the<00:06:20.210> test<00:06:20.450> tube

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.130 
inside of the test tube

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.650 
inside of the test tube
so<00:06:22.130> with<00:06:22.400> that<00:06:22.550> flashlight<00:06:22.820> we<00:06:23.210> were<00:06:23.330> able<00:06:23.510> to

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
so with that flashlight we were able to

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.200 
so with that flashlight we were able to
boil<00:06:23.930> some<00:06:24.200> water<00:06:24.230> very<00:06:24.740> small<00:06:25.070> amount<00:06:25.370> and<00:06:25.580> we

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
boil some water very small amount and we

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.450 
boil some water very small amount and we
were<00:06:26.330> also<00:06:26.540> able<00:06:26.870> to<00:06:27.050> easily<00:06:27.410> start<00:06:27.920> a<00:06:27.980> fire

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
were also able to easily start a fire

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.280 
were also able to easily start a fire

interesting little fact about LED lights

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.330 
interesting little fact about LED lights
they<00:06:38.690> have<00:06:38.720> a<00:06:38.840> little<00:06:39.020> lens<00:06:39.320> in<00:06:39.590> them<00:06:39.740> and<00:06:39.920> I'm

there I have a whiteboard so what I'm
going<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.270> do<00:06:47.510> is<00:06:47.780> put<00:06:48.410> this<00:06:48.560> through<00:06:48.830> here

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.010 
going to do is put this through here

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:54.520 
going to do is put this through here
like<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.490> and<00:06:49.840> show<00:06:50.840> you<00:06:53.170> see<00:06:54.170> if<00:06:54.230> I<00:06:54.320> can<00:06:54.440> get

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
like that and show you see if I can get

00:06:54.530 --> 00:07:03.629 
like that and show you see if I can get

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.510 

the<00:07:04.639> LEDs<00:07:05.230> this<00:07:06.230> type<00:07:06.500> are<00:07:06.740> not<00:07:06.770> strong<00:07:07.250> enough

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
the LEDs this type are not strong enough

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.930 
the LEDs this type are not strong enough
to<00:07:08.560> effectively<00:07:09.560> start<00:07:10.250> a<00:07:10.310> fire<00:07:10.550> but<00:07:10.760> that's

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
to effectively start a fire but that's

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.000 
to effectively start a fire but that's
pretty<00:07:11.120> good<00:07:11.240> light<00:07:11.450> considering<00:07:12.139> that<00:07:12.830> this

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
pretty good light considering that this

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.330 
pretty good light considering that this
is<00:07:13.190> just<00:07:13.400> a<00:07:13.490> little<00:07:13.669> 2<00:07:14.360> watt<00:07:14.540> bulb<00:07:15.100> in<00:07:16.100> a<00:07:16.190> nice
