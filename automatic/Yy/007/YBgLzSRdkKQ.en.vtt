out of the three and the funnel map that
they<00:02:18.390> released<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> map<00:02:19.920> called<00:02:20.220> perish<00:02:20.910> or

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
they released is a map called perish or

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
they released is a map called perish or
it's<00:02:21.840> definitely<00:02:22.230> perish<00:02:22.530> eights<00:02:22.769> perish<00:02:23.130> and

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
that's me defusing the bomb

the<00:03:54.690> 22<00:03:55.319> gun<00:03:55.560> streak<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.790> reason<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.120> did

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the 22 gun streak and the reason I did

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.430 
the 22 gun streak and the reason I did
that<00:03:57.299> was<00:03:57.420> because<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.780> didn't<00:03:58.109> believe<00:03:58.260> my

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
specialist game on one of them and I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.439 
specialist game on one of them and I
actually<00:04:31.650> pick<00:04:31.830> up<00:04:31.949> like<00:04:32.160> so<00:04:32.849> many<00:04:32.880> flag<00:04:33.210> cats

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
actually pick up like so many flag cats

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.420 
actually pick up like so many flag cats
and<00:04:33.660> we<00:04:33.720> barely<00:04:33.930> win<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:34.259> game<00:04:34.440> pretty<00:04:35.160> yeah
