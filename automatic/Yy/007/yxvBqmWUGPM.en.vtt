here we have the Fast Eddie 1000 it's

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.050 
here we have the Fast Eddie 1000 it's
got<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> char<00:00:03.419> broiler<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.200> smoker<00:00:04.560> on<00:00:04.680> it

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
got a char broiler and a smoker on it

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.089 
got a char broiler and a smoker on it
there<00:00:06.060> reaches<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> temperature<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.200> 400

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
there reaches a temperature of 400

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.150 
there reaches a temperature of 400
degrees<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.820> 8<00:00:09.090> minutes<00:00:12.710> and<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:14.040> we

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
degrees in about 8 minutes and here we

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.790 
degrees in about 8 minutes and here we
have<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.809> double<00:00:15.809> wall<00:00:15.929> construction<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.680> the

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
have the double wall construction on the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.779 
have the double wall construction on the
sides<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.210> hoods<00:00:19.430> insulated<00:00:20.430> handle

top cooking rack the porcelain grate

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.109 
top cooking rack the porcelain grate
over<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.599> sear<00:00:27.900> burner<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.429> this<00:00:29.429> over<00:00:29.849> here

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
over the sear burner and this over here

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.510 
over the sear burner and this over here
is<00:00:30.330> your<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:30.810> smoker<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.830> no<00:00:32.099> direct

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
is your side smoker there's no direct

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
is your side smoker there's no direct
heat<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.270> flame<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.989> hits<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.340> all

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
heat or flame that hits that so it's all

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
heat or flame that hits that so it's all
convection<00:00:36.030> style<00:00:37.670> control<00:00:38.670> panel<00:00:39.649> variable

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
convection style control panel variable

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.209 
convection style control panel variable
temperature<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:42.030> can<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.350> dial

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
temperature you can go up and down dial

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
temperature you can go up and down dial
everything<00:00:44.700> in

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.200 

it's<00:00:49.740> the<00:00:49.890> fast<00:00:50.130> Eddy<00:00:50.370> pillows

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.460 

it's<00:00:54.210> kind<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.450> nice<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.990> a<00:00:55.110> side

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
it's kind of nice because as a side

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.590 
it's kind of nice because as a side
shelf<00:00:55.830> with<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.640> stack<00:00:56.880> going<00:00:57.210> through<00:00:57.450> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
shelf with your stack going through it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.290 
shelf with your stack going through it
really<00:00:58.260> easy<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.800> together<00:00:59.660> over<00:01:00.660> here

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
really easy to put together over here

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
really easy to put together over here
you<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.450> hopper<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.170> there<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:04.589> 20

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you have a hopper right there that's 20

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.040 
you have a hopper right there that's 20
pounds<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.280> pellets<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:06.090> holds<00:01:06.360> 26

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
pounds of pellets it actually holds 26

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.080 
pounds of pellets it actually holds 26
so<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.010> you're<00:01:08.160> having<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> longer<00:01:08.820> term

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so if you're having the longer term

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
so if you're having the longer term
smoked<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:10.440> only<00:01:10.590> burns<00:01:11.390> 1.2<00:01:12.390> pounds<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:14.160> 400

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
smoked it only burns 1.2 pounds at 400

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.000 
smoked it only burns 1.2 pounds at 400
degrees<00:01:15.060> per<00:01:15.360> hour<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.770> very

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
degrees per hour so it's very very

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.500 
degrees per hour so it's very very
efficient<00:01:17.550> system<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.460> 2<00:01:21.000> minutes<00:01:21.330> in

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
efficient system it's about 2 minutes in

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.859 
efficient system it's about 2 minutes in
here<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.260> great<00:01:23.220> fire<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.910> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
here and we have a great fire going you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.600 
here and we have a great fire going you
see<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.140> under<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> that's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.040> flame<00:01:26.310> tamer

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
see it under that that's a flame tamer

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.190 
see it under that that's a flame tamer
so<00:01:27.000> there's<00:01:27.180> no<00:01:27.330> direct<00:01:27.649> flame<00:01:28.649> to<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> food

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
so there's no direct flame to the food

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.050 
so there's no direct flame to the food
it<00:01:31.200> disperses<00:01:31.619> also<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> heat<00:01:32.700> coming

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it disperses also all the heat coming

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.870 
it disperses also all the heat coming
off<00:01:33.149> on<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.460> an<00:01:35.550> internal

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
off on there it's got an internal

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.029 
off on there it's got an internal
temperature<00:01:36.630> probe<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.440> will<00:01:37.590> control<00:01:37.920> your

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
temperature probe that will control your

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.160 
temperature probe that will control your
temperature<00:01:38.430> gauge<00:01:40.250> locking<00:01:41.250> casters<00:01:42.170> full

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
temperature gauge locking casters full

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
temperature gauge locking casters full
metal<00:01:43.380> frame<00:01:44.720> now<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> newer<00:01:46.200> models<00:01:46.590> it's

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
metal frame now on the newer models it's

00:01:46.770 --> 00:02:00.250 
metal frame now on the newer models it's
going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.070> stainless<00:01:47.520> steel<00:01:47.729> model

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.550 

just<00:02:00.770> taking<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.190> from<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:02.080> indirect<00:02:03.080> rate<00:02:03.410> to

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
just taking it from the indirect rate to

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.910 
just taking it from the indirect rate to
the<00:02:03.620> direct<00:02:08.170> then<00:02:09.170> how<00:02:09.320> much<00:02:09.470> longer<00:02:09.830> would

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the direct then how much longer would

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.500 
the direct then how much longer would
you<00:02:10.070> leave<00:02:10.190> them<00:02:10.310> on<00:02:10.369> there<00:02:10.610> about<00:02:11.150> two<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
you leave them on there about two to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.000 
you leave them on there about two to
three<00:02:11.540> minutes<00:02:11.960> aside<00:02:12.260> depend<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.710> how<00:02:12.830> much

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
three minutes aside depend on how much

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.720 
three minutes aside depend on how much
you<00:02:13.070> want<00:02:13.280> done<00:02:13.550> about<00:02:14.080> 400<00:02:15.080> agrees

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730
