00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello everyone with you kama and now i want 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.510
 show you one more industrial 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.080
 minecraft assembly for version 1 5 2 this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.269
 assembly consists of 50 mods and let's 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.190
 we will begin the review 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:21.320
 first mod as you can see it here 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.810
 such mod balls are called biospheres 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.670
 or biospheres that add themselves here 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.890
 such balls are more accurate than the biosphere 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.870
 they have different biomes there are glades 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:42.000
 there is a forest there is a desert different in general 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 the biosphere that is not the sphere and the second mode 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.719
 this 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.250
 minimap rei's minimap turns on 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.840
 big on the x button menu letter m and 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 put an end to some world on 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.829
 button with the following mods let's be 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.980
 to survey in amber here with me 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 though not much interference here such here 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.930
 no tags but I don't even know what 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.520
 connected well let's still see 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.090
 first mod is jamie if in which a mod 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.600
 which adds furniture to the minikravt this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.670
 decorative mod will add not only 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.880
 furniture but here are the heads of the Christmas tree and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 any decor up any 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.150
 decor just like that 2 fashion t care bears 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.900
 which will add more beams to the minicraft in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 these gnomes 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.400
 will their trees their births in general 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.040
 all in these gnomes your next mod is 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.110
 global industrial craft in principle 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.229
 they all recognize that I donâ€™t have a game 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.009
 with texture it is thanks to the usual 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.460
 textures textures textures pac ordinary 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.140
 but this client has its own texture pack 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.219
 thanks to which we can normally 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 play and see all these textures and 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:08.640
 Now I'll show you it's 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.149
 textures here are two packs fabo pack 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.770
 and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.650
 with uart expander 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.530
 i played on a sort of expander very 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.900
 wonderful act but because I 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.210
 not loaded 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.110
 there is an inscription incomprehensible written picture 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.250
 chalice right at all does not work well in 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.190
 general play with this smartex and 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.010
 let's look at the assembly further here 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.350
 there is a mod wildly 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:43.970
 which adds decor like i 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:47.840
 I know that's such here trees Jingu bric 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.090
 here so kraft well in general 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.080
 play look also have a build 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.300
 craft mod that is needed along with 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.660
 industrial that's what we see here 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.620
 some texture too no well play and 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:08.250
 exxon grade you will have this mod 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.650
 adds different career engines to pipes 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:17.640
 and here are these facades and there is a bible 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.910
 craft also mod decor which adds 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.930
 different shelf stands here such here on 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.340
 which can be hung 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:33.750
 armor now I'll show you yes at all 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:38.690

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:45.560

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.560

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.980
 appears okay play their grade 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.660
 I repeat once again and in general all 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.700
 there seems to be nothing there also 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.880
 there are no such mods in this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.630
 inventory 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.459
 Well, in general, I advise you to play the assembly 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.390
 Excellent stable I did not lag 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.840
 Now the truth is lagging because of the video recording 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.880
 played it dont even know but for 3 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.060
 and perhaps it is not for me to survive 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.330
 enjoyed it and decided to review everything 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.950
