00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
they're top just to make sure it does

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.869 
they're top just to make sure it does
Ben<00:03:02.810> this<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.989> just<00:03:04.170> optional<00:03:04.829> but<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.609> can't

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
Ben this is just optional but you can't

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.780 
Ben this is just optional but you can't
put<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.450> top<00:03:06.689> and<00:03:06.900> bottom<00:03:07.099> it<00:03:08.099> really

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
put it on the top and bottom it really

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.390 
put it on the top and bottom it really
doesn't<00:03:09.150> matter<00:03:09.299> I'm<00:03:09.659> just<00:03:09.870> gonna<00:03:10.019> do<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.069> just

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
doesn't matter I'm just gonna do it just

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:25.440 
doesn't matter I'm just gonna do it just
just<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.519> make<00:03:14.760> sure<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> doesn't<00:03:15.720> spin

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.930 

so<00:03:26.450> now<00:03:26.980> pretty<00:03:27.980> much<00:03:28.220> what<00:03:28.490> you're<00:03:28.640> gonna<00:03:28.760> do

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
so now pretty much what you're gonna do

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.240 
so now pretty much what you're gonna do
is<00:03:29.030> you're<00:03:29.120> going<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.330> make<00:03:29.960> sure<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.920> it

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
is you're going to make sure that it

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.530 
is you're going to make sure that it
goes<00:03:32.050> straight<00:03:33.050> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.620> center<00:03:34.240> like<00:03:35.240> you

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
goes straight in the center like you

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:47.590 
goes straight in the center like you
want<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.050> so<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:45.820> have<00:03:46.820> to<00:03:46.850> spin<00:03:47.450> a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
want it so just like I have to spin a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.780 
want it so just like I have to spin a
little<00:03:47.780> bit<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.370> right<00:03:49.550> position<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:51.790> it's

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
little bit in the right position so it's

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.690 
little bit in the right position so it's
roughly<00:03:53.330> in<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.960> right<00:03:54.140> position<00:03:54.620> right<00:03:54.800> here

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.490 

so<00:03:58.700> then<00:03:59.030> what<00:03:59.210> you're<00:03:59.300> going<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.510> do<00:03:59.840> he's

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
so then what you're going to do he's

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:18.370 
so then what you're going to do he's
gonna<00:04:00.620> put<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.820> part<00:04:02.150> back<00:04:02.540> on<00:04:13.960> on<00:04:14.960> so<00:04:17.380> then

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
gonna put this part back on on so then

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.920 
gonna put this part back on on so then
if<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.400> stop<00:04:19.730> the<00:04:19.940> spin<00:04:20.209> this<00:04:20.480> screw<00:04:20.780> is

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
if you stop the spin this screw is

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.360 
if you stop the spin this screw is
really<00:04:21.230> easy<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.530> take<00:04:21.799> out

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
really easy to take out

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.810 
really easy to take out
since<00:04:22.880> it's<00:04:23.330> not<00:04:23.840> since<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.500> spinner<00:04:25.490> part

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
since it's not since the spinner part

00:04:25.820 --> 00:05:15.110 
since it's not since the spinner part
doesn't<00:04:26.060> spin<00:04:26.420> anymore<00:04:26.950> just<00:04:27.950> it's<00:04:28.910> really

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:27.560 

and<00:05:16.880> then<00:05:17.880> of<00:05:18.150> course<00:05:19.250> take<00:05:20.250> this<00:05:20.930> in<00:05:22.460> flat<00:05:26.570> you

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
and then of course take this in flat you

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:34.610 
and then of course take this in flat you
screw<00:05:27.960> that<00:05:28.169> into<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.830> locks<00:05:30.380> locks<00:05:31.380> yes<00:05:33.620> there

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
screw that into it locks locks yes there

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.950 
screw that into it locks locks yes there
now<00:05:35.160> normally<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.730> would<00:05:35.850> keep<00:05:36.090> moving<00:05:36.720> and

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
now normally it would keep moving and

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.710 
now normally it would keep moving and
keep<00:05:37.020> spinning<00:05:37.650> because<00:05:38.220> this<00:05:38.850> part<00:05:39.210> would<00:05:39.690> be

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
keep spinning because this part would be

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.180 
keep spinning because this part would be
spinning<00:05:40.110> but<00:05:41.040> since<00:05:41.280> it's<00:05:41.460> not<00:05:42.980> seeing<00:05:43.980> no

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
spinning but since it's not seeing no

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.250 
spinning but since it's not seeing no
movement<00:05:44.669> by<00:05:44.820> this<00:05:45.050> so<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:47.930> think<00:05:48.930> I'm<00:05:49.110> just

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
movement by this so I think I'm just

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.750 
movement by this so I think I'm just
going<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.500> stop<00:05:49.710> the<00:05:49.860> video<00:05:49.979> so<00:05:50.400> that<00:05:50.580> way<00:05:50.729> I

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
going to stop the video so that way I

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.719 
going to stop the video so that way I
can<00:05:50.850> just<00:05:51.090> put<00:05:51.270> the<00:05:52.070> pieces<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.190> the<00:05:53.220> back<00:05:53.490> on

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
can just put the pieces to the back on

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.370 
can just put the pieces to the back on
right<00:05:53.970> here<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.690> I'll<00:05:54.780> continue<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:55.229> video

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
right here and I'll continue the video

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.060 
right here and I'll continue the video
so<00:05:55.910> just<00:05:56.910> stick
