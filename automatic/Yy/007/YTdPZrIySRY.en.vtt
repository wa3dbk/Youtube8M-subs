00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
can argue this or that but I personally

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.030 
can argue this or that but I personally
believe<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.390> lubricity<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.410> critical

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
believe that lubricity is critical

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.620 
believe that lubricity is critical
because<00:02:39.220> when<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:40.330> you're<00:02:40.420> washing
