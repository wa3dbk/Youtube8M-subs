00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 your friends welcome once again to your 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 craft and recycling channel in 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.890
 this time I bring you a video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 how to make a mini tutorial 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.300
 toilet the first thing you have to do 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.360
 to achieve this craft is 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.850
 get you an empty dust case or 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 from the base there are very commercial brands 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.279
 famous but I like more the one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.189
 you have the space to put the motita 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.199
 with which we apply the base to the skin 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 for makeup you have makeup 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 finished or base for white skin 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
 and when it's finished we do not throw it to the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 trash because many include a 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.660
 mirror what we do is wash it very 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 well we will use it from the following 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 way in previous videos I've 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.450
 showed how to make a toilet for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 barbie but this time what 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 We will use with the cases of 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.199
 Plastic powder or base 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 makeup as you realize the only thing 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.829
 what you have to do is wash it open 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
 and put a small table for your barbie 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 have your mini dresser now I'm going to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 go on to explain what the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.660
 accessories that have to give you this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.119
 appearance to the small barbie toilet 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.780
 how can you tell here has its 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.450
 fragrance 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.940
 the ions or creams we can 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.330
 do with little pearls that are 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.060
 hollow and then you apply a small 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.320
 eva circle or color foami circle 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.750
 that you want in this case is 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.420
 frosty after you can cut a 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 stick or a bit of paint in black 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 and paste it or do it as I put a 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.810
 little bit of black eva rubber fomi 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.420
