00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.830
 butter was offered in this test, although the bolus and the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 favorite of those who make mutis da between two plastic cylinders 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.829
 You can only get the candy by disassembling the material exactly in 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.439
 the reverse order to which it has been mounted 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.919
 thanks this would test the ingenuity of a bonus and even that of a child of 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 short age 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.110
 after that the trial and error system 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.030
 the puzzle turned out 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.690
 while another to observe and learn from the movements and gear 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.470
 when it was the turn of the observer to copy the movements of the first 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.240
 solving the problem to get your reward 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.620
 then a proof of deduction 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.520
 It is unlikely that a wild kia has seen a puzzle before 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 it still takes a few minutes to claim the prize 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.200
 one step further 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.560
 this device invites the bird to create a simple mental map to discover from 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 what accounts should you throw 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.140
 most animals would use the trial and error system but the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 smart you have beaten this mind to the solution 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.600
 impressed the scientists devise an even more complex problem 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.679
 rivers 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.889
 the book was about 2 200 and research centers have to ascend 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.689
 utility 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.379
 but it's hard to prevent such a sharp-minded chain creatures 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.379
 happened and frustrated in their cages 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.059
 if a puzzle is offered those in captivity confront him with 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 enthusiasm 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.629

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.149
 zacapa 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.579
 in all the examples that we have seen so far the birds in solve the 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.579
 problem to get a reward 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.759
 but what happens if a test was designed that the bird can not solve alone 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 the result now depends on teamwork 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:32.420
 Funes needs another strip of rope to get the food 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.329
 again and again those that you have shown that they can cooperate 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.150
 who are not impressed by our standards if there is a way to 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.150
 cheat that commitment 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:04.209
 sometimes it is not clear who tests the link here and 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
 jordan the device is wolf-proof 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.550
 those who stop fooling around and go to work to get the 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
 peanuts 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.240
 the teros in addition to intelligent are creatures with a social structure 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.720
 complex always willing to use their mental capacity and help each other 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.979
 others
