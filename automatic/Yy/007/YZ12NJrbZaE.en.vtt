00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.070
 times an hour the first and good you have 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.500
 to go trying until it opens 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.810
 when it opens and could access everything 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.870
 but knowing them now I started playing in 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 level 4 place a class but when you 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.870
 you create a class 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.990

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.990
 the gym chat 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.660
 and it does not matter if it's 6.2 or any 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:51.010

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.010

 they give the woman and they put her at 20.00 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.920
 they started the game and they have to wait 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.870
 until you put it on him until he 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.220
 take the down landing on the 7 and do not let it 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.639
 escape because sometimes he does not remember and he 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.769
 load the game 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.099
