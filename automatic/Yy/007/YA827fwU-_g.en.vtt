00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
all like this but at the time I felt

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
all like this but at the time I felt
really<00:00:31.170> good<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.500> them<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.360> looking<00:00:33.360> at

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
really good about them and looking at

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.560 
really good about them and looking at
old<00:00:33.660> work<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.530> does<00:00:34.980> two<00:00:35.309> things<00:00:35.570> first

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
old work like this does two things first

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.650 
old work like this does two things first
it<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> hard<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> die

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it is hard to do because you want to die

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.280 
it is hard to do because you want to die
a<00:00:39.690> little<00:00:39.899> inside<00:00:40.700> but<00:00:41.700> most<00:00:42.030> importantly<00:00:42.629> it

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a little inside but most importantly it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.779 
a little inside but most importantly it
shows<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.100> making<00:00:44.340> progress

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
shows you that you're making progress

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.380 
shows you that you're making progress
and<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> incredibly<00:00:46.950> important<00:00:47.489> because

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and this is incredibly important because

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
and this is incredibly important because
it's<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.899> easy<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> dwell<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.860> your

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it's really easy to dwell on your

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.810 
it's really easy to dwell on your
day-to-day<00:00:50.460> progress<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.649> much

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
day-to-day progress which is not much

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.860 
day-to-day progress which is not much
you<00:00:53.820> feel<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.660> accomplish

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
you feel like you want to accomplish

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
you feel like you want to accomplish
something<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:56.010> you're<00:00:56.100> never<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> get

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
something but you're never going to get

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.479 
something but you're never going to get
there<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.530> every<00:00:58.530> day<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.739> make<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> drawing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
there and every day you make a drawing

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.630 
there and every day you make a drawing
near<00:00:59.789> maybe<00:01:00.210> not<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.719> satisfied<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.640> well

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
near maybe not very satisfied with well

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.840 
near maybe not very satisfied with well
think<00:01:02.910> bigger<00:01:03.409> look<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.619> two<00:01:04.949> years<00:01:05.369> five

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
think bigger look back two years five

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
think bigger look back two years five
years<00:01:06.320> how<00:01:07.320> were<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.619> drawings<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
years how were your drawings and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.359 
years how were your drawings and
paintings<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.900> probably<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.320> worse<00:01:10.619> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
paintings then probably a lot worse you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.830 
paintings then probably a lot worse you
might<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.820> even<00:01:11.909> been<00:01:12.299> drawing<00:01:12.630> or

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
might not have even been drawing or

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.230 
might not have even been drawing or
painting<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.290> year<00:01:13.530> ago<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.490> remember<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
painting a year ago so remember that it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.660 
painting a year ago so remember that it
is<00:01:15.270> supposed<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> struggle<00:01:16.520> what<00:01:17.520> you're

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
is supposed to be a struggle what you're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570 
is supposed to be a struggle what you're
learning<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.750> hard<00:01:19.110> stuff<00:01:19.580> it's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
learning it's hard stuff it's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
learning it's hard stuff it's
fundamentally<00:01:21.450> different<00:01:21.930> from<00:01:21.960> something

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
fundamentally different from something

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.370 
fundamentally different from something
like<00:01:22.500> math<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.700> science<00:01:24.000> where<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.229> learn

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
like math or science where you can learn

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.830 
like math or science where you can learn
the<00:01:25.560> formula<00:01:26.100> follow<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> procedure<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the formula follow the procedure and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.219 
the formula follow the procedure and
always<00:01:28.680> come<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.460> result<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
always come up with the same result so

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.719 
always come up with the same result so
honestly<00:01:31.229> get<00:01:31.710> ready<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.280> lots<00:01:32.310> of

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
honestly get ready for lots of

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
honestly get ready for lots of
short-term<00:01:33.299> frustration<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.860> won't

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
short-term frustration that just won't

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.749 
short-term frustration that just won't
go<00:01:35.189> away<00:01:35.450> but<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.780> making<00:01:37.110> progress<00:01:37.759> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
go away but you are making progress it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
go away but you are making progress it's
hard<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> measure<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> day<00:01:39.990> or<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> week<00:01:40.380> but

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
hard to measure in a day or a week but

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
hard to measure in a day or a week but
when<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> look<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> years<00:01:42.420> you're

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
when you look at the years you're

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920 
when you look at the years you're
getting<00:01:43.350> better<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.390> giving<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.780> a

getting better so I'm not giving you a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
getting better so I'm not giving you a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
get out of jail free card but if you get

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.460 
get out of jail free card but if you get
too<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.270> yourself<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.259> feel

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
too down on yourself because you feel

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.899 
too down on yourself because you feel
like<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:49.829> accomplishing<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
like you're not accomplishing what you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
like you're not accomplishing what you
want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.570> away<00:01:51.810> you'll<00:01:52.590> never<00:01:52.770> make<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
want to right away you'll never make it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.940 
want to right away you'll never make it
those<00:01:53.460> years<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.180> really<00:01:54.390> takes<00:01:54.950> so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
those years that it really takes so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.340 
those years that it really takes so
stick<00:01:56.159> with<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:57.119> remember<00:01:57.600> you're<00:01:58.049> making

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
stick with it but remember you're making

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.500 
stick with it but remember you're making
progress
