00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
building a very very large structure I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.229 
building a very very large structure I
just<00:00:55.890> want<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> make<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.370> video<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.030> said

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just want to make this video like I said

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
just want to make this video like I said
because<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.690> deleted<00:00:58.350> before<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.820> lot

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
because it was deleted before and a lot

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.639 
because it was deleted before and a lot
of<00:01:00.090> people<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.420> been<00:01:00.510> asking<00:01:01.050> me<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
of people have been asking me about this

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
of people have been asking me about this
structure<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.789> pretty<00:01:03.090> amazing<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
structure it is pretty amazing it is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320 
structure it is pretty amazing it is
really<00:01:04.320> unique<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.040> thin<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.729> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really unique it's very thin on this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.530 
really unique it's very thin on this
part<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.470> sides<00:01:07.799> are<00:01:08.280> equal<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> sine<00:01:09.330> is

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
part and the sides are equal the sine is

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.080 
part and the sides are equal the sine is
equal<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.140> side<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.670> area

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
equal to this side and this this area

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
equal to this side and this this area
almost<00:01:12.360> looks<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> front<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.400> ship

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
almost looks like the front of a ship

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.499 
almost looks like the front of a ship
and<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.390> looks<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> ship

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
and this looks like the back of the ship

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.649 
and this looks like the back of the ship
quite<00:01:18.509> unusual<00:01:18.770> let's<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.210> google<00:01:21.210> ruler

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
quite unusual let's see if google ruler

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.330 
quite unusual let's see if google ruler
gives<00:01:21.990> us<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.970> approximation<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.650> how<00:01:25.650> long

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
gives us a approximation of how long

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.670 
gives us a approximation of how long
this<00:01:26.700> object<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.630> would<00:01:27.990> guess<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.409> ends

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
this object is I would guess it ends

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.120 
this object is I would guess it ends
right<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:28.890> here<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> shadows

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
right about here because of the shadows

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
right about here because of the shadows
okay<00:01:32.600> 1,900<00:01:33.600> meters<00:01:33.810> or<00:01:34.320> kilometers<00:01:35.930> 1.9

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
okay 1,900 meters or kilometers 1.9

kilometers or miles one point two three
miles<00:01:41.909> across<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> structure<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.060> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
miles across that is a structure that is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.830 
miles across that is a structure that is
one<00:01:45.990> massive<00:01:46.560> structure<00:01:47.399> okay<00:01:48.000> let's<00:01:48.210> do

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
one massive structure okay let's do

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.399 
one massive structure okay let's do
across<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.430> width<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:51.680> okay<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.040> about

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
across the width here okay so it's about

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.429 
across the width here okay so it's about
