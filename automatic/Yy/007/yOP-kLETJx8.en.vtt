00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.960
 of chile and I'm sure this Sunday 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.000
 no Indian can make a goal 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.219
 hi i am adhirieron castle the group of 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.710
 I have a little heart and this 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.880
 Sunday in the classic the pooch we're going 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.880
 to fly the entire pen 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.760
 so they are going to celebrate on Sunday 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.340
 spare that has a match of fish 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.800
 in a guarantor there is not and was born when I 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.120
 I was playing despite this, so this Sunday 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.489
 there is bird or the agile ball 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.650
 let's bet this position the South American 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.920
 that they do not have no better bet the 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.300
 liberators who will never have what 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.949
 better bet something for the fans 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.750
 who watch this video with but who 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.520
 loses gave him a cyber shot camera 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.790
 to live the result of the game the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.790
 money 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.910
 no no 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.530
 that you go in part with the same player 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.159
 a lot that is sony technology already 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.369
 I know we can see the matches as 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.649
 luzcan motionflow xr is the innovative 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.929
 sony technology that will make you enjoy 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.380
 of fast images like a blink 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.630
 in the clearest way possible this 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.990
 because motionflow doubles the number 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.909
 of images of a conventional television 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.219
 a common television shows an average 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.319
 of 60 images per second a speed 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.079
 quite slow for the human eye 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:00.319
 motionflow technology instead 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.209
 shows a range that goes from 100 to 960 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.509
 images per second according to the model 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:08.860
 fill of woody with sony bravia and his 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.860
 motionflow technology 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.700
 6 that we better pass the game and leave 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:18.400
 that people make their forecast of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.489
 match on Sunday if you think he wins 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.230

 video on your facebook if you want to win 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.290
 a camera cyber shot the song and leave your 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.000
 forecast in the comments between 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.739
