00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 it is so that we have players 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.929
 every day totally exhausting the game 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.299
 can win and and do everything 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:18.539
 and create something in our 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.830
 Graf stands and now play again 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 1 then where with good kick and the opponent 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.599
 not so not always more and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 but not always but very often 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:39.920
 earned their crown you then times 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:45.079
 you know the right thing out and about 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 I'm very clear but of course only until 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.300
 let's say this morning must be absolute 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.420
 But concentration is also something 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 already trainingsplatz not so 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 are then things like for example 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.199
 was then totally happy because noticed 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.770
 okay is come things to admira has the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.450
 So you can score it through games or 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.490
 daniel still jumps in really big 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.360
 your chances defends well and the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.270
 forest splashes home could not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.400
 a tenth of a second quarrels with the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 fate 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 Schreiber donated he has sprintduell 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.600
 drone has he turned swiss 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 Thinking stuttgart cold and there was am 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.299
 sixteen-corner free kick for us so if 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.100
 that does not do the post is in the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.229
 other direction 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.689
 if that was so, that was four o'clock 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.890
 weeks 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.560
 why and always and now it was and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.939
 Now we have to do exactly these things 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.710
 these mental things and those total ones 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.000
 nothing but nothing 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.530
 will be impressed by the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.049
 compensation of the board not if you 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.930
 Goal gets that one there 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.399
 Again, that we that so much 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.790
 are warriors as possible to the place 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.000
 not in the sense of 5 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 but in this sense, do not think of violence 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 but warrior in attitude to that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.810
 how they approach things and how they do things 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:33.030
 they fail short-term and successes 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:38.520
 also how they handle it so that is 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.960
 be an elementary point for this the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 is always elementary point but for 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.020
