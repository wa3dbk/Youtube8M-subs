more than anything he probably wants a

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.229 
more than anything he probably wants a
run<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> games<00:02:31.440> again<00:02:32.310> drops<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> bench

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
season Jamie how much of it is abundant

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.490 
season Jamie how much of it is abundant
will<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.239> for<00:02:39.720> him<00:02:39.900> do<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.050> think<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
will that be for him do you think of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.270 
will that be for him do you think of
course<00:02:40.739> he<00:02:40.830> would<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.010> liked<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.250> have

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
course he would have liked to have

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.280 
course he would have liked to have
started<00:02:41.760> but<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.959> have<00:02:43.050> fought<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
started but I would have fought the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.600 
started but I would have fought the
temptation<00:02:43.500> would<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.010> been<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.250> start<00:02:44.489> him

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
temptation would have been to start him

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.920 
temptation would have been to start him
from<00:02:44.790> cleared<00:02:45.030> out<00:02:45.120> malicious<00:02:45.450> point<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.780> view

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
from cleared out malicious point of view

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.009 
from cleared out malicious point of view
the<00:02:46.470> Goering<00:02:46.920> gold<00:02:47.190> set<00:02:47.519> pieces<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:48.239> think<00:02:48.900> in

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
the Goering gold set pieces I think in

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.540 
the Goering gold set pieces I think in
the<00:02:49.080> FA<00:02:49.290> Cup<00:02:49.500> game<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> few<00:02:49.920> weeks<00:02:50.099> ago<00:02:50.250> there

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
the FA Cup game a few weeks ago there

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.699 
the FA Cup game a few weeks ago there
was<00:02:50.989> definitely<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.050> think<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> tactic

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
was definitely I think of the tactic

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.050 
was definitely I think of the tactic
when<00:02:52.800> Liverpool<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.250> put<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> keeper<00:02:53.880> under

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
when Liverpool to put the keeper under

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.699 
when Liverpool to put the keeper under
pressure<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.780> I've<00:02:55.019> no<00:02:55.170> doubt<00:02:55.349> with<00:02:55.500> 20

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
pressure and I've no doubt with 20

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.350 
pressure and I've no doubt with 20
minutes<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.980> grab<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.340> game<00:02:56.489> was<00:02:56.670> going<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
minutes to grab the game was going the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.520 
minutes to grab the game was going the
right<00:02:57.480> way<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.720> will<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.170> him<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:58.440> you'll

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
right way you will see him and you'll

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.259 
right way you will see him and you'll
see<00:02:58.739> Liverpool<00:02:58.950> become<00:02:59.370> direct<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.000> put<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
see Liverpool become direct and put the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.570

you<00:03:44.620> think<00:03:44.800> amongst<00:03:45.160> United's<00:03:46.030> back<00:03:46.300> for<00:03:46.540> and

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
you think amongst United's back for and

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.450 
you think amongst United's back for and
also<00:03:46.780> the<00:03:46.990> goalkeeper<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.590> Jamie<00:03:47.830> mention<00:03:48.250> I

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
also the goalkeeper is Jamie mention I

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.010 
also the goalkeeper is Jamie mention I
think<00:03:49.270> they'll<00:03:49.360> be<00:03:49.450> more<00:03:49.570> relief<00:03:49.900> the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
think they'll be more relief the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.360 
think they'll be more relief the
Bellamy's<00:03:50.410> not<00:03:50.560> playing<00:03:50.830> but<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.980> think<00:03:51.070> to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
Bellamy's not playing but I think to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.010 
Bellamy's not playing but I think to
burnish<00:03:51.640> India<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> huge<00:03:52.840> physical

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
burnish India is a huge physical

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.750 
burnish India is a huge physical
presence<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.710> think<00:03:53.890> he<00:03:53.980> has<00:03:54.070> got<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> little<00:03:54.520> bit

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
presence I think he has got a little bit

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.070 
presence I think he has got a little bit

back in his game this last couple of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.770 
back in his game this last couple of
weeks<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.500> mean<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.070> front<00:03:57.310> three<00:03:57.550> of<00:03:57.700> say<00:03:57.940> Suarez

weeks I mean a front three of say Suarez
Bellamy<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.290> Carol<00:03:59.740> we've<00:03:59.890> been<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> real

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
Bellamy and Carol we've been a real

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.100 
Bellamy and Carol we've been a real
handful<00:04:00.730> today<00:04:00.910> officers<00:04:01.360> Carol<00:04:02.020> this

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110

running through both got different
qualities<00:04:05.920> i<00:04:06.130> think<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.670> United<00:04:07.210> sends<00:04:07.450> about

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690
