00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello we make sauce binder today 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 itself and in such a nice even from 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.650
 So not in this function packaging 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.410
 but really so and with ingredients 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.210
 with flour and with butter and yes because I 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.779
 that interests then stays simple 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 tuned 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:30.480
 yes, the only ingredients we use 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:37.020
 need 50 g are butter and 50 grams 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:39.890
 The whole thing must now me first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.890
 be stirred a bit 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.869
 so this was common practice is still to me 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.869
 with your hands through 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.750
 we are critical of the country because 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.000
 I am not one of those weird keys 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.740
 just knead that together altogether 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.450
 better now just a little bit too 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.650
 say so no longer knead it that way 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.650
 is crumbly 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 so if you all look like that you can 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.830
 there is an instant aside 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:18.120
 put a bowl or so and he from 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:20.280
 clean up the team that the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.340
 only work that I both bake and 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.860
 Totally hate cooking and that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.190
 clean up 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.190
 but okay 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:40.549
 either from the too small ball climate 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.799
 with or I actually chocolates 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.379
 Bakeware but I will do that now 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.049
 to use for that simply 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.269
 always a little bit and pushes 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.560
 this in here with that form 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:59.629
 this now gets one too 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.310
 a bit nicer looks always so 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.019
 we can do it here 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.370
 push in if you do not have that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.239
 then you can just small balls 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.239
 drive 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.570
 so 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.580
 a bit much 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.530
 I think this concept just like that 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.750
 simple and I think this recipe 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.230
 just so simple and you know 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.540
 at least what is there then for ingredients 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.300
 Inside are the loose men 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.640
 somehow it buys so much in it and so on 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.850
 a lot of crap too and I just made two 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.680
 days are not harmful either or 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.550
 other yes I think it's a good one 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.380
 alternative for it and the ingredient becomes one 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.370
 mostly at home and you can summer 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.370
 just do it yourself 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.400
 and that's how the whole dog is done 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:39.880
 is and now comes in the fellow 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.900
 so and if the whole now first 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.060
 Festive has looked the lasts 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.250
 about to be like it once an hour 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.020
 then you can get that out again 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:55.570
 then you can do it 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.570
 close her mother and sing too 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.040
 Blum quite like this 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:26.210
 then you just take one 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:27.890
 freeze bag all again if 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.540
 you all done a four-seater again 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.430
 could that should now be freezing 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.890
 little does one need could 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.300
 simply remove one by one without the 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.890
 firmly open to each other 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.960
 if you have any sauces now 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.880
 wanted to cover up with her 2 to 3 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.350
 and if you want to refine soups 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.030
 or other things you just take her 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.580
 1 of them you do not have that before 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.260
 just stop just like that 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.020
 give job free and stir 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.960
 It's been used on I think 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.390
 the idea totally 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.890
 yes, I will only use it now 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.400
 I hope that maybe I will 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.960
 somehow help could do that too 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.340
 it's usually easy to get that way 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.860
 not the simplest one 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.720
 think okay in the simplest things 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.790
 you just do not come and I hope 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.870
 that I could help you with that 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.700
 I wish you a beautiful 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.530
 day and write me if you have it 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.500
 Imitation has sent me pictures 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.500
 instagram or facebook until first mio
