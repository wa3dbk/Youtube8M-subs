00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
you think the effect of that is going to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.500 
you think the effect of that is going to
be<00:03:18.380> well<00:03:18.710> as<00:03:18.800> I<00:03:18.860> imagine<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.820> sort<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.150> a<00:03:20.270> joke

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
be well as I imagine it's sort of a joke

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.810 
be well as I imagine it's sort of a joke
the<00:03:21.440> Dow<00:03:21.920> goes<00:03:22.190> straight<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.490> with

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
the Dow goes straight up with

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.430 
the Dow goes straight up with
quantitative<00:03:23.330> easing<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.900> goals<00:03:24.170> been

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
quantitative easing and goals been

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.590 
quantitative easing and goals been
slaughtered<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:24.980> hasn't<00:03:25.280> meant<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.610> thing<00:03:25.640> so

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
slaughtered it hasn't meant one thing so

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.470 
slaughtered it hasn't meant one thing so
I<00:03:27.130> don't<00:03:28.130> think<00:03:28.520> it<00:03:28.670> has<00:03:28.820> anything<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.270> do<00:03:29.450> with

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
I don't think it has anything to do with

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000 
I don't think it has anything to do with
it<00:03:29.720> with<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:29.990> gold<00:03:30.170> market<00:03:30.500> right<00:03:30.680> now<00:03:30.710> it's

price down here the central banks have

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.520 
price down here the central banks have
put<00:03:49.940> their<00:03:50.060> own<00:03:50.090> gold<00:03:50.540> in<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.840> market<00:03:51.170> at<00:03:51.290> some

put their own gold in the market at some

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.470 
put their own gold in the market at some
point<00:03:51.770> they're<00:03:51.920> gonna<00:03:52.040> hit<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.400> wall<00:03:52.480> there

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
point they're gonna hit the wall there

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.060 
point they're gonna hit the wall there
won't<00:03:53.780> be<00:03:53.870> enough<00:03:54.170> gold<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.530> meet<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> demand

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
won't be enough gold to meet the demand

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.770 
won't be enough gold to meet the demand
and<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.340> gold<00:03:55.580> price<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:55.850> going<00:03:56.210> to<00:03:56.300> explode

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and the gold price is going to explode

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.780 
and the gold price is going to explode
and<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.380> think<00:03:57.590> it's<00:03:57.710> coming<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.100> year<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:58.730> you

going<00:04:40.899> then<00:04:41.110> in<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.589> next<00:04:41.710> six<00:04:42.219> to<00:04:42.309> 12<00:04:42.610> months

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
going then in the next six to 12 months

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:46.739 
going then in the next six to 12 months
all-time<00:04:45.069> highs<00:04:45.279> I<00:04:45.639> think<00:04:46.119> silver<00:04:46.419> will<00:04:46.569> take

think once people realize what's
happened<00:05:12.639> it's<00:05:13.149> going<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.479> go<00:05:13.599> into<00:05:13.839> gold<00:05:14.050> and

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
happened it's going to go into gold and

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.350
