00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
tuning dial and looking from the front

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.889 
tuning dial and looking from the front
this<00:01:19.130> would<00:01:20.119> be<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.479> right<00:01:20.659> side<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.570> upper

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
this would be the right side the upper

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.639 
this would be the right side the upper
control<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.550> tuning<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:27.440> lower

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
control is the tuning and the lower

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.650 
control is the tuning and the lower
control<00:01:28.190> is<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.990> on/off<00:01:30.320> switch<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.660> volume

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
control is the on/off switch and volume

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:40.180 
control is the on/off switch and volume
control<00:01:36.729> this<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:37.970> what's<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.770> bottom<00:01:39.770> of

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
control this is what's on the bottom of

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.320 
control this is what's on the bottom of
the<00:01:40.310> radio<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:42.220> it's<00:01:43.220> a<00:01:43.460> little<00:01:43.819> bit<00:01:43.970> hard<00:01:44.240> to

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
the radio and it's a little bit hard to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.700 
the radio and it's a little bit hard to
read<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.990> I<00:01:45.020> put<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.710> Photoshop<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.710> this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
read so I put it in Photoshop and this

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.529 
read so I put it in Photoshop and this
is<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:49.390> little<00:01:50.390> bit<00:01:50.539> easier<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:52.100> read<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:53.360> can

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
is a little bit easier to read you can

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.219 
is a little bit easier to read you can
