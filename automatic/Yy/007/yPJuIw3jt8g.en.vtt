00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.059
 the ant man is the that's the youngest 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.949
 marvel movie is not the movie studio 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.730
 of the most fucking movies come the avengers 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:23.340
 ooo robocop back to the future and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 This is a super-map, right? 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 based on the comics of man 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.019
 spider 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.000
 but there is an insect swapping the film tells the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.910
 story of the water man but talking to 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.600
 ant and then he tells the story of a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.460
 thief who steals a clothes to do everything 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 around it looks pretty giant 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 I had trouble understanding with good 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.780
 part of the plot because the hero is very 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.730
 small to watch 0 of 10 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.309
 I think if jesus liked 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.800
 ants is perhaps from families not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.920
 they had to divide house with so many people 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.629
 In fact, I think I'm going to delay the rent. 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.219
 so I 'm going to give 10 10 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.400
 this film is mandatory to submit the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 sky ant man is the newest nonsense 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.430
 from marvel 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 the network of cinemas responsible for all 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.900
 the superheroes that his parents liked 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 to watch on TV the movie tells the story of 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.640
 paul says the actor who appeared with a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.580
 character in the friends series and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 spoiler ended up marrying the firm 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.430
 After a while he ended up at the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.330
 oblivion and of course became a 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.009
 comedian 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.680
 he knows the great American actor 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.590
 michael douglas who has many awards 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 in the cinema and in the TV that gives big stick a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 very special clothing that goes 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 figuratively turn his life away from 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 upside down 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.170
 It's a man, it 's an ant, I do not know. 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.909
 tell 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.770
 and frankly I believe that marvel 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.720
 completely lost the notion and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.820
 you'll probably end up earning more 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.399
 a million dollars with this animation 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.170
 note 9 the ant man is one more 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.000
 attempt to value the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.530
 disabled with demolisher 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
 she showed that certain can lead a 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.790
 normal life provided they have all the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 other senses or created and radar is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.899
 with the former half-mast that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 wheelers can fight against evil 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.399
 provided they have telepathy with man 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 brown ant now shows that it is nÃ³is 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.680
 can push themselves pretty bandits 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.780
 communicate with the breaking ants 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.490
 The movie shows that thieves are also 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.800
 trustworthy human beings can not 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.660
 driving man oil attacks 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.430
 ant is one of the few legendary heroes 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.920
 who does not have a big enemy because 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.080
 I would not have the courage to create the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.700
 anteater did well 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.370
 I'm sure the movie will be a 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.750
 success and win there are also reactions 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.730
 being here will be much more 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.560
 cockroaches to do since they only need 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.300
 a trail alone and pretending to be 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.710
 with your partner acting surgically 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.070
 in their intimate parts 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:46.080
 Do not laugh if it's even the best medicine. 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.090
 healing feelings can be 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.040
 considered the comedy of the year 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.880
 the film may seem like just one more 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.220
 pastel 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.030
 but do not be fooled, zoe saldana looks beautiful 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.550
 as always 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.890
 take the children out of the room 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.709
 this movie is going on in the movies and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.290
 room is passing that kite dvd and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.570
 his brother-in-law bought this brother-in- 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.420
 good did not start with wedge and eduardo 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.980
 wedge is not really 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.900
 Healing feelings is a comedy to 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.790
 whole family and if you do not have 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.730
 family you can go alone to the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.019
 cinema and sitting next to one I go 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.150
 give a note 46 healing feelings is one 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.580
 of films that show how people 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.100
 with mental problems are wonderful 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.620
 type of moon the character that is 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.120
 for my generation just like hamlet is 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.290
 for generation who saw shakespeare if 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.390
 refusing to write for theater 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.459
 to pay the bills 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.560
 healing feelings is brilliant for 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.239
 merge the truth with fantasy to 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.440
 from the truth is that the best way 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.530
 to deal with these lovely 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.750
 misfit and live well away from them 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.209
 the part of the fantasy mother leaving the threads 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.040
 with the guy to leave this fantasy more 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.500
 the murderous mother being 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.440
 interpreted by delay and the settler is 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.860
 the hulk will work note b 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.690
 It's feeling that heals a movie about a 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.830
 man who only does the first thing 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.800
 come to the head 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.580
 and like everyone who is very dumb 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.640
 He has two children and one woman. 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.580
 so I fall into his chat to my 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.130
 pick for next best actor oscar 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.100
 she's in this film the Oscar is a 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.710
 retarded a ramp is not too much 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.990
 good on film right but the dwarves 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.730
 they are giving a show of mine. 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.320
 if I believe they are people who 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.720
 we them 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.360
 it will only come in half but the 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.190
 feelings are an equal sound and luck 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.100
 they are millionaires here 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.350
 Look how much in their house I 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.230
 I always dreamed of having a 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.390
 a cardboard to play with 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.960
 pick up to take a walk in the park 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.710
 This is one size fits all a famous movie. 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.340
 to think a little more and stay 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.280
 thinking then I'll give you 10 out of 10 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.260
 the movie hated the tale of the 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.640
 Princess Cargo is yet another attempt to 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.640
 exalt the breed to be so relevant 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.680
 How much to myazaki that yes a genius 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.230
 who made sensational animations like 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.790
 chihiro trip and the lively castle o 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.290
 world does not have time to attack until 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.750
 because the Western brain only has the 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.190
 ability to make two relationships 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.310
 when talking about Japanese drawing 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.290
 miyagi or in team that the needle knows 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.600
 and that this film tries to vote pictures 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:30.360
 which subliminally relate to sex 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.830
 like bamboo spider and the frog 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.600
 if you thought I would refer to 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.090
 as part of the technique 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.060
 Do you have any problems, my friend, this movie? 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.520
 will not topple note is the tale of 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.760
 Princess with needle is a movie of 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.460
 more Japanese style design right and that was 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.669
 made in japan even good choice 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.470
 Well, it's already two years ago, whatever 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.450
 To say that you're still too young is for 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.790
 commit any crime in Brazil then it is 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:58.740
 better to have come back and have opening and 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.520
 He's only eight years from now. 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.039
 the movie is not yet ripe 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.610
 Because you can see that the princess is well 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:10.940
 dumb in the movie its dumb but a lot 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.430
 handsome face and this is a crime so I will 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.680
 give zero of 10 will only see the least 2 thousand 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.259
 including two things that culture 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.330
 Japanese woman knows well the disregard 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.210
 with women's rights and animes 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.870
 The tale of the Cape Princess is about 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.120
 foods 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.340
 I only saw half the trailer because I 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.740
 had gone to buy popcorn in our self 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.289
 I got scared with the price of popcorn. 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.180
 an absurd even at least it's a popcorn 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.949
 very different from the one we 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.750
 does at home in the microwave when it goes 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.669
 watch gray's anatomy for this 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.330
 butter that only has a movie theater 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.970
 there is a way 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.740
 ball within marvel note 10 more than 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.880
 anyway I do not know very well we 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.530
 we heard the trailer 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.530
 even because this is the name of the program
