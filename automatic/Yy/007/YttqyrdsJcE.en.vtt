00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
about a saddle that that josh has

about a saddle that that josh has
designed<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> it's<00:00:16.890> called<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> contact

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
designed and it's called the contact

designed and it's called the contact
bike<00:00:18.480> seat<00:00:20.600> it's<00:00:21.600> kind<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.170> funky<00:00:22.830> looking

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160

seat<00:00:23.430> Josh<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.880> want<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.300> briefly

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
seat Josh you want to just briefly

seat Josh you want to just briefly
explain<00:00:24.960> what<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.189> about<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
explain what it's all about and how that

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.970 
explain what it's all about and how that
how<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:27.990> did<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.289> come<00:00:28.500> up<00:00:28.529> with<00:00:28.830> this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
how that how did you come up with this

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.580 
how that how did you come up with this
seat<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.179> just<00:00:30.390> looks<00:00:30.689> well<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.289> biggest

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
seat is it just looks well the biggest

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.590 
seat is it just looks well the biggest
difference<00:00:32.009> you'll<00:00:32.189> notice<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.390> has

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
difference you'll notice is that it has

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.860 
difference you'll notice is that it has
this<00:00:33.899> more<00:00:34.550> abrupt<00:00:35.550> transition<00:00:36.180> between<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
this more abrupt transition between the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
this more abrupt transition between the
rear<00:00:37.050> support<00:00:37.590> surface<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.640> nose<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
rear support surface and the nose of the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.420 
rear support surface and the nose of the
saddle<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.770> looks<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
saddle and it's not just looks the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.030 
saddle and it's not just looks the
reasons<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.899> created<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.620> way<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
reasons that I created it this way is

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.420 
reasons that I created it this way is
because<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.180> big<00:00:45.360> research<00:00:46.190> study<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
because of a big research study that I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.220 
because of a big research study that I
did<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.879> looked<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.329> male<00:00:48.539> organ<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> might

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
did that looked at male organ I might

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.420 
did that looked at male organ I might
buy<00:00:49.410> skull<00:00:49.680> saddle<00:00:50.070> design<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:53.010> impact

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
buy skull saddle design and the impact

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.720 
buy skull saddle design and the impact
of<00:00:53.789> different<00:00:53.969> seat<00:00:54.300> designs<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
of different seat designs on the

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.189 
of different seat designs on the
arteries<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.090> nerves<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> pelvis

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
arteries and the nerves in the pelvis

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.369 
arteries and the nerves in the pelvis
and<00:00:58.469> what<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.100> found<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and what we found was that if you have a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
and what we found was that if you have a
wider<00:01:02.280> flatter<00:01:03.000> rear<00:01:03.600> support<00:01:03.899> surface<00:01:04.640> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
wider flatter rear support surface that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.539 
wider flatter rear support surface that
it<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.000> support<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.750> pelvis<00:01:06.990> better<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.770> you

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
it can support the pelvis better and you

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.429 
it can support the pelvis better and you
won't<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> pressure<00:01:09.390> on<00:01:09.689> arteries<00:01:10.260> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
won't get the pressure on arteries and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.820 
won't get the pressure on arteries and
nerves<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.119> case<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.960> transition

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
nerves and in this case this transition

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.179 
nerves and in this case this transition
here<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.540> doesn't<00:01:15.920> push<00:01:16.920> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
here is there so that it doesn't push in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
here is there so that it doesn't push in
between<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.090> bones<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.750> pelvis<00:01:19.229> when

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
between the bones and your pelvis when

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.830 
between the bones and your pelvis when
you<00:01:19.650> lean<00:01:19.860> forward<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> seat<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.570> have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you lean forward on the seat so we have

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.260 
you lean forward on the seat so we have
a<00:01:21.869> flat<00:01:22.470> support<00:01:23.009> surface<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.729> rider<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
a flat support surface the rider can

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.630 
a flat support surface the rider can
stay<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> rear<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> seat<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:26.369> legs

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
stay over the rear of the seat the legs

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.609 
stay over the rear of the seat the legs
can<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.540> down<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> less

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
can go up and down here with less

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
can go up and down here with less
friction<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.360> more<00:01:30.479> power<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
friction so they can get more power to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
friction so they can get more power to
the<00:01:31.049> pedals<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.920> stay<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> nose

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
the pedals and they stay off of the nose

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
the pedals and they stay off of the nose
section<00:01:33.360> altogether<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.560> stay<00:01:34.770> back

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
section altogether they just stay back

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.240 
section altogether they just stay back
there

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
there

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.039 
there
so<00:01:36.079> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.500> look<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> traditional<00:01:38.369> seat<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so if you look at a traditional seat you

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.499 
so if you look at a traditional seat you
wouldn't<00:01:40.380> see<00:01:40.710> as<00:01:40.950> sharp<00:01:41.520> usually<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.329> most

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
wouldn't see as sharp usually on most

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
wouldn't see as sharp usually on most
seats<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> sharp<00:01:43.619> curve<00:01:43.890> here

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
seats you don't see a sharp curve here

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
seats you don't see a sharp curve here
well<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.640> Josh<00:01:44.850> was<00:01:44.880> saying<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
well what Josh was saying this is a

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.740 
well what Josh was saying this is a
little<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.610> straight<00:01:47.939> line<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.540> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
little more of a straight line here and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.230 
little more of a straight line here and
your<00:01:48.960> thigh<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.439> touching<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
your thigh is touching and right in that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.940 
your thigh is touching and right in that
area<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.869> where<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.380> have<00:01:52.560> some<00:01:52.770> very

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
area is where you have some very

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.959 
area is where you have some very
sensitive<00:01:54.229> nerves<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> arteries<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.820> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
sensitive nerves and arteries so this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.420 
sensitive nerves and arteries so this
sweet<00:01:57.360> spot<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> say<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.829> saddle<00:01:59.310> is

sweet spot so to say on this saddle is

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
sweet spot so to say on this saddle is
when<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> rider<00:02:00.479> has<00:02:00.780> their<00:02:01.079> sit<00:02:01.290> bones

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
when the rider has their sit bones

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
when the rider has their sit bones
positioned<00:02:02.280> over<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> rear<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> seat<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
positioned over the rear of the seat and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.440 
positioned over the rear of the seat and
they<00:02:04.170> won't<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.500> touching<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> nose<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.549> the

they won't be touching the nose and the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.510 
they won't be touching the nose and the
back<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.810> their<00:02:06.930> thighs<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:08.039> against

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
back of their thighs will be up against

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
back of their thighs will be up against
this<00:02:08.849> portion<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.840> because<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> way<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this portion but because of the way that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
this portion but because of the way that
we've<00:02:10.800> designed<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.430> there

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we've designed it there

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.260 
we've designed it there
isn't<00:02:12.180> any<00:02:12.360> real<00:02:13.490> pressure<00:02:14.490> anything<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.210> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
isn't any real pressure anything on the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.910 
isn't any real pressure anything on the
back<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.690> thighs<00:02:15.900> since<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.470> rounds<00:02:16.800> off

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
back of the thighs since it rounds off

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
back of the thighs since it rounds off
there<00:02:17.160> smoothly<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.000> they<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.330> keep<00:02:19.320> up<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
there smoothly so they can keep up that

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
there smoothly so they can keep up that
smooth<00:02:19.950> motion<00:02:20.370> with<00:02:20.460> their<00:02:20.610> legs<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.060> get

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
smooth motion with their legs and get

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.990 
smooth motion with their legs and get
good<00:02:21.300> support<00:02:21.720> through<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.990> pelvis<00:02:22.350> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
good support through the pelvis and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.400 
good support through the pelvis and
quickly<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> guess<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.780> has<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> leather

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
quickly I guess there has a leather

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.060 
quickly I guess there has a leather
cover<00:02:26.010> has<00:02:26.850> some<00:02:27.420> moderate<00:02:27.900> padding<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.860> not

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
cover has some moderate padding it's not

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.010 
cover has some moderate padding it's not
very<00:02:29.370> thick<00:02:29.670> padding<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:30.510> firm

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
