00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.309
 leave with a new news video 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.320
 this time I will try to talk a little 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.529
 of small summary of what it was 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 nintendo direct from yesterday of the 25th as 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.410
 21 japan and another today in america and some 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 the new agreement will bring few want 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.039
 try to summarize what was the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.130
 nintendo of irak but is that they were not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 great thing they were dedicated just behind 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.329
 that they said let's dedicate not only 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.100
 back from that world editor I want egg 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.719
 if it is dedicated three times in hospital 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.790
 whose why will not come if they have 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.730
 said I already know it's nonsense and people 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 the in the chat next to the streaming 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.870
 saying I want to get bored behind 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 that focus on a bakery not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.809
 They hope you do not expect them to sell you 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.969
 meat for example if they tell you in our 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 edition behind that who was the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 Japanese lasted one hour from the American 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.230

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.520
 little unimportant because in the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.260
 new things so 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:35.800

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.610
 where blood 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.350
 very cool so more guys little thing 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.000
 later in the Japanese and they were 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.950
 talking about dragon quest 10 for wii 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.740
 If talking it there where there were very 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.090
 a little while in which the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.770
 things that can be with argentas 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.130
 basically be able to play in the gamepad 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.750
 is worth a game in mpg online in the 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:26.090
 gamepad cool a lot 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.090
 and little more a few images and that 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.620
 and this I do not know what they told more guys 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.480
 because the American was 20 minutes 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.500
 whole talking about those and 10 others 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.960

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.680
 last 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.230
 they did not say dates in the Japanese they 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.290
 inflated so Japanese date a lot of 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.950
 juezos leave in December there but 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.650
 an awful lot of great games 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.060
 strippers pay more paper sea â€‹â€‹I think 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.180
 what has gone out 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.739
 animal crossing where games there here 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 we have to wait for the first half 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.110
 of 2013 I may even get ahead 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.440
 in a game if important game that is 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:12.709

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.220

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.530

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.220
 so that is, do not make illusions that 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.010

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.539

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.449

 I'm sorry for not counting the most but it's 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.849
