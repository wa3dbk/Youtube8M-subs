00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.390
 ah 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 we will need two platforms and mine 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 they measure 50 x 50 centimeters also what 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 I decided to paint in white but you even 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.899
 you can give it a more natural finish and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.349
 only sanding the wood and placing a 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:34.320
 varnish protects very well the area where 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.970
 go paint and if you decide to paint what 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.360
 first give it a coat 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.280
 and then let ideas dry another layer to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.370
 that everything is well covered and for 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.620
 Of course do not forget the sides as 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.020
 important is that you paint the 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 platform or the platform that goes on the 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.420
 top part 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.420
 which is the one that is going to see more 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.060
 then I'm going to make you some little eyes 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.240
 in each corner with the drill for 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 place some wheels and so be able to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 move more easily 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.060
 I did this because my wheels have 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.159
 like a stick on the top 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.189
 but 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.890
 there are some wheels that have a small insert 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.979
 and they were bolted so those are 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.679
 but I did not get them when 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.289
 I saw them and I had bought these and for 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.069
 that I had to drill but it's not so 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.069
 required 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.409
 place the wheels one at each corner 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.679
 obviously and then the only thing we have 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.090
 what to do is place a platform 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.090
 up another 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.500
 you can join the platforms by placing 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 some hinges on the sides 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.880
 and screwing them but I decided 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.370
 stick them with this one that is special to 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.530
 wood I have already used it and they have 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.080
 come out pretty good and what I'm going to 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.140
 do is follow the indications of 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.140
 content of the tube 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.870
 and placing enough quantity in each 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.280
 corner now I'm going to place the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.280
 platform on top 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.760
 and I'm going to press it a bit so that 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.930
 look good 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.299
 I also decided to put a glass and 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.709
 I found this quite economical, I think 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.709
 like 50 pesos 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.200
 the question is to search and investigate 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.900
 things can go you much more 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.130
 economic I decided to put some pillows 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.620
 on the ground and ready 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.840
 but you can use it even for 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.480
 your room depends on the size you want 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.209
 and I think it's going very well for that 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.050
 space where sometimes we want 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.050
 relax a little 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.520
 that you liked today's video 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.319
 I hope I have given you some ideas and if 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.990
 they put it into practice do not forget 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.670
 share it on social networks 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.709
 with me all my social networks are the 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.020
 I leave the information box and if 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.209
 So they want more details in the 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.870
 materials as I always leave them in 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.150
 my blog 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.370
 do not forget to leave me your suggestions 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.220
 video in the comments and give me a 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.120
 like if you liked it and that's all we see 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.120
 in the next
