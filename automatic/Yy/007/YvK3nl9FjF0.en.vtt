00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.809
 ticas 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.859
 ok girls here I am again only 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.779
 I'm doing it with my left hand 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.939
 to finish recording the video but 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:20.790
 Here I show you, since it reads - that is, 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.150
 you can see him lime with him with the tri lo 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.530
 with the polishing machine and I left all the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.770
 Acrylic on a level 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.580
 at the level of the natural nail 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:36.180
 and now let's shake a little bit 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.180
 the dust 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.829
 and then shake as I said look 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.680
 there's always dust so there's always 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.690
 to use face masks 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.690
 then we will use him 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.180
 cuticle softener 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.180
 in the area of ​​the cuticle 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.559
 to push our cuticle 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 and after pushing it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.800
 let's file with the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.460
 read more of science grain 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.900
 let's push this tends to hurt a 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.300
 little clients always complain but 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.440
 with the cuticle softener because 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.660
 it hurts less 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.460
 see it a little less if you notice 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.460
 this mild acid 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 What it does is 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.050
 remove the cuticle come around 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.740
 we can see remains of perillo and 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.280
 cuticle 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.280
 we clean and go 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.090
 with the other finger 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 the process to do this challenge that is 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 a little bit longer when we file but 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 having a good drill 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.970
 and a good team, because it's much more 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.710
 easy 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.880
 people almost do not like to wait 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:27.370
 They want to go out with beautiful ones but 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.350
 that one has magic and that in one hour 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.080
 be ready and the truth is that a good 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.640
 work because it requires a bit of 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.630
 patience I am very well delicate 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:44.350
 do the nails and then the process is a 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.730
 little slower before it was slower when 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:52.610
 started and complained a lot 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.110
 apart was the only good criticism one of 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.110
 the criticisms that made me 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.620
 sometimes ill-intentioned but good 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:08.170
 since we remove the doggie and push 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.170
 let our cuticles 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.819
 to file with our 100 grain file 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:20.930
 I showed them that 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:27.159
 100 grain and we will try to lower 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.159
 a little our acrylic 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.810
 as far as I could not get close to him 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.810
 with the thriller until there will come 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.810
 minimal minimum forgiveness 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.450
 trying not to touch our natural nail 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.650
 or is a very abrasive grain 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.849
 well after 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.959
 we filed 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.959
 the dust 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.620
 and with a kitten 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.400
 with gauze 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:05.780
 which is also not included 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.780
 in the materials a gauze 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:14.699
 we clean with our synergy white 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:17.809
 if they do not have without the white forgiveness they can 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:20.809
 use 70 percent alcohol 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:25.249
 mixed with a little water the water 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:25.249
 purified can serve them very much 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.430
 so it's not so strong because that 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:34.520
 brings alcohol and other ingredients but 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.770
 I have seen several girls and compañeras 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.759
 who use alcohol and water 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:45.569
 if not then write me and I will tell you how 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:49.229
 get the synergy white that is nothing 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:54.200
 expensive over here since you can already observe 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:55.960
 we have the nail almost ready 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.639
 for 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.639
 Apply the acrylic 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.449
 there is 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:10.960
 and let's proceed to 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:12.550
 throw the acrylic balls in the area 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.710
 of our cuticle to make the 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.830
 filling the growth of our nail 

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.830
 natural
