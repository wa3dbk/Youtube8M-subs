to let's say we want to splice this
piece<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.280> film<00:00:14.570> with<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.750> piece<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> film

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
piece of film with this piece of film

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.730 
piece of film with this piece of film
and<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.460> came<00:00:17.670> off<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.090> same<00:00:18.359> role<00:00:18.740> it's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and this came off the same role it's

and this came off the same role it's
okay<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> go<00:00:20.880> ahead<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.270> cut<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.810> half

and let's say we want to splice it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
and let's say we want to splice it
together<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.010> it'll<00:00:29.189> be<00:00:29.279> perfect<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:30.660> we

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
together so it'll be perfect what we

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.799 
together so it'll be perfect what we
want<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.439> want<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> slightly

film top and bottom okay I got them

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.420 
film top and bottom okay I got them
anchored<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.449> that's<00:00:51.660> when<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.289> to

take my shot oval blade if there's a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.110 
take my shot oval blade if there's a
defroster<00:00:56.219> line<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.820> trying<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
defroster line here that I'm trying to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.900

they<00:01:17.100> pulled<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> release<00:01:17.580> liner<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they pulled the release liner but the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.390 
they pulled the release liner but the
first<00:01:18.840> type<00:01:19.080> thing<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> discard

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
first type thing you do is you discard

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the top piece and then you carefully

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.490 
the top piece and then you carefully
pull<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:26.090> that's<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.330> piece<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.869> gently

pull back that's other piece and gently

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.870 
pull back that's other piece and gently
work<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> film<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.280> these<00:01:32.280> two<00:01:32.610> pieces

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
work out the film and these two pieces

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
work out the film and these two pieces
will<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:35.150> identical<00:01:36.290> now<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.439> you're<00:01:37.590> good

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will but identical now if you're good

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.280 
will but identical now if you're good
enough<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.400> smooth<00:01:39.030> enough<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:39.990> on

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
enough and smooth enough to get this on

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.139 
enough and smooth enough to get this on
a<00:01:40.909> defroster<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.100> absolutely<00:01:44.399> hide

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
a defroster on you can absolutely hide

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
a defroster on you can absolutely hide
that<00:01:45.420> splice<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.200> don't<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.460> see

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that splice I don't know if you can see

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.130 
that splice I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:48.000> from<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:51.360> almost<00:01:51.600> undetectable

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that from here it's almost undetectable

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.789 
that from here it's almost undetectable
it<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.220> smooth<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.090> that's<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.649> way

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it is so smooth and that's the the way

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
it is so smooth and that's the the way
to<00:01:55.860> splice<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> trick<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.329> on

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to splice and the trick is to get it on

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
to splice and the trick is to get it on
a<00:01:57.479> line<00:01:57.719> whether<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> cut<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
a line whether you like to cut on the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.709 
a line whether you like to cut on the
outside<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.969> transfer<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
outside and then transfer it to the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.410 
outside and then transfer it to the
inside<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.049> me<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:02.280> cut<00:02:02.610> or<00:02:02.820> transfer<00:02:03.240> both

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
inside like me or cut or transfer both

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.120 
inside like me or cut or transfer both
pieces<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.049> inside<00:02:04.380> overlap<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
pieces to the inside overlap the

much<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.940> like<00:02:25.420> that<00:02:25.570> to<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> outside

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
much I like that to do on the outside

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.150 
much I like that to do on the outside
because<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.710> have<00:02:26.860> more<00:02:27.010> control<00:02:28.950> here's<00:02:29.950> that

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
because I have more control here's that

20 inch roll instead of a larger roll

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.810 
20 inch roll instead of a larger roll
like<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.720> 36<00:02:38.260> or<00:02:38.350> 40<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.400> want<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.670> roll

having some problems and I'll explain in
a<00:02:46.960> second<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.920> better<00:02:48.100> roll<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:50.080> better<00:02:50.320> roll

to do the bottom because what's
happening<00:02:57.490> here<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.880> piece<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.300> film<00:02:58.540> is

happening here on a piece of film is

happening here on a piece of film is
this<00:02:59.380> dye<00:02:59.650> is<00:03:00.900> more<00:03:01.900> accurate<00:03:02.530> vertical<00:03:03.520> and

this dye is more accurate vertical and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
not very accurate going across you will

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.260 
not very accurate going across you will
not<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:08.020> if<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.740> try<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.130> how<00:03:09.520> do<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.670> say<00:03:09.940> this

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
not if if you try to how do I say this

if you try to splice these films like I
just<00:03:15.100> showed<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.360> you've<00:03:16.360> got<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.630> do<00:03:16.930> it

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
just showed you you've got to do it

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.560 
just showed you you've got to do it
where<00:03:17.290> you've<00:03:17.710> got<00:03:17.920> spliced<00:03:18.220> this<00:03:18.520> edge<00:03:18.820> with

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
where you've got spliced this edge with

where you've got spliced this edge with
this<00:03:19.750> edge<00:03:20.050> you<00:03:20.590> can't<00:03:20.890> splice<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.520> edge

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
this edge you can't splice this edge

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.850 
this edge you can't splice this edge
with<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.209> edge<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:23.080> example<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:23.680> we<00:03:23.800> were

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
with this edge for example if we were

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.770 
with this edge for example if we were
going<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.040> splice<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.640> and<00:03:25.000> we<00:03:25.540> were<00:03:25.660> going

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
going to splice this and we were going

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.110 
going to splice this and we were going
to<00:03:25.840> have<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.170> color<00:03:26.440> even<00:03:26.980> we<00:03:27.730> would<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:28.000> to

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
to have the color even we would have to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.750 
to have the color even we would have to
use<00:03:28.300> this<00:03:28.480> edge<00:03:28.750> with<00:03:28.989> this<00:03:29.110> edge<00:03:29.790> okay<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:32.760> do

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
use this edge with this edge okay and do

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.729 
use this edge with this edge okay and do
the<00:03:33.880> same<00:03:34.060> process<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.959> would<00:03:35.170> work<00:03:35.320> this

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the same process this would work this

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.680 
the same process this would work this
would<00:03:35.920> match<00:03:36.190> if<00:03:36.550> we<00:03:37.090> tried<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:38.040> splice<00:03:39.040> it

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
would match if we tried to splice it

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.540 
would match if we tried to splice it
using<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.900> doing<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.650> way<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:45.010> this

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
using this doing it this way this this

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.949 
using this doing it this way this this
wouldn't<00:03:45.790> look<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:46.239> would<00:03:46.480> not<00:03:46.630> look<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
wouldn't look this would not look the

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.550 
wouldn't look this would not look the
same<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.910> dye<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.209> going<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.750> be<00:03:49.900> more<00:03:50.110> more

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
same the dye is going to be more more

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.010 
same the dye is going to be more more
concentrated<00:03:51.489> in<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:52.300> middle<00:03:52.630> it's<00:03:52.870> usually

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
concentrated in the middle it's usually

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.600 
concentrated in the middle it's usually
going<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.350> be<00:03:53.500> less<00:03:53.739> concentrated<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.520> the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
going to be less concentrated on the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.210 
going to be less concentrated on the
sides<00:03:54.850> or<00:03:55.480> vice<00:03:55.780> versa<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:56.380> it<00:03:56.500> never<00:03:56.890> matches

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
sides or vice versa but it never matches

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.130 
sides or vice versa but it never matches
all<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.550> way<00:03:57.730> through<00:03:58.000> that's<00:03:58.540> why<00:03:58.780> you<00:03:58.840> have

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
all the way through that's why you have

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.800 
all the way through that's why you have
to<00:03:59.260> supply<00:03:59.440> light<00:04:00.340> edge<00:04:00.670> with<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.239> edge<00:04:01.540> do

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
to supply light edge with like edge do

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.690 
to supply light edge with like edge do
not<00:04:01.989> cross<00:04:02.260> these<00:04:02.530> edges<00:04:02.890> up<00:04:03.040> or<00:04:03.340> they<00:04:03.550> will

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
not cross these edges up or they will

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.699 
not cross these edges up or they will
look<00:04:03.820> like<00:04:04.000> there<00:04:04.900> will<00:04:04.959> be<00:04:05.020> an<00:04:05.140> illusion<00:04:05.680> like

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
look like there will be an illusion like

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.920 
look like there will be an illusion like
there's<00:04:06.010> two<00:04:06.130> different<00:04:06.430> shades<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:07.780> is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
there's two different shades this is

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.750 
there's two different shades this is
also<00:04:08.110> true<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.500> flat<00:04:08.830> glass<00:04:09.040> work<00:04:09.370> as<00:04:09.550> well

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
also true in flat glass work as well

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.580 
also true in flat glass work as well
just<00:04:10.420> for<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.630> fun<00:04:10.810> of<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.019> I'm<00:04:11.170> going<00:04:11.290> to<00:04:11.380> see

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
just for the fun of it I'm going to see

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.180 
just for the fun of it I'm going to see
if<00:04:12.070> this<00:04:12.250> does<00:04:12.519> look<00:04:13.330> funny<00:04:13.920> maybe<00:04:14.920> you<00:04:15.070> can

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
if this does look funny maybe you can

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:32.710 
if this does look funny maybe you can
pick<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.430> up<00:04:15.489> on<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.730> camera

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.570 

it's<00:04:33.080> very<00:04:33.290> hard<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.650> tell<00:04:33.890> but<00:04:34.070> this<00:04:34.250> looks<00:04:34.490> a

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
it's very hard to tell but this looks a

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.950 
it's very hard to tell but this looks a
little<00:04:34.670> darker<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.360> don't<00:04:35.510> know<00:04:35.570> if<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.690> camera

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
little darker I don't know if the camera

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.540 
little darker I don't know if the camera
can<00:04:36.080> pick<00:04:36.230> it<00:04:36.380> up<00:04:36.470> than<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.860> even<00:04:37.490> though

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
can pick it up than this even though

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.670 
can pick it up than this even though
these<00:04:37.700> are<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:37.910> same<00:04:38.120> films<00:04:38.630> because<00:04:39.320> there

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
these are the same films because there

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.210 
these are the same films because there
is<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.010> different<00:04:40.730> level<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.870> dye<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:42.950> edge

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
is a different level of dye on this edge

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.070 
is a different level of dye on this edge
and<00:04:43.250> there<00:04:43.700> was<00:04:43.910> on<00:04:44.120> this<00:04:44.270> edge<00:04:44.510> of<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.870> film

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and there was on this edge of the film

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.630 
and there was on this edge of the film
they<00:04:45.320> don't<00:04:45.530> these<00:04:45.800> edges<00:04:46.190> don't<00:04:46.340> match

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
they don't these edges don't match

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.640 
they don't these edges don't match
you'll<00:04:47.330> usually<00:04:47.510> find<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.320> run<00:04:48.500> into

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
you'll usually find and run into

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.310 
you'll usually find and run into
problems<00:04:49.070> with<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.370> I<00:04:50.020> want<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.080> show<00:04:51.200> you<00:04:51.260> a

right there touching it on my finger let
me<00:05:05.600> show<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:05.840> macro<00:05:06.380> mode<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:08.180> camera<00:05:08.600> see
