similar

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.459 
similar
you<00:00:08.790> got<00:00:08.940> your<00:00:09.120> long-range<00:00:09.660> weapons<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.290> got

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
you got your long-range weapons you got

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.589 
you got your long-range weapons you got
your<00:00:10.679> close<00:00:10.950> encounter<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.759> then<00:00:11.969> pretty

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
your close encounter and then pretty

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.289 
your close encounter and then pretty
much<00:00:12.719> everything<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.559> between<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.790> can<00:00:15.240> be

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
much everything in between and it can be

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.930 
much everything in between and it can be
kind<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> challenging<00:00:15.710> to<00:00:16.710> know<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.730> to

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
kind of challenging to know which one to

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.730 
kind of challenging to know which one to
use<00:00:17.970> over<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.720> other<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.199> if<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.529> playing

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
use over the other so if you are playing

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.620 
use over the other so if you are playing
as<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:19.980> assaults<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> have<00:00:21.000> three<00:00:21.510> or

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
as the assaults and you have three or

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.050 
as the assaults and you have three or
four<00:00:21.660> close<00:00:22.320> encounter<00:00:22.800> guns<00:00:23.010> which<00:00:23.850> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
four close encounter guns which one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.900 
four close encounter guns which one
should<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.330> choose<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.170> why<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.519> kind

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
should you choose and why and so I kind

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.880 
should you choose and why and so I kind
of<00:00:27.000> wanted<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> start<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:28.050> new<00:00:28.230> series<00:00:28.650> where

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of wanted to start up a new series where

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.890 
of wanted to start up a new series where
I<00:00:28.920> compare<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.640> weapons<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.390> today<00:00:30.630> it's

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I compare two weapons and for today it's

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.120 
I compare two weapons and for today it's
going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> long<00:00:31.619> range

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
going to be the long range

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.060 
going to be the long range
sar<00:00:32.369> 21<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.600> scar-h<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.800> kind<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
sar 21 and the scar-h and then kind of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
sar 21 and the scar-h and then kind of
showcase<00:00:35.489> why<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> might<00:00:36.270> want<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> use<00:00:36.690> one

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
showcase why you might want to use one

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
showcase why you might want to use one
over<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> other<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.340> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> perform

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
over the other which is going to perform

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.520 
over the other which is going to perform
better<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.450> certain<00:00:39.780> kind<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> combat

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
better in certain kind of combat

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
better in certain kind of combat
situations<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.579> which<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.270> may<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.809> suit

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
situations or which one may just suit

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.040 
situations or which one may just suit
your<00:00:43.410> playstyle<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:44.910> bit<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> so

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
your playstyle a little bit more and so

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.869 
your playstyle a little bit more and so
to<00:00:46.110> start<00:00:46.379> things<00:00:46.559> off<00:00:46.800> both<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.399> these<00:00:47.640> guns

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
to start things off both of these guns

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
to start things off both of these guns
are<00:00:48.120> very<00:00:48.390> similar<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:49.079> their<00:00:49.469> rounds<00:00:49.920> per

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
are very similar in their rounds per

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.560 
are very similar in their rounds per
minutes<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:51.030> solidify<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
minutes and they really solidify the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.540 
minutes and they really solidify the
fact<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.989> they<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.379> long-range<00:00:53.070> weapons

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
fact that they are long-range weapons

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.540 
fact that they are long-range weapons
the<00:00:53.850> sar-21<00:00:54.210> has<00:00:54.719> an<00:00:54.840> RPM<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> 600<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the sar-21 has an RPM of 600 and the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.619 
the sar-21 has an RPM of 600 and the
scar-h<00:00:56.820> has<00:00:57.030> one<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:58.280> 620<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.969> while<00:01:00.210> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
scar-h has one of 620 and so while the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
scar-h has one of 620 and so while the
scar-h<00:01:00.870> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> eats<00:01:01.590> out<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> end<00:01:02.129> there

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
scar-h kind of eats out in the end there

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.149 
scar-h kind of eats out in the end there
it's<00:01:02.879> not<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> substantial<00:01:04.019> difference<00:01:04.229> but

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it's not a substantial difference but

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's not a substantial difference but
other<00:01:05.400> than<00:01:05.670> their<00:01:06.119> rounds<00:01:06.570> per<00:01:06.780> minutes

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
other than their rounds per minutes

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
other than their rounds per minutes
that's<00:01:07.680> pretty<00:01:07.950> much<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.640> similarities

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
that's pretty much all the similarities

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.760 
that's pretty much all the similarities
that<00:01:09.210> these<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.659> guns<00:01:09.960> hold<00:01:10.290> other<00:01:10.530> than<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
that these two guns hold other than the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
that these two guns hold other than the
fact<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.130> they're<00:01:11.340> great<00:01:11.549> at<00:01:11.700> long<00:01:11.880> range

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
fact that they're great at long range

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
fact that they're great at long range
and<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> really<00:01:13.110> good<00:01:13.290> example<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and so a really good example of this is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.090 
and so a really good example of this is
their<00:01:14.820> damage<00:01:15.150> model<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.869> sar-21<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.860> going

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
their damage model the sar-21 is going

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
their damage model the sar-21 is going
to<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.280> 25<00:01:17.670> damage<00:01:18.090> up<00:01:18.360> close<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.810> that's<00:01:18.960> its

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to do 25 damage up close or that's its

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
to do 25 damage up close or that's its
max<00:01:19.680> damage<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.430> its<00:01:20.549> minimum<00:01:20.880> damage

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
max damage and then its minimum damage

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.899 
max damage and then its minimum damage
is<00:01:21.360> 18<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.080> long<00:01:22.320> range<00:01:22.619> while<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> scar-h<00:01:23.670> has

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
is 18 at long range while the scar-h has

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.090 
is 18 at long range while the scar-h has
the<00:01:24.540> highest<00:01:24.960> damage<00:01:25.140> model<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the highest damage model out of all the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
the highest damage model out of all the
assault<00:01:26.369> rifle<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.790> doing<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.150> staggering<00:01:27.720> 34

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
assault rifle is doing a staggering 34

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830 
assault rifle is doing a staggering 34
damage<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:29.100> close<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.579> its<00:01:29.790> max<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
damage up close or its max and then a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.100 
damage up close or its max and then a
minimum<00:01:31.170> damage<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.799> 25<00:01:32.640> damage<00:01:33.090> around<00:01:33.479> 50

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
minimum damage of 25 damage around 50

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.560 
minimum damage of 25 damage around 50
meters<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.939> minimum<00:01:36.390> damage

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
meters and out and so the minimum damage

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.440 
meters and out and so the minimum damage
of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.170> scar-h<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> max<00:01:38.520> damage<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
of the scar-h is the max damage of the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
of the scar-h is the max damage of the
sar-21<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.040> least<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> damage

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
sar-21 and so at least in the damage

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
sar-21 and so at least in the damage
Department<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> scar-h<00:01:43.009> completely<00:01:44.009> blows

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
Department the scar-h completely blows

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
Department the scar-h completely blows
it<00:01:44.520> out<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.850> water<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> recoil

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it out of the water as for the recoil

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.609 
it out of the water as for the recoil
numbers<00:01:46.890> though<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.399> Tsarist<00:01:47.790> 41<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.619> amazing

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
numbers though the Tsarist 41 is amazing

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.499 
numbers though the Tsarist 41 is amazing
like<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.009> almost<00:01:50.220> laser<00:01:50.640> beam<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:51.119> if<00:01:51.360> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
like it's almost laser beam like if you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.030 
like it's almost laser beam like if you
want<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> weapon<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.590> don't<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:52.890> to

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
want a weapon that you don't have to

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
want a weapon that you don't have to
deal<00:01:53.189> with<00:01:53.310> pretty<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.880> any<00:01:54.149> recoil<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:54.720> all

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
deal with pretty much any recoil at all

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.319 
deal with pretty much any recoil at all
this<00:01:55.530> gun<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> probably<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.090> alley

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
this gun is probably right up your alley

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.249 
this gun is probably right up your alley
it's<00:01:57.840> got<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> horizontal<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:59.600> 0.18<00:02:00.600> almost

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it's got a horizontal of 0.18 almost

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
it's got a horizontal of 0.18 almost
non-existent<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> horizontal<00:02:02.939> or<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
non-existent and then a horizontal or a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
non-existent and then a horizontal or a
left<00:02:03.810> kick<00:02:03.960> 0.2<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.890> right<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.399> point<00:02:05.670> -<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
left kick 0.2 and a right of point - so

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.690 
left kick 0.2 and a right of point - so
it's<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.320> basically<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:08.099> hold<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it's it's basically you hold down the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.139 
it's it's basically you hold down the
button

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
button

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850

maybe<00:02:09.599> deal<00:02:09.869> with<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> recoil

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
maybe deal with a little bit of recoil

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
maybe deal with a little bit of recoil
but<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.489> long<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:11.879> you're<00:02:12.000> aiming<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.330> the

bullets<00:02:13.440> are<00:02:13.560> gonna<00:02:13.650> travel<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.220> that

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
bullets are gonna travel in that

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.670 
bullets are gonna travel in that
direction<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.630> scar-h<00:02:15.900> on<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.320> other<00:02:16.470> hand

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
direction the scar-h on the other hand

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.790 
direction the scar-h on the other hand
has<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.340> highest<00:02:18.150> vertical<00:02:18.750> recoil<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.590> of

the<00:02:20.040> assault<00:02:20.340> rifles<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.150> 0.5<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.740> left

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the assault rifles with a 0.5 and a left

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.940 
the assault rifles with a 0.5 and a left
kick<00:02:23.190> 0.2<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.720> point<00:02:24.990> 2<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.440> so

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
kick 0.2 and a right of point 2 and so

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.500 
kick 0.2 and a right of point 2 and so
while<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.370> doesn't<00:02:26.610> have<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> whole<00:02:26.940> lot<00:02:27.240> of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
while it doesn't have a whole lot of

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.290 
while it doesn't have a whole lot of
horizontal<00:02:28.080> deviation<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:29.340> if<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.090> hold

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
horizontal deviation there if you hold

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300 
horizontal deviation there if you hold
down<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.750> trigger<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.560> gonna<00:02:31.800> kick<00:02:32.100> like<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
down the trigger it's gonna kick like a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.770 
down the trigger it's gonna kick like a
mule<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.940> you're<00:02:33.090> gonna<00:02:33.180> have<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.420> compensate

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
mule and you're gonna have to compensate

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.440 
mule and you're gonna have to compensate
it<00:02:34.020> compensate<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.040> pretty<00:02:35.700> substantially

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
it compensate that pretty substantially

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.780 
it compensate that pretty substantially
on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.050> other<00:02:37.170> hand<00:02:37.440> though<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.010> does<00:02:38.250> have<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
on the other hand though it does have a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760 
on the other hand though it does have a
low<00:02:39.060> initial<00:02:39.540> recoil<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.530> you're<00:02:40.650> able

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
low initial recoil and so if you're able

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.830 
low initial recoil and so if you're able
to<00:02:41.010> just<00:02:41.160> kind<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.310> tap<00:02:41.490> fire<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.090> that's<00:02:42.630> kind

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to just kind of tap fire and that's kind

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.060 
to just kind of tap fire and that's kind
of<00:02:42.900> how<00:02:42.990> you're<00:02:43.170> supposed<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> scar-h

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
of how you're supposed to use the scar-h

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.420 
of how you're supposed to use the scar-h
it<00:02:44.490> becomes<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.030> lot<00:02:45.300> more<00:02:45.600> manageable<00:02:45.980> as<00:02:46.980> for

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
it becomes a lot more manageable as for

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.330 
it becomes a lot more manageable as for
their<00:02:47.790> reload<00:02:48.180> times<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.080> scar-h<00:02:49.440> has<00:02:49.710> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
their reload times the scar-h has a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.760 
their reload times the scar-h has a
surprisingly<00:02:51.270> fast<00:02:51.540> animation<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> still

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
surprisingly fast animation if you still

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.020 
surprisingly fast animation if you still
have<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:52.920> bolt<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> chamber<00:02:53.520> it's<00:02:53.670> gonna<00:02:53.790> take

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
have a bolt the chamber it's gonna take

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.750 
have a bolt the chamber it's gonna take
you<00:02:54.150> only<00:02:54.709> 1.9<00:02:55.709> seconds<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.250> go<00:02:56.400> through<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
you only 1.9 seconds to go through it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.310 
you only 1.9 seconds to go through it
and<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> have<00:02:57.570> gone<00:02:57.690> through<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.110> your

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
and if you have gone through all of your

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.810 
and if you have gone through all of your
rounds<00:02:58.680> which<00:02:58.800> is<00:02:58.920> pretty<00:02:59.100> easy<00:02:59.190> we'll<00:02:59.580> get<00:02:59.700> to

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
rounds which is pretty easy we'll get to

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.520 
rounds which is pretty easy we'll get to
that<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.209> second<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.750> only<00:03:01.080> takes<00:03:01.380> you

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that here in a second it only takes you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.820 
that here in a second it only takes you
two<00:03:02.070> point<00:03:02.490> four<00:03:02.910> seconds<00:03:03.540> as<00:03:04.050> for<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> Tsar

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
two point four seconds as for the Tsar

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.860 
two point four seconds as for the Tsar
it's<00:03:05.220> gonna<00:03:05.430> take<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.880> two<00:03:06.360> point<00:03:06.630> three

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's gonna take you two point three

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.449 
it's gonna take you two point three
seconds<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.440> go<00:03:07.530> through<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.770> short<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> a

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
seconds to go through the short and a

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.820 
seconds to go through the short and a
staggering<00:03:08.910> three<00:03:09.600> point<00:03:09.930> four<00:03:10.290> if<00:03:10.620> you've

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
staggering three point four if you've

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830 
staggering three point four if you've
gone<00:03:11.070> through<00:03:11.130> all<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> your<00:03:12.150> rounds<00:03:12.690> so<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
gone through all of your rounds so a

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.690 
gone through all of your rounds so a
pretty<00:03:13.230> substantial<00:03:13.680> difference<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
pretty substantial difference in that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.160 
pretty substantial difference in that
department<00:03:15.240> as<00:03:15.390> well

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
department as well

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.720 
department as well
the<00:03:16.740> final<00:03:17.130> stat<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.370> we're<00:03:17.550> gonna<00:03:17.640> be

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
the final stat that we're gonna be

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.610 
the final stat that we're gonna be
looking<00:03:17.760> at<00:03:18.060> though<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.269> their<00:03:18.870> magazine<00:03:19.320> size

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
looking at though is their magazine size

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.040 
looking at though is their magazine size
the<00:03:19.920> scar-h<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.430> gonna<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.940> 21<00:03:21.390> rounds<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.959> a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
the scar-h is gonna have 21 rounds in a

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.210 
the scar-h is gonna have 21 rounds in a
mag<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.560> still<00:03:22.739> had<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.890> bull<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
mag if you still had a bull in the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.150 
mag if you still had a bull in the
chamber<00:03:23.610> while<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.269> sar-21<00:03:24.750> will<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.620> 30<00:03:26.070> or

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
chamber while the sar-21 will have 30 or

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.420 
chamber while the sar-21 will have 30 or
31<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.810> now<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.830> kind<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.040> have<00:03:29.190> all<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
31 so now that we kind of have all the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.340 
31 so now that we kind of have all the
stats<00:03:29.700> out<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.060> way<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.230> these

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
stats out of the way what do these

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.530 
stats out of the way what do these
numbers<00:03:31.830> actually<00:03:32.160> mean<00:03:32.610> how<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.450> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
numbers actually mean how is it going to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.479 
numbers actually mean how is it going to
affect<00:03:33.900> your<00:03:34.050> playstyle<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.709> how<00:03:34.890> you<00:03:34.950> use

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
affect your playstyle and how you use

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.670 
affect your playstyle and how you use
each<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:36.060> these<00:03:36.239> different<00:03:36.510> candidates<00:03:37.110> well

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
each of these different candidates well

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670 
each of these different candidates well
in<00:03:37.950> my<00:03:38.130> opinion<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:39.060> sar-21<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:40.170> strictly<00:03:40.590> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
in my opinion the sar-21 is strictly a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.310 
in my opinion the sar-21 is strictly a
long-range<00:03:41.519> killing<00:03:42.000> machine<00:03:42.330> if<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.959> try<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
long-range killing machine if you try to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.500 
long-range killing machine if you try to
use<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.680> up<00:03:43.860> close<00:03:44.040> and<00:03:44.280> personal<00:03:44.700> while<00:03:45.239> you

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
use this up close and personal while you

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.840 
use this up close and personal while you
can<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:45.989> successful<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.709> some<00:03:47.010> circumstances

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
can be successful in some circumstances

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.759 
can be successful in some circumstances
it's<00:03:48.300> mainly<00:03:48.630> gonna<00:03:48.870> come<00:03:49.080> down<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
it's mainly gonna come down to you

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.710 
it's mainly gonna come down to you
catching<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.580> enemy<00:03:50.820> by<00:03:50.940> surprise<00:03:50.970> getting<00:03:51.660> a

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
catching the enemy by surprise getting a

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.229 
catching the enemy by surprise getting a
nice<00:03:51.840> flank<00:03:52.170> off<00:03:52.380> or<00:03:52.620> if<00:03:53.250> they're<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> terrible

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
nice flank off or if they're a terrible

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.120 
nice flank off or if they're a terrible
player<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.840> if<00:03:55.019> they<00:03:55.200> kind<00:03:55.650> of<00:03:55.769> start<00:03:56.010> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
player because if they kind of start the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.190 
player because if they kind of start the
firefight<00:03:56.670> at<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:56.970> same<00:03:57.180> time<00:03:57.450> as<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.780> do<00:03:57.959> and

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
firefight at the same time as you do and

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.350 
firefight at the same time as you do and
they're<00:03:58.620> using<00:03:59.010> something<00:03:59.250> like<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.610> AEK<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
they're using something like the AEK the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.110 
they're using something like the AEK the
FAMAS<00:04:00.690> or<00:04:01.110> even<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.680> reasonably<00:04:02.250> fast<00:04:02.489> rpm

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
FAMAS or even a reasonably fast rpm

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.240 
FAMAS or even a reasonably fast rpm
weapon<00:04:03.480> they're<00:04:04.019> gonna<00:04:04.200> have<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.680> huge

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
weapon they're gonna have a huge

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.910 
weapon they're gonna have a huge
advantage<00:04:05.940> over<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.330> it's<00:04:07.019> time<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.470> kill<00:04:07.709> is

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
advantage over you it's time to kill is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.539 
advantage over you it's time to kill is
very<00:04:08.670> very<00:04:09.180> high<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.590> do<00:04:11.190> try<00:04:11.489> to

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
very very high and so if you do try to

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.340 
very very high and so if you do try to
run<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:11.790> gun<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.299> you're<00:04:12.480> successful<00:04:12.690> with<00:04:13.049> it

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
run a gun and you're successful with it

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.080 
run a gun and you're successful with it
then<00:04:13.500> you're<00:04:13.620> either<00:04:13.799> a<00:04:13.950> god<00:04:14.280> or<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> headshot

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
then you're either a god or a headshot

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.630 
then you're either a god or a headshot
machine<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:16.200> for<00:04:16.410> everyone<00:04:16.739> else<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.459> just

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
machine but for everyone else it's just

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.159 
machine but for everyone else it's just
simply<00:04:17.940> because<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.479> way<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> stats

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
simply because of the way that the stats

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.409 
simply because of the way that the stats
are<00:04:19.380> presented<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.280> has<00:04:20.459> such<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.910> slow

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
are presented and it has such a slow

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.430 
are presented and it has such a slow
rounds-per-minute

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
rounds-per-minute

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.200 
rounds-per-minute
you're<00:04:22.860> gonna<00:04:23.010> want<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.370> use<00:04:23.430> this<00:04:23.729> one<00:04:23.970> at<00:04:24.180> a

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
you're gonna want to use this one at a

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.830 
you're gonna want to use this one at a
distance<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:25.350> scar-h<00:04:25.650> on<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.190> other<00:04:26.340> hand

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
distance the scar-h on the other hand

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.500 
distance the scar-h on the other hand
I<00:04:26.870> feel<00:04:27.260> like<00:04:27.500> is<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:27.740> much<00:04:28.070> more<00:04:28.510> versatile

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
I feel like is a much more versatile

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.600 
I feel like is a much more versatile
candidate<00:04:30.110> it's<00:04:30.320> got<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.530> higher<00:04:30.889> damage<00:04:31.310> model

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
candidate it's got a higher damage model

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.740 
candidate it's got a higher damage model
so<00:04:31.730> even<00:04:31.970> if<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.120> get<00:04:32.210> up<00:04:32.330> close<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.540> personal

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so even if you get up close and personal

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.170 
so even if you get up close and personal
you<00:04:33.440> have<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.980> higher<00:04:34.250> damage<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:34.940> kind<00:04:35.120> of

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
you have that higher damage to kind of

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.420 
you have that higher damage to kind of
take<00:04:35.330> them<00:04:35.479> out<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:35.840> while<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.710> do<00:04:37.100> need<00:04:37.340> to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
take them out and while you do need to

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.469 
take them out and while you do need to
be<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.760> bit<00:04:37.850> more<00:04:37.970> accurate<00:04:38.120> with<00:04:38.449> it

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
be a little bit more accurate with it

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.270 
be a little bit more accurate with it
because<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.870> only<00:04:39.020> have<00:04:39.199> 21<00:04:39.530> rounds<00:04:39.860> in<00:04:40.190> a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
because you only have 21 rounds in a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.730 
because you only have 21 rounds in a
magazine<00:04:40.490> if<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.360> are<00:04:41.540> able<00:04:41.960> to<00:04:41.990> nail<00:04:42.320> each<00:04:42.590> of

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
magazine if you are able to nail each of

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.800 
magazine if you are able to nail each of
your<00:04:42.919> shots<00:04:43.220> it's<00:04:43.790> time<00:04:44.060> to<00:04:44.180> kill<00:04:44.330> is<00:04:44.510> gonna<00:04:44.690> be

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
your shots it's time to kill is gonna be

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.710 
your shots it's time to kill is gonna be
way<00:04:45.169> lower<00:04:45.620> compared<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.190> the<00:04:46.580> sar-21<00:04:47.060> and

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
way lower compared to the sar-21 and

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.870 
way lower compared to the sar-21 and
it's<00:04:48.020> for<00:04:48.199> that<00:04:48.229> very<00:04:48.710> reason<00:04:49.010> why<00:04:49.430> I<00:04:49.460> believe

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
it's for that very reason why I believe

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.510 
it's for that very reason why I believe
that<00:04:50.300> this<00:04:50.479> gun<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:51.080> just<00:04:51.160> outperforms<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:52.430> is

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
that this gun it just outperforms and is

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.610 
that this gun it just outperforms and is
much<00:04:52.850> more<00:04:53.060> versatile<00:04:53.600> than<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.470> other

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
much more versatile than the other

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.280 
much more versatile than the other
candidate<00:04:55.100> on<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.790> other<00:04:55.970> hand<00:04:56.360> if<00:04:56.600> you<00:04:57.080> do

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
candidate on the other hand if you do

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.950 
candidate on the other hand if you do
not<00:04:57.440> want<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.860> deal<00:04:58.070> with<00:04:58.310> any<00:04:58.729> type<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.210> recoil

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
not want to deal with any type of recoil

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.010 
not want to deal with any type of recoil
then<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:01.070> SAR<00:05:01.550> is<00:05:01.580> is<00:05:02.210> an<00:05:02.419> amazing<00:05:02.990> choice

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
then the SAR is is an amazing choice

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.020 
then the SAR is is an amazing choice
like<00:05:03.560> you<00:05:03.680> guys<00:05:03.860> can<00:05:04.250> see<00:05:04.460> throughout<00:05:04.729> today's

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
while it does have a significant amount

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.740 
while it does have a significant amount
of<00:05:52.099> recoil<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:52.669> I<00:05:52.760> understand<00:05:53.300> that<00:05:53.479> can<00:05:53.599> be<00:05:53.720> a

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
of recoil and I understand that can be a

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.810 
of recoil and I understand that can be a
turn-off<00:05:54.020> for<00:05:54.169> some<00:05:54.530> players<00:05:54.770> if<00:05:55.099> you're<00:05:55.520> able

to manage that and you're able to work

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.779 
to manage that and you're able to work
around<00:05:57.320> the<00:05:57.560> fact<00:05:57.800> that<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.039> only<00:05:58.130> has<00:05:58.400> 21

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789
