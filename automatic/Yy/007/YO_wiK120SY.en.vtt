that's<00:03:13.130> 64-bit<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.030> octo<00:03:14.480> cores<00:03:14.840> big<00:03:15.739> thing

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
that's 64-bit and octo cores big thing

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.620 
that's 64-bit and octo cores big thing
here<00:03:16.069> though<00:03:16.220> despite<00:03:16.579> having<00:03:16.730> open<00:03:17.090> ports

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
here though despite having open ports

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.539 
here though despite having open ports
I<00:03:17.720> had<00:03:17.900> his<00:03:17.989> waterproofing<00:03:18.560> dust<00:03:18.950> tight<00:03:19.310> so

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
I had his waterproofing dust tight so

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.849 
I had his waterproofing dust tight so
that's<00:03:19.730> IP<00:03:19.910> 65<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.690> 68<00:03:21.019> so<00:03:21.290> they<00:03:21.560> took<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.799> of

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
that's IP 65 and 68 so they took out of

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.940 
that's IP 65 and 68 so they took out of
the<00:03:21.920> beach<00:03:22.040> watch<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.850> video<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.209> bathtub

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
the beach watch a video in the bathtub

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.379 
the beach watch a video in the bathtub
taken<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.100> shower<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:25.670> you're<00:03:26.150> so

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
taken in the shower if you're so

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.300

keeping<00:03:28.310> this<00:03:28.459> thin<00:03:28.850> tablet<00:03:29.329> powered<00:03:29.630> up<00:03:29.780> is

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
keeping this thin tablet powered up is

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.289 
keeping this thin tablet powered up is
six<00:03:30.319> thousand<00:03:30.920> milliamp<00:03:31.190> hours<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.030> hopefully

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
six thousand milliamp hours so hopefully

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.270 
six thousand milliamp hours so hopefully
that'll<00:03:32.420> last<00:03:32.660> while<00:03:33.139> somebody<00:03:33.980> says<00:03:34.130> it'll

that'll last while somebody says it'll

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.520 
that'll last while somebody says it'll
get<00:03:34.370> you<00:03:34.459> about<00:03:34.549> 17<00:03:34.970> hours<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.180> playback

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530

I<00:03:36.560> feel<00:03:36.889> like<00:03:37.040> tablets<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.639> phones<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.940> were

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
I feel like tablets and phones out were

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.129 
I feel like tablets and phones out were
just<00:03:38.150> showing<00:03:38.359> off<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:38.750> this<00:03:38.840> thing<00:03:39.019> has

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
just showing off but this thing has

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.590 
just showing off but this thing has
three<00:03:39.650> gigs<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.160> RAM<00:03:40.340> which<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:40.880> imagine<00:03:41.359> is

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
three gigs of RAM which I imagine is

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.080 
three gigs of RAM which I imagine is
unnecessary<00:03:42.230> but<00:03:42.829> it's<00:03:43.220> got<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:43.819> built<00:03:44.000> in

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
unnecessary but it's got it built in

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.509 
unnecessary but it's got it built in
there<00:03:44.180> anyway<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.989> has<00:03:45.109> cameras<00:03:45.560> on<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:46.400> back

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
there anyway it has cameras on the back

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.699 
there anyway it has cameras on the back
although<00:03:46.850> really<00:03:47.209> don't<00:03:48.170> don't<00:03:48.590> take

iPad air 2 it weighs in feels like

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.110 
iPad air 2 it weighs in feels like
they've<00:04:06.889> gotta<00:04:07.099> put<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.340> batter<00:04:07.519> in<00:04:07.639> here<00:04:07.910> it

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
they've gotta put the batter in here it

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.220 
they've gotta put the batter in here it
wastes<00:04:08.239> your<00:04:08.419> hundred<00:04:08.630> eighty<00:04:08.720> nine<00:04:08.780> grams

wastes your hundred eighty nine grams
and<00:04:09.680> then<00:04:09.889> for<00:04:10.099> reference<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.609> iPad<00:04:10.910> air<00:04:11.060> 2<00:04:11.090> is

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
and then for reference the iPad air 2 is

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.140 
and then for reference the iPad air 2 is
437<00:04:12.380> grams<00:04:12.560> so<00:04:12.799> less<00:04:13.130> than<00:04:13.160> that<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.790> if

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
437 grams so less than that and if

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.060 
437 grams so less than that and if
you're<00:04:14.269> wondering<00:04:14.419> what<00:04:14.660> grams<00:04:15.139> means<00:04:15.500> this

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
you're wondering what grams means this

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.560 
you're wondering what grams means this
thing<00:04:16.220> weighs<00:04:16.400> less<00:04:16.579> than<00:04:16.639> a<00:04:16.820> pound<00:04:16.849> so<00:04:17.359> it<00:04:17.479> is

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
thing weighs less than a pound so it is

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.710 
thing weighs less than a pound so it is
really<00:04:18.200> really<00:04:18.680> light<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:20.329> he's<00:04:20.510> done<00:04:20.690> a

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
really really light so he's done a

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.800 
really really light so he's done a
decent<00:04:21.079> job<00:04:21.460> of

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
decent job of
