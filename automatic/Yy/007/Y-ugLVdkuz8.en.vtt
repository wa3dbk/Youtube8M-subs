00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
everything ok so something like this was

only a certain a few grams and it needs

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.680 
only a certain a few grams and it needs
very<00:00:38.010> lightweight<00:00:38.340> sensors<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.149> there<00:00:39.510> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
very lightweight sensors and there we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.299 
very lightweight sensors and there we
can<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:40.050> inspiration<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:40.620> biology<00:00:40.829> from

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can take inspiration from biology from

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.420 
can take inspiration from biology from
flies<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:42.059> bees<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.230> only<00:00:43.500> their<00:00:44.040> visual

this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> very<00:00:48.719> powerful<00:00:49.260> example<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.950> using

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
this is a very powerful example of using

fish is that each fish or each bird uses

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
fish is that each fish or each bird uses
very<00:01:14.119> simple<00:01:15.119> navigation<00:01:15.650> principles<00:01:16.650> or

very simple navigation principles or

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.190 
very simple navigation principles or
ways<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.549> sensors<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.049> this

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
ways or sensors as well and like this

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.660 
ways or sensors as well and like this
together<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> collective<00:01:20.189> systems<00:01:20.549> are

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
together as the collective systems are

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.850 
together as the collective systems are
able<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> provide<00:01:21.689> very<00:01:21.960> complex<00:01:22.409> behaviors

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
able to provide very complex behaviors

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
able to provide very complex behaviors
so<00:01:23.759> doing<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> same<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.630> robots<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.170> allow

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so doing the same with robots can allow

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:37.880 
so doing the same with robots can allow
us<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:25.890> complex<00:01:26.610> tasks

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.440 

I<00:01:40.130> think<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.190> next<00:01:41.430> step<00:01:41.520> for<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> aerial

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
I think the next step for the aerial

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
I think the next step for the aerial
robotics<00:01:42.750> field<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.590> interact<00:01:43.890> with

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
robotics field is to interact with

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
environments and grasping or perching is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.810 
environments and grasping or perching is
one<00:01:47.220> example<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.830> once<00:01:49.830> we<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.159> robots

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
one example for that once we have robots

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.609 
one example for that once we have robots
that<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.119> freely<00:01:51.390> fly<00:01:51.659> around<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.229> pick<00:01:52.440> up

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
that can freely fly around and pick up

that can freely fly around and pick up
objects<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:53.250> flights<00:01:53.580> we<00:01:54.240> will<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.509> able<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
