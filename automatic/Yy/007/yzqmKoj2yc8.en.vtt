very very important piece of maintenance

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.940 
very very important piece of maintenance
on<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.429> Traxxas<00:00:11.849> Slash<00:00:11.929> 4x4<00:00:12.929> now<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.799> is

going to be about the plastic half
shafts<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.770> slider<00:00:17.369> axles<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.840> all

four corners of this slash 4x4 these are

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
four corners of this slash 4x4 these are
not<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.170> same<00:00:22.350> shafts<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.160> they've<00:00:23.369> used<00:00:23.670> on

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
not the same shafts as they've used on

any other vehicle to date they have a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.970 
any other vehicle to date they have a
new<00:00:26.369> design<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.840> more<00:00:28.260> durable<00:00:28.680> than<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
new design that is more durable than the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
new design that is more durable than the
older<00:00:29.250> versions<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.170> less

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
older versions and it has a lot less

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.850 
older versions and it has a lot less
tolerance<00:00:32.099> between<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.030> outer<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> inner

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
tolerance between the outer and inner

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
tolerance between the outer and inner
pieces<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.730> I've<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:35.880> gone<00:00:36.450> ahead<00:00:36.540> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
pieces so what I've got gone ahead and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.810 
pieces so what I've got gone ahead and
done<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.100> speed<00:00:38.340> things<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
done here just to speed things up a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.850 
done here just to speed things up a
little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> I've<00:00:39.360> taken<00:00:39.600> off<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
little bit and I've taken off one of the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.740 
little bit and I've taken off one of the
wheels<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> tires<00:00:41.460> I've<00:00:42.030> taken<00:00:42.239> off<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> hex

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
wheels and tires I've taken off the hex

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.810 
wheels and tires I've taken off the hex
hub<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.530> now<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:43.920> just<00:00:43.950> taking<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hub and now I'm just taking out the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.040 
hub and now I'm just taking out the
outer<00:00:45.600> suspension<00:00:46.289> pin<00:00:47.660> I'll<00:00:48.660> set<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.989> aside

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
outer suspension pin I'll set that aside

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
outer suspension pin I'll set that aside
and<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:50.879> pull<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.570> out<00:00:51.860> you're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and I pull this out you're going to

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.689 
and I pull this out you're going to
notice<00:00:53.190> something<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:56.100> right

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
notice something that is very not right

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.319 
notice something that is very not right
here<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.840> shaft<00:00:58.260> itself<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.329> extending

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
here the shaft itself is not extending

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.080 
here the shaft itself is not extending
in<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.530> fact<00:01:02.570> very<00:01:03.570> stiff<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:05.090> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
in and out in fact very stiff that is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.130 
in and out in fact very stiff that is
completely<00:01:06.780> bound<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.549> what<00:01:08.549> happens<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.450> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
completely bound up what happens is that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.210 
completely bound up what happens is that
dirt<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.119> dust<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:13.320> fine<00:01:13.560> grains<00:01:13.950> of

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
dirt and dust a little fine grains of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
dirt and dust a little fine grains of
sand<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:15.330> inside<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.479> two<00:01:18.630> pieces

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
sand get inside of the the two pieces

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.710 
sand get inside of the the two pieces
and<00:01:19.400> interferes<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> mesh<00:01:20.970> between<00:01:21.509> them

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and interferes in the mesh between them

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.899 
and interferes in the mesh between them
and<00:01:22.020> it<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:22.710> gets<00:01:22.920> ground<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.520> there<00:01:23.729> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and it really gets ground in there and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.030 
and it really gets ground in there and
what<00:01:24.030> happens<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.470> creates

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
what happens is that it just creates

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
what happens is that it just creates
friction<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.640> entire<00:01:27.060> shaft<00:01:27.540> actually

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
friction this entire shaft actually

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.359 
friction this entire shaft actually
becomes<00:01:29.009> somewhat<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.670> shock<00:01:30.180> absorber<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
becomes somewhat of a shock absorber and

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
becomes somewhat of a shock absorber and
it's<00:01:32.369> literally<00:01:32.909> adding<00:01:33.540> shock<00:01:34.350> absorption

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
it's literally adding shock absorption

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
it's literally adding shock absorption
and<00:01:35.220> dampening<00:01:35.850> effect<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:37.229> entire

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
and dampening effect to your entire

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.370 
and dampening effect to your entire
suspension<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.930> happens<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
suspension back here so what happens is

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.730 
suspension back here so what happens is
that<00:01:40.409> while<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:42.299> shock<00:01:42.869> is<00:01:43.110> set<00:01:43.590> up

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that while I think my shock is set up

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.960 
that while I think my shock is set up
properly<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:45.360> actually<00:01:46.290> adding<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.670> lot<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
properly I'm actually adding a lot of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.600 
properly I'm actually adding a lot of
resistance<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> movement<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
resistance to the movement of the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.760 
resistance to the movement of the
suspension<00:01:51.149> because<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.689> shaft<00:01:52.500> is

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
suspension because this shaft is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.069 
suspension because this shaft is
supposed<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.399> go<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> out<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.810> bit

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
supposed to go in and out a little bit

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.859 
supposed to go in and out a little bit
as<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.560> suspension<00:01:56.369> compresses<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.420> extends

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
as the suspension compresses and extends

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050 
as the suspension compresses and extends
so<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> need<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.100> clean<00:01:59.460> down<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so I need to get this clean down this is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
so I need to get this clean down this is
something<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> you're<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> need<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
something that you're going to need to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.889 
something that you're going to need to
do<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> Traxxas<00:02:02.729> Slash<00:02:02.759> 4x4<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.840> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
do on the Traxxas Slash 4x4 on a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.260 
do on the Traxxas Slash 4x4 on a
somewhat<00:02:04.229> regular<00:02:04.710> basis<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:06.030> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
somewhat regular basis if you have the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.190 
somewhat regular basis if you have the
stock<00:02:06.920> slider<00:02:07.920> shafts<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.390> don't<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
stock slider shafts if you don't do this

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.229 
stock slider shafts if you don't do this
your<00:02:10.560> suspension<00:02:11.009> action<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:12.000> be

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
your suspension action will be

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.000 
your suspension action will be
compromised

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
compromised

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.390 
compromised
very<00:02:13.790> dramatically<00:02:14.629> this<00:02:15.140> is<00:02:15.409> a<00:02:15.440> big<00:02:16.040> deal

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
very dramatically this is a big deal

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.190 
very dramatically this is a big deal
here<00:02:16.819> it<00:02:17.299> can<00:02:17.450> make<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.629> difference<00:02:17.780> between

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
here it can make the difference between

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.440 
here it can make the difference between
your<00:02:18.650> suspension<00:02:19.220> working<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.819> not<00:02:20.420> working

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
your suspension working and not working

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.740 
your suspension working and not working
at<00:02:20.930> all<00:02:21.110> whether<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.920> realize<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.430> or<00:02:22.700> not<00:02:22.760> so

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
at all whether you realize it or not so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.910 
at all whether you realize it or not so
what<00:02:24.080> I'm<00:02:24.200> going<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.349> do<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.799> I'm<00:02:24.890> just

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
what I'm going to do here is I'm just

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.369 
what I'm going to do here is I'm just
going<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.280> take<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.640> entire<00:02:26.030> assembly<00:02:27.019> off

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
going to take this entire assembly off

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.940 
going to take this entire assembly off
and<00:02:27.709> then<00:02:28.430> clean<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.819> up<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:30.349> there<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.620> is<00:02:30.739> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
and then clean it up so there it is the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.789 
and then clean it up so there it is the
shaft<00:02:31.690> see<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.930> get<00:02:33.049> this<00:02:33.200> focused<00:02:33.680> a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
shaft see it and get this focused a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.009 
shaft see it and get this focused a
little<00:02:34.010> bit<00:02:34.129> here<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.549> can<00:02:35.450> see<00:02:35.690> that

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
little bit here and you can see that

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.229 
little bit here and you can see that
there<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.319> grid<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.989> dust<00:02:38.989> on<00:02:39.379> the<00:02:40.129> on<00:02:40.459> the

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
there is grid and dust on the on the

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.809 
there is grid and dust on the on the
spline<00:02:41.569> there<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.349> it's<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.579> stuff

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
spline there and it's actually the stuff

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.390 
spline there and it's actually the stuff
that's<00:02:44.030> on<00:02:44.180> these<00:02:44.329> larger<00:02:44.959> surfaces<00:02:45.650> that's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
that's on these larger surfaces that's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.309 
that's on these larger surfaces that's
causing<00:02:46.670> most<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.510> resistance<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:48.260> I'm

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
causing most of the resistance so I'm

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.440 
causing most of the resistance so I'm
going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.530> take<00:02:48.709> these<00:02:48.890> apart<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:50.329> can

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
going to take these apart and you can

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.339 
going to take these apart and you can
see<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.349> wedged<00:02:51.560> together<00:02:52.190> there

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
see it's really wedged together there

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.199 
see it's really wedged together there
take<00:02:54.349> these<00:02:54.530> apart<00:02:54.730> we're<00:02:55.730> going<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:55.940> clean

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
take these apart we're going to clean

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.110 
take these apart we're going to clean
them<00:02:56.420> with<00:02:57.109> just<00:02:57.590> regular<00:02:57.769> soap<00:02:58.430> water<00:02:58.790> clean

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
them with just regular soap water clean

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.670 
them with just regular soap water clean
them<00:02:59.299> very<00:02:59.510> thoroughly<00:02:59.720> to<00:03:00.049> get<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.470> loose

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
them very thoroughly to get the loose

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.349 
them very thoroughly to get the loose
dust<00:03:01.040> off<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.609> then<00:03:01.700> I'm<00:03:01.790> going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:01.940> come<00:03:02.150> back

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
dust off and then I'm going to come back

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.830 
dust off and then I'm going to come back
and<00:03:02.690> work<00:03:03.379> on<00:03:03.560> them<00:03:03.739> a<00:03:03.769> little<00:03:03.920> bit<00:03:04.129> more<00:03:04.340> and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
and work on them a little bit more and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.500 
and work on them a little bit more and
there<00:03:05.840> we<00:03:05.989> go<00:03:06.170> now<00:03:06.680> they're<00:03:07.010> cleaned<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.150> I

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
there we go now they're cleaned and I

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.839 
there we go now they're cleaned and I
also<00:03:08.629> dry<00:03:08.959> them<00:03:09.200> just<00:03:09.410> have<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.590> fair<00:03:09.980> before

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
also dry them just have a fair before

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.460 
also dry them just have a fair before
and<00:03:10.970> after<00:03:11.239> comparison<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.519> already<00:03:14.470> with

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
and after comparison and already with

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.470 
and after comparison and already with
the<00:03:15.650> man<00:03:15.799> I<00:03:16.069> can<00:03:16.549> feel<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.849> it's<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.209> little

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
the man I can feel that it's a little

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.970 
the man I can feel that it's a little
bit<00:03:17.630> more<00:03:17.870> loose<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.319> there<00:03:18.470> but<00:03:18.650> it's<00:03:18.799> still

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
bit more loose in there but it's still

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.699 
bit more loose in there but it's still
binding<00:03:19.459> I<00:03:19.519> mean<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:20.299> inside<00:03:21.139> shaft<00:03:21.470> should

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
binding I mean this inside shaft should

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.920 
binding I mean this inside shaft should
be<00:03:21.859> able<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.069> just<00:03:22.340> fall<00:03:22.669> should<00:03:23.599> be<00:03:23.690> able<00:03:23.750> just

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
be able to just fall should be able just

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.039 
be able to just fall should be able just
fall<00:03:24.200> right<00:03:24.230> out<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:25.190> should<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.519> no

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
fall right out there should be no

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.960 
fall right out there should be no
friction<00:03:27.049> err<00:03:27.349> next<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.250> no<00:03:28.370> friction<00:03:28.760> at<00:03:28.880> all

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
friction err next to no friction at all

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.930 
friction err next to no friction at all
so<00:03:29.239> these<00:03:29.359> are<00:03:29.540> still<00:03:29.810> binding<00:03:30.700> fairly<00:03:31.700> badly

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
so these are still binding fairly badly

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.789 
so these are still binding fairly badly
so<00:03:32.329> now<00:03:32.510> I'm<00:03:32.660> going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.870> take<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.290> next<00:03:33.590> step

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
so now I'm going to take the next step

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.240 
so now I'm going to take the next step
to<00:03:34.340> do<00:03:34.459> this<00:03:34.609> even<00:03:34.849> more<00:03:35.090> thoroughly<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:37.099> want

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
to do this even more thoroughly you want

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.879 
to do this even more thoroughly you want
to<00:03:37.340> take<00:03:37.489> your<00:03:37.639> inner<00:03:37.849> spline<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.530> sharp

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
to take your inner spline and a sharp

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.089 
to take your inner spline and a sharp
number<00:03:40.549> 11<00:03:40.940> exacto<00:03:41.660> blade<00:03:41.690> or<00:03:42.680> something

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
number 11 exacto blade or something

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.890 
number 11 exacto blade or something
equivalent<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:43.790> you're<00:03:44.510> going<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.690> run

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
equivalent to that you're going to run

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.000 
equivalent to that you're going to run
the<00:03:44.959> blade<00:03:45.819> across<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.239> surface<00:03:47.889> scraping<00:03:48.889> it

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
the blade across the surface scraping it

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.530 
the blade across the surface scraping it
so<00:03:49.160> I'm<00:03:49.250> not<00:03:49.310> cutting<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.090> I'm<00:03:50.239> going<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.419> get

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
so I'm not cutting in I'm going to get

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.330 
so I'm not cutting in I'm going to get
in<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.780> little<00:03:50.870> bit<00:03:50.989> closer<00:03:51.290> here<00:03:51.410> I'm<00:03:52.160> not

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
in a little bit closer here I'm not

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.089 
in a little bit closer here I'm not
cutting<00:03:52.819> in<00:03:52.970> I'm<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.269> going<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.540> scrape

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.550 

flat<00:03:58.099> across<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:58.549> surface<00:03:58.989> now<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.049> can<00:04:00.379> do

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
flat across the surface now you can do

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.899 
flat across the surface now you can do
this<00:04:00.769> with<00:04:01.159> a<00:04:02.709> piece<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> sandpaper<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:04.640> very

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:04.909 
this with a piece of sandpaper and very

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.210 
this with a piece of sandpaper and very
fine<00:04:05.299> emery<00:04:05.870> paper<00:04:08.680> but<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.799> want<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.040> make

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
fine emery paper but you want to make

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.309 
fine emery paper but you want to make
sure<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.790> you<00:04:11.090> do<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.480> all<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:11.870> one<00:04:12.049> direction

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
sure that you do it all in one direction

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.890 
sure that you do it all in one direction
you<00:04:12.799> want<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.010> go<00:04:13.099> along<00:04:13.909> the<00:04:14.420> length<00:04:14.659> you

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
you want to go along the length you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.800 
you want to go along the length you
don't<00:04:15.049> want<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.319> just<00:04:15.500> randomly<00:04:16.810> create

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
don't want to just randomly create

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.530 
don't want to just randomly create
scuffs<00:04:18.229> in<00:04:18.560> every<00:04:18.769> direction

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
scuffs in every direction

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.879 
scuffs in every direction
again<00:04:20.540> these<00:04:20.799> shouts<00:04:21.799> go<00:04:22.490> in<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:23.030> out<00:04:23.710> so<00:04:24.710> any

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
again these shouts go in and out so any

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.520 
again these shouts go in and out so any
grooves<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.240> inadvertently<00:04:26.900> put<00:04:27.410> in

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
grooves that you inadvertently put in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.040 
grooves that you inadvertently put in
there<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:28.699> want<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.030> be<00:04:29.150> in<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.600> in-and-out

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
there you want to be in the in-and-out

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.980 
there you want to be in the in-and-out
direction<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.220> they<00:04:31.370> can<00:04:31.720> ride<00:04:32.720> with

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
direction so that they can ride with

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.750 
direction so that they can ride with
less<00:04:33.229> friction<00:04:33.530> I'm<00:04:34.039> just<00:04:34.190> going<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.400> go<00:04:34.520> all

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
less friction I'm just going to go all

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.150 
less friction I'm just going to go all
the<00:04:34.789> way<00:04:34.940> around<00:04:35.090> now<00:04:38.650> your<00:04:39.650> blade<00:04:39.889> can

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
the way around now your blade can

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.840 
the way around now your blade can
actually<00:04:40.550> start<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.970> round<00:04:41.150> off<00:04:41.479> a<00:04:41.510> little<00:04:41.810> bit

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
actually start to round off a little bit

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.400 
actually start to round off a little bit
and<00:04:43.850> create<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.240> burr<00:04:44.510> on<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.840> opposite<00:04:45.139> side

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
and create a burr on the opposite side

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.629 
and create a burr on the opposite side
so<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.680> can<00:04:45.800> actually<00:04:47.380> kind<00:04:48.380> of<00:04:48.500> flip<00:04:49.490> around

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
so you can actually kind of flip around

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.990 
so you can actually kind of flip around
and<00:04:50.120> start<00:04:50.419> scraping<00:04:50.840> in<00:04:51.350> toward<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.280> just<00:04:52.820> be

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
and start scraping in toward you just be

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.379 
and start scraping in toward you just be
very<00:04:53.360> careful<00:04:53.810> not<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:53.990> cut<00:04:54.260> yourself<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:56.240> now

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
very careful not to cut yourself so now

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.120 
very careful not to cut yourself so now
right<00:04:56.600> in<00:04:56.780> that<00:04:56.930> sweet<00:04:57.229> spot<00:04:57.260> where<00:04:57.860> the

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
right in that sweet spot where the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.420 
right in that sweet spot where the
suspension<00:04:58.610> really<00:04:58.760> works<00:04:59.229> it's<00:05:00.229> very<00:05:00.979> very

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
suspension really works it's very very

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.270 
suspension really works it's very very
loose<00:05:01.729> whereas<00:05:02.240> before<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:03.500> was<00:05:03.710> completely

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
loose whereas before it was completely

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.800 
loose whereas before it was completely
bound<00:05:04.580> up<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:07.490> see<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:07.700> didn't<00:05:08.000> do<00:05:08.090> anything<00:05:08.330> to

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
bound up you see I didn't do anything to

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.680 
bound up you see I didn't do anything to
the<00:05:08.930> grooves<00:05:09.260> in<00:05:10.060> there<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.270> didn't<00:05:11.630> do

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
the grooves in there I didn't do

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.350 
the grooves in there I didn't do
anything<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.320> end<00:05:12.669> all<00:05:13.669> that<00:05:13.729> I<00:05:13.940> worked<00:05:14.180> on

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
anything to the end all that I worked on

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.710 
anything to the end all that I worked on
was<00:05:14.690> just<00:05:15.160> scraping<00:05:16.160> off<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.720> outside

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
was just scraping off the outside

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.279 
was just scraping off the outside
surface<00:05:18.440> of<00:05:18.560> it<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.539> this<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:20.660> done<00:05:20.900> this<00:05:21.110> is

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
surface of it and this is done this is

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.260 
surface of it and this is done this is
ready<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.620> go

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
ready to go

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.670 
ready to go
this<00:05:23.270> will<00:05:23.450> make<00:05:23.599> a<00:05:23.660> tremendous<00:05:24.050> difference

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
this will make a tremendous difference

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.460 
this will make a tremendous difference
to<00:05:25.490> your<00:05:25.580> suspension<00:05:26.180> action<00:05:26.539> so<00:05:27.110> if<00:05:27.199> you<00:05:27.349> have

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
to your suspension action so if you have

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.129 
to your suspension action so if you have
tuned<00:05:27.710> your<00:05:27.979> suspension<00:05:28.599> your<00:05:29.599> shocks<00:05:29.930> on

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 
tuned your suspension your shocks on

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.439 
tuned your suspension your shocks on
your<00:05:30.260> springs<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:31.400> a<00:05:32.560> set<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:34.000> shafts<00:05:35.000> that<00:05:35.240> are

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
your springs to a set of shafts that are

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.320 
your springs to a set of shafts that are
already<00:05:35.660> bound<00:05:36.620> up<00:05:36.919> you're<00:05:37.280> going<00:05:37.699> to<00:05:37.880> need<00:05:38.120> to

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
already bound up you're going to need to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.120 
already bound up you're going to need to
retune

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.680 

and<00:05:41.640> the<00:05:41.730> more<00:05:41.910> times<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.330> do<00:05:42.480> this

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
and the more times you do this

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.580 
and the more times you do this
maintenance<00:05:43.130> the<00:05:44.660> smaller<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:45.960> inner<00:05:46.170> shaft

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
maintenance the smaller that inner shaft

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.320 
maintenance the smaller that inner shaft
is<00:05:46.800> going<00:05:46.980> to<00:05:47.070> become<00:05:47.370> from<00:05:47.670> scraping<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.180> down

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
is going to become from scraping it down

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.690 
is going to become from scraping it down
and<00:05:48.570> the<00:05:49.050> less<00:05:49.320> frequently<00:05:49.950> you<00:05:50.130> will<00:05:50.280> need<00:05:50.520> to

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
and the less frequently you will need to

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.740 
and the less frequently you will need to
do<00:05:50.820> this<00:05:51.000> because<00:05:51.180> there<00:05:51.390> would<00:05:51.510> be<00:05:51.540> a<00:05:51.600> little

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
do this because there would be a little

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.870 
do this because there would be a little
bit<00:05:51.900> more<00:05:52.080> tolerance<00:05:52.620> so<00:05:53.370> you<00:05:53.430> won't<00:05:53.700> really

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
bit more tolerance so you won't really

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.950 
bit more tolerance so you won't really
be<00:05:54.200> squeezing<00:05:55.200> and<00:05:56.090> compressing<00:05:57.090> dirt<00:05:57.780> in

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
be squeezing and compressing dirt in

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.480 
be squeezing and compressing dirt in
there<00:05:58.200> quite<00:05:58.830> so<00:05:59.070> well<00:05:59.310> as<00:05:59.640> as<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.600> drive

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
there quite so well as as you drive

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.710 
there quite so well as as you drive
while<00:06:02.490> you're<00:06:02.760> doing<00:06:03.060> this<00:06:03.210> this<00:06:03.420> is<00:06:03.480> of

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
while you're doing this this is of

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.110 
while you're doing this this is of
course<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:04.080> good<00:06:04.380> time<00:06:04.590> to<00:06:05.340> clean<00:06:05.910> off<00:06:06.090> your

course a good time to clean off your

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.480 
course a good time to clean off your

and<00:06:18.390> do<00:06:18.750> it<00:06:18.810> in<00:06:18.900> here<00:06:19.170> and<00:06:20.130> it's<00:06:20.340> also<00:06:20.490> a<00:06:20.610> good

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
and do it in here and it's also a good

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.420 
and do it in here and it's also a good
time<00:06:20.940> of<00:06:21.150> course<00:06:21.360> if<00:06:21.660> you<00:06:21.780> haven't<00:06:21.990> done

maintenance on your bearings recently
it's<00:06:25.860> a<00:06:25.890> good<00:06:26.040> time<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.430> do<00:06:26.520> that<00:06:26.670> too<00:06:26.970> and<00:06:27.540> look

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
it's a good time to do that too and look
