00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
finished together I didn't use a whole

finished together I didn't use a whole
lot<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.340> solder<00:01:06.610> on<00:01:06.790> it<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.950> didn't<00:01:08.950> want<00:01:09.009> to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
lot of solder on it I didn't want to

look you know really amateurish and I

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.930 
look you know really amateurish and I
used<00:01:11.259> just<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.649> minimal<00:01:12.009> amount<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.520> should<00:01:12.759> just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
used just a minimal amount I should just

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.700 
used just a minimal amount I should just
go<00:01:13.060> ahead<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.300> just<00:01:13.390> just<00:01:13.690> slopped<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.560> on

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710

go ahead and just just slopped it on
there<00:01:16.289> now<00:01:17.289> the<00:01:17.350> problem<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.039> with<00:01:18.250> this

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
there now the problem is with this

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.850 
there now the problem is with this
guitar<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.390> you're<00:01:20.050> playing<00:01:20.380> it<00:01:20.560> all<00:01:20.740> of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
guitar is that you're playing it all of

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.580 
guitar is that you're playing it all of
a<00:01:20.890> sudden<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.550> neck<00:01:22.060> pup<00:01:22.360> cuts<00:01:22.660> out<00:01:22.899> alright

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
a sudden the neck pup cuts out alright

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.419 
a sudden the neck pup cuts out alright
and<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:25.330> simply<00:01:25.690> means<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:26.080> a<00:01:26.429> grounding

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
and it simply means that a grounding

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:29.219 
and it simply means that a grounding
wire<00:01:27.580> has<00:01:27.880> come<00:01:28.060> loose<00:01:28.270> off<00:01:28.539> of<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:28.990> knob

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
wire has come loose off of that knob

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.889 
wire has come loose off of that knob
right<00:01:29.560> there<00:01:30.149> which<00:01:31.149> means<00:01:31.390> that<00:01:31.539> got<00:01:31.659> pull

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
right there which means that got pull

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.430 
right there which means that got pull
that<00:01:32.050> knob<00:01:32.320> out<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:33.119> resolder<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.720> it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
that knob out and resolder it and it

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.990 
that knob out and resolder it and it
won't<00:01:35.619> be<00:01:35.679> too<00:01:35.710> hard<00:01:35.890> just<00:01:36.369> take<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.670> strings

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
won't be too hard just take the strings

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.510 
won't be too hard just take the strings
down<00:01:37.330> or<00:01:37.630> loosen<00:01:37.899> those<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.440> pull<00:01:38.679> aside<00:01:38.830> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
down or loosen those that pull aside and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.380 
down or loosen those that pull aside and
I<00:01:40.210> take<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.659> pup<00:01:40.869> out<00:01:41.940> it's<00:01:42.940> laying<00:01:43.119> there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
I take the pup out it's laying there

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.440 
I take the pup out it's laying there
with<00:01:43.450> two<00:01:43.659> screws<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.670> know<00:01:45.820> resolder<00:01:46.180> it

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and put it back in again it's not really

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.700 
and put it back in again it's not really
hard<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.130> do<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.689> don't<00:01:49.689> know<00:01:49.780> last<00:01:50.140> is<00:01:50.590> two

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
hard to do I don't know last is two

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.590 
hard to do I don't know last is two
beyond<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.310> but<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.909> kind<00:01:52.299> of<00:01:52.360> tell<00:01:52.570> that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
beyond that but you kind of tell that

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.999 
beyond that but you kind of tell that
because<00:01:52.990> when<00:01:53.170> you're<00:01:53.259> playing<00:01:53.290> it's<00:01:53.740> already

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
because when you're playing it's already

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.580 
because when you're playing it's already
touches<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.430> pup<00:01:54.640> itself<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.810> ground<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.380> and

way<00:06:22.510> I<00:06:22.540> got<00:06:22.810> this<00:06:22.870> wired<00:06:23.170> up<00:06:23.470> when<00:06:23.800> it<00:06:23.890> sits<00:06:24.160> up

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
way I got this wired up when it sits up

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.580

guys I mean I have to start from right
here<00:06:31.380> build<00:06:32.380> a<00:06:32.470> harness<00:06:32.680> that<00:06:32.890> ran<00:06:33.130> up<00:06:33.250> to<00:06:33.280> this

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
here build a harness that ran up to this

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.030 
here build a harness that ran up to this
then<00:06:34.180> ran<00:06:34.360> over<00:06:34.390> to<00:06:34.690> here<00:06:35.170> then<00:06:35.530> back<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:35.950> the

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
then ran over to here then back to the

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.790 
then ran over to here then back to the
pups<00:06:36.310> in<00:06:36.520> and<00:06:36.910> that's<00:06:37.810> not<00:06:37.960> gonna<00:06:38.140> happen<00:06:38.350> okay

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
pups in and that's not gonna happen okay

freestanding wires and two of them you

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.280 
freestanding wires and two of them you
can<00:06:44.530> see<00:06:44.830> just<00:06:45.190> barely<00:06:45.550> but<00:06:45.850> on<00:06:46.540> this<00:06:46.720> film<00:06:47.020> but

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
can see just barely but on this film but

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.170 
can see just barely but on this film but
in<00:06:47.920> real<00:06:48.160> life<00:06:48.370> you<00:06:48.520> can<00:06:48.670> see<00:06:48.760> them<00:06:48.880> very<00:06:48.910> well

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
in real life you can see them very well

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.330 
in real life you can see them very well
I'll<00:06:49.540> just<00:06:49.870> simply<00:06:50.050> tuck<00:06:50.440> those<00:06:50.650> back<00:06:50.950> inside

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340
