more<00:00:36.870> mid-range<00:00:37.460> there<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.640> 12,000<00:00:40.940> 350

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
roughly miles on it which really isn't

roughly miles on it which really isn't
that<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.270> 495<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:47.160> runs<00:00:47.370> great<00:00:47.579> let<00:00:48.329> me

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that much 495 and it runs great let me

00:00:48.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
that much 495 and it runs great let me
start<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.780> right<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.020> for<00:00:49.200> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.130 

go<00:01:03.030> around<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> bike<00:01:03.600> scene<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.020> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
go around the bike scene here the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.640 
go around the bike scene here the
exhaust<00:01:05.360> going<00:01:06.360> always<00:01:06.660> show<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.110> pipe<00:01:07.440> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
exhaust going always show the pipe and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
exhaust going always show the pipe and
how<00:01:07.800> loud<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.610> stock<00:01:09.300> pipe

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.920 

and<00:01:27.850> I<00:01:27.940> think<00:01:28.150> it's<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.300> little<00:01:28.479> louder<00:01:28.690> from

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
and I think it's a little louder from

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:41.830 
and I think it's a little louder from
behind<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:29.470> bike

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.130 

there<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:44.330> let<00:01:45.330> me<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> guess<00:01:45.870> I<00:01:45.990> could

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
there it is let me see I guess I could

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.870 
there it is let me see I guess I could
show<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.680> guess<00:01:46.980> I<00:01:47.070> could<00:01:47.220> probably<00:01:47.340> show<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
show I guess I could probably show the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.160 
show I guess I could probably show the
tires<00:01:48.560> you<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:50.300> see<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.450> spiky<00:01:51.900> things
