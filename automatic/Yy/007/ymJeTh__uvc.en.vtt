00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 what to do if lag laptop when 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 running games and generally the games themselves frets with 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.880
 You are Vlad Ivanov 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.219
 magazine just.ru advanced user 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.469
 and the easiest solution is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.900
 switching the video card from the built-in to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.990
 discrete word pair built-in card 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 there is in every laptop is understandable 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.990
 but in the last two years started 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.740
 to release a technique with two video cards 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:31.769
 let's say i have a hp probook laptop 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.780
 4530 with two video cards in it and all 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.210
 worked fine we need 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.579
 switch to a discrete graphics card 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 how do they differ and why are there three? 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.629
 video cards did look at this from 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 developer side 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.559
 let me draw you a little so you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.010
 means eat 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 discrete graphics card and built-in to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
 everything worked fine enough one 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.329
 video cards 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 but they were made 2 why and then what 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.189
 the laptop has a battery and and when it doesn't 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.070
 connected to charge 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.670
 sits down pretty quickly 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.220
 when a discrete graphics card in here soon 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.409
 as if very fast discharge j 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.020
 and if use built 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.240
 then the video card will charge 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.790
 leave less proper for this and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.860
 was made from such a technical 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.759
 integrated graphics card solution consumes 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.850
 less power consumption discrete 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.880
 the card is larger but the discrete card is by 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 performance better and faster she 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.490
 has its own operating memory and its 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.200
 CPU 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.310
 the built-in card eats the processor 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.790
 your laptop 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.240
 but its resources are more accurate and operational 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 memory 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 therefore from here all and lags behind built 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.869
 video cards when you run heavy games like 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 same it is solved is solved just push 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.420
 on the desktop, right-click 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.090
 click graphics properties if you have 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.270
 video card 2 from me 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 raiden some kind there i don't know exactly 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.790
 I have such a center and in it 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.800
 you must press 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.130
 way to switch graphic 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 adapters and select graphic 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.440
 I manually switch the processor here 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.010
 is worth a little boxing in this case too 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 you will all be great I run 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.160
 I mean games like assassin's 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.700
 creed 3 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:38.610
 or whatever it is called gta 4 and others 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 heavier games to check which one 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 the video card is working now 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.990
 need in the right corner of the screen yes actually 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.180
 you can run the game and compare how 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.900
 after these of your switching will 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.320
 In general, everything looks by the way here 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 let me choose an example now 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.290
 Iâ€™ll click on the first checkbox 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.450
 the screen starts flashing to change 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.570
 resolution 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.800
 so briefly befall 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.270
 video card 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.570
 graphics processor more precisely and now i'm 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.150
 I press on this arrow I choose so m d 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.070
 center right click and see what y 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 I have a built-in card here 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.709
 intel hd graphics last name which means 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.880
 what is now used exactly 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.980
 integrated map 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.690
 we need to switch to discrete me 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.240
 I select the second check mark 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.650
 reverse operation see chose the old 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.770
 pressing again apply all 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.470
 switched and and again muna 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.300
 right arrow and see something 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.610
 that I now have a video card selected 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.000
 discrete md raid eat 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.390
 seventy four seventy m now with 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.430
 I will be fine with the start of the game 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:58.400
 so what you want so on this and let's 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.530
 consider how to defragment 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.340
 go to the browser go to the link 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.540
 which I will attach below this video 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.290
 I also made a direct link to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.489
 the program is our favorite developer before 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.540
 forum so click download 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.850
 choose 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.250
 and it starts with the customer 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:28.919
 programs to defrag hard 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.850
 we wait a little for a disk and we start I select 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:34.050
 Russian language 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.729
 next this center can be closed click 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.199
 Further 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:45.000
 ticking updates and clicking 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:47.849
 install cleaning information program 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.889
 ready to close the program here we are 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.729
 we can make an estimate of speed 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.770
 hard drive 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.199
 analysis either run immediately 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.810
 defragment me recommend you 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.539
 choose normal defragmentation they 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.900
 quickly because it's more thorough 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.880
 will do everything I understand they ask us 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.229
 delete or unnecessary files from the recycle bin 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.440
 pressing yes is cleaning and now 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.699
 begins creating a list of files on 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.400
 everyone on the hard drive 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.699
 this is done to ensure that everything is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.470
 laid out on the shelves what is this 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.090
 the process will take quite some time 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.139
 especially if you have your own hard drive 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.810
 about 700 gigabytes or more so i 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.440
 on this I finish see you in others 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.979
 more interesting videos such as hacking 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.849
 wi-fi networks or creating your own website 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.470
 and other interesting topics for you by the way 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:49.800
 saying you can go to the youtube channel 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:53.280
 advanced log user and there 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.260
 send me a topic for a new lesson that 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.690
 like likes leave comments 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.539
 subscribe to the channel not to 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.500
 traced interesting information with you 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.010
 was Vlad Ivanov 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.010
 all the best
