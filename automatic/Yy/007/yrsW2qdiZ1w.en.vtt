00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
In previous episodes....

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.460
Don't let down a classmate

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.740
And I surely will get the money to pay the rent

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.100
Real estates. That's where the money is.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.320
Your father, who was considered dead for the past 10 years, is alive.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.200
I even took pictures

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.960
Taxi! That's where the money is.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.800
..... or porn....

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.460
Ich habe Ihre pizza gebracht

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.680
He unzipped his pants, pulled it out and it was all pum-ped up...

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.540
Do I speak German or Czech????

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.280
I have been saying it all the time. The money is in taxi driving.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.440
Hey...... can I use your car?

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.100
The hotdog vendor is having an affair with the blonde librarian

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.380
And why are you telling me this?!

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.700
Spying on just one person is really boring.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.880
I even took pictures

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.720
The Taxi driver

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.900
I will pay you back this week. I promise.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.700
I sold a lawn mower, for 200$, you know...

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.180
But you do not have any lawn mower

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.800
And mine is well hidden

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.740
The neighbour left his one outside........overnight

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.040
You kidding me??

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.703
Really! What a jerk, right?

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.020
You can't just steal his lawn mower........ you have to return it.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.540
Done.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.340
Pardon?

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.080
He is the guy I sold it to.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:01.920
I painted it so it looks like the tiny German tanks you fool with every weekend and told him its German import.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.490
Oh, so now it looks like Wehrmacht tank.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.160
Where what?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.140
Go see for yourself. He is currently mowing the old Polish guy's lawn. He is riding through the garden like if it was his own.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.620
Dude..... it is the guy who wanted me to pick him up at the bank. He was wearing a mask, so I assumed they have a costume party....

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.400
..... and then I had to testify at the police station............ what could he want?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.300
I bet there is a costume party somewhere. Or he needs to get a bag full of costumes across borders.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.380
The best taxi in town, hello......... if this hears the trade office, you surely just misunderstood what I said

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.080
Hi there, rockafella, Kropáček here. I need a little favor... You think you could "take care of" lil Pete?

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.180
And when do you want me to take care of him? I need to work this evening.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.660
Well, obviously, you take care of him when you have the time.... see ya!

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.560
He wants me to babysit some child.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.800
Hi there, they will bring lil Pete in a minute. They took him for a walk, to see if he starts talking.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.880
Starts talking? Oh, he does not talk yet. I know this type.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.520
I must admit I like you, man.

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:24.972
What the hell is the sheet for?!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.060
So I don't mess my car.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.160
You want to take care of him here??

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.920
Of course, there is no time to do it somewhere home.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.500
But you understand there is no need to teach him a lesson. Just take care of him.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.820
Sure, sure, no teaching. I won't mess with the way you bring him up.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.200
Hmmm... we sealed his mout shut

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:50.520
Sealed his mouth? Why??!! If he is calm, then its ok and if he screams, I put this in his mouth.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.340
Of course he will scream. They always do.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.840
If you take care properly, the don't. Or if someone they know very well takes care of them.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.280
If a brother takes care of his sister, that is always totally smooth.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.760
I've never heard in my life that a brother would take care of his sister.

00:04:07.736 --> 00:04:10.056
And what are the teddy bears for??!!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.060
When I take care of someone... and it takes some time..... they start to feel sad....

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.780
... so I give them these.....and its fine....

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.640
Oh, there they come.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.140
Come take him over.

00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:36.437
What the hell is that?!?!?!

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.360
Lil Pete. You could guess why such nickname.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.880
You get the money, when he's taken care of

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.980
To be continued.....
