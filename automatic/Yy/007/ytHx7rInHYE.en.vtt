 valuable what was going to complicate the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 road facing the World Cup in the first 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.399
 ball but before finishing the first 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.800
 Costa Rica weather was going to cut the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.519
 distance an accurate header Alvaro 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.079
 flavor muffled the rommel fernandez 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.819
 in the second time the Ticos took 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.530

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.210
 to score the second goal goal that 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.970
 local would be superior from 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.430
 beginning to end the first time 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.909
 to go for the second goal the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.430
 midfielder celso borges would be the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.220
 in charge of marking the definitive 2 by 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.890
 0 in this way costa rica- assured
