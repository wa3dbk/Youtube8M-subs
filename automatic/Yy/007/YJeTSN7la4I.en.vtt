P is you've got to be able to unwind the
roll<00:01:02.289> of<00:01:02.320> bread<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:03.850> once<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.449> bread<00:01:04.750> is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
roll of bread and then once the bread is

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.960 
roll of bread and then once the bread is
on<00:01:05.199> one<00:01:05.530> will<00:01:06.490> roll<00:01:06.789> it<00:01:06.910> out<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:08.229> we<00:01:08.470> cheese

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on one will roll it out don't we cheese

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.290 
on one will roll it out don't we cheese
gather<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.060> back<00:01:10.300> up<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:11.080> bacon<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:13.030> we<00:01:13.119> get

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
gather the back up and bacon so we get

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.039 
gather the back up and bacon so we get
going<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.690> that<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.090> trick<00:01:16.390> now<00:01:16.420> is<00:01:16.630> to

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
going on that so the trick now is to

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.980 
going on that so the trick now is to
carefully<00:01:17.770> unwind<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.880> bread<00:01:19.119> without

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
carefully unwind the bread without

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
carefully unwind the bread without
unduly<00:01:20.470> damaging<00:01:21.159> lead<00:01:21.369> to<00:01:21.970> do<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.990> I'm<00:01:23.200> using

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
unduly damaging lead to do and I'm using

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.179 
unduly damaging lead to do and I'm using
some<00:01:24.610> flour<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.330> lightweight<00:01:25.890> flour<00:01:26.890> the

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
some flour to lightweight flour the

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.820 
some flour to lightweight flour the
dough<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:28.090> then<00:01:28.119> begin<00:01:29.110> pulling<00:01:29.530> apart

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
dough and then begin pulling apart

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:41.260 
dough and then begin pulling apart
gently<00:01:30.930> hopefully<00:01:31.930> will<00:01:32.110> come<00:01:32.290> apart

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.999 

as<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.049> see<00:01:42.229> now<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:42.530> beginning<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.890> come

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
as you see now it's beginning to come

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.639 
as you see now it's beginning to come
apart<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:44.509> flower<00:01:44.780> acts<00:01:45.679> as<00:01:46.130> a<00:01:46.420> as<00:01:47.439> an<00:01:48.439> aid

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
apart and the flower acts as a as an aid

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.880 
apart and the flower acts as a as an aid
in<00:01:49.600> keeping<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.659> flower<00:01:50.990> from<00:01:51.289> committing

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
in keeping the flower from committing

in keeping the flower from committing
and<00:01:52.250> keeping<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.759> dough<00:01:52.909> from<00:01:52.939> being<00:01:53.360> too

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
and keeping the dough from being too

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.580 
and keeping the dough from being too
sticky<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:56.030> just<00:01:56.390> gently<00:01:56.840> work<00:01:57.200> your<00:01:57.409> way

around you can see it's beginning to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.020 
around you can see it's beginning to
come<00:02:01.939> apart

worth doing it's a big time saver to use
this<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> dough

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420 

it's<00:02:43.990> got<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.320> stick<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.710> go<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.100> sometimes

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it's got to be stick to go and sometimes

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's got to be stick to go and sometimes
it<00:02:45.580> gets<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.000> difficult<00:02:46.540> to<00:02:46.600> unroll<00:02:46.960> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it gets a little difficult to unroll it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.150 
it gets a little difficult to unroll it
that<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.030> will<00:02:49.240> unroll<00:02:49.740> give<00:02:50.740> me<00:02:50.920> enough<00:02:51.130> time

that it will unroll give me enough time

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.870 
that it will unroll give me enough time
and<00:02:51.700> patience<00:02:52.210> it<00:02:52.480> will<00:02:52.860> come<00:02:53.860> apart<00:02:54.220> patch

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
and patience it will come apart patch
