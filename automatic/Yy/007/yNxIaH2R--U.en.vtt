00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello everyone on visual since this is 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.080
 a new video with more information 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:10.020
 halo 4 and good then this time 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.020
 according to a small video clip of 14 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.099
 seconds where we see a shot in 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 lasers leave that is is let's say also 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.119
 a small moment in which the 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.369
 sniper but good as much 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 important is how I've told you the use of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.800
 laser spartan and well then now we 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800
 we see 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.040
 and well, as you will have seen 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.290
 listening to the sound of the spartan 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.320
 when you shoot him, the sound of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.920
 charge and the sound of final shots is 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.970
 tremendous is brutal I love 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.640
 Well, I'm going to do a little 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.340
 good analysis here we have a one 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.230
 picture of 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.390
 while the laser is firing 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.810
 Sparta and we see how up on the right 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.720
 in him 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.400
 we see how is 50% and how we have 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.510
 seen in the video how to understand shoots 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.670
 of state to 75%, that is, the 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.050
 Percentage system of leaving ritz in 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.820
 the what 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.610
 it was discounting each time 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.280
 25% fired ammunition of 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.340
 the spartal and we also see the peephole 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.530
 which is quite similar to halo 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.200
 reach although this one has more more ornaments 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.850
 it's more season and how can you also 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.070
 have seen in the video come back in the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.490
 classic arrows that when they reach the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.320
 same point later is when it shoots in 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.600
 the is discarded 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.930
 and well, here you have in the venues 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.480
 are missing zooming in and well we see what 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.610
 that the look is square that is 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.110
 pretty cool they also have more or 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.350
 less everything is the same design of the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.050
 measures with that that background makes a shield 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.570
 and then look at the weapon with that 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.060
 shaded blue at the edges but it's 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.399
 pretty cool we see that when done 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.869
 with the weapon we see quite the cat of the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.270
 left of the right that I guess 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.420
 they will only be ornament I do not think 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.570
 have any function while we do 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.300
 zoom but we see that below that of the 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.230
 reticle laser sight glass Esparta 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.810
 we see two species of bars 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.860
 semicircular a quarter circle 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.980
 we see how the one on the left is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.470
 It's full like this 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.450
 I would say that this is the bar of the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.030
 ammunition that we have this ammo 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.450
 have lasers leave with when 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.310
 are you pointing with the zoom and how 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.200
 we can see it on the right here still 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.920
 has not fired and is 75 percent 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.110
 that is to say that the bar is not 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.269
 is almost full and that evolution 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.799
 be 75 percent 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.319
 surely that after he has 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.409
 fired where you are playing in the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.209
 bar is in half we want is 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.950
 that also as I said before 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.129
 arrows that are already coming together in the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.870
 he was studying to shoot but he has 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.489
 been a video a pretty short video 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.739
 and well, visit our meeting 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:25.260
 favorites and who distributes it deserves it and 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.260
 subscribe for more goodbye
