00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.300
 I have four or three cups of water 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.730
 kick loud to mix for the color behind 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.760
 you can have many color often as you like me 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.500
 I wanted glitter and some stars around it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.059
 effect 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.250
 First mix the water in the colors we 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.539
 each other until you are satisfied 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.369
 you can use dye for this 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:06.229
 watercolor acrylic paint and can do it you want 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.909
 if you mixed the color app 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.990
 he first fill a layer with the 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.430
 wimps and just try to think of it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 They wad them nice because it was 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.909
 less so I do my first clio and 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.580
 slowly add it should not be too 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.920
 we just get wet that it gets through well 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.610
 and by the color is now I have dressed up 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.380
 as with 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.350
 wooden pot also a little flash on the side 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.369

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.100
 clear time and the second layer to 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.780
 and so donwan all colors 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.670
 and push all the flashes on the side 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 second color on top 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.100
 every little scales with water until it 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.690
 all morning anyway so I think 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.490
 and here is a jar filled I have there 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.229
 namely a bit done above them 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.789
 with the jar closed 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.710
 and here is my end result i find 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.299

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.490

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.110
 I succeeded in the water myself 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.490

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.659
