guess<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.729> people<00:04:48.789> who<00:04:49.060> don't<00:04:49.180> understand

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
guess for people who don't understand

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.810 
guess for people who don't understand
you<00:04:49.870> are<00:04:49.900> competitors<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.740> are<00:04:50.919> athletes<00:04:51.610> how

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
you are competitors you are athletes how

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.339 
you are competitors you are athletes how
can<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.090> not<00:04:52.210> care<00:04:52.270> about<00:04:52.539> your<00:04:52.900> placement

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
can you not care about your placement

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.230 
can you not care about your placement
well<00:04:54.130> I<00:04:54.159> think<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.460> has<00:04:54.580> gotten<00:04:54.849> to<00:04:54.909> the<00:04:55.000> point

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
well I think it has gotten to the point

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.180 
well I think it has gotten to the point
where<00:04:55.449> at<00:04:56.020> placement<00:04:56.680> doesn't<00:04:56.949> matter<00:04:57.099> i

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
where at placement doesn't matter i

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.860 
where at placement doesn't matter i
think<00:04:57.490> being<00:04:57.729> like<00:04:57.940> but<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> public<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.659> more

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
think being like but a public is more

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.990 
think being like but a public is more
important<00:04:59.380> because<00:04:59.560> placement<00:05:00.280> in<00:05:00.520> the<00:05:00.789> long

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
important because placement in the long

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.730 
important because placement in the long
run<00:05:01.030> really<00:05:01.510> doesn't<00:05:02.199> give<00:05:02.289> anything<00:05:02.530> if

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
run really doesn't give anything if

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.899 
run really doesn't give anything if
you're<00:05:02.830> not<00:05:02.919> liked<00:05:03.130> by<00:05:03.159> the<00:05:03.340> public<00:05:03.760> what
