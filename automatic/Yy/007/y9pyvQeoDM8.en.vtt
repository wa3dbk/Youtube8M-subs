00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.230
 some 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 but 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.710
 it is everyone's room colleagues 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.170
 202 15.15 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.220
 I hope that my friends and nickel 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.650
 lions come together for a whole 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.460
 little video story to put some 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.330
 little things clear because 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.910
 recently 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.880
 as you will surely have seen it 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.500
 turns out that we have a little less activity 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.030
 on our channel and this is due to already 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.350
 I found a new job 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.650
 it was besides I already made myself 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.879
 recognize on the job when I of 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.220
 job not subscribers is enough 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.680
 Funny I will tell more 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.780
 next time and what makes that 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.180
 I have pretty chelous schedules over at 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.440
 settat all that is what makes that with 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.690
 my brother do not really have time anymore 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.310
 to comment both of them so here's to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.270
 iron is better friends as per 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.500
 elsewhere today there I present you 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.390
 a small gameplay commented by myself 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.810
 I barely make out there to 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.670
 a few minutes it's still in a 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.100
 hardly more than 100 seconds so a little 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.970
 more than a minute and forty so that's 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.960
 to tell you that even like that I 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.560
 keep playing and still going out 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.300
 gameplay 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.310
 I always think of you people do not 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.780
