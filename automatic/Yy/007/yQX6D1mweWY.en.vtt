00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.740
 hello friends I remember somehow 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.320
 repainted this epiphone 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.539
 with the same hurry if not look in 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.090
 description there is a link to the video build 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.400
 and in the pictures of the painting process I 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.680
 changed the factory polyester coating on 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.660
 nitrolac thin and matt after which 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.119
 Guitar better start to vibrate it 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.460
 it felt like a belly and became brighter 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.440
 sound but the host didn't stop at 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.840
 achieved and continues to further improve 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.539
 his favorite and wanted to install on 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.750
 her new Russian pickups 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:46.730
 production and rb naturally replace 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.290
 I made the pickups and therefore 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.140
 for you decided to write a small 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.899
 Comparative bridge drain test humbucker 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.450
 stage background and new bradshaw humbucker 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.120
 from airbnb puncher let's hear 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.120
 how big is the difference and is it 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.939
 generally running ahead I will say that the difference 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.829
 there is and tangible enough and that 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.479
 feel you need to listen to the recording 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.969
 sturdy headphones either 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.100
 quality monitor speakers immediately 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:15.020
 i will say that there were very few records 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.649
 time since the guitar needed 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.200
 give away 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.869
 so everything was written first double not 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.109
 judge strictly for execution let's 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.109
 listen 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.410
