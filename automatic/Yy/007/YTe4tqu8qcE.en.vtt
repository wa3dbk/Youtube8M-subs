00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.429
 hello andrew koftun welcome 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.080
 you heading contests 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.030
 I think our regular viewers and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.289
 readers remember our first contest for 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.060
 our editor is not going to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.520
 stop there and here we are 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 decided to hold a second more serious 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 competition rather we will hold three at once 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.010
 competition and there will be three winners 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
 each of these contests will have its own 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.429
 rules and families will be generally different then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.289
 there is this time we hope that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.880
 dissatisfied participants will not be here 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 there will be no ball present and 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 creativity and effort but generally I won't 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 torment you and begin to meet with the first 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.550
