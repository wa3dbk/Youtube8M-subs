00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello I am christine we saw 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 a beauty institute and we do 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.490
 various services including the care of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 face I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.009
 now 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.680
 we often talk about facial care as 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.020
 a care only made to moisturize 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.960
 to take care of our small wrinkles 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 but it's also a moment of relaxation and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.550
 of happiness once the make-up removal 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.920
 was done we start a little bit 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 looked at the skin the different areas 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.099
 who are more to be treated where needed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.260
 insist 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.570
 often it's true that the parties 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 facial medians are more marked by 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.379
 what we are tired 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.469
 so we start with hydrating 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.510
 mostly the front and under the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.180
 eyes of course we proceed 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 also to a good scrub so 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.489
 prepare the skin to receive the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.579
 different moisturizing creams but 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.059
 especially remove the small dead skin 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:04.320
 and then so before putting on the mask 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.240
 prepare the skin to receive 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.939
 active ingredients that are in this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 mask once the mask poses a small 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.560
 moment obviously we remove this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 famous mask and we reproached a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 massage to remove the different 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.830
 residues and finish to hydrate and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 to bring relaxation and then there is 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.119
 also this little care that is moderately 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.979
 again we will tell the currents 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.079
 galvanic which is done using a 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.600
 small device that is knitted on the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 face and on the areas a little bit 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.439
 more at risk the lion's wrinkles forehead 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 and who dredges deeply and who gives 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.520
 a real stroke of brilliance and beauty 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.500
 for a few days and that allows 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.689
 also makeup to better hold 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.270
 now you know how is going on 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.130
 a facial is the facial care 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.310
 classic with scrubs 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.799
 hydration the masks either or also 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 care for galvanic currents so this 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 little magic device that gives a real 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.829
 etc. the beauty and that can besides be 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.829
 do besides the classic care
