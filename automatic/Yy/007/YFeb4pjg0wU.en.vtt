00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 do not 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.710
 do not 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.560
 suleman eros and its ways that the 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.740
 I dream sorianos commenting and we are with 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.970
 the clover that helped me make this great 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.189
 trick though he had to do it twice 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.890
 before but the fucking hard catch does not 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.000
 it came out I have half damage and in this 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.920
 trick we have to do it first what 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.540
 first very first is to buy a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.650
 bicycle is here that is two thousand 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.900
 dollars is worth we bought the sop be the 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.700
 fender 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.980
 ok and after that what we have to 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.840
 to do is to take the car that we want to 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.480
 so to say double it's worth because this 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.430
 Trick tries to duplicate a car and 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.020
 then sell it worth is how to cheat 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.960
 the machine and he has to get out of 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.850
 garage is worth it and that our partner in 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.730
 Here I've said before I entered 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.140
 postpone a c4 exactly where 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.180
 let's go out with the car worth we look 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.040
 of this pointing has to be polished 4 the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.450
 plowed by the c4 what happens that is not seen 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.430
 I do not know what happened that afternoon with 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 we were recording that the game was 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.060
 like google a little bit then it's worth 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.430
 what we have to do 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.570
 inside and now we go to hours when it 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.660
 does the trick okay now we have to 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.119
 cheat san andreas gta inside it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.430
 that sometimes you go to these 5 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.220
 we cheat we take the bikes and when 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.890
 our colleagues get out of the garage 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.979
 they can exploit that 4 killing worth half 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.500
 that is dead and right now is 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.570
 doing the trick is very important that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 when we sew our best car comes out 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.330
 What does our friend have to do? 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.619
 car and that death quote is worth not 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.900
 be there so I have not thrown the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.490
 car of a player car out 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.230
 they are very important we had to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.700
 do two or three times because no 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.290
 we knew what this trick really was like 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.850
 then we found out what it was that 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.620
 I had to give an appointment and I do not know 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.390
 I could for the car then what 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.110
 we do is take a car to the saints 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.360
 just and sell it really gives little 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.520
 money because it 's a rifle to little 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.520
 I do not have a maximum either, nothing is worth 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 you have brick kilns or to be observed 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 more money now give me 87 thousand here what 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.110
 you are seeing on screen 87 thousand 487 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.760
 it's good to see he has a rifle to see 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.830
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.380
 sell it and now we would have to call the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.240
 mechanical here I'm recording it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.520
 we call mechanic because it brings us the 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.580
 rifle to then I had another one 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.959
 duplicate then that we do not have to 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.640
 ask first if we have a car and 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.740
 the rejoin whatever I have to ask 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.510
 first ok here we're going to put that in 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.150
 other mechanics we already have this car 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 that the trick is done now 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.380
 I made sure that take it home 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.200
 because I say it is not going to be that this one is 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.450
 the one that I had before what 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.180
 that already has duplicate and then I say 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.830
 I'm going to the garage so yes to see if 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 I have to stop with a rifle to see 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.800
 I wanted to have this before that is debut and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.920
 the one that depended so the trick is already 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.269
 done and you do not know is the trick done well 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.060
 that there are system favorites and 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.060
 use of the astrologer kids
