00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.870
 I had several teachers but there 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.760
 which oriented me more so it's cherabi 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.010

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650

 the great iron specialist and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.540
 foundations

 so he brought me a lot in this 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.219
 area there but I had other 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.789
 blame especially master pain 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.190
 but we had a training that allowed 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:44.130
 to have an opening because we had 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.720
 teachers a little bit everywhere 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.310

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.420
 different methods et cetera so we have 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.149
 had 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.820
 so I had teachers from whom 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.300
 come Egypt as a great scholar 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.560

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.909
 Egyptians of international renown 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:09.369
 although he did not know 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.690
 it's a lot of young people 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.600
 who believe that Russian scholars and 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.369
 only those who are known to on the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.460
 parable is that as she says himself 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.470
 it's really one of the biggest 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.840
 scholars a person who has me the most 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.670
 amazed astonished and so nothing is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.140
 really one then two years and then from 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.869

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.610
 to another consultant his rips to 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.909
 rats that is of Algerian origin but 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.869
 who live in egypt who's called mom 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.009
 slimani so also a very great scholar 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.670
 especially in everything that is of what 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.159
 call for artillery fication 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.850
 old books and serves in the east too 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.159
 as a Chernobyl professor admitted kyi 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.829
 and the former minister of business 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.630
 Tunisian nuns so he has us 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:04.630
 taught the purposes of sharia I 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.860
 also as a moussa chÃ©rif professor who 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 is known 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.460
 in the spans and other scholars 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.130
 so of course but djaballah and and 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.020
 else and Saudi professors have 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.870
 if I had Saudi professors 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.450
 sheikh mossa women in redon who is 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.250

 scheer mauritania who is professor 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 adrian so that's why I 'm telling you 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.310
 is a little bit of 2 to of course moussa 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.090

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.680

 literalist and so on and elsewhere 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.200
 they even suffer in their own in 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.660
 their own country 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.160
 so that's in relation to some of my 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.160
 teachers like me preserve them 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:17.069
