that<00:01:29.570> out<00:01:29.920> but<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:32.230> probably<00:01:33.230> should<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.560> got

going about 30 minutes ago but hopefully

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.750 
going about 30 minutes ago but hopefully
it<00:01:37.340> all<00:01:37.400> work<00:01:37.670> out<00:01:37.790> okay<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:39.440> I'll

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.070
