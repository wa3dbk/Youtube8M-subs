00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
regular guitar you'll see the bass

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.110 
regular guitar you'll see the bass
guitar<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.020> longer<00:02:00.680> and<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.220> fret<00:02:01.460> spacing<00:02:02.030> in

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
guitar is longer and the fret spacing in

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.570 
guitar is longer and the fret spacing in

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
between the frets is longer as well so

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.610 
between the frets is longer as well so
physics<00:02:04.970> dictates<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:06.110> order<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.410> have<00:02:06.590> a

physics dictates that in order to have a
lower<00:02:06.950> tone<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.390> need<00:02:08.570> both<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.899> thicker<00:02:09.200> gauge

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
lower tone you need both a thicker gauge

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.790 
lower tone you need both a thicker gauge
string<00:02:10.100> more<00:02:10.670> diameter<00:02:11.270> as<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:12.080> as<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> longer
