and that first thing is the antenna for
some<00:01:03.770> reason<00:01:04.220> recently<00:01:04.790> this<00:01:05.090> antenna<00:01:05.450> has

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
some reason recently this antenna has

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.990 
some reason recently this antenna has
become<00:01:06.230> so<00:01:06.650> very<00:01:06.920> weak<00:01:07.130> we're<00:01:07.670> going<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.850> put

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000
