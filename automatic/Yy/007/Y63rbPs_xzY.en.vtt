00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.320 

so<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:02.310> Western<00:00:02.879> Digital<00:00:03.060> caviar

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
so this is a Western Digital caviar

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.259 
so this is a Western Digital caviar
green<00:00:04.200> series<00:00:04.770> drive<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.359> why<00:00:06.629> they<00:00:06.870> suck

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
green series drive this is why they suck

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.390 
green series drive this is why they suck
so<00:00:09.269> you'll<00:00:09.960> notice<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.530> way<00:00:10.620> that's<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.309> way

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
so you'll notice the way that's the way

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820 
so you'll notice the way that's the way
that<00:00:11.550> it's<00:00:11.700> parked<00:00:12.150> here<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.290> of<00:00:13.410> course<00:00:13.650> my

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that it's parked here and of course my

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.910 
that it's parked here and of course my
wall<00:00:14.070> art<00:00:14.309> reflects<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> really<00:00:15.389> nicely

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
wall art reflects in it really nicely

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.210 
wall art reflects in it really nicely
cool<00:00:16.920> right<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:18.029> way<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.449> parks<00:00:19.220> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
cool right the way that it parks the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340 
cool right the way that it parks the
heads<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.820> parked<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.660> little<00:00:21.960> bitty

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
heads get parked on this little bitty

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.179 
heads get parked on this little bitty
ramp<00:00:22.920> structure<00:00:23.730> over<00:00:24.060> here<00:00:24.920> turn<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
ramp structure over here turn on the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.269 
ramp structure over here turn on the
light<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.830> that<00:00:28.830> prevents

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
light so you can see it that prevents

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.150 
light so you can see it that prevents
stiction<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.230> impact<00:00:31.230> damage<00:00:31.560> among<00:00:32.009> other

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
stiction and impact damage among other

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.370 
stiction and impact damage among other
things<00:00:32.899> the<00:00:33.899> problem<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.530> these<00:00:34.710> drives<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
things the problem with these drives is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.750 
things the problem with these drives is
they<00:00:37.380> park<00:00:37.770> too<00:00:38.129> much<00:00:39.800> let's<00:00:40.800> spin<00:00:41.280> up<00:00:41.460> here

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
they park too much let's spin up here

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.970 
they park too much let's spin up here
and<00:00:41.910> see<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.300> still<00:00:42.600> runs<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:48.860> guess<00:00:49.860> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and see if it still runs I guess it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:01:00.660 
and see if it still runs I guess it
hates<00:00:50.190> life<00:00:50.430> now

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.530 

now<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.910> was<00:01:02.120> working<00:01:02.600> before<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:07.540> problem

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
now it was working before the problem

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.320 
now it was working before the problem
inherent<00:01:09.050> in<00:01:09.170> these<00:01:09.320> drives<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.210> they

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
inherent in these drives is that they

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.530 
inherent in these drives is that they
constantly<00:01:11.990> parked<00:01:12.530> ahead<00:01:12.940> about<00:01:13.940> every<00:01:14.300> five

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
constantly parked ahead about every five

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.160 
constantly parked ahead about every five
seconds<00:01:15.140> if<00:01:15.290> they're<00:01:15.500> not<00:01:15.710> being<00:01:15.979> accessed

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
seconds if they're not being accessed

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.230 
seconds if they're not being accessed
now<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.380> little<00:01:18.530> ramp<00:01:18.890> mechanism<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:19.940> keeps

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
now that little ramp mechanism it keeps

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.140 
now that little ramp mechanism it keeps
scraping<00:01:21.080> the<00:01:21.200> head<00:01:21.380> on<00:01:21.590> and<00:01:21.830> off<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.150> will

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
scraping the head on and off of will

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.499 
scraping the head on and off of will
eventually<00:01:23.720> wear<00:01:23.900> out<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.150> here<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.300> can

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
eventually wear out and here you can

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.890 
eventually wear out and here you can
actually<00:01:26.720> see<00:01:27.970> see<00:01:28.970> if<00:01:29.060> it'll<00:01:29.180> focus<00:01:29.720> this

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
actually see see if it'll focus this

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.300 
actually see see if it'll focus this
close<00:01:30.940> there's<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:32.060> small<00:01:32.570> divot<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.530> ramp

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
close there's a small divot in the ramp

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.279 
close there's a small divot in the ramp
you<00:01:35.350> see<00:01:36.350> it<00:01:36.440> right<00:01:36.590> there<00:01:36.619> near<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> edge

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
you see it right there near the edge

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:53.820 
you see it right there near the edge
you're<00:01:39.289> going<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.500> get<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.649> better<00:01:39.800> angle

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.800 

and<00:01:54.490> I<00:01:54.580> guess<00:01:54.730> is<00:01:54.910> just<00:01:55.150> not<00:01:55.300> willing<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.660> be

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
and I guess is just not willing to be

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.220 
and I guess is just not willing to be
photographed<00:01:57.300> but<00:01:58.300> where<00:01:58.480> that<00:01:58.630> little<00:01:58.930> divot

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
photographed but where that little divot

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.730 
photographed but where that little divot
is<00:01:59.820> every<00:02:00.820> time<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.240> hits<00:02:01.510> it's<00:02:01.900> gonna<00:02:02.080> pick<00:02:02.440> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
is every time it hits it's gonna pick a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.180 
is every time it hits it's gonna pick a
piece<00:02:02.950> of<00:02:03.130> plastic<00:02:03.640> off<00:02:03.850> I<00:02:04.650> can<00:02:05.650> even<00:02:05.770> hear<00:02:06.130> it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
piece of plastic off I can even hear it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:29.150 
piece of plastic off I can even hear it
hop<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.000> off<00:02:07.090> of<00:02:07.120> that<00:02:07.420> thing

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.310 

but<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.910> little<00:02:30.030> those<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:31.020> bits<00:02:31.170> of

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
but that little those little bits of

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.500 
but that little those little bits of
plastic<00:02:31.530> are<00:02:32.190> getting<00:02:32.520> circulated<00:02:33.240> around

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
plastic are getting circulated around

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.740 
plastic are getting circulated around
then<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.840> drive<00:02:35.000> likely<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.120> cause<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.360> head

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
then the drive likely to cause a head

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.110 
then the drive likely to cause a head
crash<00:02:37.520> this<00:02:38.520> small<00:02:38.970> air<00:02:39.270> filter<00:02:39.870> here<00:02:41.120> might

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
crash this small air filter here might

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
crash this small air filter here might
have<00:02:42.300> caught<00:02:42.600> some<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:42.960> them<00:02:45.050> hard<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.200> say

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
have caught some of them hard to say

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.130 
have caught some of them hard to say
really

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.360 

but<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> problem<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.770> will<00:02:52.860> eventually

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
but the problem that will eventually

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.240 
but the problem that will eventually
occur<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.840> ramp<00:02:55.230> mechanism<00:02:55.890> will<00:02:56.070> wear

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
occur is that ramp mechanism will wear

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.830 
occur is that ramp mechanism will wear
out<00:02:57.770> it'll<00:02:58.770> kick<00:02:59.310> at<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.490> head<00:02:59.820> drive<00:03:00.630> it<00:03:00.780> out

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
out it'll kick at the head drive it out

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.380 
out it'll kick at the head drive it out
of<00:03:00.990> alignment<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.830> then<00:03:02.430> very<00:03:02.700> suddenly<00:03:03.210> an

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
of alignment and then very suddenly an

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.980 
of alignment and then very suddenly an
entire<00:03:03.750> platter<00:03:04.200> will<00:03:04.530> become<00:03:04.830> unreadable

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
entire platter will become unreadable

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:15.230 
entire platter will become unreadable
wonderful<00:03:06.990> design<00:03:07.350> right<00:03:10.340> hate<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:13.850> avoid<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
wonderful design right hate it avoid the
