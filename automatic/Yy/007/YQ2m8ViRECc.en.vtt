00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
around a bit like so and then just will

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
around a bit like so and then just will
probably<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> couple<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> minutes

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
probably take a couple of minutes

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
probably take a couple of minutes
because<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:19.530> bad<00:01:19.740> scratch

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
because this is a pretty bad scratch

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.010 
because this is a pretty bad scratch
light<00:01:20.520> scratches<00:01:21.030> only<00:01:21.330> take<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> little<00:01:21.689> while

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
light scratches only take a little while

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.290 
light scratches only take a little while
but<00:01:22.740> being<00:01:22.979> such<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> bad<00:01:23.549> rat

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
but being such a bad rat

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.469 
but being such a bad rat
prototype<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> few<00:01:25.470> minutes

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
prototype of few minutes

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.940 
prototype of few minutes
you<00:01:27.900> know<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.140> got<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.439> concentrate<00:01:28.710> on

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
you know I'm just got to concentrate on

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.070 
you know I'm just got to concentrate on
one<00:01:29.250> area<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.729> distraction<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.570> move<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
one area of distraction will move that

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.929 
one area of distraction will move that
so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.710> see<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> actually<00:01:32.250> works

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
so you can see that it actually works

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.700 
so you can see that it actually works
and<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> switching<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> disk<00:01:34.500> up
