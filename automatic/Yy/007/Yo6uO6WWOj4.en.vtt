00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.049 

all<00:00:48.980> right<00:00:49.220> so<00:00:49.370> here<00:00:49.550> we<00:00:49.579> are<00:00:49.670> in<00:00:49.850> Pro<00:00:50.030> Tools

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
all right so here we are in Pro Tools

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.610 
all right so here we are in Pro Tools
and<00:00:50.540> we're<00:00:50.660> looking<00:00:50.840> at<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> eleven<00:00:51.470> rack

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
and we're looking at the eleven rack

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.560 
and we're looking at the eleven rack
control<00:00:52.100> window<00:00:52.430> you<00:00:52.850> can<00:00:53.000> see<00:00:53.150> that<00:00:53.300> all<00:00:53.420> the

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
control window you can see that all the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.330 
control window you can see that all the
devices<00:00:53.809> we<00:00:54.110> currently<00:00:54.320> have<00:00:54.650> loaded<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.250> the

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
devices we currently have loaded in the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.760 
devices we currently have loaded in the
eleven<00:00:55.640> rack<00:00:55.760> are<00:00:56.000> showing<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.540> a<00:00:57.470> signal

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
eleven rack are showing in a signal

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.380 
eleven rack are showing in a signal
chain<00:00:57.949> there<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.370> we<00:00:58.790> can<00:00:58.940> change<00:00:59.150> those

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
chain there and we can change those

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.939 
chain there and we can change those
things<00:00:59.449> I<00:00:59.930> don't<00:00:59.989> have<00:01:00.320> time<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.739> show<00:01:00.890> you

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
things I don't have time to show you

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.950 
things I don't have time to show you
everything<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.030> figured<00:01:02.329> maybe<00:01:02.449> what<00:01:02.660> we<00:01:02.750> do

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
everything so I figured maybe what we do

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.930 
everything so I figured maybe what we do
is<00:01:03.260> try<00:01:03.500> to<00:01:03.530> build<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:04.129> tone<00:01:04.400> I'll<00:01:04.670> show<00:01:04.879> you

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
is try to build a tone I'll show you

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.060 
is try to build a tone I'll show you
some<00:01:05.210> things<00:01:05.239> but<00:01:05.690> we'll<00:01:06.080> try<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.290> go<00:01:06.500> for<00:01:06.860> an

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
some things but we'll try to go for an

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.940 
some things but we'll try to go for an
idea<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.940> tone<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:08.810> here<00:01:09.470> we<00:01:09.560> have<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.770> amp

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
idea of a tone so here we have the amp

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.070 
idea of a tone so here we have the amp
section<00:01:10.460> there<00:01:10.729> are<00:01:10.759> a<00:01:10.910> number<00:01:11.570> of<00:01:11.750> different

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
section there are a number of different

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.840 
section there are a number of different
amps<00:01:12.350> inside<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.860> eleven<00:01:13.130> rack<00:01:13.280> there<00:01:13.729> are

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
amps inside of eleven rack there are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.430 
amps inside of eleven rack there are
some<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:14.509> most<00:01:14.690> sought-after<00:01:14.930> amps<00:01:15.350> in

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
some of the most sought-after amps in

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.770 
some of the most sought-after amps in
history<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:15.830> fact<00:01:16.150> all<00:01:17.150> sorts<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.600> cool<00:01:17.750> stuff

the first one I figure we look at is a

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.820 
the first one I figure we look at is a
early<00:01:20.990> American<00:01:21.500> tweet<00:01:21.830> amp<00:01:26.710> it's<00:01:27.710> also

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
one of the first amp simulators or

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.690 
one of the first amp simulators or
virtual<00:01:36.649> amps<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.070> can<00:01:37.190> literally<00:01:37.490> use

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
virtual amps that you can literally use

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.010 
virtual amps that you can literally use
the<00:01:37.880> volume<00:01:38.149> knob<00:01:38.300> thing<00:01:38.509> on<00:01:38.630> so<00:01:38.780> it's<00:01:38.899> pretty

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
the volume knob thing on so it's pretty

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.130 
the volume knob thing on so it's pretty
cool<00:01:39.289> let's<00:01:40.160> go<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.369> something<00:01:40.670> like<00:01:40.789> mid<00:01:41.660> 60s

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
cool let's go to something like mid 60s

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.260 
cool let's go to something like mid 60s

English amp it's kind of a nice one
there<00:01:45.070> go<00:01:46.070> turn<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.399> down

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.820 

kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> cool<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:59.100> course<00:01:59.509> one<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
kind of cool and of course one of the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.219 
kind of cool and of course one of the
classic<00:02:01.830> amps<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:03.000> uh<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.990> never<00:02:04.080> been

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
classic amps it's uh it's never been

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:11.390 
classic amps it's uh it's never been
made<00:02:09.410> for<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.530> amp<00:02:10.770> let's<00:02:10.979> switch<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
made for this amp let's switch it to a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400 
made for this amp let's switch it to a
4-12<00:02:11.910> maybe<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.870> about<00:02:13.050> eight

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
4-12 maybe so you have about eight

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.570 
4-12 maybe so you have about eight
different<00:02:14.040> cabinets<00:02:14.489> inside<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.090> eleven<00:02:15.360> rack

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.160 

pretty<00:02:20.580> cool<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.420> also<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> bunch<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pretty cool so you also have a bunch of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.710 
pretty cool so you also have a bunch of
