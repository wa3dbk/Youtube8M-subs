00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
as I know and and started a litigious

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.620 
as I know and and started a litigious
phase<00:04:30.100> which<00:04:31.100> was<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.730> can't<00:04:32.000> put<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.390> story

phase which was you can't put that story

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.220 
phase which was you can't put that story
out<00:04:32.780> about<00:04:33.140> me<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.390> you<00:04:35.390> know<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.930> he<00:04:36.050> wasn't

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
out about me and you know that he wasn't

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
very successful with that either so yeah

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.310 
very successful with that either so yeah
I<00:04:40.370> personally<00:04:41.180> think<00:04:41.390> that<00:04:41.540> Mickey<00:04:42.020> would

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
I personally think that Mickey would

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.400 
I personally think that Mickey would
have<00:04:43.330> told<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.510> that<00:04:44.600> he<00:04:44.810> didn't<00:04:45.110> want<00:04:45.260> this

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
have told you that he didn't want this

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.100 
have told you that he didn't want this
book<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.880> not<00:04:47.120> only<00:04:47.240> needed<00:04:47.630> particularly

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
book and not only needed particularly

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.350 
book and not only needed particularly
this<00:04:48.410> book<00:04:48.680> but<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.610> think<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:49.940> he<00:04:50.150> would<00:04:50.240> have

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
this book but I think that he would have

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.300 
this book but I think that he would have
loved<00:04:50.600> having<00:04:50.840> him<00:04:51.080> he<00:04:51.920> would<00:04:52.040> have<00:04:52.130> loved

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
loved having him he would have loved

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.370 
loved having him he would have loved
having<00:04:52.520> something<00:04:52.880> that<00:04:53.570> he<00:04:53.660> secretly<00:04:53.900> liked

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
having something that he secretly liked

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.550 
having something that he secretly liked
that<00:04:55.190> he<00:04:55.310> could<00:04:55.490> put<00:04:55.700> down<00:04:56.200> you<00:04:57.200> know<00:04:57.320> he

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
that he could put down you know he

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.040 
that he could put down you know he
wanted<00:04:57.860> plausible<00:04:58.430> deniability<00:04:58.760> he<00:04:59.720> said<00:04:59.930> the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
wanted plausible deniability he said the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.730

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
home to die he left a treasure trove of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.760 
home to die he left a treasure trove of
stuff<00:05:10.790> in<00:05:11.000> France<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.600> in<00:05:11.720> other<00:05:11.900> places<00:05:12.110> he

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
stuff in France and in other places he

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.730 
stuff in France and in other places he
could<00:05:12.800> have<00:05:13.070> said<00:05:13.220> burn<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.670> throw<00:05:13.910> it<00:05:13.940> away<00:05:14.740> he

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
could have said burn it throw it away he

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.950 
could have said burn it throw it away he
didn't<00:05:16.040> he<00:05:16.400> left<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.730> evidence<00:05:17.090> to<00:05:17.570> me<00:05:17.720> that

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
didn't he left the evidence to me that

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.200 
didn't he left the evidence to me that
is<00:05:18.110> basically<00:05:18.590> saying<00:05:18.800> go<00:05:19.610> on<00:05:19.760> the<00:05:19.850> gauntlet

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
is basically saying go on the gauntlet

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.380 
is basically saying go on the gauntlet
down<00:05:20.360> and<00:05:21.320> so<00:05:21.620> I<00:05:21.650> did<00:05:21.950> it<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.220> I<00:05:22.730> figure<00:05:23.060> it's

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
down and so I did it and I figure it's

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.300 
down and so I did it and I figure it's
really<00:05:23.660> ironic<00:05:23.780> that<00:05:24.170> a<00:05:24.320> valley<00:05:24.770> surfer

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
really ironic that a valley surfer

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.440 
really ironic that a valley surfer
rovahkis<00:05:25.790> biography<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:28.880> think<00:05:29.150> that<00:05:29.300> he

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
rovahkis biography and I think that he

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.540 
rovahkis biography and I think that he
might<00:05:29.630> have<00:05:29.750> liked<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.350> don't<00:05:30.800> know<00:05:30.950> Chris

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
might have liked it I don't know Chris

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.480 
might have liked it I don't know Chris
