 commercial of the festivities these 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.900
 May is a traditional festival to which 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.689
 we have a very popular festival 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.160
 we are in a phase of the budget 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.740
 we are trying to find resources 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.539
 to program the sign let's say 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.900
 however, all the initiatives that are 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.880
 will be made in May but already e 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.960
 we can say that they will be made of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.030
 things about show 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.140
 entertainment is this important 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 fair this year will have a connotation 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.120
 different the municipality of licata ha 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 purchased 200 stands will be accommodated 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.410
 neatly and elegantly 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.390
 within the historic center 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 we believe we believe this is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.570
 is a very important piece for the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 delicate city then have a 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.219
 available 200 stands and means that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 licata will be able to focus precisely on the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.480
 on the treatment effect of fairs such as 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 you will remember in recent weeks yes 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 was registered on this one aspect 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 position taken by the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 trade fairs had complained about conditions 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.979
 of considerable difficulty to install the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.090
 own exhibitions on stand considered 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.530
 too small 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.659
 as well as for the costs of public land 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 deemed too high 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.189
 the fair will be held from 3 to 6 May 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.470
 the councilor licata d'andrea spoke 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.080
 but a starting point for creating 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 a licata a kind of fairground in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.509
 able to experiment and feed a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 tourism based precisely on the fair 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.710
 certainly ambitious and that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.659
 requires an important network of contacts 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 to be able to be realized in the 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.630
 fairs we could organize it by having 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.130
 this heritage that are the stands e 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.520
 also at other times I have already contacted 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 of the great organizers of fairs between 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.210
 the other of a certain level 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.979
 because we believe that the licata can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.990
 become proud centric in the sense that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.149
 the fair can be a reason 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 attractive from a tourist point of view 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.860
 there are many cities that live point of 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.299
 Fiera Milano is one of the cities that 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 through the fair among the many 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.750
 visitors and lots of tourism 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.490
 here we maybe want fairs a 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.469
 quality theme they can relate to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.869
 food and wine and food or the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.520
 culture and many other things 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 precisely with the available hardships 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.630
 we will try to organize in different 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.570
 moments of the year of the fairs that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.330
 they will be attractive for tourism and 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.120
 so the sector is a segment 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.260
 fair to be valued is a lot 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.610
 important from a point of view 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.080
 attractive to the city can be 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090
 really make lots of things 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.310
 evaluate enhance the territory do 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.630
 territorial marketing and marketing 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.630
 of products and companies
