00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.000
 you answer your vocation in that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.590
 place where you can love totally 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.590
 let yourself be totally loved 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.070
 in 2010 I came from many 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.830
 disappointments at an emotional level 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.790
 in the sense that I had just concluded one 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.470
 7 year history with a boy is now 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.850
 I was 25 years old 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.890
 we thought we were getting married 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.530
 history of our life so when there 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.329
 we realized that 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.150
 that this was not the case remained 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.340
 really disappointed e 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 I thought my life no longer had 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:57.160
 that way there is that the linen road 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:01:01.840
 if it was mine and opened for a while 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.670
 a vice rienzo I thought that that jesus 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.530
 just wanted something from me 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.830
 even more special relationship even more 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.240
 particular noemi wanted all for himself and 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.340
 them truly in love and also mindful 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.850
 of the affective disappointments had before 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:23.350
 there was just that it was so then 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.110
 after a year I thought about entering 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.210
 italy with dense to find start 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.210
 this postulate path 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.710
 of his life and remains the essence remains 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.390
 of term comes to light what you 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.720
 maybe not before he had the courage to 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.890
 to tell you to investigate to call 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.330
 by name of what this experience has 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.050
 had the climax in the march 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.030
 Franciscan who was a journey that 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.470
 it really made me reborn because 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.170
 above all in the effort of a journey 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.370
 ten days of walking has come 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.320
 just afloat are united afloat i 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.960
 deepest desires of my life 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.240
 those who perhaps are really in the grip of 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.320
 disappointments that had been there before was 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.590
 been able to grasp to call for 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.770
 name with courage and honesty instead 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.630
 greeting files of all the masks or that 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.450
 that I wanted to tell you about me that already me 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.580
 I saw a beautiful post-Franciscan Karina 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.170
 23 history a bad go because mine 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.690
 the road was not that but the one I was 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.680
 I was prata I had planned instead 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:43.070
 There was just one final blow to me 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:47.200
 given to understand that maybe it was all 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.200
 a project I was doing myself south 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.810
 this desire to love came to the surface 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.379
 he and everyone but through love 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.750
 detail of a man in a relationship 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:03.519
 affective that really could 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.870
 through which you might like to hear me 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.870
 loved and leave me love 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.340
 and it was shocking upsetting 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.590
 trust this because it is meant to 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:19.060
 re-entering face a sense of 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.859
 bankruptcy and evian I come back 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.650
 compared to the bundles I had made though 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:31.239
 open an abundance that does not 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.530
 I imagined the most beautiful thing that is 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.720
 really happened in this period 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.379
 colors offered I can't remember 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.409
 trepak as performed in the genes is c 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.140
 was that he never let me go to the 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.860
 below a 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.480
 that is, I never touched despair 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.170
 I felt a sense in me 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.049
 profound failure of disappointment of 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.400
 discouragement however you ever have 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:04.170
 a desperation 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.710
 I immediately had the need to 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.100
 recontact my spiritual father and 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.380
 get back into a listening dimension 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.120
 and to compare with someone else why 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.920
 second and that is what I learned in 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.790
 this path that you do not do alone 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.470
 that is, you do not reach certain things by yourself 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.420
 you need someone to do you 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.000
 mirror not that you say what you have to do 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.760
 but that it acts as a mirror for the purposes 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.700
 help to stay inside a will that does not 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:40.660
 it is more or rather that you need in this 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:47.760
 I always had the certainty inside me 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:51.650
 that for him that Jesus was there and that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.300
 whoever loves me must be happy, that is 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.190
 I had my left me he gave me 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.280
 because it is not my work but mine has me 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.500
 left the certainty of a promise of 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.050
 good for my life and that all too 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.650
 what had just happened against the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.030
 rest is good for me because I said if 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.160
 ix20 because I am a Christian 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.010
 that is if at this moment I give up and don't 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.860
 I believe more that you do everything well e 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.880
 that is, I can become any other 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.220
 thing 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.520
 muslim rudisha 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.650
 this thing instead if I put myself one 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.460
 little to the test that is what I say I am 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:31.040
 Christian also in this moment wants 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.980
 say that you are the one you want to write 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.050
 good for me indeed inside these lines a 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.840
 me now they only bring a dolorino 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:43.040
 suffering kidneys then it started off right 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.110
 an incessant prayer because of the course 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.380
 for the purpose of assisi they had mentioned it 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.200
 this is the Serbian prayer of 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.740
 isaac who goes to look for his wife 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760
 for the master to this prayer 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.700
 grant me the grace of a 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.100
 nice meeting and use of kindness towards 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.860
 me that was so much in mind that 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.040
 at the time it was time to 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.960
 re wishing this with certainty 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.390
 prayer entered my days and 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.640
 day after day it was not 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.130
 ask a father incessantly 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.310
 something with the certainty that a father 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:22.110
 when he sees a son who 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:24.780
 incessantly want something and not 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.730
 for selfishness but for a good to put to 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.980
 fruit his life for ours speaks 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:33.380
 to be happy to make someone happy 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.380
 he could not help but listen to them 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.910
 the certainties that were born to me and the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.140
 infections I had were not mine were 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:47.770
 Guided by a hand of someone else I 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:50.910
 I was willing to say yes to Jesus on 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:54.250
 this project on this promise that 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:58.780
 made me go through one 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.880
 special relationship with a man and in the 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.960
 meeting with luca confirmed that this 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.850
 it was not my work 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.550
 that is , I did n't want to meet him 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.920
 I designed this meeting 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.530
 I didn't know him, he wasn't put there 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.870
 right in front of that day it will seem 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:19.780
 so strange then they went home that 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:23.550
 it is that same evening with the intention 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.550
 that could be for me
