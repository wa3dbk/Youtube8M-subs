00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
 It's finally started . 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.990
 Oh, this is right. 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.990
 To figure out the market 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.679
 A roar that is bigger than a soda car 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.480
 U 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.980
 Now that the residents are assured that they can struggle , 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 I did. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.310
 then 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.620
 Sounds like a lie 4 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.380
 5 5 8 3 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.380
 2 toom 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.140
 People are gathered like the prophecies of the people. 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.140
 And I'll call you . 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.260
 It's obvious that you're getting two on the white main door . 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.260
 U 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:06.320
 A lot of it lasts for three minutes a day for ten minutes. 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.150
 The sounds that have been plagued by residents for over a year have clearly flowed out of the white main house 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.100
 I was there. 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:19.869
 When people gathered to eat, they started to sound like lies. 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.869
 Do you think Yoo is deliberately making noise as the residents guess? 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.650
 Help me get some 2 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 In fact, I've actually heard the concept 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.720
 It's loud enough to make you feel better. 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.530
 It seems to be a sound in the Taiwanese house even when listening in the field. 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.060
 I can not hear it . 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 The roar that raided the peaceful evening lasted for three minutes. 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:03.000
 Neighbors gathered in the tide, and the dinner was over. 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:07.350
 Oh yeah, I mean, now that's the window, or the yogurt is broken. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.729
 I'm not going to do this so loud that value to 8 days here in this house 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.729
 Live paddle carrier sliced 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:21.310
 If you use the scientific method, you can see the invisible sound. 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.310
 It means you can find the location where the sound is. 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.250
 At that time, the sound expert came to contact me. 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:36.629
 I found the sound of the sound coming from the white house in the white house. 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:39.959
 I compared the sounds I could hear around me 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:44.060
 Shout what is Right and Elder 2 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.060
 Stagnation in Finding Noise 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:53.140
 It's just getting the mixer working sound . 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.080
 There was more truth that sound experts found 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.280
 4 This is characteristic 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.880
 I'm recording, but it's repeating. 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:10.080
 It's evenly cracked. 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:16.410
 The recording is a continuous sound of mixer operation . 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.780
 So , after recording the sound of the blender, Yoon used the speaker or microphone to deliberately 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.780
 I mean, it's turning louder . 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.709
 Oh, I mean, you're doing so-called terrorism. 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.550
 By the way 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.630
 Big daughter Drinu Xu 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.630
 This coming 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:47.810
 I'm weak in Korea than talking after legal ban 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:53.280
 Sounds like you've heard it. 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:58.590
 It's because we have equipment installed to identify the epicenter. 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.270
 When analyzing the sound recording equipment Now you can know the exact source of the sound 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.160
 It is. 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:08.850
 But it was not just the sound of the camera . 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.920
 At 6 am 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:18.530
 Someone puts out a face through a minute open curtain 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:24.520
 It's a house in the white main house. 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.520
 Soon after, the problem sound will start fourth in her appearance jideoni 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.740
 The sound of the people breaking the noodles of dawn 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:39.919
 I which allowed correct 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:41.509
 3 minute duration sound meomchudeo you release a while back at an angle door yieogan 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.170
 Opens 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:48.530
 As I have come through Yoon 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:54.800
 I wrote the mask as I heard it. 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:57.320
 She was very dry and covered with a pale face mask. 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:05.530
 But something is strange. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.530
 Even though it's your own garden, it looks as though you are in a strange place.
