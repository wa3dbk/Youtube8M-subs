00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 so well since we arrived here 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.319
 still not on the tour then move on to 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.690
 To the cause, so tackle, I think that nothing 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.910
 there is not much new here but 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.969
 for some reason I did not see that and used 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 Oh, I think it's worth it and so the rod 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:22.020
 the longer the better the main line 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 sliding load bead stop 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.330
 and then swivel leash hook what is it 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.640
 everything gives it our bottom gear 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.600
 absolutely legal again for a period 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:44.719
 spawning ban means intended 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.329
 for catching mostly big fish why 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.960
 load moving why sliding olive 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.550
 I think everything is clear because it means 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.000
 bite you see 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.620
 and your opponent in this case is not a fish 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.579
 feels like fishing line freely 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 passes through the ring means here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.430
 worth stopping bead too clear 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 for what for moving load 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.189
 rolling did not turn into deaf not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.590
 stuck on the main node swivel 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:23.189
 as likely as fastening means 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.890
 as for the marani leash and in similar 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.990
 I tried to put the gear well in what 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.509
 thinner fishing line is better and therefore 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.970
 I had to rely only on 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.520
 confusion let's say fish a bit klimov 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.960
 my bream all this calmly tore now I 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 I put 10 number braids and I must say 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.159
 This is the quality of the fishing line 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.430
 just very good fish and practically 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.380
 does not feel the hook I think 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.470
 universal fifth number even 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 relatively small fish catch 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.960
 major uses it straight as a swallow and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.330
 means 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 main fishing line due to the fact that here 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.750
 us soft thin wire 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.900
 may be thick enough here at 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.280
 me 02 is worth and nod why nod they 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.530
 float well today I was very lucky 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.319
 or rather lucky well in short to us 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.440
 lucky with the wind because it is not and you 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.750
 out of luck because you can't 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 see that nod absolutely into the wind not 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.200
 reacts mean float you would 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.209
 danced burrowed in the water hung out 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.450
 surface nod stands calmly and 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.050
 drag his job just a bite and he 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.360
 goes to look for regularly performs what else 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.260
 I must say the advantages of this tackle vodka 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.470
 loops you can die out available to you 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.600
 with the help of the rod the reservoir is to determine 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.640
 ramp dimple and so on the same 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.140
 you can make a float well, it's in four 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.140
 longer sam casimir time 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.580
 yes rather no no it is not victorious 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.600
 point in the story of clarity it is rather 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.600
 shy
