hello I'm

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.499 
hello I'm
Frances<00:00:09.700> we're<00:00:10.700> going<00:00:10.850> to<00:00:10.910> look<00:00:11.090> at

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
Frances we're going to look at

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.600 
Frances we're going to look at
if<00:00:13.230> you're<00:00:13.500> not<00:00:13.650> gonna<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.039> it<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.190> martial

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
if you're not gonna do it for martial

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.429 
if you're not gonna do it for martial
arts<00:00:14.849> well<00:00:15.240> there's<00:00:15.570> several<00:00:15.719> reasons<00:00:16.260> first

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
arts well there's several reasons first

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.279 
arts well there's several reasons first
of<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.820> skills<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.480> learned<00:00:18.810> in

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of all the skills that get learned in

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.300 
of all the skills that get learned in
pushing<00:00:19.800> hands<00:00:20.250> will<00:00:20.669> be<00:00:20.849> useful<00:00:21.329> for<00:00:22.310> most

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
pushing hands will be useful for most

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.229 
pushing hands will be useful for most
athletics<00:00:24.259> there's<00:00:25.259> no<00:00:25.410> two<00:00:25.470> ways<00:00:25.619> about<00:00:25.949> it

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
athletics there's no two ways about it

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.460 
athletics there's no two ways about it
another<00:00:27.239> reason<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.840> pushing<00:00:28.140> hands

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
another reason is that pushing hands

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.140 
another reason is that pushing hands
will<00:00:28.679> give<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.009> level<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.759> energetic

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
will give you a level of energetic

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
will give you a level of energetic
sensitivity<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.769> hard<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.519> get

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
sensitivity that is hard to get

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.210 
sensitivity that is hard to get
elsewhere<00:00:33.350> ones<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.830> applied<00:00:35.160> not

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
elsewhere ones that can be applied not

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.189 
elsewhere ones that can be applied not
only<00:00:35.519> in<00:00:35.760> martial<00:00:36.120> arts<00:00:36.210> but<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.600> healing<00:00:37.019> work

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
only in martial arts but in healing work

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.210 
only in martial arts but in healing work
or<00:00:37.650> in<00:00:38.129> anything<00:00:38.579> where<00:00:39.180> hand<00:00:40.050> sensitivity<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
or in anything where hand sensitivity is

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.290 
or in anything where hand sensitivity is
important<00:00:42.409> including<00:00:43.409> making<00:00:43.769> love<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:45.000> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
important including making love so it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
important including making love so it's
very<00:00:45.420> useful<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.199> the<00:00:46.500> flow<00:00:46.949> of<00:00:46.980> energy

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
very useful for that the flow of energy

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.599 
very useful for that the flow of energy
back<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:47.730> forth<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> pushing<00:00:48.629> hands<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
back and forth and pushing hands is

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.840 
back and forth and pushing hands is
appliable<00:00:50.609> in<00:00:50.969> many<00:00:51.270> many<00:00:51.480> many<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.899> arenas

the second thing is that one of the

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:57.500 
the second thing is that one of the
major<00:00:55.530> hallmarks<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.520> stress<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> fight

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
major hallmarks of stress is the fight

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.290 
major hallmarks of stress is the fight
and<00:00:57.750> flight<00:00:57.960> response<00:00:58.730> which<00:00:59.730> actually

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and flight response which actually

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.100 
and flight response which actually
should<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.629> accurately<00:01:01.199> should<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.739> fight

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
reduce and release it and one which I

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.690 
reduce and release it and one which I
have<00:01:32.640> taught<00:01:32.849> for<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.569> purpose<00:01:34.250> all<00:01:35.250> over

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
have taught for that purpose all over

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.219 
have taught for that purpose all over
the<00:01:35.789> world<00:01:36.000> including<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.929> you<00:01:37.140> know

the world including to you know
corporate<00:01:37.530> types<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.190> whole<00:01:38.310> thing<00:01:39.470> the

next<00:01:40.770> thing<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.039> another<00:01:41.340> aspect<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.970> pushing

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
next thing is another aspect of pushing

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.380 
next thing is another aspect of pushing
hands<00:01:42.599> is<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:43.110> which<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:44.209> think<00:01:45.209> is<00:01:45.270> very

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
hands is one which I think is very

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.350 
hands is one which I think is very
useful<00:01:45.950> people<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.670> biological

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
useful people have the biological

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
useful people have the biological
