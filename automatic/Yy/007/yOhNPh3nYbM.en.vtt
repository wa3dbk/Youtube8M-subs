00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.830 
the back and we're on the bottom of the
mouse<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.970> made<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.599> awkward

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
mouse and that made it really awkward

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.440 
mouse and that made it really awkward
for<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.950> didn't<00:02:11.640> distribute<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.300> weight

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
for it just didn't distribute the weight

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.250 
for it just didn't distribute the weight
really<00:02:12.870> well

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
really well

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
really well
um<00:02:13.459> unlike<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.060> distributes

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
um unlike this one it just distributes

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.990 
um unlike this one it just distributes
the<00:02:16.019> weight<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.319> lot<00:02:16.530> better<00:02:16.890> than<00:02:17.519> having<00:02:17.939> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the weight a lot better than having it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.089 
the weight a lot better than having it
in<00:02:18.090> front<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.629> in<00:02:18.750> back<00:02:18.780> which<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.409> really<00:02:19.920> like

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
in front and in back which I really like

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.539 
in front and in back which I really like
a<00:02:20.129> lot<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.659> think<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.439> a<00:02:22.680> very<00:02:23.040> nice<00:02:23.280> Mouse
