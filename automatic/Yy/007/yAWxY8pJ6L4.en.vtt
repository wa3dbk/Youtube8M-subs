starting<00:01:24.240> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> lowest<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.280> going<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.540> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
starting from the lowest and going up to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.120 
starting from the lowest and going up to
the<00:01:27.630> highest<00:01:29.000> when<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.090> reach<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.509> top<00:01:30.720> you

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
the highest when you reach the top you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:42.980 
the highest when you reach the top you
start<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.250> over<00:01:32.280> again<00:01:32.550> without<00:01:33.149> a<00:01:33.360> pause

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.130 

and<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.350> forth<00:01:47.940> let's<00:01:48.940> take<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> closer<00:01:49.600> look<00:01:49.930> at

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and so forth let's take a closer look at

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.340 
and so forth let's take a closer look at
my<00:01:50.320> technique<00:01:51.300> notice<00:01:52.300> how<00:01:52.450> I<00:01:52.480> start<00:01:52.990> with<00:01:53.170> my

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
my technique notice how I start with my

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.880 
my technique notice how I start with my
wrists<00:01:53.680> high<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.550> my<00:01:55.120> fingers<00:01:55.540> curved<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.290> I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
wrists high and my fingers curved and I

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.090 
wrists high and my fingers curved and I
simply<00:01:57.250> drop<00:01:58.210> my<00:01:58.900> weight<00:01:59.880> onto<00:02:00.880> each

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
simply drop my weight onto each

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.020 
simply drop my weight onto each
fingertip<00:02:04.410> except<00:02:05.410> for<00:02:05.590> the<00:02:05.710> thumb<00:02:06.030> which

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
fingertip except for the thumb which

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.640 
fingertip except for the thumb which
plays<00:02:07.360> on<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.350> more<00:02:08.560> on<00:02:08.649> its<00:02:08.830> side<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:11.500> what

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
plays on it more on its side so what

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
plays on it more on its side so what
happens<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.940> gravity<00:02:13.540> does<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:14.320> work<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
happens is that gravity does the work I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.820 
happens is that gravity does the work I
don't<00:02:16.420> push<00:02:16.840> or<00:02:17.800> press<00:02:18.130> down<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:19.200> just<00:02:20.200> release

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
don't push or press down I just release

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.830 
don't push or press down I just release
and<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.780> key<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:24.010> your<00:02:24.459> wrist<00:02:24.840> it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and the key to all this is your wrist it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.490 
and the key to all this is your wrist it
needs<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.380> relaxed<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.190> loose<00:02:27.760> as<00:02:28.750> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
needs to be relaxed and loose as it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.690 
needs to be relaxed and loose as it
drops<00:02:29.830> down<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.580> then<00:02:31.180> bounces<00:02:31.750> back<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.700> for

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
drops down and then bounces back up for

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:45.560 
drops down and then bounces back up for
each<00:02:33.850> note

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.410 

so<00:02:46.570> at<00:02:46.690> this<00:02:46.840> point<00:02:47.700> practice<00:02:48.700> playing<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.240> C

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
so at this point practice playing the C

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.570 
so at this point practice playing the C
chord<00:02:49.720> over<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.230> over

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
chord over and over

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.050 
chord over and over
so<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.210> can<00:02:52.450> play<00:02:52.630> it<00:02:52.780> easily<00:02:53.760> with<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> nice

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
so you can play it easily with a nice

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:05.190 
so you can play it easily with a nice
steady<00:02:55.870> flow<00:03:02.880> next<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> piece<00:03:04.330> comes<00:03:04.960> the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
steady flow next in the piece comes the

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.810 
steady flow next in the piece comes the
F<00:03:05.380> chord<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:08.530> practice<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.160> same<00:03:09.400> routine

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
F chord so practice the same routine

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.910 
F chord so practice the same routine
