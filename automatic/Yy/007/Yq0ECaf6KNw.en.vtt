liner brush it does come with a little
brush<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.200> I<00:02:06.259> personally<00:02:07.039> don't<00:02:07.189> get<00:02:07.520> on<00:02:07.610> with

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
brush but I personally don't get on with

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:25.110 
brush but I personally don't get on with
the<00:02:07.880> tiny<00:02:08.119> ones<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.569> well

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.089 

and<00:02:25.720> then<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.110> jazz<00:02:26.500> up<00:02:26.530> for<00:02:26.830> my<00:02:26.920> lower

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
and then to jazz up for my lower

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.530 
and then to jazz up for my lower
lashline<00:02:27.340> this<00:02:27.670> will<00:02:27.819> just<00:02:27.910> make<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.330> tiny

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
lashline this will just make it a tiny

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.390 
lashline this will just make it a tiny
bit<00:02:28.690> more<00:02:28.750> exciting<00:02:29.290> I'm<00:02:29.410> using<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:30.040> sort<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
bit more exciting I'm using this sort of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.309 
bit more exciting I'm using this sort of
ready<00:02:30.700> maroon<00:02:31.120> e<00:02:31.209> color<00:02:31.420> here<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.050> it's

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
ready maroon e color here and it's

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.869 
ready maroon e color here and it's
called<00:02:32.470> maple<00:02:32.980> but<00:02:33.160> any<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.400> these<00:02:33.550> colors

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
called maple but any of these colors

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.160 
called maple but any of these colors
would<00:02:34.030> look<00:02:34.090> quite<00:02:34.390> good<00:02:34.629> sort<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:34.840> blended

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819
