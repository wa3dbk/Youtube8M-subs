00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.750
 who could make them very famous piece and 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.060
 I'm surprised by Argentine 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.250
 the Netherlands and software recognize people 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.529
 there is a tradition in the in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.119
 performance practice of reading piece such as 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.980
 in delden music too 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.590
 and in this tradition actually started with 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.600
 the first recording in the sixties with 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.879
 los french resource inner diameter itself 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 I was also a child and I have right away 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.200
 power just as a child 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.800
 you must have a prana until always old 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.050
 music it is the first time for us 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.190
 that we are going to record something like that is from the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.810
 60s 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.290
 this music the music again matter online 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.290
 the baroque music 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.790
 and what is special about this is how tired you are 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.240
 must see because the voice on the classical 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.369
 Way is built on resonance and here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.040
 is built on tension on the vocal cords 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.119
 so that your thing is actually in the point 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.909
 from almost 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.890
 whining and thus music made very 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.000
 very emotional you can't let him go 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.000
 let it is always fixed 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.300
 I think we have a chance to 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.370
 perform mycelia in Netherlands in 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.320
 the netherlands we have so many mission that out 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.020
 different Latin American countries 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.840
 good musicians bring the two together 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.770
 can be a real site american version 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.450
 to make 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.649
 the same way we do the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.160
 perform music 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.660
 throughout the continents through which we enter 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.410
 general south american sound 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.410
 to gain 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.540
 help 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 I'll watch 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.120
 Yes 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.540
 we have always discharged the micellar 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.470
 hated because we have grown with it 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.470
