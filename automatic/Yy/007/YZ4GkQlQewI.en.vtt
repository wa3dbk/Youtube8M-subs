Kamen Rider Verde anyway let's start
with<00:00:43.239> this<00:00:43.480> one<00:00:43.659> I<00:00:43.690> really<00:00:43.780> like<00:00:44.110> that<00:00:44.470> it's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
with this one I really like that it's

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.160 
with this one I really like that it's
actually<00:00:45.129> labeled<00:00:45.670> as<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.300> Darth<00:00:46.539> Tyranus<00:00:46.750> his

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170

actually labeled as a Darth Tyranus his
lightsaber<00:00:51.000> if<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.480> recall<00:00:52.660> correctly<00:00:52.930> and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
lightsaber if I recall correctly and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.740 
lightsaber if I recall correctly and
seeing<00:00:54.219> that<00:00:54.309> I'm<00:00:54.550> a<00:00:54.820> bit<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.570> nerd<00:00:55.719> about

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
seeing that I'm a bit of a nerd about

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.990 
seeing that I'm a bit of a nerd about
this<00:00:56.109> sort<00:00:56.289> of<00:00:56.320> thing<00:00:56.440> I'm<00:00:56.680> pretty<00:00:56.859> sure<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
this sort of thing I'm pretty sure that

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.670 
this sort of thing I'm pretty sure that
they<00:00:58.120> released<00:00:58.449> an<00:00:58.660> episode<00:00:59.019> 2<00:00:59.199> version<00:00:59.559> of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
they released an episode 2 version of

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.040 
they released an episode 2 version of
this<00:00:59.769> one<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:01.390> was<00:01:01.480> labeled<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.840> Count

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
this one that was labeled as Count

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.779 
this one that was labeled as Count
Dooku's<00:01:02.379> lightsaber<00:01:02.469> in<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.160> episode<00:01:03.430> 3<00:01:03.670> what

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
Dooku's lightsaber in the episode 3 what

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.580 
Dooku's lightsaber in the episode 3 what
they<00:01:03.969> relabeled<00:01:04.809> as<00:01:04.869> Darth<00:01:05.110> Tyranus

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
they relabeled as Darth Tyranus

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.230 
they relabeled as Darth Tyranus
and<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:07.060> think<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:07.660> identical<00:01:08.110> except<00:01:08.560> for<00:01:08.590> I

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and I think it's identical except for I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.380 
and I think it's identical except for I
think<00:01:10.240> this<00:01:10.479> elbow<00:01:10.840> might<00:01:11.050> be<00:01:12.390> bronzers

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
think this elbow might be bronzers

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.029 
think this elbow might be bronzers
colored<00:01:13.690> plastic<00:01:14.110> instead<00:01:14.350> of<00:01:14.410> metal<00:01:14.500> I<00:01:14.830> think

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
colored plastic instead of metal I think

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.810 
colored plastic instead of metal I think
that's<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.280> only<00:01:15.310> difference

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
that's the only difference

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's the only difference
I<00:01:15.970> like<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:17.729> curved<00:01:18.729> saber<00:01:19.539> hilt<00:01:19.810> design<00:01:20.140> I

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I like the curved saber hilt design I

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.279 
I like the curved saber hilt design I
like<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.000> rubber<00:01:22.209> grip<00:01:22.539> here<00:01:23.050> the

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
like the rubber grip here the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.230 
like the rubber grip here the
alternating<00:01:24.009> with<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> aluminum<00:01:24.700> or<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
alternating with the aluminum or the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.389 
alternating with the aluminum or the
metal<00:01:25.709> looks<00:01:26.709> like<00:01:26.800> it's<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:26.979> little<00:01:27.069> dusty

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
metal looks like it's a little dusty

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.559 
metal looks like it's a little dusty
it's<00:01:28.209> just<00:01:28.360> a<00:01:28.479> cool<00:01:29.610> cool<00:01:30.670> saber<00:01:31.330> design<00:01:31.539> I

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
it's just a cool cool saber design I

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.800 
it's just a cool cool saber design I
like<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.959> little<00:01:32.770> red<00:01:32.890> trigger<00:01:33.160> there<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
like the little red trigger there the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.600 
like the little red trigger there the
emitter<00:01:35.080> with<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.560> weird<00:01:36.099> cooking<00:01:36.220> thing

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
emitter with the weird cooking thing

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.029 
emitter with the weird cooking thing
even<00:01:37.060> though<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.239> way<00:01:37.330> this<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:37.660> lined<00:01:37.869> up<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
even though the way this is lined up the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.690 
even though the way this is lined up the
lightsaber<00:01:39.489> would<00:01:41.250> seems<00:01:42.250> like<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.520> blade

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
lightsaber would seems like the blade

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.800 
lightsaber would seems like the blade
would<00:01:42.880> cut<00:01:43.060> off<00:01:43.149> part<00:01:43.390> of<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.569> but<00:01:43.690> doing

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
would cut off part of it but doing

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.559 
would cut off part of it but doing
really<00:01:44.500> cool<00:01:45.149> design<00:01:48.179> see<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.300> about<00:01:49.450> as

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
really cool design see it's about as

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.250 
really cool design see it's about as
long<00:01:49.690> as<00:01:49.840> my<00:01:49.959> hand<00:01:50.200> not<00:01:50.530> really<00:01:50.770> not<00:01:51.009> quite

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.440 

I<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:55.180> really<00:01:56.020> really<00:01:56.050> like<00:01:57.360> Darth<00:01:58.360> Sidious

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450

is lightsaber do you think I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.880 
is lightsaber do you think I
consistently<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.510> about<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> prequels<00:02:02.170> was

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
consistently like about the prequels was

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.160 
consistently like about the prequels was
everything<00:02:03.250> with<00:02:03.660> Chancellor<00:02:04.660> Emperor

Palpatine Darth Sidious and this hilt

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.350 
Palpatine Darth Sidious and this hilt
design<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:09.310> really<00:02:09.610> cool<00:02:09.760> I<00:02:09.910> love<00:02:10.150> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
design is really cool I love the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.960 
design is really cool I love the
purplish<00:02:11.250> aluminum<00:02:12.570> color<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:14.100> silver<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
purplish aluminum color the silver the

purplish aluminum color the silver the
gold<00:02:17.310> like<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.460> red<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.670> green<00:02:20.070> buttons<00:02:21.070> I

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
gold like the red and green buttons I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.480 
gold like the red and green buttons I
guess<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.670> would<00:02:21.790> be<00:02:21.820> le<00:02:22.270> could<00:02:22.480> be<00:02:22.600> LEDs

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
guess that would be le could be LEDs

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.060 
guess that would be le could be LEDs
it's<00:02:24.490> got<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> very<00:02:24.850> brassy<00:02:25.450> not<00:02:25.720> glossy<00:02:26.070> no

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
it's got a very brassy not glossy no

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.440 
it's got a very brassy not glossy no
major<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:28.540> short<00:02:29.310> it's<00:02:30.310> very<00:02:30.550> distinct<00:02:31.210> size

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
major it's short it's very distinct size
