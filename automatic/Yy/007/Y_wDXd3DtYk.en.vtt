Hopkins but in many cases these were

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.970 
Hopkins but in many cases these were
basically<00:03:13.760> slum<00:03:14.329> tenements<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.709> think

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
basically slum tenements and I think

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.039 
basically slum tenements and I think
this<00:03:16.130> gave<00:03:16.370> George<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.850> Dublin<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.359> very<00:03:17.810> bad
