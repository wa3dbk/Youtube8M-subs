of course at the time scepter would have
been<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.279> more<00:00:32.399> established<00:00:32.579> than

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
greninja moveset wise and they did

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
greninja moveset wise and they did
distribute<00:00:35.700> mega<00:00:36.210> Blaziken<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
release of Pokemon X&amp;Y so it is clear

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
release of Pokemon X&amp;Y so it is clear
that<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.719> did<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.020> generation<00:00:40.590> 3<00:00:40.770> Pokemon

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

in<00:00:41.309> mind<00:00:41.550> Sakurai<00:00:42.510> has<00:00:42.690> surprised<00:00:43.079> us<00:00:43.230> before

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
in mind Sakurai has surprised us before

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
in mind Sakurai has surprised us before
so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.160> guess<00:00:44.340> we'll<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.910> wait<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
so I guess we'll have to just wait and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
so I guess we'll have to just wait and
see<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.390> he<00:00:45.570> does<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.809> again<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.489> now

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
see if he does it again but for now

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.369 
see if he does it again but for now
let's<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.180> over<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> possible<00:00:48.840> move<00:00:48.960> set<00:00:49.170> and

weight-wise<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.149> think<00:01:00.719> septa<00:01:01.079> would<00:01:01.230> fit<00:01:01.440> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
weight-wise I think septa would fit in

middleweight assuming Charizard returns

as a heavy and greninja as a speedster

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.100 
as a heavy and greninja as a speedster
since<00:01:08.280> even<00:01:08.490> Pokemon<00:01:08.970> stat<00:01:09.210> wise<00:01:09.360> he<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.810> in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
since even Pokemon stat wise he is in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.200

between those two in terms of speed his
dash<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.780> look<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.500> how<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> raptor
