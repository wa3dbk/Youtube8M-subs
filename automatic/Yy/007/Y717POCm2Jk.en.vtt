00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.550
 it's everybody's the big face 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 to sum up 3:15 p.m. I hope you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.660
 Come on, I'm fine today 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.830
 so yes I am alone 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.810
 today to comment on this gameplay 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.640
 who is not of me or my brother 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.250
 so I explain why I am 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 only ben in fact my brother is not there 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.170
 and I tried to do it on skype 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 but it did not work, because that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.050
 did not work I did not take my head 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 I said to myself and I'm still 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.750
 pretty slow 1 g i'm going into my age 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 Anjou is a little old 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 so I order all alone and so 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110
 today jean we meet when 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.559
 even for an ace and your gameplay is a 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.010
 gameplay of our dry friend or fake sykes 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.270
 not good for all of us to get excited 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.059
 reference to ecstasy because that's it 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.079
 bow citizens too lol and today 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.370
 so they play with the 12 anti acca 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.539
 flash I'm not fooling I believe that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.680
 that's how it pulses and the thing 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 whatever happens not to have precisely 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.369
 the flash of tears when you shoot 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.430
 a ball and the gameplay like you 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.549
 will surely have seen in the title it's 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.400
 1.50 gunfights ie 50 that he 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.710
 bendrix say it alarm and so did 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.530
 50 who tear in a row without dying 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.729
 so patrick only specialist of the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.490
 race is leaving his class so he was playing 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 anti flash charge before capacity and 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.259
 then in specialist finally slats 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.299
 where he had then I did not have the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.920
 trumps a granny did not give but saw this 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.380
 I've seen some gameplay he wants to play 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.200
 dead silence with sleight ace 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.540
 the trigger and surely another I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.040
 believe or on is a brief place then 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:51.479
 in specialist he had how 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 is called tracker amplification and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.729
 looters and in 6 pc I can not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.850
 know 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.260
 so sorry 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.880
 I was not really against all his 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.770
 trumps but I think you'll see 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.479
 well by yourself not really what 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.580
 is more important 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.659
 you probably know that I also see that I 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.270
 will still achieve a lot of 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.450
 couples in this gameplay seen that actually 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 finally in front of the team the cei he 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.260
 go often and have rage quit 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.420
 sometimes they'll be only two sometimes 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.800
 having to be three outside has so for 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 avoid making you wait for 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.680
 moments is what ben they're walking around 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.150
 to try to find the enemies I 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.489
 prefer you put something with a little 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.489
 more action a little more con launched I 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.069
 think you would also prefer then 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.920
 in terms of amap and mode 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.860
 cdu hardcore domination on the map 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.870
 octane so yes of hardcore you go 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.850
 tell me it's really quite a lot of 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.280
 records that's pretty true but people 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.530
 to tell you one thing I'm going to talk 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.870
 personal bad luck is that the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 hardcore I play for a reason 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.370
 since I have a collection enough yes we 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.549
 will say it clearly 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.910
 I have 5 mega 4 5 megabytes of download and 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:05.120
 0.7 of the peloton with a ping kind of 50 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.920
 down quite often when I play in 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.440
 normal mode they in normal domination 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.359
 or lightning where that's fine it turns out that 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.370
 I take bullshit stands in 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.810
 first I took back the smoke three 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.010
 ballets it's a bag and the cam down they 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.329
 wish the crowds raid it happens 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.870
 as she is too beautiful it looks like 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.329
 I am thinking of someone 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.060
 I stop shooting while not 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.530
 everything and it started a little upset 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.420
 precisely to make unique and too much 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.130
 of serial times like that and so I 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.100
 decided to test their agreement and the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.329
 hardcore well yes it's really 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:38.470
 than at the common dia reflex at the 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.989
 speed all that so no longer really 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.760
 of weapons tchitÃ© in more powerful or 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.430
 more versatile than it is 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.670
 really that style and I prefer 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.230
 largely that or after that skill yes 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.299
 but as you all know 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.680
 campers there are the ei that's there too 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.180
 and that's why maybe they 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.530
 should play I think maybe too 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.069
 I'm also bullet-proof because 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.030
 it saves lives there is still one so 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.859
 well here I just saw that we 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.620
 specialists so he had an eye of 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.840
 lynx and surely determination 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.099
 and so he will miss it I do not know 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.180
 too much that it could already be in 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.370
 way something like that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.269
 I remember chocolate send back 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.290
 the cough that gives you an asset to 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.370
 chance among all the assets of the game 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.370
 ge supply to tell you but was 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.690
 accompanied by some friends so I know 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.979
 not too much that serves me not too much 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.010
 the habit of games etc is that seen 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.330
 it's on xbox so that xbox gameplay 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
 present who say that xbox is over 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.740
 hard blah blah blah bah here is the xbox 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.910
 so it's harder low ie 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.870
 that he is still stronger than 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.630
 others 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.180
 so here are some money already 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.979
 I want to tell you go see when 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.300
 even the string of thresholds they deserve 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.850
 as I think a little more swallow 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.320
 what does he currently have but he 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.270
 will get you out all the time enough 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.830
 big gameplay it not laugh made him 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.370
 things a little different because of it 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.199
 rather raging themes of double md 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.330
 still weird or if a big one 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.889
 strict game but it's not the kind of 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.270
 dude you just shoot a camera the cad 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.520
 or if they have this change of course in 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.560
 half point bar samson specialty and 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.720
 jeans not fast nothing is really 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.030
 someone who finally in the small 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.780
 last while their age and 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.150
 frankly we get along really well 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.169
 love that's a little dedication to him and for 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.430
 what is the commander harrie me good 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:23.050
 or at a big turn anyway me 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.770
 must be how to say do not have too much 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.080
 enjoyed my com went seeing that 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.660
 usually I comment to two with my 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.710
 brother there I am alone so good even though 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.000
 like that you appreciate so much 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.320
 compact happens it makes me happy 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.150
 I know it's not really 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.699
 the usual but there in the absence diplo 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.270
 down I still have to ensure a 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.160
 maximum 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.570
 the quality of the videos I hope when 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.280
 even that you like it so there it comes 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.539
 to be unlocked for me his range but 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.169
 for you want to assure them already 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.220

 on this I tell you to let lay people 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.110

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.500
 50 km strict which 50.0 from 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.630

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.289
 his height 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.020
 at work or well played
