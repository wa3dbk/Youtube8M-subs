00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.140 
cheb and fabric Brad bricks Xbox just
broke<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.230> probably<00:00:19.859> pretty<00:00:20.039> old<00:00:20.220> game<00:00:20.840> but<00:00:23.150> no

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
broke so probably pretty old game but no

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.250 
broke so probably pretty old game but no
hopefully<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> some<00:00:24.930> good<00:00:24.990> spawn

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
killing in fact that's I think that's

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
killing in fact that's I think that's
what<00:00:27.869> I'm<00:00:27.960> doing<00:00:31.520> here's<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.759> spot<00:00:32.910> i

always use you can see perfectly through

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.630 
always use you can see perfectly through
that<00:00:36.000> gap<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> blind<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.550> people<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that gap in the blind and people that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
that gap in the blind and people that
rush<00:00:38.879> under<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.270> chopper<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.989> get<00:00:40.559> blown

rush under the chopper just get blown
away<00:00:42.170> it's<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.379> nothing<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
away it's really nothing you can do in

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.650 
away it's really nothing you can do in
somebody's<00:00:44.550> behind<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.879> blind<00:00:45.149> where<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
somebody's behind a blind where you can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.990 
somebody's behind a blind where you can
hardly<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:45.989> anything<00:00:46.700> like<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.090> Robo<00:00:48.600> oh

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
hardly see anything like me with Robo oh

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.020 
hardly see anything like me with Robo oh
yeah<00:00:51.680> some<00:00:52.680> good<00:00:52.860> shotgun<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.850> then

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
yeah some good shotgun and then

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
yeah some good shotgun and then
eventually<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.899> got<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> point<00:00:55.500> where

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
eventually they got to the point where

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.350 
eventually they got to the point where
they<00:00:55.920> didn't<00:00:56.190> fall<00:00:56.340> off

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.660 

so<00:01:01.530> okay<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.560> guess<00:01:02.980> I'm<00:01:03.130> starting<00:01:03.400> now<00:01:03.460> going

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
so okay I guess I'm starting now going

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.650 
so okay I guess I'm starting now going
for<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.850> objective<00:01:04.330> a<00:01:04.420> little<00:01:04.629> bit<00:01:04.780> but<00:01:04.989> uh

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
for the objective a little bit but uh

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.190 
for the objective a little bit but uh
I'll<00:01:07.660> start<00:01:07.900> spawn<00:01:08.110> killing<00:01:08.320> soon<00:01:08.500> enough<00:01:09.120> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I'll start spawn killing soon enough I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890 
I'll start spawn killing soon enough I
believe<00:01:11.200> hutch<00:01:11.530> made<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> video<00:01:12.160> about<00:01:12.900> spawn

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
believe hutch made a video about spawn

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.030 
believe hutch made a video about spawn
killing<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.440> this<00:01:14.470> map<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:16.080> yeah<00:01:17.080> yeah<00:01:17.680> he<00:01:17.860> did

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
killing on this map and yeah yeah he did

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.400 
killing on this map and yeah yeah he did
and<00:01:18.420> there's<00:01:19.420> something<00:01:19.690> wrong<00:01:19.780> with<00:01:19.960> it<00:01:20.140> and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
and there's something wrong with it and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.430 
and there's something wrong with it and
I'll<00:01:21.280> get<00:01:21.400> to<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.550> later<00:01:21.900> when<00:01:22.900> i<00:01:22.930> get<00:01:23.229> over

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
I'll get to that later when i get over

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.480 
I'll get to that later when i get over
there<00:01:24.300> some<00:01:25.300> he<00:01:25.510> didn't<00:01:25.690> exactly<00:01:25.930> cover<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
there some he didn't exactly cover and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.460 
there some he didn't exactly cover and
it's<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.940> bit<00:01:28.060> misleading<00:01:28.240> perhaps<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.320> doesn't

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
it's a bit misleading perhaps it doesn't

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.859 
it's a bit misleading perhaps it doesn't
happen<00:01:29.680> domination<00:01:30.610> but<00:01:30.790> i<00:01:30.850> don't<00:01:31.030> i<00:01:31.270> don't

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
happen domination but i don't i don't

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.580 
happen domination but i don't i don't
think<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.440> i<00:01:33.040> wouldn't<00:01:33.460> because<00:01:33.910> uh<00:01:34.590> von

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
think that i wouldn't because uh von

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.109 
think that i wouldn't because uh von

dick you sent pics you dick well on this

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.370 
dick you sent pics you dick well on this
side<00:01:59.790> up<00:02:00.060> there's<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:00.930> really<00:02:01.110> no

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
side up there's some there's really no

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.609 
side up there's some there's really no
there's<00:02:02.340> no<00:02:02.520> spot<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.090> de-spawn<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.259> besides

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
there's no spot to de-spawn do besides

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.620 
there's no spot to de-spawn do besides
looking<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> windows<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:08.149> i<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.599> know

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
looking in the windows and i don't know

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.820 
looking in the windows and i don't know
why<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:09.869> thought<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.229> was<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.649> side

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
why i thought i was on the other side

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.800 
why i thought i was on the other side
and<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.819> bit<00:02:11.940> easier<00:02:11.970> spawn<00:02:12.390> call<00:02:12.630> on<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and it's a bit easier spawn call on that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.970 
and it's a bit easier spawn call on that
side<00:02:13.080> because<00:02:14.300> there's<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.390> spot<00:02:15.630> over<00:02:15.780> there

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
side because there's a spot over there

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.120 
side because there's a spot over there
where<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:18.690> your<00:02:18.930> next<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.349> cafe<00:02:19.950> and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
where your your next to the cafe and

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.220 
where your your next to the cafe and
you're<00:02:20.250> sitting<00:02:20.400> outside<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.230> they'll

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
you're sitting outside of it and they'll

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.750 
you're sitting outside of it and they'll
either<00:02:22.410> spawn<00:02:22.799> in<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.299> stairwell<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:26.190> i

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
either spawn in the stairwell the i

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.059 
either spawn in the stairwell the i
think<00:02:27.150> it's<00:02:27.239> called<00:02:27.299> the<00:02:27.630> executive<00:02:28.560> offices

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
think it's called the executive offices

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.020 
think it's called the executive offices
or<00:02:29.280> something<00:02:29.640> or<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:31.830> spawn<00:02:32.160> outside<00:02:32.790> by
