00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.699
 Hi, what are you doing, a tyrannosaurus? 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.500
 You'll need your pencil and do it. 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.300
 3d pencil 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.380
 If you do not have these you can also 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:22.530
 2b 4b you will also need a 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.530
 blank paper and if you want a rubber 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.600
 We'll do it if they say step by step. 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.699
 at each step you can pause the video and 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.019
 only pass the next step when 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.539
 ready with the paper lying down 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.399
 Let's start with b-pencil by drawing the 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.159
 lines that compose this Tyrannosaurus 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:50.319
 to start three straight lines to the 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:53.819
 mouth a curved line for the muzzle one 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.819
 small curve for the eye region 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.530
 something bigger with your head in a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 straight line is small 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.060
 and a large curve for the back 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.170
 now a pretty big tail thing 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.980
 coming back because they called regular a 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.980
 curve for the jaw 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:39.760
 now a curve for the neck in a 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:45.220
 curved line for the front leg more 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.940
 a curved line to the leg a line in 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.920
 s shape 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:56.140
 to make the first finger a line 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 curve for his second and one more 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 s-shaped thing for his second 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.560
 now a regular line the elbow in 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.060
 a small curved line to finish 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.390
 this first leg a curved line to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 the belly 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:29.360
 two curved lines for which a straight line 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.590
 a curve to the leg plus a straight in 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.590
 an ankle curve 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.300
 now the fingers a curved line and more 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.300
 two curved lines for the other fingers 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.720
 Now one thing is quite big that goes up to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.820
 the tip of the tail to finish the body 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.820
 now a straight line for what is behind 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.510
 two lines to suggest that the folder 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:07.760
 there are two straight lines to the 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:12.620
 ankle and a curved line for the finger 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:18.290
 as if he had now another 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.100
 arm two straight lines plus two rules 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.100
 for this arm 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.900
 finally the fingers a curve to 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.200
 start another curve line for the 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.200
 finger 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:42.400
 the second will also need a 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.400
 curved line and one more curved line 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.370
 now you can present the claws 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.590
 then the teeth 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.540
 is the language 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.310
 may also have cartilage of the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.310
 mouth opening 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.970
 finally the eye 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:19.130
 now the details a few lines for 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:24.380
 give volume and others more to answer 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:27.970
 texture of the skin afterwards with four well 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.970
 you can darken the front lines 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.190
 and finally also puts the 4 b 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.360
 you can make some shadow effects 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.580
 notes that the paws behind 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.920
 are totally shaded so much more 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.940
 dark because the body shades over 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.940
 they 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.520
 also has some shadows in the 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.380
 under his tail and also above the 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.960
 back and head 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.610
 the language was also a little known and 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.530
 below his chin is also a 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.800
 little darker these effects you 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.550
 can do with spots 46 collapse on 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.290
 the paper 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.660
 you can also add more rows 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.120
 like those in the leg of a is in the leg that 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.110
 is at the forefront of doing something to 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.660
 little more culture for the skin also 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.260
 a drawing uses your imagination and you 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.410
 can also add a scenario or 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.010
 other details you want history 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.010
 of life
