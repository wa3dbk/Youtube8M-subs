00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.869

 it is possible to hide the main thing is not to distinguish 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.600
 the main thing here and so the ball does not lose a pancake 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.789

 that you have high highs you are constantly in 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.790

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:37.389

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.810
 offside was offside was site was class 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.400
 start running the ball of course repulsed well 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.709
 that somehow the Thomas site Bolton 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.810
 volleyball agitated knocked his legs 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.069
 tea as a result of losses whose result in the end 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:17.169
 eventually knock out well no no cast 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:19.780
 no bar no monsters damn well like so 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.210
 how did it go now? I don’t understand 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.210

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.320
 adds what about lone shot 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.479
 disgusting it was not to mention this 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.560
 ear craps do not give them a beat 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.139

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.630

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.229
 no one gives to close and here it is necessary 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.289
 back you have to auto change player actor 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:01.599

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.900

 how could it just be a new bloom here 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.460
 such a moment, well, what kind of 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.220
 bullying even in real football 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.260
 probably 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.260
 would have just struck a blow 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.270

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.070

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.520
 very tense match translated to 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.210
 dangerous 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.340
 for five minutes as usual the court gave us 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:45.770
 attack in attack in attack now everything is possible 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.580

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.340
 I take it I went to this goal after 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.770
 in what ways it has been the main 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:58.490
 to slow down something karvahal 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.110

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.150

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.090
 match we had a decent but necessary 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.310
 hold advantage now 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.890
 extra time still goes on 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.450
 it is not known when it will end for now 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.700
 so much 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.800
 begovic by kurtuay came to serve 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.800
 now would fight back and the fourth ball for 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.300
 loyalty still score instead instead 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.490
 this cross fend for 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.970
