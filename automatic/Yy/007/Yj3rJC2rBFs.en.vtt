00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hey 2 more days then it is Friday 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.560
 is it halloween and of course i already had 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.530
 made a halloween tutorial but me 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.170
 also wanted to make a bottle of nail art and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.719
 I have some very simple ones 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.940
 nail polishes together what saté 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.170
 goodies and I am up to this nail art 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.939
 come 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 so you do not have to go in front of the house 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.529
 and yes you can actually summer 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.230
 we participate so grab your black and white 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 nail polish and then we can start 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.550
 first I have two layers of black 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 pixel of orly applied 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 this is a sandy smile with whole ones 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 beautiful glitter in it and it will dry 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.190
 matted on but with the shiny top coat 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 you can also get it shiny 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 I let it dry completely and it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 it goes very quickly with such a plan 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 I think it takes about 10 minutes and 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.820
 let it dry before the mail output 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.680
 use 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 essence hat trick that is an opaque 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.860
 white lacquer 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.149
 orly league final this is an opaque 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 black paint 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.440
 and I use a number of saté frogs 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.480
 you can still have a palette or a lot 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.220
 Use a piece of aluminum foil to make the 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.830
 to laugh or to make with one 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.689
 I stick saté stick in the white nail polish 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 and then i'm going to have a sort of comma on my 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.159
 make a nail only slightly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.049
 otherwise first go even bigger for the front 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 to make 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.439
 and because I aim for a top and sand patch 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.630
 you are the bottom 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.250
 just i need a little bumpy them 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.619
 easiest is to order a creamy 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.590
 to do or not effects 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:34.340
 mentioned below but this also wants 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:38.690
 and then I make a point of it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.380
 and then I'll make the edges 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.380
 slightly nicer 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.219
 the white paint is now quite thick 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.930
 applied must first completely 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.760
 dry before we face it 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.590
 make fairy tales on it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.980
 in the meantime I am already writing the text 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.780
 how or something on my ring finger i go 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.060
 see what fits 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.060
 and yes then we go there 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.250
 then I go with another 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.670
 skewer you can also do the back 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.710
 use again in a black lacquer and now 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 I go and yes the face you make and 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:03.990
 actually that is very easy 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.730
 I make 2 big spots like eyes and you 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.810
 You can choose a bit of the shape yourself 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.810
 cut a wedge of oil drops from this one 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.080
 quite large with a little tip 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080
 above 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.840
 a mouth 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.220
 so I have the nails on all of them 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.750
 fairy tales you see a fairy tales now 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.940
 and the surface 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.680
 what is in itself this is very nice 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.880
 effect only that will be faster 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.560
 wear off 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.600
 therefore it gives a top coat 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.160
 and for halloween I find a matt effect 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.770
 then very beautiful and then come the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.100
 glitter too, yes, I like that 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.410
 self 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.380
 so i bring the nail art special effect 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.330
 topper in sas touch by essence 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.060
 in this gives a very nice matte or 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.990
 a semi matte matte effect so it is 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:17.560
 not completely super matte but it is 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:19.660
 just not just them anymore and then this is it 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.220
 ultimately the result so you have 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.680
 actually a whole in no time 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.730
 nice halloween nails and you would like them 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.040
 possibly of course also 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.920
 used to sit there 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.870
 what is already in a few weeks I hope 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.370
 don't forget that you liked them 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.770

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.660
