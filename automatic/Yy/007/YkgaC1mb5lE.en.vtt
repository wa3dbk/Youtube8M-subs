00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 spring summer 2015 collection the north 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.150
 face shoe for three years in ultra mtb a 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.320
 innovative fresh product 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.600
 revolutionary in its segment 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.019
 not so much as a product concept 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.560
 because it is the classic cross print and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.900
 well we say present in stores in the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 world of 3 run our big news 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.430
 is related to the type of compound sole that 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.579
 he wants us to say in the sense that 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.399
 vibrate ok up to 4 a world vibrates 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.899
 very well known trigger sole al 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.600
 number one at the level of man but the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.690
 type of fiber used for a tremor 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.739
 ie the brand new innovative vibram 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.609
 mega grip and mega grip is a brand new one 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.710
 conception created by the Italian iii that 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.260
 allows in this case the author admits 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.460
 to have a resistance in terms of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.650
 abrasion resistance therefore on 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 uneven ground never seen before e 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.229
 especially as it is vibrating in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.689
 especially in the wet the test 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.259
 stunning especially on tweets on 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.330
 wet granite from a consistency 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.940
 an outlet to the runway never seen before 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.640
 recreating a little what the effect of 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.450
 a crampon in the use of ice the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.410
 all then cultivated by this 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.530
 tessellation and therefore this package 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.200
 very very pronounced ideal of the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.350
 context then use grass mud 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.330
 so the dirt soil is muddy but not 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 only then also at the crisis level of 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.430
 sarah both intensive use 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.070
 because in addition to the speech of the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 mixes negativity in the medial part 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.760
 of the shoe is inserted a small 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.140
 non-existent insole irrelevant in 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.229
 weight terms 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.990
 macheda protection which thus gives this 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.080
 part therefore very very protective to 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.350
 so tragic rocks that are therefore 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.440
 also ideal for intensive use 15 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.930
 scree on the ideal scree in the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.459
 general concept therefore also for competitions 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.990
 of km vertically very well to race of 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.880
 medium distance on the ground a lot 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.320
 wavy very uneven 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.150
 important 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.459
 the whole thing is this with regards to 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.800
 the underside of the shoe as far as 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.260
 regards the rest online therefore very much 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.930
 slender from our design 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.660
 geo disco therefore that characterizes the whole 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.970
 the collection 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.230
 of the north face shoes at hermes 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 in the area of ​​the toe of the shoe 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.130
 completely revised compared to others 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.860
 types of shoes in the collection a 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.510
 bit more protective to be in this 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.300
 case in the shoe by three in the subject 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.520
 so the shoes grow another place 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.980
 very much more protective as well 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.230
 in the area then the tip then the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.480
 a little more delicate part is certain 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.820
 very very abrasion resistant 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.360
 reflective teachers as well as a 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.640
 level of us in the tip area 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.560
 bettina for the dirt of the sand in the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.290
 inner part then to prevent that 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.130
 sand or other parts entering the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.320
 shoe a locked tongue 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.570
 inside then to allow any 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.940
 comfort and a lot of adjustment 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.120
 important thin just not to 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.380
 going to impact in the bow area 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.500
 medial of the foot and to conclude in the 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.930
 lateral part of the heel which 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.510
 guarantees this very fit 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.880
 comfortable so very accommodating and 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.490
 ideal for all types of fit 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.550
 par excellence of the shoe a fit 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.590
 neutral but ideal for use in addition to 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 three years and on hiking use 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.780
 better quiet at 360 degrees as you wish 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.200
 the great tradition of shoes from 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.740
