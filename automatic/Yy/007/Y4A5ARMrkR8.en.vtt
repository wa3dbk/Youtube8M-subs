00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
where she trying to bite her way out but

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.050 
where she trying to bite her way out but
I<00:02:17.070> kind<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.130> hang<00:02:18.280> my<00:02:18.400> snares<00:02:18.700> a<00:02:18.760> little<00:02:18.940> higher

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
I kind of hang my snares a little higher

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.979 
I kind of hang my snares a little higher
so<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:20.650> get<00:02:21.610> wrapped<00:02:21.820> up<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.450> theoretically

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
so I get wrapped up and theoretically

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.540 
so I get wrapped up and theoretically
don't<00:02:23.200> chew<00:02:23.470> out<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.070> obvious<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
don't chew out and so obvious on this

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.080 
don't chew out and so obvious on this
one<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:24.790> worked

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
one it worked

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.220 
one it worked
but<00:02:25.980> anyway<00:02:26.980> pretty<00:02:27.280> excited<00:02:27.519> about<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
but anyway pretty excited about that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.870 
but anyway pretty excited about that
first<00:02:29.230> check<00:02:29.380> today<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.890> move<00:02:30.580> on<00:02:30.700> down<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
first check today so move on down the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.860 
first check today so move on down the
line<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.239> else<00:02:31.390> what's<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.290> today

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
line and see else what's going on today

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.350 
line and see else what's going on today
well<00:02:34.870> apparently<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.290> need<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.910> meal<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.030> think<00:02:37.060> it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
well apparently I need a meal I think it

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.930 
well apparently I need a meal I think it
was<00:02:37.450> actually<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.870> male<00:02:38.050> a<00:02:38.760> little<00:02:39.760> closer

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
was actually a male a little closer

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.500 
was actually a male a little closer
anyway<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.670> I<00:02:42.850> was<00:02:43.120> thinking<00:02:43.300> it's<00:02:43.390> pretty

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
anyway but I was thinking it's pretty

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.350 
anyway but I was thinking it's pretty
big<00:02:43.720> for<00:02:43.750> for<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.620> female<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.220> know<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> little

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
big for for a female so know a little

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.449 
big for for a female so know a little
better<00:02:46.510> inspection<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.260> turns<00:02:48.100> eyes<00:02:48.220> nice

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
better inspection and turns eyes nice

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.199 
better inspection and turns eyes nice

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
down white you know I guess that's what

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.330 
down white you know I guess that's what
happens<00:03:52.909> when<00:03:53.260> someone<00:03:54.260> beats<00:03:54.409> you<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.680> trap

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
happens when someone beats you you trap

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.220 
happens when someone beats you you trap
like<00:03:55.549> somebody<00:03:56.239> or<00:03:56.299> to<00:03:56.389> eat<00:03:56.510> my<00:03:56.629> possum<00:03:59.139> and<00:04:00.139> I

like somebody or to eat my possum and I

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.920 
like somebody or to eat my possum and I
