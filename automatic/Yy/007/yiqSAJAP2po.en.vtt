00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
little bit of an angle and then you're

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.050 
little bit of an angle and then you're
just<00:03:55.650> snapping<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.160> expands<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.610> plastic

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
just snapping it expands the plastic
