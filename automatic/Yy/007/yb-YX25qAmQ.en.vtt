00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
all right folks I'm back all right well

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.110 
all right folks I'm back all right well
as<00:00:04.259> you<00:00:04.440> can<00:00:04.560> see<00:00:04.830> I've<00:00:04.950> removed<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.490> camshaft

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
as you can see I've removed the camshaft

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.730 
as you can see I've removed the camshaft
position<00:00:06.540> sensor<00:00:07.020> there<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.379> is

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
position sensor there it is

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.799 
position sensor there it is
now<00:00:08.639> immediately<00:00:09.830> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:11.010> see<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
now immediately you can see the

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.390 
now immediately you can see the
connector<00:00:12.809> terminal<00:00:13.410> plug<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:14.580> broken

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
connector terminal plug is broken

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.510 
connector terminal plug is broken
interesting<00:00:17.930> how<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.990> happened<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.890> couldn't

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
interesting how that happened I couldn't

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.250 
interesting how that happened I couldn't
say<00:00:23.390> someone<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.420> guess<00:00:24.600> must<00:00:25.019> have<00:00:25.140> been

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
say someone I guess must have been

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.890 
say someone I guess must have been
working<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:25.710> there<00:00:25.859> before<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
working down there before and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.050 
working down there before and
accidentally<00:00:28.010> hit<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.550> didn't<00:00:29.910> notice

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
accidentally hit it and didn't notice

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.520 
accidentally hit it and didn't notice
but<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.320> couldn't<00:00:31.590> say<00:00:31.859> all<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.759> is

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
but I really couldn't say all I know is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.389 
but I really couldn't say all I know is
this<00:00:34.530> pretty<00:00:34.950> much<00:00:35.690> means<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.129> can't

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
this pretty much means that it you can't

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.830 
this pretty much means that it you can't
really<00:00:38.489> connect<00:00:39.000> anything<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.629> anymore

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
really connect anything in there anymore

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.250 
really connect anything in there anymore
all<00:00:40.110> because<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.680> plastic<00:00:41.480> plug<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.870> pretty

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
all because the plastic plug is pretty

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
all because the plastic plug is pretty
much<00:00:43.410> broken<00:00:43.710> though<00:00:43.920> yeah<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
much broken though yeah I know the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
much broken though yeah I know the
context<00:00:45.450> still<00:00:45.690> look<00:00:45.870> good<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> try<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
context still look good but you try to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
context still look good but you try to
plug<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.809> gonna

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
plug it back and now it's just not gonna

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
plug it back and now it's just not gonna
stay<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.010> unfortunately<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.879> means<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
stay in so unfortunately that means the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.160 
stay in so unfortunately that means the
sensor<00:00:52.530> has<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.010> replaced<00:00:53.870> I've<00:00:54.870> already

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
sensor has to be replaced I've already

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
sensor has to be replaced I've already
got<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> new<00:00:55.620> sensor<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> do

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
got a new sensor but what I want to do

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
got a new sensor but what I want to do
right<00:00:57.539> now<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.960> take<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> closer<00:00:58.710> look<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.160> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
right now is take a closer look at that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
right now is take a closer look at that
wiring<00:00:59.789> because<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.180> noticed<00:01:00.570> as<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.840> took<00:01:01.050> it

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
wiring because I noticed as I took it

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.200 
wiring because I noticed as I took it
off<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.649> harness<00:01:02.309> around<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.879> looked<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
off the harness around that looked a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.530 
off the harness around that looked a
little<00:01:03.390> iffy<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.610> wanna<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> get

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
little iffy I wanna see if I can get

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.320 
little iffy I wanna see if I can get
down<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:06.930> take<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.140> closer<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
down there and take a closer look at it

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.890 
down there and take a closer look at it
that<00:01:09.330> means<00:01:09.600> I'm<00:01:09.900> gonna<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.729> this

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
that means I'm gonna have to this

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.730 
that means I'm gonna have to this
overflow<00:01:12.900> tank<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> way<00:01:14.100> again<00:01:18.740> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
overflow tank out of the way again this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.300 
overflow tank out of the way again this
car<00:01:20.009> being<00:01:20.310> uh<00:01:20.600> this<00:01:21.600> car<00:01:21.900> being<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.320> basically

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
car being uh this car being a basically

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.990 
car being uh this car being a basically
a<00:01:23.369> rebadged<00:01:23.850> Cadillac<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.799> tend<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> find

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a rebadged Cadillac you tend to find

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.390 
a rebadged Cadillac you tend to find
quite<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> few<00:01:27.509> things<00:01:28.430> now<00:01:29.430> what<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.390> do

quite a few things now what I want to do

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.190 
quite a few things now what I want to do
hopefully<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.939> right<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
hopefully is get right down in there and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
hopefully is get right down in there and
take<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> harness<00:01:36.150> sorry

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
take a good look at the harness sorry

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.149 
take a good look at the harness sorry
guys

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
guys

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.780 
guys
right<00:01:38.159> down<00:01:39.110> there<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:43.290> can<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.920> closely

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right down there you can see closely

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.020 
right down there you can see closely
there's<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> opening<00:01:46.140> where<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.729> main<00:01:47.729> part

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
there's the opening where the main part

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
there's the opening where the main part
of<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> camshaft<00:01:48.689> sensor<00:01:48.869> goes<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of the camshaft sensor goes into and of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.649 
of the camshaft sensor goes into and of
course<00:01:50.189> there's<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.640> plug<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.299> talked<00:01:51.540> about

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
course there's the plug I talked about

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.310 
course there's the plug I talked about
in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.960> last<00:01:52.140> video<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.840> right<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in the last video but right there the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
in the last video but right there the
harness<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:55.950> down<00:01:56.159> there<00:01:56.399> what's<00:01:56.610> dark<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
harness right down there what's dark I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.690 
harness right down there what's dark I
noticed<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.829> middle<00:01:59.130> bracket<00:01:59.579> that

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
noticed that the middle bracket that

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.580 
noticed that the middle bracket that
that<00:01:59.880> sensors<00:02:00.360> connected<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.229> kind<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
that sensors connected to was kind of

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.130 
that sensors connected to was kind of
digging<00:02:02.009> into<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.509> should<00:02:03.960> also

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
digging into it now I should also

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.380 
digging into it now I should also
mention<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.740> I'm<00:02:05.040> also<00:02:05.250> getting<00:02:05.549> codes<00:02:06.000> for

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
mention that I'm also getting codes for

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.380 
mention that I'm also getting codes for
the<00:02:07.049> oxygen<00:02:07.710> sensor<00:02:08.190> heater<00:02:08.459> circuit<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.179> this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the oxygen sensor heater circuit in this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.809 
the oxygen sensor heater circuit in this
car

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
car

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.839 
car
and<00:02:10.290> I've<00:02:11.290> got<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> hunch<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.579> might

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
and I've got a hunch that that might

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.240 
and I've got a hunch that that might
have<00:02:13.090> something<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.629> do<00:02:13.780> with<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.109> I<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:15.099> to

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
have something to do with it I have to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.750 
have something to do with it I have to
do<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.430> little<00:02:15.640> bit<00:02:15.819> more<00:02:15.849> testing<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:17.760> that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
do a little bit more testing but that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.580 
do a little bit more testing but that
just<00:02:19.000> might<00:02:19.180> be<00:02:19.390> my<00:02:19.540> problem<00:02:20.049> there<00:02:20.290> hopefully

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
just might be my problem there hopefully

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.179 
just might be my problem there hopefully
if<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.579> that<00:02:21.849> I'm<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.540> gonna<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.920> go

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
if not that I'm just gonna have to go

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.429 
if not that I'm just gonna have to go
through<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.150> wiring<00:02:25.390> diagram<00:02:25.569> trace

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
through and get a wiring diagram trace

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.940 
through and get a wiring diagram trace
the<00:02:26.620> circuit<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.959> try<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.049> find<00:02:29.439> the<00:02:29.680> problem

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the circuit and try to find the problem

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.550 
the circuit and try to find the problem
there<00:02:30.310> it's<00:02:31.299> gonna<00:02:31.480> be<00:02:31.659> fun<00:02:31.900> especially<00:02:32.019> on

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
there it's gonna be fun especially on

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.899 
there it's gonna be fun especially on
this<00:02:32.739> engine<00:02:33.129> which<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:33.310> notoriously

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
this engine which is notoriously

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.629 
this engine which is notoriously
difficult<00:02:34.359> to<00:02:34.750> work<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.430> love<00:02:36.609> a

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
difficult to work on but I love a

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.190 
difficult to work on but I love a
challenge<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.340> anyway<00:02:39.700> I'm<00:02:40.599> gonna<00:02:40.780> go<00:02:40.870> ahead

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
challenge but anyway I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.589 
challenge but anyway I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:41.379> I'm<00:02:41.439> going<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:42.000> take<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.030> closer<00:02:43.299> look<00:02:43.420> at

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
and I'm going to take a closer look at

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.110 
and I'm going to take a closer look at
that<00:02:43.629> harness<00:02:44.079> I'm<00:02:44.470> gonna<00:02:44.790> pop<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.090> new

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
that harness I'm gonna pop in a new

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.770 
that harness I'm gonna pop in a new
camshaft<00:02:46.720> position<00:02:47.109> sensor<00:02:47.889> and<00:02:48.780> fix

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
camshaft position sensor and fix

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.390 
camshaft position sensor and fix
anything<00:02:50.230> else<00:02:50.379> along<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.829> way<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.129> I<00:02:51.159> can

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
anything else along the way that I can

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.179 
anything else along the way that I can
see<00:02:51.669> while<00:02:51.879> I've<00:02:52.000> got<00:02:52.209> this<00:02:52.359> all<00:02:52.540> apart<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
see while I've got this all apart and

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.649 
see while I've got this all apart and
hopefully<00:02:54.189> that'll<00:02:54.700> take<00:02:55.030> care<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.419> least

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
hopefully that'll take care of the least

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.470 
hopefully that'll take care of the least
that<00:02:55.870> small<00:02:56.650> part<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:57.069> the<00:02:57.549> long<00:02:58.120> list<00:02:58.359> of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
that small part of the long list of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.159 
that small part of the long list of
problems<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:59.109> this<00:02:59.290> car<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.480> anyways<00:03:01.930> that's

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:02.169 
problems on this car so anyways that's

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.020 
problems on this car so anyways that's
it<00:03:02.349> for<00:03:02.560> now<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:04.150> will<00:03:05.370> probably<00:03:06.370> give<00:03:06.760> another

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
it for now I will probably give another

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.059 
it for now I will probably give another
video<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.870> another<00:03:08.019> update<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.560> what<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.829> got

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
video of another update of what I got

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.309 
video of another update of what I got
going<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:09.400> later<00:03:09.720> there's<00:03:10.720> plenty<00:03:11.109> of<00:03:11.139> other

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
going on later there's plenty of other

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.559 
going on later there's plenty of other
things<00:03:11.409> I'm<00:03:11.799> doing<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:12.220> this<00:03:12.370> car<00:03:12.430> but<00:03:12.970> today

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
things I'm doing to this car but today

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.050 
things I'm doing to this car but today
I'm<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:13.930> focusing<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.739> sensor<00:03:15.959> so

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I'm just focusing on this sensor so

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.870 
I'm just focusing on this sensor so
until<00:03:19.060> next<00:03:19.209> time<00:03:19.479> peace
