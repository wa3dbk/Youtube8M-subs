00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.979 
EGR which is exhaust gas recirculation
my<00:02:26.570> system<00:02:27.290> adds<00:02:27.530> an<00:02:28.310> extra<00:02:28.880> exhaust<00:02:29.570> valve

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
my system adds an extra exhaust valve

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.500 
my system adds an extra exhaust valve
into<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.890> head<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.459> engine<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.000> that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
into the head of the engine and that

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.960 
into the head of the engine and that
exhaust<00:02:32.840> valve<00:02:33.109> is<00:02:33.320> purely<00:02:33.859> but<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:34.760> all

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
exhaust valve is purely but it's all

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.289 
exhaust valve is purely but it's all
stats<00:02:35.359> the<00:02:35.720> circulation<00:02:36.790> improves<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
stats the circulation improves the

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.300 
stats the circulation improves the
real-world<00:02:38.480> fuel<00:02:38.930> economy<00:02:39.380> reduces

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
real-world fuel economy reduces

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.039 
real-world fuel economy reduces
real-world<00:02:41.060> emissions<00:02:41.510> so<00:02:41.720> all<00:02:41.900> those

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
real-world emissions so all those

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.910 
real-world emissions so all those
contributions<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:43.010> co2<00:02:43.400> yeah<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.920> very

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
contributions to co2 yeah and very

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.289 
contributions to co2 yeah and very
nicely<00:02:46.100> has<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> strong<00:02:46.640> synergy<00:02:47.060> we've

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
nicely has a strong synergy we've

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.490 
nicely has a strong synergy we've
downsized<00:02:47.799> gasoline<00:02:48.799> engines

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
downsized gasoline engines

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.860 
downsized gasoline engines
they<00:02:51.500> are<00:02:51.620> really<00:02:51.770> pleased<00:02:52.099> to<00:02:52.190> present<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.670> my

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
they are really pleased to present to my

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.490 
they are really pleased to present to my
invention<00:02:53.870> which<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.200> called<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
invention which is called the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.070 
invention which is called the
significant<00:02:55.129> brake<00:02:55.340> system<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.480> my<00:02:56.690> idea<00:02:56.870> was

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
significant brake system so my idea was

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.110 
significant brake system so my idea was
actually<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.680> combine<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.370> main<00:02:58.519> advantages

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
actually to combine the main advantages

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.369 
actually to combine the main advantages
of<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.420> drama<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.900> discrete

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
of the drama and the discrete

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.690 
of the drama and the discrete
eliminating<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.519> disadvantages<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:03.489> can<00:03:04.489> have

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
eliminating the disadvantages I can have

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.000 
eliminating the disadvantages I can have
a<00:03:04.730> size<00:03:05.150> reduction<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.260> overall<00:03:06.620> assembly

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
a size reduction of the overall assembly

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.690 
a size reduction of the overall assembly
so<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.420> means<00:03:08.660> that<00:03:09.190> also<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> weight<00:03:10.489> reduction

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
so it means that also a weight reduction

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.180 
so it means that also a weight reduction
and<00:03:11.269> size<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.110> weight<00:03:12.230> reduction<00:03:12.769> means<00:03:12.920> also

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and size and weight reduction means also

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.809 
and size and weight reduction means also
I<00:03:13.489> natural<00:03:13.910> deduction<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.110> actual

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
I natural deduction so the actual

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.820 
I natural deduction so the actual
dynamic<00:03:16.819> performances<00:03:17.599> of<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.930> car<00:03:18.140> will<00:03:18.709> be

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
dynamic performances of the car will be

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.680 
dynamic performances of the car will be
improved<00:03:19.190> because<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.120> going<00:03:20.239> to<00:03:20.330> be<00:03:20.450> more

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
improved because it's going to be more

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.850 
improved because it's going to be more
reactive<00:03:21.730> especially<00:03:22.730> in<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.910> corner<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.860> so

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
reactive especially in the corner and so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.110 
reactive especially in the corner and so
the<00:03:25.010> handling<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.640> improved<00:03:27.010> I'm<00:03:28.120> ecstatic

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
the handling is improved I'm ecstatic

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.940 
the handling is improved I'm ecstatic
and<00:03:29.660> very<00:03:29.870> pleased<00:03:30.140> to<00:03:30.319> reach<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.650> final

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
and very pleased to reach the final

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.460 
and very pleased to reach the final
three<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:32.510> know<00:03:32.660> all<00:03:32.810> that<00:03:32.900> hard<00:03:33.140> work<00:03:33.200> has

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
three and to know all that hard work has

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.180 
three and to know all that hard work has
paid<00:03:33.709> off<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.540> very<00:03:35.540> pleased<00:03:35.780> I<00:03:36.190> really

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
paid off and very pleased I really

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.100 
paid off and very pleased I really
enjoyed<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.670> mapped<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.360> hasn't<00:03:38.840> sunk<00:03:38.930> in

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
enjoyed it I mapped it hasn't sunk in

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.839 
enjoyed it I mapped it hasn't sunk in
yet<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:39.829> know<00:03:39.950> actually<00:03:40.370> through<00:03:40.730> the
