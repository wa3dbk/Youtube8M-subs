00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.710
 gta san andreas marked a generation 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.809
 can easily be placed between 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.480
 the best games ever released 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.170
 story someone doubts a world game 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.019
 open that with missions details and much 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 plus many easter eggs it's no wonder that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 We are in the fifth part and it is in this wave 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.020
 I start gta san andreas 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.149
 the best and serec of the game part 5 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.730
 the first premiere of today's video only 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 with a mystery for many players 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.070
 all because when they were inside 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.390
 of area 69 prevented a crowbar in 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 on a table 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
 Why the hell has a crowbar in 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 on a table if you can not enter 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.300
 can not catch can not do anything and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 after much vascular on the internet 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.649
 I discovered that this is a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 reference to a half life game because 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.589
 who has played knows that one of the main 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.430
 guns of the game is the foot of each and they of the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.439
 reference 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 if you pay close attention to the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 adaptations of the 69 gta san andreas do 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.540
 reference to that is black table, right? 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.520
 game and it's very cool this one is good 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 interesting, I do not know how to tell you 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.560
 if an easter egg or if it is a bug or a 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.900
 A little of the two do not know but in any 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.590
 case of tattoos 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.380
 look in the mirror and go friend's rifle and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.710
 see what happens just pops up 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.990
 on the mirror screen is people walking a 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.790
 machine gun sometimes has a 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.399
 person there are more than one 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.110
 but it's quite weird curious and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.180
 interesting not 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.340
 now an easter egg to prove that the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.049
 rockstar is always one step ahead 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.210
 of its competitors 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.159
 by this time you already 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.920

 here from the time of greeting and until 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 even the size of the bridge how to 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.150
 they spent 1.27 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 I hit a legal act even from a census 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 of rockstar and this detail that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.940
 makes the difference in big expensive games 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.620
