00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 whoever is gambling also seeks one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.879
 Challenge 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 after all, it would be lame to play 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.780
 pure interactive movies without 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 own performance 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.519
 some games even care about it 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.269
 the player to its limits too 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.609
 demand 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.270
 and so a special sense of achievement too 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.670
 create 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.439
 others simply worry about bad 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 balancing or leveldesign for 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.330
 inappropriate frustration moments and such 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 Some keyboard must later with got a 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.199
 tec directed so many controllers 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 be fished out of the corner again 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.130
 we have ten examples for games 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.180
 collected us again and again 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.100
 frustrate 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.230
 but we still like somehow 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.239
 play and because ten are not enough 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.520
 we will soon be a second part 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 reloading 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.320
 Super meat boy is a super meat boy 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.360
 Candidate who wants to be frustrating 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 First, the player in this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.500
 jump'n'run parody still ridiculous 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.420
 then face simple levels 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.120
 however, it is screened out quickly like a 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.890
 real platform expert is and at 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.110
 super meat boy means that 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 protagonist dies bloody and fast 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 over and over again 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.930
 the levels are relatively short loading times 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.939
 not available the threshold it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.270
 always trying again is so very 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.270
 low 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.840
 dragon slayer dragon's lair is 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.000
 cartoon frustration 1983 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 enchanted animated legend don 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.680
 bluth gambling hall gamblers with a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 incredible graphics the game behind 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.280
 dragon's lair, on the other hand, is at most 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.200
 rudimentary today we would do it one 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.140
 call episode of quicktime events 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.180
 basically a short film is left empty 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.490
 to be a knight of a princess before 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.860
 A kite must rescue every scene 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.630
 deadly dangers lurk on knights dirk 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.280
 and if the player is not on time 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.170
 mighty button expresses relative 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.479
 start right from the beginning 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 until the animations are forever in the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.770
 retina have burned 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.190
 gothic 3 gothic 3 it could be on like that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.110
 many levels are frustrating when it does 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.149
 again crashed when saving 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.519
 we hopelessly in the graph 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.260
 Festakt if we noticed that the open 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.910
 world approach any form of a 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.989
 dramaturgically meaningful storyline 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.790
 had been sacrificed 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.560
 or simply at the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.510
 first time encounter with wild boar 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.239
 their successful attack ours 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.220
 nameless hero in an animation 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.290
 sent by the inevitable 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.510
 useless succession attacks so 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.690
 long lasting until the hero dead on the ground 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:36.130
 was 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.590
 it went to 6.3 so a final 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.410
 death without level reboot or save games 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 for some a wont for others totally 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.390
 trendy the feature also meets us in 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.700
 the binding of isaac by edmund mcmillen 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.430
 the already super meat boy on the 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.560
 unleashed the indie game with the world 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.930
 sell such gameplay has defied 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.790
 or because of his level of difficulty 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.920
 By the way, it will sell extremely well 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.170
 This does not easier that we here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.239
 at the beginning naked and helpless infant 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.030
 play in a dungeon fuller 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:12.250
 monster must survive the xcom series 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.230
 the current ex com is already one 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.910
 quite a bit frustrating 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.549
 but it is still very difficult 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.120
 partly because the original series is terror 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.280
 front 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.010
 the developers made the title like that 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.540
 so heavy that many round tactics 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.220
 fans, the teeth hard nut to it 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.180
 and the reason was one 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.600
 misunderstanding 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.760
 fans of the 1st 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.470
 had row after row over the deal too 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.860
 low level of difficulty 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.920
 so micro pros highlighted this clearly 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.900
 the problem with the original ex kombi 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.940
 actually not exactly 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.250
 just any player who complains 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.380
 had been victim of a bug 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.810
 who set the difficulty to easy 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.730
 had in part 2 then had fun 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.490
 doing the same mission always and 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.590
 to play again and again 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.600
 dark souls at dark souls is the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.120
 difficulty level the most salient 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.890
 feature the role-playing game is based on it 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.330
 that the player struggles everything 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.160
 even worked out and that 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.160
 experience of success in the event of a triumph 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 then the greater the consequence 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.250
 the fighting is almost inhuman 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.020
 hard and even the developers do 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.000
 hard to stand here 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.400
 By the way, whoever bites the grass loses 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.960
 everyone sees the game currency that they 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.890
 but at the place of his death again 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.380
 gather in 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.880
 but who on the way there again 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.530
 This one may aim from his own 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.510
 finally say goodbye 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.070
 and that is through the respawn of all 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.070
 opponents are not exactly unlikely 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.490
 Daisy playing multiplayer are often 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.710
 the teammates are the reason for the frustration 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.040
 and so are in zombie mode for arma 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.900
 2 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.970
 not just the undead ones 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.720
 real enemy but also the same 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.730
 mitspieler 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.830
 who starts his career in it 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.720
 It starts with a minimal equipment 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.760
 and so who better a creak or 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.590
 has found a second dose of beans 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.210
 guard these treasures jealously and 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520
 bangs the newcomer 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.590
 for safety's sake, off and on 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.360
 if its just the first can bottom 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.350
 then he has them after the 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.400
 respawn again go search mafia 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.350
 it gets annoying when you actually play 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.460
 are not particularly hard individual 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.590
 but suddenly missions 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.230
 come disproportionately violent therefore 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.150
 that you are running against a wall mafia 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.800
 such a game clearly through evil 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.480
 Surprises could be found throughout 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.400
 game apparently without any special reason 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.990
 spoon deliver the mission on the 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.430
 race track, however, is still general 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.500
 once harder than ten numbers 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.300
 according to the developer, this is classified 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.400
 game for a steering wheel but hardly thought 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.110
 one of the players used such an am 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.880
 the end was the difficulty of 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.880
 mafia adjusted by patch 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.530
 the need for speed series for frustration 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.570
 made the immense 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.490
 successful racing series need for 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.590
 speed every now and again the lack of one 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.510
 real ki that by the elastic band 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.090
 effect should be compensated 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.800
 means the computer opponents adapt 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.990
 the driving speed of the player 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.320
 stay in extreme cases even if 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.340
 he does so for a more active one 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.500
 action-packed race to care 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.690
 extremely stupid only if the player 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.370
 perfect race is driven and short 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.140
 ahead of the finishing straight from others 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.550
 Vehicles will overtake you 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.690
 actually left far behind 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:20.240
 had extreme extremely got us started 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.160
 90s one who teaches a death star 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.320
 either wants to attack 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.230
 does at his side or very much 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.450
 luck and patience the trench run at the end 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.249
 the game changed in 90 percent of the game 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.769
 not so good 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:37.199
 if you and the joystick ever up 

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:39.119
 could hold on to it in extremely white 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.929
 Not only are all controls difficult 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:42.029
 inculcate 

00:06:39.929 --> 00:06:44.099
 also most of the missions were great 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:46.769
 violent and often only helped dull 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:49.169
 memorize once upon where which 

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:51.239
 Schwader but that's exactly how we wanted it 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.579
 at that time and still today in the old age 

00:06:51.239 --> 00:06:54.299
 We can look back on our successes back then 

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:56.549
 be proud 

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:58.259
 that was part 1 of ours 

00:06:56.549 --> 00:07:00.029
 frustrating heavy games of those 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.829
 we still can not get away 

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.829
 look for part 2 and see you later
