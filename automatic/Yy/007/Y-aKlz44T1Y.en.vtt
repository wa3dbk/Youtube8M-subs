years<00:04:59.699> later<00:04:59.900> just<00:05:00.900> looking<00:05:01.169> at<00:05:01.259> that<00:05:01.379> model

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
years later just looking at that model

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.619 
years later just looking at that model
looking<00:05:02.039> at<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.550> light<00:05:02.729> shining<00:05:03.180> through<00:05:03.300> the

looking at the light shining through the
few<00:05:03.810> slides<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:05.389> wondering<00:05:06.389> how<00:05:06.569> that<00:05:06.810> all

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
few slides and wondering how that all

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.800 
few slides and wondering how that all
went<00:05:07.110> together<00:05:07.289> and<00:05:08.389> in<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.479> weeks<00:05:09.659> that

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
went together and in the weeks that

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.619 
went together and in the weeks that
followed<00:05:10.349> Larry<00:05:11.069> presented<00:05:11.759> a<00:05:11.970> building

was like one or two nights a week and
the<00:05:19.740> first<00:05:19.949> models<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.430> we<00:05:20.520> built<00:05:20.759> were<00:05:21.659> one

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
the first models that we built were one

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.960 
the first models that we built were one
night<00:05:22.319> 16s<00:05:22.979> which<00:05:23.069> is<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.370> smaller<00:05:23.729> version

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
night 16s which is the smaller version

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.149 
night 16s which is the smaller version
of<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.419> it's<00:05:25.169> all<00:05:25.289> built<00:05:25.530> up<00:05:25.710> fuselage

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
of that it's all built up fuselage

of that it's all built up fuselage
tissue<00:05:26.550> covered<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.319> he<00:05:28.319> walked<00:05:28.560> us<00:05:28.740> through

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
tissue covered and he walked us through

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.649 
tissue covered and he walked us through
every<00:05:29.310> part<00:05:29.699> of<00:05:29.819> how<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.030> build<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.389> model

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
every part of how to build a model

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
to cover it with tissue paper one thing

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.420 
to cover it with tissue paper one thing
we<00:05:36.629> didn't<00:05:36.900> do<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.349> we<00:05:37.379> didn't<00:05:37.740> use<00:05:38.129> dope

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
we didn't do is we didn't use dope

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.550 
we didn't do is we didn't use dope
because<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.719> librarians<00:05:40.229> would<00:05:40.319> have<00:05:40.440> kicked

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
because the librarians would have kicked

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.100 
because the librarians would have kicked
us<00:05:40.710> out<00:05:40.860> if<00:05:41.069> we<00:05:41.159> opened<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.460> jar<00:05:41.639> to<00:05:41.789> open<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.180> but

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
us out if we opened a jar to open it but

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.950 
us out if we opened a jar to open it but
we<00:05:43.199> used<00:05:43.409> Elmer's<00:05:44.009> glue<00:05:44.190> with<00:05:44.340> white<00:05:44.960> Elmer's

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
we used Elmer's glue with white Elmer's

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.219 
we used Elmer's glue with white Elmer's
glue<00:05:46.139> thinned<00:05:46.409> with<00:05:46.469> water<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.949> cover<00:05:47.129> it<00:05:47.340> and

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
glue thinned with water to cover it and

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.589 
glue thinned with water to cover it and
they<00:05:49.229> flew<00:05:49.469> wonderfully<00:05:50.120> without<00:05:51.120> any<00:05:51.270> effort

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:51.599 
they flew wonderfully without any effort

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:52.939 
they flew wonderfully without any effort
at<00:05:51.690> all<00:05:51.810> you'd<00:05:52.080> wind<00:05:52.349> him<00:05:52.500> up<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.710> they<00:05:52.830> would

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
at all you'd wind him up and they would

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:55.610 
at all you'd wind him up and they would
just<00:05:53.099> take<00:05:53.310> off<00:05:53.460> and<00:05:53.699> fly<00:05:53.759> and<00:05:54.440> it<00:05:55.440> was<00:05:55.590> a

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
just take off and fly and it was a

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.140 
just take off and fly and it was a
wonderful<00:05:56.039> way<00:05:56.159> to<00:05:56.190> get<00:05:56.460> us<00:05:56.550> all<00:05:56.729> hooked<00:05:56.969> on

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
wonderful way to get us all hooked on

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.450 
wonderful way to get us all hooked on
aviation<00:05:59.509> we'd<00:06:00.509> also<00:06:00.810> start<00:06:01.310> playing<00:06:02.310> around

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
aviation we'd also start playing around

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.850 
aviation we'd also start playing around
with<00:06:02.699> like<00:06:03.449> ball<00:06:03.630> sheet<00:06:03.900> balsa<00:06:04.259> gliders<00:06:04.650> and

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
with like ball sheet balsa gliders and

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.820 
with like ball sheet balsa gliders and
things<00:06:05.009> like<00:06:05.159> that<00:06:05.310> to<00:06:05.490> learn<00:06:05.580> aerodynamics

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
things like that to learn aerodynamics

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.040 
things like that to learn aerodynamics
basically<00:06:07.830> all<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:09.029> aerodynamics<00:06:09.659> knowledge

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
basically all the aerodynamics knowledge

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.339 
basically all the aerodynamics knowledge
that<00:06:10.259> I<00:06:10.289> had<00:06:10.909> came<00:06:11.909> when<00:06:12.750> it<00:06:12.779> came<00:06:12.960> time<00:06:13.139> to<00:06:13.199> get

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
that I had came when it came time to get

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:14.870 
that I had came when it came time to get
my<00:06:13.440> private<00:06:13.770> pilot's<00:06:13.889> license<00:06:14.370> was<00:06:14.580> due<00:06:14.759> to

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
my private pilot's license was due to

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.390 
my private pilot's license was due to
modeling<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:15.529> this<00:06:16.529> early<00:06:16.860> years<00:06:17.099> when<00:06:17.279> I<00:06:17.310> was

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
modeling and this early years when I was

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.659 
modeling and this early years when I was
figuring<00:06:17.789> out<00:06:17.909> how<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.150> make<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.509> airplane<00:06:18.840> do

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
figuring out how to make the airplane do

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:26.520 
figuring out how to make the airplane do
what<00:06:20.669> I<00:06:20.699> needed<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:21.120> do

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.999 

that's<00:06:27.530> me<00:06:27.860> I<00:06:28.780> was<00:06:29.780> about<00:06:29.960> ten<00:06:30.289> years<00:06:30.440> old<00:06:30.680> and

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
that's me I was about ten years old and
