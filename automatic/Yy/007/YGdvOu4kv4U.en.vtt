00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hello everyone I'm teaching a little 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.770
 small little tutorial of how they are 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.690
 in the camera of android 4.3 with all 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.960
 the functionalities although with a 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.020
 small asterisk and well we need it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.550
 download this apk that looks good for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.990
 that I have it here that I guess not 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.189
 I'll have it called google camera r-ca 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 point pk is the one that I have 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.470
 which is the same we go is that of 43 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.010
 then first of all it works in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.350
 android 4.2.2 the answers not why 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.910
 because although it is a different sin to the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.700
 gallery that comes to us by default in 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 422 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.830
 it's as if he installed himself on 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.500
 same application directory but 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.660
 then he says no for 412 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.120
 works and for 4 3 and 7 comes that is 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.680
 I think also for 404 for 100 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.520
 sandwiches if it works 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.200
 so good 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
 if you basically install it with a 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.660
 application to the next evil next 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.000
 following 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.780
 that is the application of agreement I'm going to 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.610
 try 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.659
 if all the cables are not picked up 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.189
 You see here and such 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.539
 and it is well logically pointed out the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.540
 options because this is crap this 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:22.080
 is the normal camera then hello hello 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.600
 we have for example the camera back 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.600
 well now I do not know what happens 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.290
 strictly interesting it looks very good 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 and we have here various options for 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.240
 example 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.399
 exceptional sizes we have in both 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 in the normal camera as the camera 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.970
 front so you do not see the ground 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.170
 basically then also less 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.570
 exhibition and we have for example also 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.390
 for the gps, then we have also 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.729
 a timer and tempera balance 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.840
 white is worth as you see here 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.100
 I have put in automatic and the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 front camera options I think that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.080
 they are exactly the same but teach 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.530
 just in case it is also worth here we are 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.720
 the only good the flash and the others 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.010
 we also have a scene worth 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.920
 night party etcetera and we have also 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.470
 the timer and the megapixels 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.750
 depend on camera's camera we can do 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.819
 either by clicking here or by keeping 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.580
 pressed and for one side is very 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.920
 interesting, and we also have a 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540
 Video camera option 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.450
 what is a camera gave very very 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.920
 normalita we can record with flash something 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.280
 interesting for the front camera and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.739
 Rear video quality to choose 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.860
 between these three things there are some here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.660
 to nitrification and white balance 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.730
 then we have a good panorama for 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.660
 do the panoramic thing these is 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 like you comes before 422 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.730
 basically and to make sphere photos of 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 photos but it does not work well because it comes out 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.280
 the image as bent 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.900
 although I have to prove that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.220
 try the beige everyone because if 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.810
 the camera is caught, you have to 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.090
 restart the system organize 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.489
 so that you download what you get x step 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.530
 to do right now and good as before 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.230
 that everything spoils me, so tell them 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.060
 nothing that is an application amalita that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.409
 let's leave in the description and that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.040
 make it progress liked and this person 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.040
 goodbye 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.170
 in a little bit the mining is worth
