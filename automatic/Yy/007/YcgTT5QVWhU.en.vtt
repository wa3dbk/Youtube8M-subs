00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.190
 welcome to all in this section they do not fix easy this 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.690
 emission was long I come back in the arms loaded with gifts like a 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.039
 santa claus of the child 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:11.169
 with a 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:15.699
 a pedal it's called the depression 1 hour per cent and that I brought back 2 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.009
 portland fight for vacation because yes I took a vacation because I have the right 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.140
 6 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.409
 here you are 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.179
 of his pedals are not yet worn but it should not be long because seen 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.939
 the killing that's very frankly where it's really we're in in the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:30.699
 times 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.629
 qualitatively one is in sex and even beyond in terms of 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.309
 creativity what was already hallucinating chain was broadcasting axis the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 so here is the mark is called hours and you've all heard 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.740
 talk about missed suicide or 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.300
 m very moved Monday in mind those same teams that there mark oulala 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.390
 who is aptly named here so cdf and a little 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 France dared for a long time that we had not seen innovation in terms of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.500
 belated late years 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.510
 because I as well have one on the way to signing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 on the same forum we miss the time in this sense 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.750
 do not care a little high so that this pedal makes itunes criminal 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.910
 octave hours and 10 rounds 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.020
 which has the peculiarity of owning a gestory gold 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 and me as a guide it speaks to me of justice knowing that the high level 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.960
 construction is that streit mentioned of entry its limits even one can the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.700
 hack it a little bit by the go anyway and I mean it's 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 really no six goals or 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080
 and then it's part of this pedal family a bit like it did 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.190
 proposes to explain it is going to be 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.730
 those both used for conventional uses 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.400
 and at the same time we can really make a debut 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.500
 sound textures of mentally ill see us 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 to beating up operating in a national jewel on the move 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.220
 So here we have something pretty classic sees a big smoker but 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.480
 really anxious 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.480
 so we can adjust the state must play even less a quarter 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.369
 currently at something quite lumpy da it's nice site then 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.490
 that the sooner is that as the Asec thought when we started the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.029
 spreadsheet we can not wait 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:10.499
 rethink continue when we do not play 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.699
 a gentleman jean-paul anciaux 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:15.699
 for six years his little one but we eat gesticulates 

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:26.029
 So that's not the case it's funny 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.219
 everything is in fact when we move I know if you want to red I think 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:32.069
 that it's from left to right it's the intensity of the farce that changes the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.189
 two as much bar it's going to be she has faith the pitch the chart 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.359
 both the level of these are old records also tempted we 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.159
 can snap we are launched 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.209
 and it's going to be the color 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.389
 the fola the sound color khalkhal october 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.159
 so we engage the two men already it's starting to do some stuff 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.159
 crazy enough we'll say that 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.849
 when I even hear 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.619
 the color of drinking water 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.619
 as for the color of the distortion end of all the colors we see all his 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.469
 call to change it as soon as we move so I know what you're saying that a few 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:24.689
 oppositions a little bit like that 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.299
 extreme times a little bit light 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.299
 One who would not know it yet 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:18.489
 rearward 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.879
 she had put forward 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.660
 I mean songs look alike 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.259
 even behind his big boss 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.889
 besides the pedal compared to the magnitude of tipp and thunderstorms so we 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 can think of the museum with them deal with joystiq looks like that 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:37.620
 it makes me laugh personally 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.600
 so can we say a little more because laure jesus gil will love you 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.059
 did not show much in fact 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.380
 because there are still other modes for example 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.360
 link in mode 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.560
 k -o this is a non-iso mode that are aptly named after the softer job 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.370
 case within 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.450
 so here we have the impression of having a distortion pedal broken 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.659
 caraman a banker fell off a cliff right in front of me i love by sochaux 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.070
 that does not mean anything I think it's great so I'll remind you 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:56.199
 the site of two entities shelter these things from space 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.840
 so is called to avoid them for the human body the pv they can and 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.779
 operates point com 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.360
 that's it can be ordered upstream it's like a bit like is vexed the 

00:06:05.359 --> 00:06:06.589
 300th mans 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.589
 in series not huge no but it can be found here I am 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.589
 I never miss an opportunity to show you indeed who can afford you 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.329
 to assert your personality and your gold hyginex bedridden so here we are if 

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:20.569
 do you like 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.399
 and if you like to shred it are simply if you like a little bit the 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.309
 text that is out of the ordinary if you like the drill I really think 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.550
 you should like that a little bit 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.280
 it's a little bit a thoroughbred for once he tamed me I do not have 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.750
 heard holler I start to swallow it's a little better but here it is 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.039
 Anything super tool for the poultry studio
