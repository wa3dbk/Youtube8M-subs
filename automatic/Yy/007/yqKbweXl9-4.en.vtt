 - Do I understand that you want a confession? - Yes, I want. 

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.700
 It's not entirely confession, I haven't done it yet. 

00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.000
 I'm here for you, Mark. 

00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:17.800
 Is it possible for me to know a woman in the biblical sense? 

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:20.200
 - Are we talking about sex here? - Yes, we're talking. 

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:21.200
 Outside marriage? 

00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.000
 My cock speaks to me, Father Brandon. 

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.500
 My therapist suggested I work with a sex specialist 

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.000
 susceptible to my unusual needs. 

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:35.000
 I feel in my heart that I should bless it. 

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.000
 Do it.

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.000
 - Yes they are. - That was a bad start. 

00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:51.000
 It really was. Can we start again? 

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.300
 - Please start. - I'm not a prostitute. 

00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:54.500
 You don't have to pay me in advance. 

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.000
 And this is a limited number of sessions, and the number is six. 

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:02.000

 We just forget it. 

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:09.500

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.700
 What is it? 

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:24.000
 Start listening to your body's signals. 

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.300
 - So you can control them. - Oh, God! 

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:30.800
 Understand, even among unbelievers, the most common expression 

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.000

 Most of the time, I don't meet my clinics outside of work. 

00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.200
 We don't have much to talk about. I just want people to watch 

00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:56.300
 and they said, hey, who's the cripple with that beautiful blonde? 

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:00.000
 What happens when people start to feel something together? 

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.000
