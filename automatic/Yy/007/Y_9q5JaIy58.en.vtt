00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.800
Maya Gabeira, 26 was surfing a Giant wave
when she fell off the board. The emergency

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.400
team that was in the sea with a jetski went
by her side to save her, but the force of

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.400
the sea made it very difficult.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:37.700
There were many people doing me a sign and when a saw her for a moment, i went ther and she disappeared with the wave, then people start saying to

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
go to the other side of Maya and i did it.
After that i gave her a rope but she didn't

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.000
had any force to hold it and let go. When
i saw she missed the rope for a second time,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:10.000
i realize she was going in direccion of the
Rocks. Then she disappeared with the wave

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000
When she appeared again, i jumped from the jetski and hold her and bring her to the shore.there was a guy helping me on the shore

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.000
because i couldn't do all by myself...he arrived, helped me and then we resurrect her.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.000
The surfer, were helped by the emergency team when she got to the shore

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Thank God i did a resuscitation course last year in Hawai, because if didn't do that i couldn't save her
