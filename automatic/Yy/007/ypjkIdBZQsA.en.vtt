00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
with million or not maybe not millions

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.520 
with million or not maybe not millions
but<00:02:41.090> thousands<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.840> thousands<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> people

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
but thousands and thousands of people

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.110 
but thousands and thousands of people
playing<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.070> they<00:02:43.580> don't<00:02:43.760> seem<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.000> have

playing and they don't seem to have
these<00:02:44.330> problems<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.770> feeling<00:02:46.070> that

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
these problems so I have a feeling that

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.580 
these problems so I have a feeling that
the<00:02:46.310> cloud<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.060> your<00:02:47.210> Xbox<00:02:47.750> could<00:02:48.110> find<00:02:48.410> a
