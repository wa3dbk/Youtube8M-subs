simply pull the bulb straight out the

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.070 
simply pull the bulb straight out the
LED<00:00:41.920> bulbs<00:00:42.310> we<00:00:42.430> will<00:00:42.580> use<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:42.850> polarized<00:00:43.600> so<00:00:43.960> if

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
LED bulbs we will use a polarized so if

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.049 
LED bulbs we will use a polarized so if
you<00:00:44.170> find<00:00:44.440> they<00:00:44.590> do<00:00:44.800> not<00:00:45.010> work<00:00:45.250> simply<00:00:45.790> turn

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
you find they do not work simply turn

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.030 
you find they do not work simply turn
them<00:00:46.180> around<00:00:46.270> within<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.900> socket<00:00:47.110> my<00:00:47.650> next

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
them around within the socket my next

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.979 
them around within the socket my next
step<00:00:48.220> is<00:00:48.340> to<00:00:48.520> remove<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:48.970> gauge<00:00:49.210> face<00:00:49.480> bezel

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
step is to remove the gauge face bezel

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.040 
step is to remove the gauge face bezel
again<00:00:50.890> using<00:00:51.309> our<00:00:51.430> t15<00:00:52.150> Torx<00:00:52.180> driver

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
again using our t15 Torx driver

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.830 
again using our t15 Torx driver
we<00:00:53.290> removed<00:00:53.680> eight<00:00:53.950> screws<00:00:54.340> numbers<00:00:55.330> five<00:00:55.630> and

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
we removed eight screws numbers five and

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.360 
we removed eight screws numbers five and
eight<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.140> removed<00:00:56.559> during<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.920> initial

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
eight I removed during the initial

eight I removed during the initial
cluster<00:00:57.790> pull<00:00:58.030> out<00:00:58.230> we<00:00:59.230> tried<00:00:59.500> different

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
cluster pull out we tried different

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.920 
cluster pull out we tried different
diffuser<00:01:00.250> films<00:01:00.640> to<00:01:00.820> see<00:01:00.850> if<00:01:01.090> replacing<00:01:01.630> just

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
diffuser films to see if replacing just

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.990 
diffuser films to see if replacing just
the<00:01:02.050> film<00:01:02.260> would<00:01:02.410> work<00:01:02.730> sometimes<00:01:03.730> you<00:01:03.880> get

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
the film would work sometimes you get

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.850 
the film would work sometimes you get
lucky<00:01:04.180> in<00:01:04.420> this<00:01:04.540> step<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.110> most<00:01:05.350> often<00:01:05.770> you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
lucky in this step but most often you

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.280 
lucky in this step but most often you
don't<00:01:06.130> this<00:01:07.060> means<00:01:07.390> we<00:01:07.540> need<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.750> remove<00:01:08.110> the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
don't this means we need to remove the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.690 
don't this means we need to remove the
needle<00:01:08.470> from<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.860> gauge<00:01:09.160> face

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.309 

so<00:02:49.520> while<00:02:49.700> we're<00:02:49.849> down<00:02:50.030> here<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.510> lab

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
so while we're down here in the lab

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.199 
so while we're down here in the lab
Davis<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.220> back<00:02:52.400> units<00:02:52.879> I<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.090> to

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
Davis is in the back units I want to

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.030 
Davis is in the back units I want to
take<00:02:53.390> this<00:02:53.540> moment<00:02:53.780> talk<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.739> about<00:02:54.830> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
take this moment talk to you about the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.070 
take this moment talk to you about the
different<00:02:55.430> types<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.819> bulbs<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.360> this

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
different types of bulbs that this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.559 
different types of bulbs that this
application<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.920> work<00:02:58.129> with<00:02:58.370> I'm<00:02:59.120> not<00:02:59.300> sure

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
application can work with I'm not sure

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.150 
application can work with I'm not sure
exactly<00:02:59.900> which<00:03:00.319> one<00:03:00.560> we're<00:03:00.680> gonna<00:03:00.830> go<00:03:01.010> with

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
exactly which one we're gonna go with

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.220 
exactly which one we're gonna go with
yet<00:03:01.430> until<00:03:01.760> we<00:03:01.790> plug<00:03:02.120> them<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.810> look<00:03:03.050> how

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
yet until we plug them in and look how

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.259 
yet until we plug them in and look how
the<00:03:03.290> light<00:03:03.440> dispersion<00:03:04.129> works<00:03:04.400> but<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.120> go

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
the light dispersion works but to go

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.970 
the light dispersion works but to go

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
figure out which one it is we'll put it

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.220 
figure out which one it is we'll put it
in<00:04:10.519> they'll<00:04:11.180> be<00:04:11.209> part<00:04:11.540> of<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.720> light<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.079> so

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
in they'll be part of the light up so

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.020 
in they'll be part of the light up so
you<00:04:12.290> won't<00:04:12.530> have<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.829> guess<00:04:13.069> on<00:04:13.310> which<00:04:13.790> ball

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
you won't have to guess on which ball

you won't have to guess on which ball
will<00:04:14.060> work<00:04:14.359> best<00:04:14.600> so<00:04:15.380> stay<00:04:15.859> tuned<00:04:17.769> so<00:04:18.769> we<00:04:18.950> are

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
will work best so stay tuned so we are

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.159 
will work best so stay tuned so we are

removed<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.720> will<00:04:26.900> tell<00:04:27.169> us<00:04:27.320> which<00:04:27.620> bulbs

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
removed this will tell us which bulbs

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.680 
removed this will tell us which bulbs
spreads<00:04:28.340> to<00:04:28.490> light<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.850> best<00:04:29.120> within<00:04:29.570> the

cluster we want to get the maximum
coverage<00:04:32.930> possible<00:04:33.200> so<00:04:33.680> we're<00:04:34.070> going<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.220> take

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
coverage possible so we're going to take

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.779 
coverage possible so we're going to take
our<00:04:34.700> silver<00:04:35.240> reflective<00:04:36.160> diffuser<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.550> we're

our silver reflective diffuser and we're

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.800 
our silver reflective diffuser and we're
going<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:37.970> place<00:04:38.270> it<00:04:38.510> in<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:40.010> white<00:04:40.250> panel

material<00:04:52.250> we<00:04:53.060> usually<00:04:53.360> use<00:04:53.510> for<00:04:53.750> scrapbooking

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
material we usually use for scrapbooking

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.650 
material we usually use for scrapbooking
it<00:04:54.470> works<00:04:54.680> great<00:04:55.040> as<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> reflector<00:04:55.850> so<00:04:56.450> we're

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
it works great as a reflector so we're

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.810 
it works great as a reflector so we're
gonna<00:04:56.750> do<00:04:56.930> that<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.320> then<00:04:57.470> test<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.860> out

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.670 

Oh

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.450 

completed<00:05:10.670> reflector<00:05:11.210> here<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.680> put<00:05:13.340> some

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
completed reflector here so put some

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.700 
completed reflector here so put some
finishing<00:05:13.730> touches<00:05:14.030> on<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.480> we<00:05:15.260> can<00:05:15.410> see<00:05:15.590> that

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
finishing touches on it we can see that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.070 
finishing touches on it we can see that
I<00:05:15.770> digital<00:05:16.190> display<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.700> like<00:05:16.850> a<00:05:16.880> sign<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.540> when

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
I digital display is like a sign in when

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.830 
I digital display is like a sign in when
we<00:05:18.290> put<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.680> red<00:05:18.950> and<00:05:19.130> blue<00:05:19.280> film<00:05:19.640> over<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:20.600> sign

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
we put a red and blue film over the sign

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.760 
we put a red and blue film over the sign
in<00:05:21.080> its<00:05:21.590> gonna<00:05:21.800> turn<00:05:22.100> it<00:05:22.250> white<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.290> so

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
in its gonna turn it white like that so

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.050 
in its gonna turn it white like that so
that's<00:05:24.920> exactly<00:05:25.280> what<00:05:25.460> we're<00:05:25.610> gonna<00:05:25.670> do<00:05:25.910> now

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
that's exactly what we're gonna do now

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.940 
that's exactly what we're gonna do now
we're<00:05:26.120> gonna<00:05:26.300> fabricate<00:05:26.570> a<00:05:27.140> red<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:27.830> blue

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
we're gonna fabricate a red and blue

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.510 
we're gonna fabricate a red and blue
film<00:05:28.660> into<00:05:29.660> our<00:05:29.810> gauge<00:05:30.380> face<00:05:30.680> so<00:05:31.040> that<00:05:31.070> we<00:05:31.310> have

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
film into our gauge face so that we have

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.910 
film into our gauge face so that we have
a<00:05:31.730> white<00:05:32.270> digital<00:05:33.020> display<00:05:33.350> so<00:05:33.560> we've<00:05:33.680> got<00:05:33.800> our

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
a white digital display so we've got our

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.680 
a white digital display so we've got our
red<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:34.130> blue<00:05:34.400> over<00:05:34.700> this

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
red and blue over this

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.960 
red and blue over this
it<00:05:36.020> was<00:05:36.170> just<00:05:36.380> fabricated<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.220> switched<00:05:37.820> some

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
it was just fabricated I switched some

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.820 
it was just fabricated I switched some
lights<00:05:38.150> around<00:05:38.480> in<00:05:38.600> here<00:05:38.840> now<00:05:39.530> we're<00:05:39.680> gonna

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
lights around in here now we're gonna

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:50.440 
lights around in here now we're gonna
try<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.250> over<00:05:40.880> our<00:05:41.230> cyan<00:05:43.180> digital<00:05:44.180> display

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.800 

ah<00:05:51.450> nice<00:05:52.290> and<00:05:52.590> white<00:05:52.830> that's<00:05:53.730> exactly<00:05:54.420> what<00:05:54.660> we

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
ah nice and white that's exactly what we

wanted

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.770 
wanted
probably<00:05:56.310> get<00:05:56.430> a<00:05:56.460> better<00:05:56.700> shot<00:05:56.820> of<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.360> once

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
probably get a better shot of that once

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.860 
probably get a better shot of that once
we<00:05:57.960> actually<00:05:58.140> get<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:58.740> in<00:05:59.300> but<00:06:00.300> now<00:06:00.480> it's<00:06:00.690> going

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
we actually get it in but now it's going

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.020 
we actually get it in but now it's going
to<00:06:00.930> match<00:06:01.140> all<00:06:01.980> of<00:06:02.010> our<00:06:02.220> indicator<00:06:02.670> lights<00:06:02.910> as

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030
