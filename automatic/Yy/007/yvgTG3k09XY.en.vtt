00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
the name of this tutorial is photoshop

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.150 
the name of this tutorial is photoshop
in<00:00:02.429> blender<00:00:02.850> part<00:00:03.149> 3<00:00:03.510> creating<00:00:04.440> an<00:00:04.560> alpha<00:00:04.950> mask

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
in blender part 3 creating an alpha mask

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.870 
in blender part 3 creating an alpha mask
using<00:00:05.730> GIMP<00:00:06.560> in<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.740> previous<00:00:08.069> tutorial<00:00:08.639> part

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
using GIMP in the previous tutorial part

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390 
using GIMP in the previous tutorial part
2<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.630> saw<00:00:09.840> how<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> alpha<00:00:10.530> mask<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> scene

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
2 we saw how the alpha mask of the scene

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
2 we saw how the alpha mask of the scene
was<00:00:11.639> used<00:00:11.880> so<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.240> could<00:00:12.389> work<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
was used so it could work as the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.079 
was used so it could work as the
foreground<00:00:13.469> image<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> Alpha<00:00:14.490> over<00:00:14.670> node

foreground image in the Alpha over node

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.090 
foreground image in the Alpha over node
to<00:00:15.929> combine<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> foreground<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
to combine a foreground with a

to combine a foreground with a
background<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.660> tutorial<00:00:19.260> I'll<00:00:19.439> show

which does not have an alpha channel in

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.970 
which does not have an alpha channel in
a<00:00:27.180> future<00:00:27.539> tutorial<00:00:27.960> I'll<00:00:28.470> show<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
a future tutorial I'll show you how to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.269 
a future tutorial I'll show you how to
create<00:00:29.250> an<00:00:29.429> alpha<00:00:29.760> mask<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.269> blender<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
create an alpha mask in blender the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
create an alpha mask in blender the
first<00:00:32.550> step<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.090> separate<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.540> locomotive

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
first step is to separate the locomotive

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
first step is to separate the locomotive
from<00:00:34.350> its<00:00:34.590> background<00:00:34.850> using<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> various

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
from its background using the various

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.270 
from its background using the various
selection<00:00:37.230> tools<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.770> GIMP<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> Photoshop

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
selection tools the GIMP and Photoshop

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.270 
selection tools the GIMP and Photoshop
as<00:00:39.000> well<00:00:39.030> offer<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.469> GIMP<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.860> seven

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
as well offer the GIMP has seven

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.400 
as well offer the GIMP has seven
different<00:00:41.430> selection<00:00:42.180> tools<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:43.230> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
different selection tools it's a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.080 
different selection tools it's a
time-consuming<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.370> detail-oriented

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
time-consuming and detail-oriented

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
time-consuming and detail-oriented
process<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.649> course<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.250> detailed

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
process and of course the more detailed

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.930 
process and of course the more detailed
the<00:00:47.760> selection<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.539> better<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> result<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the selection the better the result I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.299 
the selection the better the result I
don't<00:00:50.940> own<00:00:51.120> Photoshop<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.050> suspect<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:53.160> may

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
don't own Photoshop I suspect there may

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.150 
don't own Photoshop I suspect there may
even<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.579> more<00:00:53.910> selection<00:00:54.449> tools<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.930> it

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
even be more selection tools in it

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
even be more selection tools in it
regardless<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.309> process<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> same<00:00:57.320> so

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
regardless the process is the same so

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.549 
regardless the process is the same so
here's<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> process<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> ginn<00:01:00.469> open<00:01:01.469> up

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
here's the process in the ginn open up

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
here's the process in the ginn open up
the<00:01:01.710> original<00:01:01.920> locomotive<00:01:02.820> jpg<00:01:03.270> image<00:01:03.480> which

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the original locomotive jpg image which

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
the original locomotive jpg image which
does<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.619> again<00:01:04.890> an<00:01:04.979> alpha<00:01:05.369> Channel<00:01:05.960> now

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
does not have again an alpha Channel now

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
does not have again an alpha Channel now
we<00:01:07.020> need<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> select<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> locomotive

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we need to select the locomotive

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.480 
we need to select the locomotive
