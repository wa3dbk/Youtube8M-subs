1911 as you can see I have half the the

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.730 
1911 as you can see I have half the the
lower<00:00:06.930> receiver<00:00:07.410> done<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:10.050> slide<00:00:10.350> is

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
lower receiver done and the slide is

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
lower receiver done and the slide is
still<00:00:11.960> you<00:00:12.960> know<00:00:13.050> hanging<00:00:13.410> apart<00:00:13.680> there<00:00:13.980> but

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
still you know hanging apart there but

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.580 
still you know hanging apart there but
intact<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.900> still<00:00:16.860> have<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.100> gotten<00:00:17.430> around<00:00:17.699> to

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
intact I still have not gotten around to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.420 
intact I still have not gotten around to
doing<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> front<00:00:20.010> portion<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> slide<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
doing the front portion of the slide and

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.540 
doing the front portion of the slide and
obviously<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:23.609> closing<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:25.550> hopefully

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
obviously not closing it but hopefully

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.040 
obviously not closing it but hopefully
very<00:00:27.420> soon<00:00:27.600> when<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:29.330> start<00:00:30.330> doing<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
very soon when I start doing all the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.639 
very soon when I start doing all the
other<00:00:31.500> rounded<00:00:31.920> pieces<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:33.320> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
other rounded pieces here you can see I

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.860 
other rounded pieces here you can see I
did<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:36.600> rounded<00:00:37.020> part<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:37.739> magwell

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
did the the rounded part of the magwell

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.030 
did the the rounded part of the magwell
using<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.219> airsoft<00:00:41.219> replica<00:00:41.880> of<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> mag

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
using the airsoft replica of the mag

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
using the airsoft replica of the mag
that<00:00:44.040> goes<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.030> then<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> fits<00:00:45.690> in

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that goes in and then if it fits in

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.709 
that goes in and then if it fits in
nicely<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.340> back<00:00:47.730> wall<00:00:48.000> yep

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
nicely I don't have that back wall yep

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
nicely I don't have that back wall yep
so<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> wiggle<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:52.340> this<00:00:53.340> is<00:00:53.489> nice

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so it's going to wiggle but this is nice

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.410 
so it's going to wiggle but this is nice
i'm<00:00:54.210> using<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.899> actual<00:00:55.890> cereal<00:00:56.489> box<00:00:56.760> surface

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
i'm using the actual cereal box surface

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.979 
i'm using the actual cereal box surface
because<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.649> a<00:01:00.020> it's<00:01:01.020> glossy<00:01:02.000> so<00:01:03.000> i<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.809> have

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
because it's a it's glossy so i can have

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.550 
because it's a it's glossy so i can have
the<00:01:04.799> mag<00:01:05.009> slide<00:01:05.429> in<00:01:05.670> without<00:01:06.679> dying<00:01:07.679> problems

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
the mag slide in without dying problems

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.429 
the mag slide in without dying problems
so<00:01:11.569> so<00:01:12.569> that's<00:01:13.079> really<00:01:13.740> nice<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:15.170> as<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.380> can

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so so that's really nice here as you can

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.499 
so so that's really nice here as you can
see<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.840> curved<00:01:19.319> piece<00:01:19.679> was<00:01:20.219> I<00:01:20.520> made<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
see the curved piece was I made I I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.589 
see the curved piece was I made I I
rolled<00:01:22.109> a<00:01:22.349> a<00:01:22.920> pipe<00:01:23.549> first<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.639> about<00:01:26.639> three

00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:27.599 
rolled a a pipe first it was about three

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.589 
rolled a a pipe first it was about three
quarter<00:01:28.789> three<00:01:29.789> quarters<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> an<00:01:30.299> inch<00:01:30.389> in

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
quarter three quarters of an inch in

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.370 
quarter three quarters of an inch in
diameter<00:01:30.779> and<00:01:31.319> then<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.039> cut<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.719> in<00:01:33.719> half<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
diameter and then I cut it in half and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.190 
diameter and then I cut it in half and
then<00:01:35.069> shaved<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:36.469> sides<00:01:37.469> off<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.299> yeah

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
then shaved the sides off so that yeah

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.639 
then shaved the sides off so that yeah
the<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.249> different<00:01:41.899> halves<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.319> receiver

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the the different halves of the receiver

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.279 
the the different halves of the receiver
could<00:01:44.399> fit<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.569> on<00:01:45.599> it<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.899> Matt<00:01:48.899> goes<00:01:49.109> in

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
could fit right on it so Matt goes in

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.919 
could fit right on it so Matt goes in
there<00:01:49.499> very<00:01:50.069> nicely<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.069> have<00:01:53.279> the

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
there very nicely you can see I have the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.519 
there very nicely you can see I have the
that's<00:01:54.929> where<00:01:55.139> the<00:01:55.259> trigger<00:01:55.579> pokes<00:01:56.579> through<00:01:56.700> I

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
that's where the trigger pokes through I

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:02.989 
that's where the trigger pokes through I
have<00:01:58.529> that<00:01:58.709> already<00:01:59.189> cut<00:01:59.459> out<00:01:59.609> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:01.999> this

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:02.999 
have that already cut out and then this

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.989 
have that already cut out and then this
part<00:02:03.239> right<00:02:03.359> here<00:02:03.509> will<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> very<00:02:04.409> easy<00:02:04.999> should

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
part right here will be very easy should

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:09.440 
part right here will be very easy should
go<00:02:06.179> by<00:02:06.359> pretty<00:02:07.139> fast<00:02:07.409> no<00:02:07.739> problem<00:02:08.159> this<00:02:08.939> one<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
go by pretty fast no problem this one is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.899 
go by pretty fast no problem this one is
a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.780> bit<00:02:09.929> harder<00:02:10.259> that's<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.700> mag

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
a little bit harder that's the the mag

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.430 
a little bit harder that's the the mag
release

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
release

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.830 
release
button<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.819> whole<00:02:16.000> goes<00:02:16.420> right<00:02:16.630> through

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
button the whole goes right through

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.640 
button the whole goes right through
there<00:02:16.989> as<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.160> see<00:02:18.489> I<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:20.050> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
there as you can see I have the that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.740 
there as you can see I have the that
curved<00:02:20.950> part<00:02:21.190> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> magwell<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.120> so

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
curved part of the magwell in the way so

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.130 
curved part of the magwell in the way so
i<00:02:23.170> might<00:02:23.380> as<00:02:23.410> well<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:23.970> cut<00:02:24.970> these<00:02:25.209> two<00:02:25.630> off

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
i might as well just cut these two off

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.990 
i might as well just cut these two off
or<00:02:28.440> something<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:30.580> I'll<00:02:30.819> figure

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
or something like that but I'll figure

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.630 
or something like that but I'll figure
it<00:02:31.090> out<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.690> wouldn't<00:02:31.930> be<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.019> problem<00:02:32.640> that's

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
it out it wouldn't be a problem that's

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.920 
it out it wouldn't be a problem that's
just<00:02:34.319> it's<00:02:35.319> not<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> bump<00:02:35.769> it's<00:02:36.099> just<00:02:36.310> uh

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
just it's not a bump it's just uh

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.059 
just it's not a bump it's just uh
because<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.230> know<00:02:38.319> I'm<00:02:38.440> making<00:02:38.709> this<00:02:38.800> out<00:02:38.980> of

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
because you know I'm making this out of

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.550 
because you know I'm making this out of
paper<00:02:39.310> it's<00:02:39.580> I'm<00:02:39.819> not<00:02:40.000> not<00:02:40.569> like<00:02:40.750> milling<00:02:41.290> a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
paper it's I'm not not like milling a

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.840 
paper it's I'm not not like milling a
block<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.220> Steel<00:02:42.250> or<00:02:42.790> anything<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.670> would

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
block of Steel or anything so that would

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.699 
block of Steel or anything so that would
be<00:02:45.880> easier<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.360> do<00:02:46.600> with<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:46.989> drill<00:02:47.319> press<00:02:47.350> and

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
be easier to do with a drill press and

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.370 
be easier to do with a drill press and
steel<00:02:48.040> but<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:49.090> know<00:02:49.180> I'm<00:02:49.330> doing<00:02:49.600> paper<00:02:49.810> so<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
steel but you know I'm doing paper so I

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.080 
steel but you know I'm doing paper so I
got<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.769> make<00:02:50.950> pieces<00:02:51.190> that<00:02:51.610> will<00:02:51.730> go<00:02:51.940> around

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
got to make pieces that will go around

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.720 
got to make pieces that will go around
it<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.750> stuff<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.940> know<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.989> use<00:02:56.380> my

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
it and stuff you know just use my

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.110 
it and stuff you know just use my
intuition<00:02:57.730> with<00:02:58.360> that<00:02:58.569> and<00:03:00.000> building<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
intuition with that and building the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.520 
intuition with that and building the
back<00:03:01.540> part<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:02.489> there<00:03:03.489> still<00:03:04.110> about<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.349> much

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
back part up there still about that much

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.220 
back part up there still about that much
more<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.890> go<00:03:06.040> on<00:03:06.280> top<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.330> that's<00:03:07.720> for<00:03:08.049> the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
more to go on top of this that's for the

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.470 
more to go on top of this that's for the
disk<00:03:09.220> connector<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.940> poke<00:03:10.120> through<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
disk connector to poke through in the

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.350 
disk connector to poke through in the
middle<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.620> don't<00:03:11.830> have<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.160> yet<00:03:12.549> but<00:03:12.940> i'll

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
middle so I don't have that yet but i'll

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.090 
middle so I don't have that yet but i'll
have<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:14.860> disconnect<00:03:15.760> er<00:03:15.849> housing<00:03:17.100> that

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
have the that disconnect er housing that

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.420 
have the that disconnect er housing that
should<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.400> pretty<00:03:18.519> easy<00:03:18.670> as<00:03:19.060> well<00:03:20.070> yeah<00:03:21.070> so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
should be pretty easy as well yeah so

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.310 
should be pretty easy as well yeah so
here<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:22.720> looks<00:03:22.989> like<00:03:23.200> with<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
here is what it looks like with the

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:39.410 
here is what it looks like with the
slide<00:03:26.320> on<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.739> far<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:35.010> yep<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:37.720> see<00:03:38.019> my

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
slide on so far so yep so you can see my

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.559 
slide on so far so yep so you can see my
my<00:03:40.420> one<00:03:40.720> scale<00:03:41.170> one-to-one<00:03:41.829> scale<00:03:42.569> printing

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
my one scale one-to-one scale printing

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.640 
my one scale one-to-one scale printing
is<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.769> correct<00:03:45.069> size<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.690> actually<00:03:46.690> made<00:03:47.200> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
is the correct size I actually made the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.270 
is the correct size I actually made the
the<00:03:48.010> entire<00:03:48.370> slide<00:03:49.769> without<00:03:51.030> using<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:53.799> 3d

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
the entire slide without using the 3d

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.229 
the entire slide without using the 3d
model<00:03:54.639> because<00:03:55.329> I<00:03:55.600> I<00:03:56.170> wasn't<00:03:56.889> even<00:03:57.010> aware<00:03:57.400> that

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
model because I I wasn't even aware that

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.860 
model because I I wasn't even aware that
it<00:03:58.359> was<00:03:58.480> 121<00:03:59.170> until<00:03:59.940> until<00:04:00.940> I<00:04:01.000> started<00:04:01.720> making

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
it was 121 until until I started making

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.039 
it was 121 until until I started making
a<00:04:02.079> receiver<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:03.160> yeah<00:04:03.819> I<00:04:03.880> based<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.840> size

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
a receiver so yeah I based the the size

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.840 
a receiver so yeah I based the the size
of<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.440> slide<00:04:05.680> off<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.480> airsoft<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
of the slide off of the the airsoft the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.819 
of the slide off of the the airsoft the
airsoft<00:04:10.470> size<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:13.350> obviously<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.500> airsoft

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
airsoft size and obviously the airsoft

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.270 
airsoft size and obviously the airsoft
one<00:04:15.010> is<00:04:15.220> one<00:04:15.459> to<00:04:15.609> one<00:04:15.730> so

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
one is one to one so

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.590 
one is one to one so
I<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:19.060> looked<00:04:19.239> at<00:04:19.389> it<00:04:19.420> I<00:04:19.750> traced<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.560> out<00:04:21.600> yeah

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
I just looked at it I traced it out yeah

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.810 
I just looked at it I traced it out yeah
so<00:04:22.840> I<00:04:22.870> was<00:04:22.930> doing<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.320> old-school<00:04:23.500> here<00:04:24.070> she's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
so I was doing it old-school here she's

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.210 
so I was doing it old-school here she's
basically<00:04:25.560> tracing<00:04:26.560> out<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.800> contours<00:04:27.160> of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
basically tracing out the contours of

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.090 
basically tracing out the contours of
the<00:04:27.520> slide<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.900> right<00:04:29.169> onto<00:04:29.350> paper<00:04:29.680> and

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
the slide and then right onto paper and

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.480 
the slide and then right onto paper and
then<00:04:31.050> eyeballing<00:04:32.050> everything<00:04:32.470> here<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.889> then

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
then eyeballing everything here and then

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.129 
then eyeballing everything here and then
I<00:04:33.580> realized<00:04:34.030> well<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.800> do<00:04:35.889> it<00:04:36.010> with<00:04:36.790> a

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
I realized well I can do it with a

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.050 
I realized well I can do it with a
software<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.770> 3d<00:04:39.100> model<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.639> printed<00:04:39.970> out

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
software and a 3d model and printed out

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.830 
software and a 3d model and printed out
one<00:04:40.240> to<00:04:40.360> one<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.400> yeah<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.730> this<00:04:43.030> is<00:04:43.210> this<00:04:43.720> is

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
one to one so yeah that this is this is

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.350 
one to one so yeah that this is this is
going<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.139> by<00:04:44.169> really<00:04:44.530> fast<00:04:44.830> because<00:04:45.130> I<00:04:45.610> now

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
going to go by really fast because I now

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.750 
going to go by really fast because I now
have<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:47.139> means<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:48.240> printing<00:04:49.240> out<00:04:49.530> pieces<00:04:50.760> very

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
have a means of printing out pieces very

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.510 
have a means of printing out pieces very
accurately<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.780> efficiently<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> don't

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
accurately and efficiently so I don't

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.750 
accurately and efficiently so I don't
have<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.669> go<00:04:54.820> eyeballing<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.810> then<00:04:55.930> like

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
have to go eyeballing it and then like

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.590 
have to go eyeballing it and then like
wondering<00:04:57.760> what<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.030> next<00:04:58.180> step<00:04:58.419> would<00:04:58.540> be

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
wondering what the next step would be

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.310 
wondering what the next step would be
because<00:04:59.470> now<00:04:59.770> I<00:04:59.800> can<00:04:59.980> just<00:05:00.720> almost<00:05:01.720> blow<00:05:02.110> right

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
because now I can just almost blow right

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.320 
because now I can just almost blow right
through<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:03.100> obviously<00:05:03.640> take<00:05:03.970> my<00:05:04.150> time

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
through this but obviously take my time

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.640 
through this but obviously take my time
and<00:05:04.570> make<00:05:05.260> sure<00:05:05.860> it's<00:05:06.310> perfect<00:05:07.440> going<00:05:08.440> to<00:05:08.560> me

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
and make sure it's perfect going to me

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.680 
and make sure it's perfect going to me
started<00:05:09.490> on<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.640> feeding<00:05:10.090> ramp<00:05:10.300> just<00:05:10.600> a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
started on the feeding ramp just a

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.810 
started on the feeding ramp just a
little<00:05:10.930> bit<00:05:11.050> but<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.260> won't<00:05:11.440> go<00:05:11.590> into<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.950> too

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
little bit but I won't go into it too

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.500 
little bit but I won't go into it too
much<00:05:12.850> until<00:05:13.540> I<00:05:13.570> have<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:15.610> big<00:05:15.850> block<00:05:16.180> right

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
much until I have that big block right

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.040 
much until I have that big block right
there<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.490> then<00:05:20.490> yeah<00:05:21.490> that<00:05:21.820> should<00:05:22.270> be<00:05:22.300> I'll

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
there and then yeah that should be I'll

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.210 
there and then yeah that should be I'll
figure<00:05:23.290> out<00:05:23.500> what<00:05:23.620> i'm<00:05:23.710> going<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.890> do<00:05:24.010> over

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
figure out what i'm going to do over

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.180 
figure out what i'm going to do over
here<00:05:24.250> it's<00:05:24.580> probably<00:05:25.060> the<00:05:25.240> same<00:05:25.479> as<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:26.229> front

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
here it's probably the same as the front

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.880 
here it's probably the same as the front
of<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.370> magwell<00:05:27.610> here<00:05:28.090> right<00:05:28.930> at<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.229> the

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
of the magwell here right at the the

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.190 
of the magwell here right at the the
grip<00:05:30.760> so<00:05:31.720> as<00:05:31.990> you<00:05:32.350> can<00:05:32.470> see<00:05:32.820> there's<00:05:33.820> the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
grip so as you can see there's the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.770 
grip so as you can see there's the
curved<00:05:35.200> magwell<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.919> then<00:05:36.400> there's<00:05:36.780> two

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
curved magwell and then there's two

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.440 
curved magwell and then there's two
thick<00:05:38.530> layers<00:05:39.120> two<00:05:40.120> different<00:05:40.479> layers<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:41.400> of

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
thick layers two different layers of of

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.409 
thick layers two different layers of of
the<00:05:43.450> cereal<00:05:44.080> box<00:05:44.110> cardboard<00:05:44.940> like<00:05:45.940> two<00:05:46.180> steps

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
the cereal box cardboard like two steps

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.700 
the cereal box cardboard like two steps
so<00:05:47.380> that<00:05:47.710> one<00:05:48.370> is<00:05:48.580> easy<00:05:49.289> all<00:05:50.289> i<00:05:50.380> have<00:05:50.470> to<00:05:50.530> do<00:05:50.680> is

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
so that one is easy all i have to do is

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.800 
so that one is easy all i have to do is
take<00:05:50.919> an<00:05:51.070> exacto<00:05:51.490> knife<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:51.880> shave<00:05:52.630> it<00:05:52.780> down

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
take an exacto knife and shave it down

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.310 
take an exacto knife and shave it down
until<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.710> meets<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.940> line<00:05:55.150> that<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.750> printed

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
until it meets the line that is printed

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.020 
until it meets the line that is printed
right<00:05:56.650> there<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:58.260> that<00:05:59.430> it<00:06:00.430> is<00:06:00.460> flush<00:06:01.000> with

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
right there and that it is flush with

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.590 
right there and that it is flush with
the<00:06:01.780> surface<00:06:02.080> of<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.770> rounded<00:06:03.280> part<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.789> it's

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
the surface of the rounded part and it's

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.370 
the surface of the rounded part and it's
going<00:06:04.720> to<00:06:04.780> look<00:06:05.020> really<00:06:05.050> nice<00:06:05.919> so<00:06:07.050> those<00:06:08.050> steps

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
going to look really nice so those steps

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.840 
going to look really nice so those steps
in<00:06:08.620> there<00:06:09.190> are<00:06:10.440> are<00:06:11.440> good<00:06:11.740> to<00:06:11.860> have<00:06:12.070> because

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
in there are are good to have because

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.380 
in there are are good to have because
you<00:06:13.030> can<00:06:13.180> always<00:06:13.450> take<00:06:13.660> away<00:06:13.960> it's<00:06:14.410> very

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
you can always take away it's very

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.960 
you can always take away it's very
difficult<00:06:16.390> to<00:06:16.690> add<00:06:16.870> on<00:06:17.140> but<00:06:17.800> you<00:06:18.010> know<00:06:18.130> if<00:06:18.370> that

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
difficult to add on but you know if that

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.740 
difficult to add on but you know if that
if<00:06:19.630> that<00:06:19.690> is<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.110> case<00:06:20.140> there<00:06:21.070> is<00:06:21.250> that<00:06:21.750> the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
if that is the case there is that the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.830 
if that is the case there is that the
baking<00:06:23.169> powder<00:06:23.440> and<00:06:23.770> our<00:06:24.580> baking<00:06:24.970> soda<00:06:25.210> baking

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
baking powder and our baking soda baking

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.010 
baking powder and our baking soda baking
soda<00:06:26.289> powder<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:27.099> superglue<00:06:28.090> solution<00:06:28.630> so

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
soda powder and superglue solution so

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.370 
soda powder and superglue solution so
you<00:06:29.110> could<00:06:29.289> just<00:06:29.500> add

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
you could just add

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.290 
you could just add
two<00:06:30.740> contouring<00:06:31.250> of<00:06:31.520> that<00:06:31.700> so<00:06:33.070> we<00:06:34.070> will<00:06:34.300> see

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
two contouring of that so we will see

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.270 
two contouring of that so we will see
very<00:06:35.720> soon<00:06:35.780> I<00:06:36.290> should<00:06:36.650> be<00:06:36.800> done<00:06:36.950> with<00:06:37.160> this

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
very soon I should be done with this

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.040 
very soon I should be done with this
receiver<00:06:38.560> in<00:06:39.560> a<00:06:39.710> day<00:06:39.860> or<00:06:40.040> so<00:06:40.070> so<00:06:41.030> very<00:06:41.330> soon
