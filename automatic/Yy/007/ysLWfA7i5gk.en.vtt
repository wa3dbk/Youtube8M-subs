00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
with the flip out LCD the reason why I

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.070

waited to get the t3i and not the t2i or
even<00:03:42.620> getting<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.860> 60d<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.550> because<00:03:43.880> pretty

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
even getting the 60d is because pretty

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.450 
even getting the 60d is because pretty
much<00:03:44.270> this<00:03:44.960> almost<00:03:45.290> has<00:03:45.560> every<00:03:45.890> feature<00:03:45.920> that

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
much this almost has every feature that

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.570 
much this almost has every feature that
the<00:03:46.610> 6th<00:03:46.940> ed<00:03:47.120> has<00:03:47.390> were<00:03:47.660> cheaper<00:03:48.110> oh<00:03:48.400> yes<00:03:49.400> the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
the 6th ed has were cheaper oh yes the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.910 
the 6th ed has were cheaper oh yes the
6th<00:03:49.820> ed<00:03:50.030> is<00:03:50.270> built<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:50.930> bit<00:03:51.080> better<00:03:51.260> but

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
6th ed is built a little bit better but

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.100 
6th ed is built a little bit better but
honestly<00:03:52.190> right<00:03:52.400> now<00:03:52.720> feels<00:03:53.720> good<00:03:53.930> in<00:03:54.050> the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
honestly right now feels good in the

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.550 
honestly right now feels good in the
hand<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:56.480> does<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.840> losses<00:03:57.050> at<00:03:57.530> the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
hand and this does have losses at the

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.550 
hand and this does have losses at the
6th<00:03:57.920> ed<00:03:58.130> now<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.790> 6th<00:03:59.090> ed<00:03:59.300> does<00:03:59.630> have<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.200> think

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
6th ed now the 6th ed does have I think

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.140 
6th ed now the 6th ed does have I think
a<00:04:00.890> higher<00:04:01.190> ISO<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:03.790> something<00:04:04.790> else<00:04:04.910> i'm

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
a higher ISO and something else i'm

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.390 
a higher ISO and something else i'm
forgetting<00:04:05.480> but<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:06.050> got<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.470> photographer

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
forgetting but you got you photographer

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.320

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
probably know what the 6th ed has but

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.550 
probably know what the 6th ed has but
pretty<00:04:10.310> much<00:04:10.340> has<00:04:10.910> exact<00:04:11.300> same<00:04:11.480> sensor<00:04:12.020> as<00:04:12.050> the

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
pretty much has exact same sensor as the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.840 
pretty much has exact same sensor as the
t2i<00:04:13.100> 60d<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.540> 7d<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.190> I'm<00:04:16.340> definitely
