00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
blade you can see there the overall

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
blade you can see there the overall
length<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.729> guy<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.810> eight<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> half

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
length of this guy is eight and a half

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.620 
length of this guy is eight and a half
inches<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.430> pretty<00:01:29.759> large<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.420> blade

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
inches so it is pretty large the blade

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.090 
inches so it is pretty large the blade
length<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.960> three<00:01:31.140> point<00:01:31.409> four<00:01:31.619> they're<00:01:31.829> using

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

440<00:01:32.549> steel<00:01:32.850> on<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.380> weights<00:01:34.560> about

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
440 steel on this and the weights about

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
440 steel on this and the weights about
four<00:01:35.009> point<00:01:35.299> four<00:01:36.299> point<00:01:36.509> six<00:01:36.689> ounces<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
four point four point six ounces so it's

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.450 
four point four point six ounces so it's
a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.799> bit<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.040> weight<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:39.229> but

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
a little bit of weight for this but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.690 
a little bit of weight for this but
really<00:01:41.460> cool<00:01:41.670> knife<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.090> button<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:46.520> this<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
really cool knife the button it this is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
really cool knife the button it this is
brand-new<00:01:48.119> not<00:01:48.390> broken<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.930> yet<00:01:49.130> but<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
brand-new not broken in yet but the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
brand-new not broken in yet but the
button<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.310> takes<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.149> little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
button actually takes a little bit to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.709 
button actually takes a little bit to
retract<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> blade<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:56.009> there<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.509> I'm<00:01:57.509> sure

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
retract the blade in there and I'm sure

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
retract the blade in there and I'm sure
it's<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.960> initial<00:01:58.409> break-in<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.640> know

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it's just initial break-in I don't know

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.359 
it's just initial break-in I don't know

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.240 
i--but kind of hesitant to do it cuz I
didn't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> mess<00:02:07.170> with<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.500> inner<00:02:07.649> I

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
didn't want to mess with the inner I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.469 
didn't want to mess with the inner I
didn't<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:08.940> was<00:02:09.030> causing<00:02:09.270> these

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
didn't know if it was causing these

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.140 
didn't know if it was causing these
problems<00:02:09.539> or<00:02:10.229> anything<00:02:10.879> inside<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> knife

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
problems or anything inside the knife

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:23.130 
problems or anything inside the knife
I'm<00:02:13.390> sure<00:02:14.189> pretty<00:02:15.189> cool<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.159> said<00:02:22.140> it's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
I'm sure pretty cool like I said it's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.600 
I'm sure pretty cool like I said it's
getting<00:02:23.439> easier<00:02:23.560> now<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:23.950> I'm<00:02:24.040> breaking<00:02:24.370> in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
getting easier now that I'm breaking in

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360 
getting easier now that I'm breaking in
so<00:02:24.819> I<00:02:24.849> guess<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.269> better<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.599> way<00:02:26.370> then

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
so I guess it's better that way then

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.220 
so I guess it's better that way then
have<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:27.879> loose<00:02:28.060> as<00:02:28.269> far<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.659> riding

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
have it really loose as far as it riding

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.780 
have it really loose as far as it riding
in<00:02:29.439> your<00:02:29.560> pocket<00:02:29.980> because<00:02:30.459> I'm<00:02:30.519> sure<00:02:30.700> would

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
in your pocket because I'm sure would

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.130 
in your pocket because I'm sure would
really<00:02:31.030> suck<00:02:31.390> if<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.689> thing<00:02:31.930> we're<00:02:32.049> to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
really suck if this thing we're to

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.050 
really suck if this thing we're to
deploy<00:02:32.500> out<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.769> your<00:02:32.859> pocket<00:02:33.280> but<00:02:33.730> definitely

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
I've been messing around with it quite a

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:14.670 
I've been messing around with it quite a
bit

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
bit

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.939 
bit
I<00:03:14.859> just<00:03:15.129> got<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:17.049> last<00:03:17.169> two<00:03:17.500> hours<00:03:17.829> or
