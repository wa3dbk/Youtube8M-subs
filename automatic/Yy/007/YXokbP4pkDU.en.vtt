00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.049
 the theme of beauty was very 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 long time I had to make one 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.890
 for a while since I already had 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.570
 filmed if he puts that a few months ago 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.580
 now i would say so it was time 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 that puts it online so today we 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 will see together how to achieve a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.500
 hair is normal who will you 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 to strengthen the hair and give you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.280

 little bit raplapla who have not much 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.980
 of energy and vitality 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.629
 it's something that will really 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.860
 boosted hair growth and then that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.070
 help with that pushed a little bit more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.320
 quick 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.750
 in any case on me it works well 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 so I think it should be the same 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.750
 for you and I wish you in all 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.370
 case so we go we will see together 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.079
 the list of ingredients you will have 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 need to achieve tonight you'll 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.340
 first of all need a bowl in which 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.799
 you will make your mix so in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
 this bowl you to mix them with the powder 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.790
 dirty pungent for the quantities you 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.500
 do it according to your volume it's for me 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.330
 I think it was about 4 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 curved coffee spoons but you 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.299
 can perhaps put more is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 no problem it depends on your mass 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.710
 you will need then 10 drops 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.360
 of grapefruit essential oil these 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.680
 written slimming tox on it but I you 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 ensures that it is invigorating for 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.759
 hair you will also need to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.170
 chic kayes powder so surround yourself 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.270
 and fortify the scalp as it is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.650
 written on the bag in you see there I 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.600
 shows you what is written so 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 if you have the time was asked could I 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.479
 look a little bit at the properties of the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.250
 chic to cannes it's really very very 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.520
 good for the hair it favors the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.400
 shoot 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.170
 you will also need rassoul 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.030
 so I limit myself in a mortar for 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.729
 to be able to crush it this is under 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.850
 cube shape like that and find 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 a little bit everywhere in the shops 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.900
 bio generally 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.549
 on the internet so once you have 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.500
 finished having your ingredients you 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.860
 see all installed in your bowl you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 to mix them all and me what I 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.310
 do it usually is that I mix 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.509
 but powders first with my doubts my 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 ten drops of essential oil of 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.410
 grapefruit and then complete with 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.649
 lukewarm water or not it's up to you to 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.510
 see 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.300
 you mix until you 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.580
 make a homogeneous paste and then their 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.319
 there is more serious it is necessary to spread all this on 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.660
 the rector you are going to make a good 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.950
 scalp massage with under your 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.970
 shower and that's not to do that in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.430
 your bathroom or you'll 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.560
 redacorate your soil I assure you 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.660
 me it's your head 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.640
 it's me until you have it 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.110
 sailor simply and it's not worth it 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.050
 really great on the lengths 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.550
 since its tendency to a little bit to 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.810
 to dry your hair if you have been hot 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.920
 and dry besides do not hesitate to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.450
 add a little bit of oil to 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.250
 inside I have not put it because 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.750
 that I have fat roots and it's a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.940
 massage that I basically do for 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.430
 the roots since the hair does not 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.260
 not grow in the tip but well 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.690
 for the root so you apply everything 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.040
 that in circular massages and once 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.690
 that everything is applied on all your 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.180
 roots all over your head leave you 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.769

 time to do a body scrub and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.920
 and then after you rinse you do a 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.810
 little shampoo and then a 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.350
