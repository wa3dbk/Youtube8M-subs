 meat and from the fridge to the gondola and on the farms electronic sites 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 are being implanted in the herd

 according to the company in a year the consumer can have information 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.570
 over all the animal's life our goal 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.970
 guarantee the fact that the quality of the meat and ldu defense karma we want to 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.830
 We had a problem, we did not check people. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.150
 identify the chain everyone believes that in the future we will be able to 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:29.830
 Tue 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.400
 ensure a control of pasture compared to this type of monitoring already 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.450

 with control of the origin of the afternoon the animal was born immediately until the day 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.090
 that he died with all the notes 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.060
 if he took an antibiotic and has to meet a grace period is a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.800
 very effective and very important control for the consumer because
