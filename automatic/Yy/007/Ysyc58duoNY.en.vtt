00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the game and then I guess every so often

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the Interceptor is coming down so you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.840 
the Interceptor is coming down so you
can<00:01:07.080> prepare<00:01:07.409> yourself<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> either<00:01:08.159> grab<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
can prepare yourself to either grab it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
can prepare yourself to either grab it
or<00:01:09.000> destroy<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:10.350> also<00:01:10.560> nerfed<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.280> rate

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
or destroy it they also nerfed the rate

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
of fire on the Rockets it's going to be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
of fire on the Rockets it's going to be
a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.710> bit<00:01:13.890> slower<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> shoot<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> the

a little bit slower to shoot and the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660 
a little bit slower to shoot and the
lethality<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.860> assume<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.520> mean

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
lethality of them which I assume to mean

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.390 
lethality of them which I assume to mean

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
rifles are getting buffed we just don't

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
rifles are getting buffed we just don't
know<00:01:22.320> how<00:01:22.590> at<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.799> moment<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.850> was

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
know how at the moment this was

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
know how at the moment this was
absolutely<00:01:24.299> needed<00:01:25.080> because<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.530> auto<00:01:25.710> rifle

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
absolutely needed because the auto rifle

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.160 
absolutely needed because the auto rifle
just<00:01:26.460> completely<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.360> classes<00:01:27.750> these

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
just completely out classes these

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.830 
just completely out classes these

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
weapons in every regard the scout rifle

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960 
weapons in every regard the scout rifle
makes<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> hand<00:01:31.560> cannon<00:01:31.920> near<00:01:32.189> useless<00:01:32.670> as

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
makes the hand cannon near useless as

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.670 
makes the hand cannon near useless as
well<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.450> I'm<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:33.780> glad<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> hear<00:01:34.320> about<00:01:34.380> this
