00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
could also think okay well you know this

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.429 
could also think okay well you know this
is<00:01:51.909> kind<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.149> hard<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.509> keep<00:01:52.659> cold<00:01:52.960> what<00:01:53.320> other

have there's a bunch of dried fruit out
on<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.450> market<00:01:58.840> now<00:01:58.990> that's<00:01:59.590> non<00:01:59.979> perishable

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
on the market now that's non perishable

but<00:02:34.820> be<00:02:35.030> creative<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:36.110> could<00:02:36.320> certainly<00:02:36.560> be

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
but be creative it could certainly be

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.560
