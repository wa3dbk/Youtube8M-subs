00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it to expose the hive so will is doing

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
it to expose the hive so will is doing
what's<00:00:36.780> called<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.050> trap<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> that's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
what's called a trap out and that's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
what's called a trap out and that's
where<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.090> some<00:00:39.989> mesh<00:00:40.230> material<00:00:40.829> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
where you take some mesh material and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.500 
where you take some mesh material and
make<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> cone<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> basically<00:00:44.510> trap

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
make a cone out of it and basically trap

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.380 
make a cone out of it and basically trap
the<00:00:45.690> bees<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:48.210> their<00:00:48.450> home

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
the bees out of their home

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.110 
the bees out of their home
this<00:00:51.390> cone<00:00:51.829> makes<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> bees<00:00:53.489> come<00:00:53.879> out

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this cone makes it so the bees come out

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
this cone makes it so the bees come out
where<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.570> can't<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:56.190> then

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
where they can't get back in and then

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
where they can't get back in and then
set<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.690> another<00:00:58.020> beehive<00:00:58.530> next<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
set up another beehive next to it that

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.750 
set up another beehive next to it that
has<00:00:59.340> brood<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.329> other<00:01:00.510> bees<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
has brood and other bees in it and the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.490 
has brood and other bees in it and the
bees<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.149> nowhere<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.510> go<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.229> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
bees have nowhere to go but into this

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
tried using wasn't working so he got a

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.880 
tried using wasn't working so he got a
different<00:02:57.760> box<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:59.230> bees<00:02:59.470> seem<00:02:59.710> to<00:02:59.800> be

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
different box and the bees seem to be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.940 
different box and the bees seem to be
moving<00:03:00.040> into<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.550> now<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:02.500> know<00:03:02.620> if<00:03:02.800> the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
moving into it now don't know if the

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.770 
moving into it now don't know if the
hole<00:03:03.190> was<00:03:03.430> too<00:03:03.580> small<00:03:03.850> on<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.060> other<00:03:04.180> box<00:03:04.450> or

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
hole was too small on the other box or

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.390 
hole was too small on the other box or
maybe<00:03:04.930> there<00:03:05.380> were<00:03:05.500> too<00:03:05.680> many<00:03:05.800> bees<00:03:06.100> living

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
maybe there were too many bees living

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.430 
maybe there were too many bees living
inside<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.720> bees<00:03:07.930> from<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.170> wall

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
inside it but the bees from the wall

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.250 
inside it but the bees from the wall
just<00:03:08.770> did<00:03:08.980> not<00:03:09.130> want<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.550> move<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:10.170> when<00:03:11.170> he

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
just did not want to move in when he

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.920 
just did not want to move in when he
replaced<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.860> hive<00:03:12.040> he<00:03:12.640> found<00:03:13.030> another<00:03:13.390> hole

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
replaced the hive he found another hole

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.350 
replaced the hive he found another hole
of<00:03:14.140> the<00:03:14.260> bees<00:03:14.470> were<00:03:14.680> going<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.640> back<00:03:16.000> into<00:03:16.210> the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
of the bees were going in back into the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.280 
of the bees were going in back into the
wall<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.840> he<00:03:17.650> was<00:03:17.770> able<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:17.980> seal<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:19.290> so

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
wall and he was able to seal that up so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.360 
wall and he was able to seal that up so
it<00:03:20.350> looks<00:03:20.470> like<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.800> gonna<00:03:20.920> work<00:03:21.100> it's

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it looks like this is gonna work it's

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.550 
it looks like this is gonna work it's
just<00:03:21.490> gonna<00:03:21.610> take<00:03:21.850> some<00:03:21.880> time

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
just gonna take some time

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.860 
just gonna take some time
but<00:03:23.560> that's<00:03:23.709> how<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:23.920> trap<00:03:24.250> out<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.580> done

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.869 

what<00:03:30.870> we're<00:03:31.049> looking<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.409> here<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.879> the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
what we're looking at here is the

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.839 
what we're looking at here is the
exterior<00:03:33.359> wall<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.010> house<00:03:35.159> original

exterior wall of the house original

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.970 
exterior wall of the house original
exterior<00:03:36.750> wall<00:03:37.939> original<00:03:38.939> hive<00:03:39.180> entrance<00:03:39.980> I'm

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
exterior wall original hive entrance I'm

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.069 
exterior wall original hive entrance I'm
guessing<00:03:41.730> they're<00:03:41.969> kind<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.390> blocking<00:03:42.930> off

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
guessing they're kind of blocking off

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.750 
guessing they're kind of blocking off
that<00:03:43.819> exit<00:03:44.819> now<00:03:45.409> I<00:03:46.409> don't<00:03:47.189> know<00:03:47.280> why<00:03:47.489> they

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
that exit now I don't know why they

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.810 
that exit now I don't know why they
would<00:03:47.939> have<00:03:47.969> died<00:03:48.329> there
