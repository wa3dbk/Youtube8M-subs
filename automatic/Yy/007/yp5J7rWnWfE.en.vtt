offline<00:02:11.950> let<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.670> do<00:02:13.180> something<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.599> reset

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989

this<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:16.410> now<00:02:17.410> we're<00:02:17.590> online<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.280> ready<00:02:18.489> to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
this and now we're online and ready to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.970 
this and now we're online and ready to
print<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.269> it's<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.690> easy<00:02:19.840> maybe<00:02:20.680> 10

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
print so it's just that easy maybe 10

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.100 
print so it's just that easy maybe 10
seconds<00:02:21.459> once<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.849> how<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.420> so

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
seconds once you know how to do it so

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.320 
seconds once you know how to do it so
again<00:02:23.260> this<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.769> for<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.040> MX<00:02:24.370> 92<00:02:24.760> -<00:02:24.940> printer

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
again this is for the MX 92 - printer

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.690 
again this is for the MX 92 - printer
I'm<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.230> sure<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:26.739> is<00:02:26.800> widespread

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
I'm not sure if this is widespread

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.089 
I'm not sure if this is widespread
across<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.239> other<00:02:28.420> Canon<00:02:29.049> platforms<00:02:29.709> but<00:02:29.920> if

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
across to other Canon platforms but if

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.280 
across to other Canon platforms but if
so<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:30.880> works<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.569> works<00:02:31.750> every<00:02:32.260> single

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
so it works and it works every single

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.769 
so it works and it works every single
time
