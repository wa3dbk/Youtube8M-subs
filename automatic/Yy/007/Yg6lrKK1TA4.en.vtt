00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.130
 the washing of lucas in mexico 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.320
 and cattle and lucas how is this phase 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.120
 for you are not playing but it was a 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.010
 Preparatory phase of meat is one thing 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.800
 who said he was already expecting the economy with 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.500
 This league is soon Cassian this process 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.779
 that you face to be a very 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.480
 very hard very hard but 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:29.260
 mainly mental than physical 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.359
 because I already came knowing that it would be so 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.949
 and I thought I was fully prepared 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.539
 to face this moment only that it is not 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.190
 anyone facing this moment 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.720
 many people come with words of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.790
 affection of motivation but only really 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 Whoever goes through this knows what is 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.120
 talking then when I talk to the 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.850
 players who went through this as 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.559
 Leandro and explains how 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.660
 retailers and other Spanish Americans 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.660
 that he has contact they understand me 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.250
 because only those who pass know and how I am not 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.320
 as one does not have much training only 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.940
 game you have to pack a way to 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.219
 show for the newspaper coach - that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.660
 You can play and I try. 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.219
 well what have i been trying to do all 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.829
 the days to train two three times 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.119
 extra from training because as 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.279
 There's no way to play and prove it. 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:10.479
 do this but I hope more I 

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:12.429
 I believe everything in life is learning 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.420
 You have to take the learning I 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.729
 I intend to take this as learning 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.289
 next year but if there is a 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.539
 opportunity that year I'll try to grab 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.909
 with one in any way possible and 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.340
 this is your motivation to have this 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.950
 opportunity that light at the end of the tunnel 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.200
 knowing that one hour can get bigger and 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.999
 you hug is always ends at the end 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.649
 of the shift, how have you been for 20 years? 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:35.409
 here you know it 's alloy is an alloy 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.789
 very long everything happens you never 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.899
 Do you know if it will hurt the animal? 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.009
 is sick 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.299
 You never know what's going to happen. 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.429
 problem in the game will be 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.049
 always prepared the technician intends 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.340
 call your name you are prepared by the 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.509
 opportunity 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.799
 So that's what you've been trying to do. 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.630
 every day for more than sometimes 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.069
 change of clothes at the time of the times I 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.290
 always with prepared mentality that the 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.500
 people never know 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.970
 has a physical characteristic by the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.400
 same time as the position that 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.230
 You play nec inside the car is very 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.450
 players contact that is more 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.630
 prepared is a motivation of the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.600
 aldermen who motivate you to work out 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.950
 plus the physical part not they always 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.050
 They do that but I have more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.540
 actually I had a lot of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.220
 very large mass in the part of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.500
 body but I discovered that neither the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.670
 stronger in the most important part 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.560
 because the fight even in the waist to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 and where they have to gain more weight in 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.450
 leg but more strength but the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 effective absurd gain on the shoulder 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.800
 through arm workout with johnny deep 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.320
 trainer best entry 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.520
 quite and also physical because the part 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.480
 conditioning is important to 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.110
 score 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.570
 the owner is now for him guinea is a smoker 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.360
 Something that we are already living here 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.640
 day by day knows that one is expected 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.140
 maybe for this difficult but I think 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.090
 eventually when he returns he will 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.030
 understand other than a year 2 and will 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.010
 understand that this process is natural and 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.480
 important for him to grow as 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.830
 he's seeing this I know you do not 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.390
 is in his position to talk about 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.030
 he but you are always in contact 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.700
 How do you see this acceptance? 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.180
 his kind of law at that time he is 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.340
 good 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.870
 He is also positive, positive too. 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.840
 with this opportunity to play because 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.000
 he wants to play as he wants to play is 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.739
 It does not turn off, so you're happy. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.140
 Only lately we do not have minutes. 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.970
 there on the right too so I do not know how 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.320
 is his head but they only think of 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.830
 play because he's a hardworking brat 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.720
 too much mc that has a talent 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.090
 amazing and he wants to play show the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.049
 he is ready is active then 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.940
 this experience has passed nothing 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.010
 negative to attract driving to the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.049
 less is what I know it starts a lot 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.790
 he is learning there too that the 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.180
 Turn off like you do not have the glamor that is 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.620
 that the meat item ended up giving more 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.580
 humility more willing to work for 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.560
 keep on 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.690
 is cool now as it is being 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.480
 so for you a dedication that you 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.310
 that you have to have mainly is the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.150
 care what you have to have with what 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.800
 you make what you say it's true that 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.290
 I already suffered a lot in relation to the care 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.760
 I speak what I do often 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.920
 badness but they ended up converting 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.590
 evil words I then spoke to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.200
 discussing lately try to take care of the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.060
 double in relation to my personal life and 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.220
 a life is a very tiring routine 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.290
 Do you know what it's like to play airplane? 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.230
 and precocity to play has been so many times 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.880
 take 15 days trip in mexico goals 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.920
 so try to prepare very mentally 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.200
 physically for me to be careful in 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.430
 not hurt or not be that cool 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.710
 had in the city that the frida with a 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.700
 hot potatoes so it 's a very routine 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.560
 tiring 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.390
 So much for who throws everything for me that does not 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.090
 play because as in the game try eight 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.320
 days and in which training doubles but 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.390
 people are always learning how you 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.450
 I spoke 'is always taking a lesson from this 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.030
 of this life and this group trip 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.470
 I heard some comments from Brazil that made 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.230
 should not have left 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.260
 How do you see this guy, I know. 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:55.290
 which is one on a break it 's good to say English 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.480
 that you have said there is a 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.960
 bit of your routine that at certain times 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.650
 and it even helps in the process of 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.020
 evolution here but how do you see 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.840
 these comments that arose in Brazil 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.330
 people sometimes they talk things 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.700
 without knowledge or understanding because the 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.340
 Most people do not know the 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.190
 people are staying to train, I would not be 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.500
 on the site by holden rule environmental law 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.610
 always have to go out easy because it 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.160
 is rich 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.380
 so I tried to break so he got the 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.300
 Brazil everyone saw me in a photo 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.550
 carnival in the sapucaí but nobody took it 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.340
 picture with family enjoying my 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.350
 sobriety one month old or a 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.760
 year and a half of life in the under 16 years 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.630
 No one went to my house to take these 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.600
 photos of the villain 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.180
 are controversial photos and people do not have 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.580
 knowledge of this thinks that people 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.810
 He preferred Brazil himself and enjoyed the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.150
 More 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.370
 but the idea was to stay the two 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.380
 nanning toronto training but as the 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.310
 Name is already what we have to have 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.780
 a break 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.670
 anyway because a rule 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.370
 levels I do not care for it and understand 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.380
 I try to turn this into training 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.910
 he who motivates me more to 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.220
 get a space and try to show in the 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.620
 house have spoken a lot but it was a 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.870
 subject that makes me very upset but 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.880
 this is it is the first time nor the second 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.160
 The time I say it will happen. 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.960
 I did not win or hurt but I'm used to it. 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.550
 it's really the jaguar that leaves a lot 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.340
 upset 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.150
 Good luck for you, cheering for you. 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.350
 Always touch here watching you and 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.540
 cheering for you 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.550
 success if she has a great chance 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.550
 to reach the playoffs and show who 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.050
 You know what your talent is, God willing. 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.790
 we are always in search of a place 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.700
 the sun always trying to show the 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.990
 coach that people can more clearly 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.110
 with great humility and feet on the ground 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.110
 mainly
