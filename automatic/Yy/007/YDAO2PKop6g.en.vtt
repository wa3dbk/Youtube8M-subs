utilizing the system for a little over a
year<00:00:30.119> now<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.790> think<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.059> very

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
year now and I just think it's very

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.150

promise<00:00:34.050> time<00:00:34.200> workflow<00:00:34.620> has<00:00:34.770> changed<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
promise time workflow has changed the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.100 
promise time workflow has changed the
way<00:00:35.280> our<00:00:35.309> staff<00:00:35.760> processes<00:00:36.480> prescriptions

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
because it allows them to organize the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
because it allows them to organize the
prescriptions<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.879> right<00:00:42.059> order<00:00:42.300> so
