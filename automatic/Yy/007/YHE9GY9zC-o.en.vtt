00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
people would love well I think when you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.460 
people would love well I think when you
see<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> demo<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.160> first<00:00:29.460> time<00:00:30.199> it's<00:00:31.199> just

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
see a demo for the first time it's just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.899 
see a demo for the first time it's just
a<00:00:31.560> stunning<00:00:32.099> elegant<00:00:32.550> minimalist<00:00:33.440> form<00:00:34.909> and

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:35.909 
a stunning elegant minimalist form and

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:38.599 
a stunning elegant minimalist form and
then<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.929> start<00:00:37.289> seeing<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.769> layers<00:00:38.100> of

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609 
then you start seeing the layers of

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.099 
then you start seeing the layers of
materials<00:00:39.239> they'll<00:00:39.600> Luminum<00:00:40.229> the<00:00:40.890> real<00:00:41.159> glass

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
materials they'll Luminum the real glass

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.110 
materials they'll Luminum the real glass
and<00:00:43.109> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.499> that<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.739> touch<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> it'll

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and I think that when you touch it it'll

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
and I think that when you touch it it'll
be<00:00:45.510> an<00:00:45.690> experience<00:00:46.319> you<00:00:46.499> haven't<00:00:46.800> felt<00:00:47.010> before

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
be an experience you haven't felt before

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.110 
be an experience you haven't felt before
that<00:00:48.030> these<00:00:48.510> are<00:00:48.690> honest<00:00:49.229> materials<00:00:50.120> that

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that these are honest materials that

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
that these are honest materials that
they<00:00:51.389> have<00:00:51.839> a<00:00:51.870> certain<00:00:52.370> temperature<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.940> them

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
they have a certain temperature to them

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
they have a certain temperature to them
that<00:00:55.109> comes<00:00:55.350> from<00:00:55.469> being<00:00:55.620> real<00:00:56.339> metal<00:00:56.639> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that comes from being real metal and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.539 
that comes from being real metal and
real<00:00:57.269> glass<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.589> manage<00:00:58.889> find<00:00:59.159> some<00:00:59.339> way<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
real glass we manage find some way to

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.860 
real glass we manage find some way to
scope<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> key<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.949> every<00:01:02.519> kick<00:01:03.059> up<00:01:03.209> a<00:01:03.239> little

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
scope the key so every kick up a little

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.109 
scope the key so every kick up a little
bit<00:01:03.989> scalloped<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.710> make<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.309> typing<00:01:05.909> very

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
bit scalloped and make to typing very

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.950 
bit scalloped and make to typing very
comfortable<00:01:07.640> also<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:09.240> no<00:01:09.509> compromise

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
comfortable also there's no compromise

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.529 
comfortable also there's no compromise
around<00:01:10.500> connectors<00:01:11.009> so<00:01:11.340> even<00:01:12.329> though<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
around connectors so even though you

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.050 
around connectors so even though you
have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:14.780> thin<00:01:15.780> product<00:01:16.609> do<00:01:17.609> you<00:01:17.640> see<00:01:17.820> as

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
have a very thin product do you see as

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.190 
have a very thin product do you see as
the<00:01:18.090> ability<00:01:18.539> to<00:01:19.079> to<00:01:19.530> stay<00:01:20.039> connected<00:01:20.430> either
