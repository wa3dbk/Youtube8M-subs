 of the comics line of sandwiches but now 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.260
 the newly announced for some time 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 now a slide of ten cine comic one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 more grand than the other 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.230
 stuff to make your wrists all marvel tremble 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.469
 fans are completely waiting for 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.969

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.530
 announced will enlarge continuity 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.440
 narrative of the marlohe universe that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 started in 2008 now with iron man e 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.899
 which arrived April 22 with outgoing 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.969
 the avengers film to the young or later 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.920
 of the previous avengers those who 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.010
 I look forward to more anxiously I am 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.930
 captain america civil war because it is one 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
 of the most comic marvel events 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.879
 splendid that have ever been written e 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.210
 drawn and one of the most significant e 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.750
 for the story of the marvel that panther 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 black because it is one of the minor characters 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.640
 and of the marvel universe which however is among the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 my absolute favorites this hero 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.190
 can always African in the middle of the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 tradition and the technology that lives in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:25.080
 this very advanced nation the wakanda 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.760
 which I don't actually know as marvel 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.180
 will manage to take all these 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.280
 elements to transpose them into a single film but 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.290
 I'm sure he will do it with great style 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.050
 without speaking then of the sequels of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.130
 avengers including the war of infinity 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.670
 which is inspired by one of the events 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.670
 marvel most beautiful of the 80s for 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.759
 the precisely the war of the infinite in which 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.070
 thanos finally owns the 5 gems 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.470
 of infinity and begins to make war 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.690
 with all the heroes of the universe rules 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.690
 from those more earthly as devil as 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.690
 spiderman and as avengers to those cosmos 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.220
 yes for which I believe marvel has 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.769
 in front of him a splendid future of ideas 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.540
 innovation and blockbuster movies that 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.230
 will no doubt be a great success 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.160
 of civil war public is a comic 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.489
 very complex to adapt as far as 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 concerns the transposition from the card 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.650
 to the film basically because it is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.599
 an event that involved 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.489
 a few years ago all the characters 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.439
 of the marvel universe 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.780
 already this is obviously a thing 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.819
 practically impossible to achieve 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.290
 because as we know not all rights 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.000
 of the characters of the night was in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.400
 possession of marvel studios for which 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.590
 some characters who had a role 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.359
 very prominent in the film as per 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 the memo the fantastic four non 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.709
 they can have it because not only 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.109
 studio murray sma fox owners 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.239
 nevertheless I am very confident that 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.400
 also marvell was able to demonstrate in 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.690
 more than one occasion to have been in 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:10.319
 degree with what he had to create gods 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:13.780
 truly explosive and functional films 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.530
 marvel has always been inspired by 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.170
 stories written on paper of the universe 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.840
 traditional and adapted by taking 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.079
 only the best of what he had a 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.239
 arrangement for cinematic marvel i 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.489
 universe what undoubtedly not 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.030
 it may be lacking and I am sure it will not fail 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.099
 and the profound difference that will come out 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.900
 between the two characters that until today 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.879
 they characterized the magician at the cinema 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.760
 tv universe and have carried it forward 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.549
 that is captain america errors and iron 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.919
 man the genius capitan america and it 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.569
 spirit of patriotism iron man and lo 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.659
 spirit of capitalism 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.840
 the clash between these two spirits 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.299
 will bring sparks 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.379
 explosive surely the film 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.049
 will reach levels never seen before 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.750
 between that marble is certainly the marvel 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.180
 studios and sony have decided to 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.670
 coproduce the next spiderman movie 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.680
 this means that although the rights 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.560
 of the character still remain in the hand 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.870
 at sony marvel studios will become one 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.489
 important part of the management of 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.680
 what will be the next stories of 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.860
 spider man and spider man will become a 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.449
 all effects a character from 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.710
 great family of cinematic marvel 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.419
 universe 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.260
 this in my opinion is news 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.660
 beautiful because it always Peider 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.780
 embodies what is the spirit of 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.570
 marvel superheroes when i was born 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.130
 marvel superheroes in the 60s 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.860
 unlike their counterparts 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.500
 of the dc comics who were heroes 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.020
 iconic almost of the gods the heroes 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.600
 marvel were shy common men 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.960
 teen characters they had gods 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.000
 super problems before superpowers 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.090
 this was the big difference and this 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.949
 state was the real game change that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.740
 in the sixties allowed mardan to 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:07.169
 impose on competition introduction 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.270
 of a character as a spider man 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.360
 inside the cinematic marvel 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 universe is undoubtedly a sign of 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.470
 great importance that will lead to the mar 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.840
 the beautiful film that spirit that up 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 now it was just proper gods 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.680
 comics 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.930
 according to me marvel is doing a 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.090
 great adaptation work not 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.220
 only for the movies but also for the series 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.260
 all the superheroes are televised 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.060
 of the classical universe of the universe 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.310
 ultimate and also of the other universes 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.310
 parallels of the spring and why that 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.690
 marvel is not just a universe 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.060
 multiverse as it is defined in jargon 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.600
 that is a universe made up of many 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.430
 several parallel universes 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.040
 but now he is bringing them more or less 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.040
 all on the big screen on the small 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.400
 screen for example I look forward to 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.240
 the TV series that will soon be released on 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.430
 netflix 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.760
 I just saw the second trailer 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.280
 extended to daredevil character and street 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.970
 marvel emails an executioner a 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.040
 blind superhero that during the day ago 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.320
 the lawyer and during the night yes 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.890
 turns into a vigilante I am love 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.170
 of his hell's kitchen neighborhood for 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.710
 defend it from the criminals who are 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:26.110
 taking possession of this transposition 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.870
 that starts from the stories of 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:31.840
 frank miller a storytelling genius a 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.660
 comics for both texts and drawings 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.120
 I am sure they will be one of the things 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.050
 most beautiful that we will see on television in 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.720
 next years 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:43.390
 so I believe that slowly marvel 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.730
 will bring within his non universe 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.440
 only film but also a bit television 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.350
 all his characters and I hope you 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.600
 always take care with attention and 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.650
 respect for the characters themselves and has 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.650
 used until now
