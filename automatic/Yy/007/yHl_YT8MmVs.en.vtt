00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.370
 Products 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.739
 have you ever had a kids penguin? 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.629
 placed in the freezer if not then 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 You should definitely do that 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.100
 is definitely one of my favorite 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.989
 unhealthy snacks if you like because 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.640
 that's like eating an ice cream though 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.259
 one is nevertheless a children's penguin 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.509
 and it's still a bit creamy 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.350
 Delicious and very refreshing 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.350
 I can only recommend it to you 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.670
 Let's stay with them right away 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.130
 unhealthy snacks I love it as well 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.440
 totally to make myself an ice cream parlor 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.440
 I'm not the coffee lover 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.140
 but eiscafe with cold milk and then 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.970
 vanilla ice to where my god that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.700
 so delicious that such a delicious dessert 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.560
 or a refreshment thing you look at 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.009
 You can do it yourself at home 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.009
 five euros 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.729
 Friendship Ribbon who still knows her 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.579
 I link you below in the infos times 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.229
 to put a link and with that you can 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.000
 then make such ribbons yourself 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.530
 and I think that's really nice if you 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 which was carrying around the foot, the right one 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.020
 nice summery and cheap 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.020
 accessories 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.600
 a lifestyle masters for me in the summer 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.340
 are in any case also soap bubbles 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600
 I link you below in the infos 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.330
 which there are definitely 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.360
 favorable so you have as much fun 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 and you can do cool photos as well 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.330
 I'm always fascinated by that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.670
 what nice snapshots there 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.110
 can arise and on festivals or 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.060
 on any other solid ones 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.060
 have an absolute must for me 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.300
 This freshness should be for the shoes of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.550
 valea will be here for me in the summer 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.050
 absolute lifesaver I'm considering the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.030
 always in my school and the 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.470
 prevent the feet from standing and that 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.210
 yes, on an intel arien or 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.330
 other open shoes very quickly 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.330
 happen 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.940
 and should, if all else fails 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.830
 this foot and studio is just this 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.170
 Sort here with blood orange for me 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.760
 absolute favorite if so with the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.500
 feet and also jump in the school 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.570
 can and then everything went so well 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.380
 somehow I orange myself and that likes it 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.380
 really like full 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.530
 my next must-have will be some 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.540
 maybe a bit ugly 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.820
 but i am a total fan of eyewear 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.080
 countries because you know that when you have one 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.150
 glasses on his head had with this 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.040
 share names and then your hair like that 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.960
 be pulled out and you can 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.360
 have glasses with you when you have that 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.220
 The band has without it the hair 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.260
 be stupidly pulled out of the pot 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.260
 That's why I think that's absolutely great 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.290
 Thermal water spray is with me too 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.730
 always at the start because I'm super 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.260
 Of course you can find it refreshing 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.160
 Also water just in one point 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.900
 fill dispenser 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.700
 but in such thermal waters are there 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 minerals in it then the skin somehow 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.780
 I take care of it in the summer and I think so 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.780
 There is a great deal of pleasantness in the pharmacy 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.260
 lifestyle favorite number nine is what 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.540
 for sports activities in the summer 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.040
 and a jump rope I have mine 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.570
 the decathlon I bought myself can 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.870
 but also something under five euros 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.480
 link in the infos and I think so 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.650
 sit really exhausting because 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.940
 you are so different things 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.160
 but it can be superior as well 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.210
 unbelievably much fun and you get that way 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.660
 quickly out of breath 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.500
 it is effective somehow and still 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.450
 coordinatively even if it is here with me 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 sometimes a little bit falls and then hurts 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.180
 But do I find the right right 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.180
 cool 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.350
 and something else smelling and that one 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.930
 Softener I am a total 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.910
 softener and especially lenor 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.790
 are really delicious and right now 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.620
 right here's this l and i know 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.150
 I just love how the laundry is there 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.870
 I do and that is for me then 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.870
 just summer 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.539
 franz aertker I really right 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:00.520
 Cool takes place in the summer and the less 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.739
 Of course, there are still costs of 5 euros 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.959

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.119

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.219
