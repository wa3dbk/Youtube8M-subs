00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.899 
and now is to read that the foregrip and
quick<00:01:57.299> draw<00:01:57.840> grip<00:01:58.530> i<00:01:58.890> think<00:01:59.460> i'm<00:01:59.549> really

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
quick draw grip i think i'm really

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.550 
quick draw grip i think i'm really
missing<00:02:00.329> i<00:02:00.450> didn't<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.170> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
missing i didn't have one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.289 
missing i didn't have one
I<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.310> gameplay<00:02:02.610> was<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
I you know got this gameplay was the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.380 
I you know got this gameplay was the
heat<00:02:03.600> sink<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> extends<00:02:05.700> firing<00:02:06.149> time

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
heat sink and that extends firing time

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.740 
heat sink and that extends firing time
from<00:02:06.689> overheating<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.860> gives<00:02:08.489> plus<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.300> fire

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
from overheating and gives plus to fire

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.979 
from overheating and gives plus to fire
it<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.649> once<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> get<00:02:11.099> heat<00:02:11.430> sink<00:02:12.150> unlocked

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
it so once you get heat sink unlocked

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.020 
it so once you get heat sink unlocked
you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.709> that<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.130> really<00:02:14.370> helps<00:02:14.760> out<00:02:14.849> it's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
you know that that really helps out it's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.850 
you know that that really helps out it's
really<00:02:15.270> needed<00:02:15.780> because<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.230> do<00:02:16.440> run<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.830> of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
really needed because you do run out of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.250 
really needed because you do run out of
ammo<00:02:17.340> really<00:02:17.760> fast<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.390> know<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.810> barely

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
ammo really fast you know you can barely

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.100 
ammo really fast you know you can barely
kill<00:02:19.860> one<00:02:20.130> person<00:02:20.160> let<00:02:20.910> alone<00:02:20.940> killing<00:02:21.930> two

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
kill one person let alone killing two

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.440 
kill one person let alone killing two
people<00:02:22.140> at<00:02:22.620> times<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> question<00:02:23.550> so

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
people at times out of the question so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150 
people at times out of the question so
you<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.720> need<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.019> heat<00:02:25.470> sink<00:02:25.800> it's<00:02:26.010> like

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
you really need that heat sink it's like

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.940 
you really need that heat sink it's like
extended<00:02:26.790> mag<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.269> a<00:02:27.360> way<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.830> this

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
extended mag in a way and I think this

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.770 
extended mag in a way and I think this
guns<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.459> underpowered<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.690> know

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
guns pretty underpowered you know

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.870 
guns pretty underpowered you know
someone<00:02:31.140> caught<00:02:31.349> it<00:02:31.440> out<00:02:31.560> perfectly<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.489> you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
someone caught it out perfectly that you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.640 
someone caught it out perfectly that you
know<00:02:33.030> it's<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.540> not<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.110> good<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.440> gun

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650

the<00:04:34.910> volume<00:04:35.180> down<00:04:35.270> Carlos<00:04:35.840> somebody<00:04:36.320> was

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530

the volume down Carlos somebody was
calling<00:04:36.770> me<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.400> would<00:04:37.520> say<00:04:37.670> that<00:04:37.850> that's

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
calling me and I would say that that's

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.720 
calling me and I would say that that's
the<00:04:38.390> biggest<00:04:38.630> problem<00:04:39.140> with<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.890> Widowmaker

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
the biggest problem with the Widowmaker

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.140 
the biggest problem with the Widowmaker
it's<00:04:41.180> its<00:04:41.390> accuracy<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.620> when<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.370> shoot<00:04:43.820> it

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
it's its accuracy like when you shoot it

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.380 
it's its accuracy like when you shoot it
just<00:04:44.450> kicks<00:04:45.070> everywhere<00:04:46.070> it's<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:46.760> ridiculous

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
just kicks everywhere it's so ridiculous

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.190 
just kicks everywhere it's so ridiculous
it's<00:04:47.630> so<00:04:47.900> hard<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.100> keep<00:04:49.490> your<00:04:50.330> aim<00:04:50.600> on<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
it's so hard to keep your aim on the

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200 
it's so hard to keep your aim on the
enemy<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.890> know<00:04:52.040> it<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.190> goes<00:04:52.550> everywhere

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
enemy you know it just goes everywhere

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.990 
enemy you know it just goes everywhere
and<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.810> doesn't<00:04:54.140> do<00:04:54.230> enough<00:04:54.320> damage<00:04:54.530> yeah<00:04:55.310> so

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
and it doesn't do enough damage yeah so

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.750 
and it doesn't do enough damage yeah so
many<00:04:56.360> hit<00:04:56.660> markers<00:04:57.170> it's<00:04:57.860> just<00:04:58.160> ridiculous

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
many hit markers it's just ridiculous

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.450 
many hit markers it's just ridiculous
yeah<00:04:59.090> I<00:04:59.450> really<00:05:00.110> don't<00:05:00.320> like<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.680> gun<00:05:00.860> at<00:05:01.250> all

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460
