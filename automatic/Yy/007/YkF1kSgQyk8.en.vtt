new<00:00:07.770> career<00:00:07.890> mode<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> legends<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.730> has

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000

new career mode the legends one has
finished<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.800> see<00:00:10.800> I<00:00:10.830> thought<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.130> picked

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
finished and see I thought I picked

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.030 
finished and see I thought I picked
doorman<00:00:11.730> they<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.240> very<00:00:12.780> good<00:00:13.049> team<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
doorman they are a very good team but of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.189 
doorman they are a very good team but of
course<00:00:14.250> by<00:00:14.429> munich<00:00:14.790> are<00:00:14.940> probably<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> best

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
course by munich are probably the best

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.240 
course by munich are probably the best
team<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> world<00:00:16.529> right<00:00:16.740> now<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> thought

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
team in the world right now so I thought

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
team in the world right now so I thought
it'd<00:00:17.400> be<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> very<00:00:18.000> good<00:00:18.060> challenge<00:00:18.359> trying<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it'd be a very good challenge trying to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.260 
it'd be a very good challenge trying to
overcome<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.380> beat<00:00:19.560> them<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:20.880> really

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
overcome and beat them and I also really

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689 
overcome and beat them and I also really

use most games 43 curry attacks so you

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.720

at<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.579> winger<00:00:42.270> i<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.140> could<00:00:43.290> do

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
at a winger i think that we could do

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
at a winger i think that we could do
with<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> winger<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.670> probably<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.539> strike<00:00:45.870> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
with a winger and probably a strike so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.150 
with a winger and probably a strike so
these<00:00:46.320> are<00:00:46.469> some<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> players<00:00:46.860> I've<00:00:47.039> been

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
now the reason behind right offers from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
now the reason behind right offers from
other<00:01:36.210> teams<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.600> roma<00:01:36.930> drones<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
other teams you know roma drones to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.039 
other teams you know roma drones to
throw<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> higher<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:39.630> i<00:01:39.659> thought<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.020> know

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
throw a higher but i thought you know

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
throw a higher but i thought you know
because<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.530> pre-contract<00:01:40.920> things<00:01:41.280> only<00:01:41.400> six

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
because the pre-contract things only six

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
because the pre-contract things only six
months<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.119> he's<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.390> 12<00:01:42.600> months<00:01:42.899> left<00:01:43.079> I

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
months and he's got 12 months left I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.170 
months and he's got 12 months left I
started<00:01:43.979> try<00:01:44.130> make<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.640> more<00:01:44.670> realistic

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
started try make it a bit more realistic

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.609 
started try make it a bit more realistic
you<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.540> loan<00:01:45.810> docs<00:01:46.020> he's<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> into

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you know loan docs he's going it into

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.980 
you know loan docs he's going it into
the<00:01:46.710> season<00:01:46.920> I've<00:01:47.399> sent<00:01:47.700> him<00:01:47.790> now<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.840> much

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the season I've sent him now not much

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.270 
the season I've sent him now not much
difference<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.500> I've<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> extra<00:01:49.950> funds

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
difference and I've got the extra funds

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.069 
difference and I've got the extra funds
I<00:01:50.460> guess<00:01:50.610> which<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.030> shouldn't<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.479> but<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I guess which I shouldn't have but you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
I guess which I shouldn't have but you
know<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> doesn't<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.680> matter<00:01:52.970> yeah<00:01:53.970> he's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
know it doesn't really matter yeah he's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
know it doesn't really matter yeah he's
basically<00:01:54.360> gone<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> buy<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
basically gone to buy and so that is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
basically gone to buy and so that is
that<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:56.130> think<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.520> makes<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.479> little

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that I think it makes it a bit a little

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.240 
that I think it makes it a bit a little
bit<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.079> realistic<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.710> might<00:01:58.829> give<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.070> was

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
bit more realistic I might give this was

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.090 
bit more realistic I might give this was
some<00:01:59.640> extra<00:01:59.969> funds<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> play<00:02:00.420> with<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.100> yeah

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
some extra funds to play with but yeah

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
some extra funds to play with but yeah
that's<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.640> it's<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.000> gonna

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that's that and it's a lot it's gonna

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
that's that and it's a lot it's gonna
allow<00:02:03.570> us<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:03.990> some<00:02:04.140> other<00:02:04.290> deals<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.710> yeah

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
allow us to do some other deals so yeah

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.080 
allow us to do some other deals so yeah
it's<00:02:05.219> important<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.850> another

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
even though Landowski has left I mean

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
so I'm not worried about that but I

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.490 
so I'm not worried about that but I
thought<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.930> could<00:03:51.959> get<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.260> another

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
thought that we could get in another

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.900 
thought that we could get in another
wing<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.860> just<00:03:53.040> looking<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.400> Wynn<00:03:53.519> options

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
if we're gonna have two years you know I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.900 
if we're gonna have two years you know I
thought<00:03:55.830> we<00:03:55.950> needed<00:03:56.160> someone<00:03:56.400> plus<00:03:56.700> we<00:03:56.820> had

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
thought we needed someone plus we had

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.610 
thought we needed someone plus we had
money<00:03:57.150> spare<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.660> I<00:03:57.720> thought<00:03:57.870> yep<00:03:58.170> let's<00:03:58.380> do<00:03:58.500> it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
is probably

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.390 
is probably
my<00:04:27.389> main<00:04:27.599> man<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.960> left<00:04:28.199> Griezmann<00:04:29.159> will

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
my main man on the left Griezmann will

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.770 
my main man on the left Griezmann will
probably<00:04:29.699> be<00:04:29.879> the<00:04:30.000> guy<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.330> use<00:04:30.539> on<00:04:30.569> the

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
probably be the guy that I use on the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.570 
probably be the guy that I use on the
right<00:04:30.990> so<00:04:31.349> I<00:04:31.379> think<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:31.770> how<00:04:32.099> we'll<00:04:32.280> do<00:04:32.520> it

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
right so I think that's how we'll do it

that was grieving that same up but yeah

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.610 
that was grieving that same up but yeah

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379

lots on just like this but generally

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:30.740 
lots on just like this but generally
what<00:06:29.400> would<00:06:29.490> happen<00:06:29.789> is<00:06:29.879> like<00:06:30.060> a<00:06:30.180> chance<00:06:30.569> like

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
what would happen is like a chance like

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.480 
what would happen is like a chance like
that<00:06:30.810> and<00:06:31.229> then<00:06:31.349> the<00:06:31.409> keepers<00:06:31.710> say<00:06:31.889> that<00:06:32.129> and

that buying so strong in FIFA not are

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.640 
that buying so strong in FIFA not are
strong<00:06:54.090> because<00:06:54.180> FIFA's<00:06:54.720> like<00:06:54.930> random<00:06:55.380> and

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
strong because FIFA's like random and

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
know by the way I just keep talking even

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
know by the way I just keep talking even
though<00:06:59.160> it'll<00:06:59.250> be<00:06:59.370> a<00:06:59.400> black<00:06:59.610> screen<00:06:59.760> for<00:07:00.000> a

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
though it'll be a black screen for a

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.360 
though it'll be a black screen for a
little<00:07:00.150> bit<00:07:00.300> and<00:07:00.480> and<00:07:01.170> then<00:07:01.620> Champions<00:07:02.130> League
