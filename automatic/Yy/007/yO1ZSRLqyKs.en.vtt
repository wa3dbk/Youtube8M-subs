00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
before okay showing you my artistic

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.160 
before okay showing you my artistic
color<00:01:16.890> course<00:01:17.159> LED<00:01:17.670> light<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.020> best

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
color course LED light there so the best

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
color course LED light there so the best
thing<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.030> LED<00:01:21.030> light

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
thing that I like about that LED light

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.210 
thing that I like about that LED light
is<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> fact<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> sets<00:01:22.470> polishes<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.040> 30

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
is the fact that it sets polishes in 30

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060 
is the fact that it sets polishes in 30
seconds<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:24.420> it's<00:01:24.840> sensotouch<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.009> you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
seconds and also it's sensotouch so you

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.230 
seconds and also it's sensotouch so you
don't<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.430> keep<00:01:26.549> pressing<00:01:26.729> buttons<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
don't have to keep pressing buttons to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
don't have to keep pressing buttons to
turn<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
turn it off and on so I'm going in and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.670 
turn it off and on so I'm going in and
apply<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.610> polish<00:01:29.970> there<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.680> remembering

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
apply my polish there and remembering

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460 
apply my polish there and remembering
it's<00:01:31.890> super<00:01:32.189> thin<00:01:32.400> coats<00:01:33.079> otherwise<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.290> gel

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it's super thin coats otherwise the gel

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.640 
it's super thin coats otherwise the gel
polish<00:01:34.619> itself<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.220> bubble<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.530> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
polish itself will bubble so you have to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.679 
polish itself will bubble so you have to
make<00:01:37.799> sure<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.150> thin<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
make sure that you do them so thin that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.950 
make sure that you do them so thin that
they<00:01:39.900> quite<00:01:40.110> share<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> build<00:01:41.430> them<00:01:41.640> up<00:01:41.960> three

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
they quite share and build them up three

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.380 
they quite share and build them up three
to<00:01:43.049> four<00:01:43.229> coats<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.890> need<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:45.270> this

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to four coats if you need to for this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
to four coats if you need to for this
one<00:01:45.450> I've<00:01:45.810> decided<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> go<00:01:46.409> ahead<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.799> do

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
one I've decided to go ahead and do

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.149 
one I've decided to go ahead and do
three<00:01:47.159> coats<00:01:47.869> after<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> each<00:01:49.259> coat<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:50.009> go

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
I'm the image and how it transfers on

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.520 
I'm the image and how it transfers on
now<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.329> I'm<00:02:22.420> basically<00:02:22.840> showing<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.290> here

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
now what I'm basically showing you here

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.080 
now what I'm basically showing you here
is<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.739> image<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.159> too<00:02:24.340> small<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:24.790> my<00:02:24.909> now

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
is the image is too small for my now

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.009 
is the image is too small for my now
even<00:02:25.989> though<00:02:26.140> those<00:02:26.290> images<00:02:26.769> are<00:02:26.980> full<00:02:27.280> size

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
even though those images are full size

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.119 
even though those images are full size
obviously<00:02:29.019> my<00:02:29.140> nails<00:02:29.620> are<00:02:29.739> quite<00:02:29.920> long<00:02:30.069> so

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
obviously my nails are quite long so

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.920 
obviously my nails are quite long so
they're<00:02:30.340> not<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.609> to<00:02:30.640> fit<00:02:30.909> and<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.659> you<00:02:31.810> can

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
they're not going to fit and as you can

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.660 
they're not going to fit and as you can
see<00:02:32.140> there's<00:02:32.319> quite<00:02:32.439> a<00:02:32.560> significant<00:02:33.280> gap<00:02:33.430> with

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
see there's quite a significant gap with

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.420 
see there's quite a significant gap with
the<00:02:33.909> step<00:02:34.180> itself<00:02:34.480> doesn't<00:02:34.810> fit<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:36.129> what<00:02:36.310> I'm

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
the step itself doesn't fit so what I'm

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.170 
the step itself doesn't fit so what I'm
going<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.609> do<00:02:36.730> instead<00:02:36.879> is<00:02:37.390> I'm<00:02:38.200> going<00:02:38.470> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
going to do instead is I'm going to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.899 
going to do instead is I'm going to
stamp<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.420> nail<00:02:40.599> twice<00:02:41.049> I<00:02:41.459> mean<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.579> guess<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
stamp the nail twice I mean I guess you

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.250 
stamp the nail twice I mean I guess you
could<00:02:42.939> try<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.269> be<00:02:43.359> patient<00:02:43.599> and<00:02:43.900> match<00:02:44.079> it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
could try and be patient and match it

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.599 
could try and be patient and match it
perfectly<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.859> I'm<00:02:44.980> never<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.400> to<00:02:45.430> match

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:45.609 
perfectly but I'm never going to match

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.670 
perfectly but I'm never going to match
it<00:02:45.760> perfectly<00:02:45.959> so<00:02:46.959> what<00:02:47.049> I'm<00:02:47.139> going<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.349> do<00:02:47.530> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
and then pick up the stamp and print the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.740 
and then pick up the stamp and print the
other<00:02:53.530> half<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:53.889> the<00:02:53.980> nail<00:02:54.510> you'll<00:02:55.510> see

other half of the nail you'll see
shortly<00:02:56.939> where<00:02:57.939> the<00:02:58.030> two<00:02:58.209> stamps<00:02:58.569> meet

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
shortly where the two stamps meet

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.420 
shortly where the two stamps meet
there's<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.019> little<00:02:59.200> bit<00:02:59.290> of<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.409> gap<00:02:59.620> I'm<00:03:00.129> not

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430

going<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.069> spin<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> nail<00:03:24.639> around<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.540> I'm

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
going to spin the nail around and I'm

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.930 
going to spin the nail around and I'm
going<00:03:26.169> to<00:03:26.349> mirror<00:03:27.010> image<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.489> on<00:03:27.639> the<00:03:27.760> other

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
going to mirror image it on the other

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.909 
going to mirror image it on the other
side<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:29.199> just<00:03:29.379> take<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.590> little<00:03:29.709> bit<00:03:29.859> of

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
side so I just take a little bit of

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.580 
side so I just take a little bit of
practice<00:03:30.040> sometimes<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.760> kind<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.060> line<00:03:31.329> it<00:03:31.480> up

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
practice sometimes to kind of line it up

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.680 
practice sometimes to kind of line it up
and<00:03:32.590> remembering<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:33.609> your<00:03:33.909> polish<00:03:34.389> dries

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
and remembering that your polish dries

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.780 
and remembering that your polish dries
quite<00:03:35.049> quickly<00:03:35.409> so<00:03:35.799> if<00:03:35.919> you<00:03:36.069> leave<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> longer

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
quite quickly so if you leave it longer

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.379 
quite quickly so if you leave it longer
than<00:03:36.909> let's<00:03:37.120> say<00:03:37.299> 10<00:03:37.569> seconds<00:03:38.199> your<00:03:39.239> image<00:03:40.239> is

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
than let's say 10 seconds your image is

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.670 
than let's say 10 seconds your image is
probably<00:03:40.569> not<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:41.049> transfer<00:03:41.470> every

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
probably not going to transfer every

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.280 
probably not going to transfer every
works<00:03:41.919> it<00:03:42.069> will<00:03:42.129> have<00:03:42.310> dried<00:03:42.549> out<00:03:42.989> okay<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.019> as

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
works it will have dried out okay so as

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.469 
works it will have dried out okay so as
you<00:03:44.349> can<00:03:44.409> see<00:03:44.970> through<00:03:45.970> going<00:03:46.239> through<00:03:46.389> the

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:46.479 
you can see through going through the

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.119 
you can see through going through the
middle<00:03:46.629> there<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:47.139> doesn't<00:03:47.470> line<00:03:47.739> up<00:03:47.769> very

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
middle there it doesn't line up very

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.289 
middle there it doesn't line up very
well<00:03:48.159> but<00:03:48.489> that's<00:03:48.579> fine<00:03:48.879> I'm<00:03:49.030> going<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.239> go

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
well but that's fine I'm going to go

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.270

Swarovski crystals you know how

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.320

expensive they are and comparison to
standard<00:04:49.390> rhinestones<00:04:50.230> so<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:51.070> really<00:04:51.400> don't

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
standard rhinestones so I really don't

acrylic on there to hold this rocket

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.020 
acrylic on there to hold this rocket
crystal<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:26.740> they<00:05:26.830> hold<00:05:27.040> quite<00:05:27.280> well<00:05:27.460> the

crystal and they hold quite well the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.400 
crystal and they hold quite well the
reason<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.330> want<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.540> hold<00:05:28.630> them<00:05:28.750> with<00:05:28.840> acrylic

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
reason I want to hold them with acrylic

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.450 
reason I want to hold them with acrylic
is<00:05:29.530> because<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:29.800> don't<00:05:29.950> want<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.130> put<00:05:30.220> a<00:05:30.280> top

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
is because I don't want to put a top

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.860 
is because I don't want to put a top
coat<00:05:30.490> on<00:05:30.669> them<00:05:30.880> if<00:05:30.970> I<00:05:31.030> put<00:05:31.180> a<00:05:31.210> top<00:05:31.390> coat<00:05:31.600> on<00:05:31.630> them

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
coat on them if I put a top coat on them

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.020 
coat on them if I put a top coat on them
it<00:05:32.410> removes<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.130> shiner<00:05:33.400> we've<00:05:33.669> bitten<00:05:33.820> that

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
it removes the shiner we've bitten that

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.180 
it removes the shiner we've bitten that
they<00:05:34.210> don't<00:05:34.390> stand<00:05:34.660> out<00:05:34.840> as<00:05:34.960> well<00:05:35.140> so<00:05:35.350> that's

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
they don't stand out as well so that's

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.260 
they don't stand out as well so that's
why<00:05:36.340> I'm<00:05:36.430> sitting<00:05:36.669> them<00:05:36.880> with<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.030> Kreutz

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
why I'm sitting them with the Kreutz

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.940 
why I'm sitting them with the Kreutz
that<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.570> don't<00:05:37.780> have<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.110> secure<00:05:38.650> them<00:05:38.830> with<00:05:38.860> a

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
that I don't have to secure them with a

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.730 
that I don't have to secure them with a
top<00:05:39.160> credit<00:05:39.370> afterwards<00:05:40.229> I'm<00:05:41.229> going<00:05:41.620> ahead

the<00:06:23.740> way<00:06:23.830> they<00:06:23.979> shine<00:06:24.190> there's<00:06:24.520> nothing<00:06:24.820> quite

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
the way they shine there's nothing quite

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.840 
the way they shine there's nothing quite
like<00:06:25.060> them<00:06:25.450> I<00:06:25.740> mean<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:27.130> rhinestones<00:06:27.640> that<00:06:27.760> we

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 
like them I mean the rhinestones that we

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.540 
like them I mean the rhinestones that we
get<00:06:28.060> off<00:06:28.720> eBay<00:06:29.110> and<00:06:29.260> a<00:06:29.320> little<00:06:29.560> circle<00:06:29.890> holder

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
get off eBay and a little circle holder

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.580 
get off eBay and a little circle holder
things<00:06:30.790> they're<00:06:31.090> great<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:32.530> they're

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
things they're great and they're

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.870 
things they're great and they're
definitely<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:33.010> cheaper<00:06:33.340> alternative

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
definitely a cheaper alternative

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.300 
definitely a cheaper alternative
Swarovski's<00:06:34.870> are<00:06:35.080> quite<00:06:35.500> expensive<00:06:35.770> and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
Swarovski's are quite expensive and

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.780 
Swarovski's are quite expensive and
compared<00:06:36.610> while<00:06:36.789> they're<00:06:36.970> incredibly

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
compared while they're incredibly

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.240 
compared while they're incredibly
in<00:06:38.090> comparison<00:06:38.480> so<00:06:39.410> hope<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.680> guys<00:06:39.710> enjoyed

I'm<00:06:41.810> expecting<00:06:42.620> for<00:06:43.130> this<00:06:43.190> elastic<00:06:43.640> a<00:06:43.730> couple

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
I'm expecting for this elastic a couple

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.190 
I'm expecting for this elastic a couple
of<00:06:44.060> weeks<00:06:44.240> without<00:06:44.450> anything<00:06:44.810> coming<00:06:45.020> off

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
of weeks without anything coming off

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.200 
of weeks without anything coming off
them<00:06:45.440> I<00:06:45.620> just<00:06:46.430> wanted<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.700> go<00:06:46.790> further<00:06:46.970> they're
