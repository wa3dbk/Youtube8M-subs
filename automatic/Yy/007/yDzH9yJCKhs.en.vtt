00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.150
 I will teach you how to configure 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.670
 either keyboard and mouse forgiveness 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:17.720
 in keyboard and joystick emulator 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.580
 Mame 32 and run the emulator 9 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.070
 32 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.270
 the list of games will appear 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.029
 I only have fighter because it's a 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.800
 simple videotutorial now so you can 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.170
 detect the joy that you have to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.610
 have it already installed connected in this 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.320
 case I have it there I already have it 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.890
 calibrated you can calibrate it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.210
 there is no problem 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.559
 already after that they go home options 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.110
 options in the directory so they can 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.540
 configure or confirm that some rooms 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 it has not acquired has not been able 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.970
 load you have to go where you have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.750
 the regulator and be placed in the folder 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:01:00.750
 rooms and really ok here here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.259
 shortly you will start loading the roms 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.150
 what is there at the moment of what I eat 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.850
 they realized I only have the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 aeroparque already so that it detects in this 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 case the rating that some people that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.020
 they do not remove the emulator because they do not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.250
 load they have to enable in interface 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 of options 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's not here was in 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.860
 and 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.860
 properties of foul game where it says 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.980
 controllers above the display have to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.640
 comes out like that in speak I sting 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:43.540
 input and this one they tell you what 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.700
 apply and accept it and this is the game 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.860
 is not is not started that so that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.260
 can configure them with either him with 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.030
 the keyboard of the notebook or its 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.940
 will and the joystick that you 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.970
 have already analog in this case usb 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.030
 now we start loading the game on 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.330
 this case there he will live typing ok what 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.660
 they do with little by any key the 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.300
 number 6 number 6 is from the keyboard where 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.550
 you place the chips supports up 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.160
 9 gray 2 and after number 1 of your 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.780
 keyboard is the number be there in 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.900
 any time we can place the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.480
 tab key that would be in this case 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.980
 to be able to load the games and I 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.330
 I say that here I will do it again 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.780
 new 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.390
 ok and there by pressing the tab key 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.260
 so that we can already configure either the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.530
 keyboard and the 'rating' already to take the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.540
 volume with the number 40 that is at 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.760
 side of the 1t there can lower the volume 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.330
 I know that it complicates them 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.709
 so the tabulation and in 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.010
 this case gives you to do these 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.110
 options 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.549
 general inputs are for all 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.239
 games can configure how much 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.940
 a keyboard and the jump do is little 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.010
 laurent player 1 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.320
 we can configure it with either the mouse 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.080
 that is with the mouse with the keyboard and with 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.390
 the destination at the same time and key towards 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.330
 up to see give delete so that you 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:19.180
 stay in norÃ©n and you can configure it already 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.910
 be with the double of or with he the skin 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.310
 the arrow up as you are 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.830
 will fix will be left in w and the key towards 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.960
 up that would be in this case the arrow 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.530
 up on it 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.870
 camps the down arrow would be the s 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.870
 that they commonly do or in this case 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:45.240
 the down arrow according to him the jay 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.240
 king left of the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.950
 and right of the d 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.480
 plus the one in this case that appears here in 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.200
 the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.770
 he says to malaga 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.770
 the D 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:06.130
 and then we jump to the buttons buttons 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.140
 one that would be the tau 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.140
 a 3rd button in this case 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.210
 two 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.310
 3 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.479
 a button 4 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.479
 j the l 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.160
 4 after that the number 1 of the start 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.250
 to start and in this case truth is k 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.180
 by then they go to where a mouse says 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.850
 main menu of the main menu enter and 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.620
 this case in returning the game is already 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.510
 having that would have no problem 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.720
 you would see it should be added so much in 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.480
 the keyboard or in the rating and the number 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.310
 one to start number 6 sorry for 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.290
 place the card number 6 for the card 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.270
 and the number 1 to be able to configure the 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.480
 this as they gave an account here I am with 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.729
 the weiqing and with the keyboard of it 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.460
 shape 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.830
 let's see if it's okay 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.449
 configured let's see who has arrived 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.180
 all right 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:17.180
 and a problem in this can see it with 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.610
 the joy king and with the keyboard also of 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.639
 the same way 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.830
 and that would be everything I hope there 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.500
 liked the video any question I 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.900
 they let her know and we'll see you soon 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.120
 a new video tutorial that are very 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.120
