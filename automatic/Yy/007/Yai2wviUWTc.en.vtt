plug into ps2 that is modern fat or slam

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
plug into ps2 that is modern fat or slam
using<00:00:19.170> fridrich<00:00:19.439> boot<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.770> OPL<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.369> how<00:00:20.460> does

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
using fridrich boot and OPL and how does

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.029 
using fridrich boot and OPL and how does
this<00:00:20.640> work<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.869> past<00:00:22.320> tutorials<00:00:22.980> just

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
this work so in past tutorials just

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
this work so in past tutorials just
that's<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.340> recap<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.000> past<00:00:24.510> tutorials<00:00:25.050> there's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that's a recap in past tutorials there's

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.410 
that's a recap in past tutorials there's
a<00:00:25.350> program<00:00:25.619> called<00:00:25.769> USB<00:00:26.279> extreme<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> we

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
a program called USB extreme and we

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300 
a program called USB extreme and we
would<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.930> program<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.560> rip<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:28.980> games

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
would use this program to rip your games

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.339 
would use this program to rip your games
and<00:00:29.609> convert<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.960> appropriate

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and convert it into the appropriate

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.860 
and convert it into the appropriate
format<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.430> external<00:00:32.880> USB<00:00:33.270> hard<00:00:33.480> drive

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
format for your external USB hard drive

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.240 
format for your external USB hard drive
so<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.410> example<00:00:34.500> if<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.950> go<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.130> my

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
so like for example if I go to my

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370 
so like for example if I go to my
computer<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.420> thumb<00:00:36.750> drive<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.230> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
computer here my thumb drive is the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.420 
computer here my thumb drive is the
letter<00:00:37.530> D<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.090> into<00:00:39.210> USB<00:00:39.540> extreme

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
letter D but if I go into USB extreme

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
letter D but if I go into USB extreme
hard<00:00:41.430> drive<00:00:41.610> section<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.149> letter<00:00:42.629> D<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:42.899> now

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
hard drive section here letter D is now

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
hard drive section here letter D is now
showing<00:00:43.379> how<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.040> thumb<00:00:44.340> drive<00:00:44.489> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
showing how do I get my thumb drive to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
showing how do I get my thumb drive to
show<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.090> here<00:00:45.300> well<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> bottom<00:00:46.260> answer

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
show up on here well the bottom answer

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.600 
show up on here well the bottom answer
is<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.160> don't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
is you don't

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
is you don't
so<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.210> don't<00:00:48.329> need<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.600> program<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.200> USB

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
so we don't need this program for USB

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.660 
so we don't need this program for USB
thumb<00:00:49.829> drives<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.219> I'll<00:00:50.370> show<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
thumb drives and I'll show you a

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.029 
thumb drives and I'll show you a
different<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> doing<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
different way of doing this so what you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.470 
different way of doing this so what you
want<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.789> computer<00:00:54.210> plug

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
want to do is go to your computer plug

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.369 
want to do is go to your computer plug
in<00:00:54.600> your<00:00:54.750> thumb<00:00:54.930> drive

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
in your thumb drive

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.130 
in your thumb drive
go<00:00:55.860> ahead<00:00:56.390> right-click<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.480> thumb<00:00:57.690> drive<00:00:57.930> go

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
go ahead right-click your thumb drive go

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080 
go ahead right-click your thumb drive go
to<00:00:58.199> format<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:58.920> make<00:00:59.489> sure<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to format and just make sure it is the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.750 
to format and just make sure it is the
fat32<00:01:00.539> format<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.170> already<00:01:01.530> did<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.280> we're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
fat32 format I already did that so we're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
fat32 format I already did that so we're
good<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.090> let<00:01:03.870> me<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> thumb

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
good to go let me go into the thumb

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.840 
good to go let me go into the thumb
drive<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.309> show<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> file

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
drive here and show you the file

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
drive here and show you the file
structure<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.990> ultimately<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.890> need<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> CD

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
structure so ultimately you need a CD

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850 
structure so ultimately you need a CD
and<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> DVD<00:01:08.820> folder<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.350> any<00:01:10.500> CD

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and a DVD folder I don't have any CD

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
and a DVD folder I don't have any CD
gains<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> moment<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.909> did<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> will

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
gains at the moment but if I did I will

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
gains at the moment but if I did I will
put<00:01:12.510> them<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> then<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> DVD

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
put them in there and then in the DVD

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
put them in there and then in the DVD
folder<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.540> isel's<00:01:16.020> so

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
folder you would have your isel's so

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
folder you would have your isel's so
just<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> recap<00:01:17.420> how<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.900> ISO<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
just a recap how do you get your ISO of

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
just a recap how do you get your ISO of
your<00:01:19.619> ps2<00:01:19.920> games<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.369> let's<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.909> example

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
your ps2 games so let's say for example

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.960 
your ps2 games so let's say for example
that<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.720> had<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> ps2<00:01:22.530> disc<00:01:22.830> inserted<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.820> your

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that you had a ps2 disc inserted in your

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
that you had a ps2 disc inserted in your
computer<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> make<00:01:25.380> an<00:01:25.470> ISO

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
computer so if you want to make an ISO

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
computer so if you want to make an ISO
out<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.580> open<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> program<00:01:27.150> like

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
out of it if you open up a program like

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.370 
out of it if you open up a program like
DVD<00:01:27.869> decrypter

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
DVD decrypter

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
DVD decrypter
or<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.250> could<00:01:29.369> use<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> program<00:01:29.880> like<00:01:29.909> image

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
or you could use a program like image

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.149 
or you could use a program like image
burn<00:01:30.570> but<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.439> using<00:01:31.590> DVD<00:01:31.979> decrypter

really sucks because it's going to take
a<00:03:05.520> while<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.030> defrag<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.690> thumb<00:03:07.020> drive<00:03:07.140> when

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
a while to defrag a thumb drive when

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.350 
a while to defrag a thumb drive when
compared<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.980> USB<00:03:08.400> external<00:03:08.580> hard<00:03:08.970> drive<00:03:09.150> so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
compared to a USB external hard drive so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.170 
compared to a USB external hard drive so
one<00:03:09.840> program<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.739> use<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.850> called

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
one program I like to use is called

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.570 
one program I like to use is called
smart<00:03:12.510> defrag<00:03:12.989> 3<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.890> what<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.250> want<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.489> do

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
smart defrag 3 and what you want to do

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.130 
smart defrag 3 and what you want to do
is<00:03:14.730> go<00:03:14.850> ahead<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.090> cert<00:03:15.360> your<00:03:15.510> thumb<00:03:15.930> drive

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
is go ahead and cert your thumb drive

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.940 
is go ahead and cert your thumb drive
and<00:03:16.530> then<00:03:16.980> what<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.220> want<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.489> do<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:18.739> go<00:03:19.739> here

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
and then what you want to do is go here

that's going to analyze your your thumb

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.360 
that's going to analyze your your thumb
drive<00:03:23.820> and<00:03:24.150> ideally<00:03:24.959> it's<00:03:25.110> going<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> say<00:03:25.530> zero

fragments fragmentation rate 0% which is

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.400 
fragments fragmentation rate 0% which is
great<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.000> fragmented<00:03:30.510> then<00:03:31.260> what

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
great but if it is fragmented then what

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.990 
great but if it is fragmented then what
you<00:03:31.530> want<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.799> do<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.190> basically<00:03:32.400> click<00:03:32.820> on<00:03:32.940> the

like those flashing colors when you

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.990 
like those flashing colors when you
first<00:03:55.739> start<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:55.980> game<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.489> it's<00:03:56.880> very

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
first start the game so it's very

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.800 
first start the game so it's very
important<00:03:57.570> to<00:03:57.660> defrag<00:03:58.320> your<00:03:58.350> thumb<00:03:59.190> drive

supposed to defrag your thumb drives

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.030 
supposed to defrag your thumb drives
because<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.810> will<00:04:03.959> decrease<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.350> length<00:04:04.920> of

and you only got a four gig 8 gig 32 gig
thumb<00:04:11.280> drive<00:04:11.549> then<00:04:12.030> what's<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.959> exactly

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
thumb drive then what's that is exactly

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.860 
thumb drive then what's that is exactly
what<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.769> got<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:15.510> that's<00:04:15.660> what<00:04:15.780> do

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
what you got to do so so that's what do

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.050 
what you got to do so so that's what do
I<00:04:15.930> do<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.320> then<00:04:17.100> that's<00:04:17.489> pretty<00:04:17.549> much<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.030> so

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
I do and then that's pretty much it so

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.289 
I do and then that's pretty much it so
the<00:04:18.329> recap<00:04:18.510> get<00:04:19.380> an<00:04:19.470> ISO<00:04:19.890> take<00:04:20.549> that<00:04:20.700> ISO<00:04:21.060> file
