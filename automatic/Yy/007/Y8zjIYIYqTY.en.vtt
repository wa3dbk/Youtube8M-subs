00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
been placed on to this little tray here

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.680 
been placed on to this little tray here
to<00:02:57.739> make<00:02:58.220> our<00:02:58.400> little<00:02:58.549> Elsa<00:02:58.940> shape<00:02:59.180> and<00:02:59.450> a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
to make our little Elsa shape and a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.840 
to make our little Elsa shape and a
little<00:02:59.989> tiny<00:03:00.170> snowflake<00:03:00.950> now<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.190> did<00:03:01.489> not<00:03:01.639> add

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
little tiny snowflake now I did not add

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.849 
little tiny snowflake now I did not add
in<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.329> extra<00:03:02.450> little<00:03:02.959> pink<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:03.500> around

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
in the extra little pink that's around

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.349 
in the extra little pink that's around
it<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.280> thought<00:03:04.489> it'd<00:03:04.639> be<00:03:04.730> pretty<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.329> a

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
it I thought it'd be pretty just like a

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.449 
it I thought it'd be pretty just like a
snowflake<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.350> instead<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.130> one<00:03:07.310> like

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
snowflake like that instead of one like

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.059 
snowflake like that instead of one like
this<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.359> now<00:03:08.810> all<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.049> we<00:03:09.290> have<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.620> do<00:03:09.799> is

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
this so now all that we have to do is

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.400 
this so now all that we have to do is
seal<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:11.389> all<00:03:11.630> stays<00:03:11.959> together<00:03:12.139> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
seal this so it all stays together and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.930 
seal this so it all stays together and
creates<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:13.010> little<00:03:13.160> Elsa<00:03:13.579> piece<00:03:13.760> because

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
creates a little Elsa piece because

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.819 
creates a little Elsa piece because
these<00:03:14.090> beads<00:03:14.420> are<00:03:14.599> very<00:03:14.959> loose<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.620> were<00:03:15.739> to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
these beads are very loose if I were to

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.199 
these beads are very loose if I were to
bump<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.220> or<00:03:16.430> something<00:03:16.609> these<00:03:16.819> beads<00:03:17.090> would

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
bump this or something these beads would

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.839 
bump this or something these beads would
go<00:03:17.329> flood<00:03:17.720> we<00:03:18.560> don't<00:03:18.739> want<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.579> set

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
go flood we don't want that so this set

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.640 
go flood we don't want that so this set
comes<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:20.420> little<00:03:20.870> spray<00:03:21.260> bottle<00:03:21.290> like

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
comes with a little spray bottle like

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.710 
comes with a little spray bottle like
this<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.459> all<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.790> did<00:03:23.030> was<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.359> fill<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.630> with

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
we go let's start spraying

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.370 
we go let's start spraying
antwuan<00:03:37.459> a-two<00:03:38.000> a-one<00:03:38.510> two<00:03:38.569> three<00:03:38.810> four

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
antwuan a-two a-one two three four

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.940 
antwuan a-two a-one two three four
where's<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.859> water<00:03:40.040> there<00:03:40.280> we<00:03:40.370> go<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:41.060> do

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
where's the water there we go so to do
