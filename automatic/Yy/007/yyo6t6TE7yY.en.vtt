00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.559
 Happy New Year to all of you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.110
 and welcome to a new one 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.480
 edition and also the first in 2015 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 of erich's culinary heritage today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.010
 we want a very special recipe 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 baked something already often 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.930
 wanted to be true to us are the ddr 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 rolls like from the baker back then and what 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 is better than a baker from that time 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.099
 to ask how this is done we have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.570
 done 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.029
 We have once been at the baker subke 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.859
 the recipe has been in demand for a long time 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.990
 years on his blog so exactly 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.640
 be on his blog since 2008 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.060
 internet has posted online due 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.320
 high demand and 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.790
 He kindly has us too 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.250
 provided so that we can 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 also can imitate his blog 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.070
 we have at the end of the videos for you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.960
 linked there you can directly 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.390
 draufklicken you come to the baker soup 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 and he also has many other great ones 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.190
 recipes and background information too 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.750
 At that time we first got to the recipe 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.110
 Need mail for course 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.930
 whitewash very important water bit 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.289
 sugar salt yeast naturally is next to it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
 dough and a bit of lard we have 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:09.740
 still used that one can but also 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.299
 change 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.130
 For example, the sugar went malty 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 but you see the exact description 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 then at the ingredients or on our 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.450
 blog you can do it all over again 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450
 read carefully 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.930
 In any case we will turn off the ingredients 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 a dough 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.500
 which we are also beautiful on the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.500
 knead the worktop 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.250
 so if you are really nice 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 kneaded a homogeneous mass 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.620
 there was a bit of flour 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.260
 Let's add that sticks 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.080
 then it's time for a round in 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.550
 then leave the pot over with the death 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.460
 We go first is as I said 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.280
 A defender must rest 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.840
 half an hour to an hour and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.800
 then he should already know risen 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 its as you can see here 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.430
 and then we go out and what ours 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.430
 dough matter a role 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.370
 and off the roll we stick to ours 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.370
 Our bread blanks quasi off 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.290
 that should be 60 to 80 grams 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.060
 according to the recipe 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.379
 but in the end , everyone can do it themselves 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.549
 decide the big his bun 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.549
 would like to bake 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.129
 and then we bring these dough pieces 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.180
 also in the desired shape we have 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.180
 baked round bread here 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.280
 Lie down on a greased tin 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.549
 and if we did that then 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.370
 Let's leave that half again 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.230
 hour back threaten at half price 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.180
 Can we do it too drastic? 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.670
 otherwise they will fall after us 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.030
 Maybe together if you are too late 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.030
 do 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.569
 and then we left all that 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.190
 nice with water so it's nice too 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.599
 the surface remains moist above all else 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.510
 always make sure it's fine too 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.709
 is covered if detail he goes if 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.840
 he does not get too dry and not 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.840
 that happens relatively quickly 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:17.459
 so and on it goes at 220 degrees about for 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.769
 About 20 minutes in the oven to 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.269
 Bake until golden brown 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.830
 But it is also important to have a bowl 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.759
 water for example or pot with 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.699
 reinzustellen 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:28.740
 since this buns bake a high 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.300
 Humidity requires and so can 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.460
 then when they are ready and 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:39.000
 we tried them and are great 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:40.620
 Yum, that was already back 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.850
 I was glad of Eris culinary heritage 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.169
 Hope you liked it if you were 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.180
 if it goes up a thumb 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.590
 a great time stay as we said 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.560
 we have again the block from the baker 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.030
 soup with linked below there you can 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.870
 also like to click on it and then come 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.580
 also to the original 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.669
 otherwise still like to watch out 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.900

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.789

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.870
 but not free ours 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.970
 if you are always up to date 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.389
 want to stay and otherwise until the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.389
