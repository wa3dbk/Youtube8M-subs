00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.570
 to fly to childbirth by raising the volume 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.570
 for the canyon 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:56.790

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.280
 very much above you 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.810
 They start up when you fall having 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:19.610
 killed a poor little monkey 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.610
 innocent innocent 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.210
 I had left 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:58.720

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.740
 spirit of cord altamira get 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.819
 all your dreams 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.819
 and if not eat 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.380
 it is not a council then the advice of today 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.380
 is to wait 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.630
 sorry but a sane advice if you say 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:22.210
 for everyday life for the day of 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.210
 Today I do not know 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:33.750
 final floor that we give the command to agree 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.770
 to see then I'm going to say a tip 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:41.460
 guys, guys, girls , today's advice 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.980
 is to wash your teeth thoroughly before 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:48.260
 lie down because if not then tartar comes out 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.260
 and those things and that's not good 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:07:01.710
 but you have to brush your teeth 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.710
 three times a day because I say so 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:14.479
 hears 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:17.340
 well let's see if in the end I think that 

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:19.379
 there is effectively a screen mode 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.860
 but beginner's position to start 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:21.860
 that is a single day 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:29.839
 at a higher level, it's worth nothing 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:34.669
 the following way 

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:39.719
 you know the credits of the accounts we 

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:42.080
 we have passed a game in just 15 

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:42.080
 minutes 

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.560
 they wash their teeth well before 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:13.840
 lay it down because if not then it comes out tartar 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.840
 and those things and that's not good
