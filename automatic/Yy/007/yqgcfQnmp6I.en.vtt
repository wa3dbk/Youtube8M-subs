remaining of 1 tbsp of ginger-garlic

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.360 
remaining of 1 tbsp of ginger-garlic
paste<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:42.330> for<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.200> second<00:02:43.560> marination<00:02:43.980> I'll

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
paste and for the second marination I'll

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.390 
paste and for the second marination I'll
began<00:02:44.670> adding<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.300> 1<00:02:45.510> cup<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.930> plain<00:02:46.170> yogurt

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.300 

next<00:02:50.400> ginger<00:02:50.640> garlic<00:02:50.970> paste<00:02:51.180> 1<00:02:51.660> tbsp<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> the

next ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp and the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.310 
next ginger garlic paste 1 tbsp and the
reason<00:02:53.610> I'm<00:02:53.760> adding<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.240> bit<00:02:54.420> more<00:02:54.780> salt<00:02:55.110> more

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
reason I'm adding a bit more salt more

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.220 
reason I'm adding a bit more salt more
because<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.700> yogurt<00:02:57.120> takes<00:02:57.450> away<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> salt

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because the yogurt takes away the salt

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.470 
because the yogurt takes away the salt
from<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> first<00:02:58.890> marination<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.300> red
