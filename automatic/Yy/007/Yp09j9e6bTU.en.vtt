now let me preference this next bit by

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
now let me preference this next bit by
saying<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> don't<00:02:02.250> think<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.850> Ultimate

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
saying that I don't think the Ultimate

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
saying that I don't think the Ultimate
Universe<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.689> pointless<00:02:04.049> now<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.799> some

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
Universe is pointless now there are some

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
Universe is pointless now there are some
really<00:02:05.189> cool<00:02:05.430> storylines<00:02:05.909> coming<00:02:06.210> out<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
really cool storylines coming out of it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
really cool storylines coming out of it
but<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.930> will<00:02:07.110> say<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.520> seemed

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
but I will say this over time it seemed

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.100 
but I will say this over time it seemed
Marvel<00:02:09.090> began<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> lose<00:02:09.629> sight<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:09.929> the

established characters they began to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.880 
established characters they began to
introduce<00:02:16.719> characters<00:02:17.349> to<00:02:17.469> the<00:02:17.500> Ultimate

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
introduce characters to the Ultimate

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.099 
introduce characters to the Ultimate
Universe<00:02:17.920> which<00:02:18.700> were<00:02:18.819> almost<00:02:19.000> identical<00:02:19.390> to

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.319 
Universe which were almost identical to
their<00:02:20.230> 6-1-6<00:02:20.890> universe<00:02:21.280> counterparts<00:02:21.939> by<00:02:22.269> the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
their 6-1-6 universe counterparts by the

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.420 
their 6-1-6 universe counterparts by the
way<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.659> 6-1-6<00:02:23.349> universe<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.099> name<00:02:24.280> for

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
way the 6-1-6 universe is the name for

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.309 
way the 6-1-6 universe is the name for
the<00:02:24.519> normal<00:02:24.939> Marvel<00:02:25.269> Universe<00:02:25.689> but<00:02:26.019> in<00:02:26.140> doing

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
the normal Marvel Universe but in doing

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.929 
the normal Marvel Universe but in doing
so<00:02:26.439> it<00:02:26.620> seemed<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.099> Marvel<00:02:27.489> just<00:02:27.609> started

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
so it seemed the Marvel just started

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.459 
so it seemed the Marvel just started
using<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.359> ultimate<00:02:28.689> universe<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.290> tell

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
using the ultimate universe to tell

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:30.990 
using the ultimate universe to tell
stories<00:02:29.859> with<00:02:29.889> their<00:02:30.129> normal<00:02:30.340> characters

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
stories with their normal characters

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.849 
stories with their normal characters
without<00:02:31.389> having<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.870> worry<00:02:32.049> about<00:02:32.139> continuity

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
without having to worry about continuity

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.500 
without having to worry about continuity
the<00:02:33.069> problem<00:02:33.400> with<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:33.939> the<00:02:34.150> Ultimate

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the problem with this is the Ultimate

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.809 
the problem with this is the Ultimate
Universe<00:02:34.540> slowly<00:02:35.290> became<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.769> mixing<00:02:36.250> pot<00:02:36.489> full

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
Universe slowly became a mixing pot full

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.670 
Universe slowly became a mixing pot full
of<00:02:36.939> brand-new<00:02:37.299> takes<00:02:37.629> on<00:02:37.840> Marvel<00:02:38.200> characters

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
of brand-new takes on Marvel characters

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.649 
of brand-new takes on Marvel characters
and<00:02:38.889> they<00:02:39.159> seemed<00:02:39.489> old<00:02:39.730> familiar<00:02:39.969> characters

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
and they seemed old familiar characters

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.360 
and they seemed old familiar characters
from<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.930> normal<00:02:41.260> continuity<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.099> it<00:02:42.189> just

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
from the normal continuity and it just

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.220 
from the normal continuity and it just
didn't<00:02:42.639> mix<00:02:42.790> well<00:02:43.000> at<00:02:43.269> points<00:02:43.719> it<00:02:43.900> seemed<00:02:44.109> like
