00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.690
 hello my name is arches ivan you 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.129
 Watch the video site revolverlab.com 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.559
 Today we have a review of the device 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:13.510
 unusual even by modern standards 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.150
 and we will talk about asus transformer 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.190
 book unusual laptop hybrid and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.410
 a tablet that works for a full 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.720
 windows 8 device comes here 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.250
 such a beautiful box opening the top 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 cover you will surely be a bit 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.720
 surprised and will appear before you 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.140
 tablet part of this device and everything 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.149
 nothing but a diagonal of 13.3 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.550
 very impressive especially considering 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.560
 what's in front of you tablet if you compare 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.570
 in size with other tablets the difference 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.250
 visible to the naked eye next in 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.530
 power adapter kit 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.239
 They are carefully packed the most important 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.100
 part of this device is keyboard 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.260
 docking station which turns it into 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.670
 a full-fledged asus laptop pampers its 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.350
 users and bundled with 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.940
 The device comes with a case in the form of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.710
 envelope where you can put 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.570
 laptop for safer 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.790
 transportation how to position 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.809
 This device I would say that asus 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.579
 transformer book 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 This is primarily a full-fledged laptop 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.659
 with the ability to transform into 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.069
 a tablet which by the way even without a dock 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.439
 station retains all the functionality 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.939
 full computer remember those dashing 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.130
 times when with the advent of the first 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.659
 tablets people wondered 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 whether the tablet can replace them 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.279
 full computer can now be with 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.359
 with confidence to answer yes may asus 

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:24.130
 transformer book 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.350
 very similar to previous devices 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.109
 companies and in design and materials 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.389
 the case is a mixture of a ruler 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.789
 zenbook laptops and asus tablets 

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.679
 vivopc dock housing is made of 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.990
 aluminum assembly everything is fine 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.049
 there is a feeling of solidity here 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.869
 there are two usb outlets micro hdmi and 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.310
 sd card slot and even network 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.459
 ethernet interface to connect 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 network cable besides the company asus 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.020
 focuses on the bin sound system 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.819
 gunn dawson speakers which carefully 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.889
 hidden on the lower side faces 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.999
 The tablet part is also sharpened in 

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.249
 aluminium case 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:02.020
 there is a large active hole in the back 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.239
 cooling which is to my pleasure 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.849
 surprise has a low sound barrier 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:07.850
 so even under heavy load 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.619
 the device does not make noise and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.840
 heats up the front of the display 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.040
 covered with protective glass display with 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.709
 13.3 diagonal resolution of 1920 to 1080 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.970
 dots has increased brightness and in 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.370
 generally leaves only positive 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 experience in communicating with the device and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.150
 now it's time to tell how and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.069
 the most important thing on which it works 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.170
 an unusual machine to tell the truth 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.760
 price factor devices two in one or 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 as the company asus calls them 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.569
 transformer and I treated more like 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.550
 mobile devices and nothing much 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.260
 Specifications not expected in 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.790
 the beginning of this review, I do not just like that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.800
 said it should be evaluated as 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.480
 watch the full laptop yourself 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.480
 the heart of this device is 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.940
 core i7 processor with a clock speed of 1 and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.920
 9 gigahertz also exists younger 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.319
 model with core i5 processor inside 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.540
 hidden 4 gigabytes of RAM 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.280
 for graphics oddly responsible chip 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.680
 intel hd 4000 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.569
 but the most amazing thing is that in 13 inch 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.910
 device found a place 2 hard 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.880
 drive system disk ssd solid state 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.440
 128 gigabyte drive and also 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.940
 500 gigabyte hard drive with 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.150
 expandable up to 1 terabyte 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.530
 it seems to me for a miniature 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.940
 13-inch device is just 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.310
 excellent with such technical 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.560
 characteristics of asus transformer book 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.410
 may well be with macbook air from 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.549
 Apple's all the stuffing device 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.220
 located in and off of the laptop 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.049
 so disconnecting the screen dock you 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.950
 will continue to work with a full 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.230
 windows environment 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.940
 for this reason the manufacturer was 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.370
 forced to abandon passive 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.230
 cooling due to good old cooler 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.130
 and large sas hood asus 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.690
 transformer book 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.790
 copes with great 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.470
 number of daily tasks for everything 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.630
 I don't use the device 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.850
 noticed significant slowdowns or 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.680
 hangs photoshop work passes 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.359
 fairly smoothly such tasks as 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.519
 surfing the internet work with office 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:58.100
 docs or watching video full hd 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.560
 format or quite under force by the way on 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.239
 he could not play some games 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.519
 although you must understand that everything is there 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.709
 rests on the graphics chip intel hd 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.750
 4000 and run on this laptop 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.370
 demanding games are not worth it 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.920
 deserves special attention 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.630
 keyboard and touchpad device perhaps 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.130
 This is one of the most convenient keyboards. 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.900
 among laptops on the operating system 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.150
 at 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.009
 ergonomics and ease of entry can only 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.290
 compare with sony company laptops 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.660
 degree of random hits on adjacent 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.490
 Keys minimal touchpad responsive 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.930
 perfectly fulfills the function of rolling 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.820
 two fingers plus everything 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.289
 programmed with certain gestures 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.100
 using special software 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.660
 ensure 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.000
 asus now let's talk about the screen 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.490
 devices or rather about its resolution 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.259
 it just so happens that with a diagonal of 13 and three 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.120
 inches with full hd resolution 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.130
 you literally have to 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 peer into the text of course if you 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.880
 not ultra vision but it's not a problem 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.979
 just recommend to go directly to 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.740
 display settings and zoom with 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.570
 increasing to 100 or 150 percent in 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.060
 the rest of the screen excellent viewing angles 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.680
 big and even violent sunshine you 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.260
 can work while on the street 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.699
 now a few words about windows 8 i know 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.160
 that among our viewers and readers 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.169
 there are a lot of people who put it mildly not 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.970
 are supporters of this version 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.810
 operating system can say one thing 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.240
 exactly 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.310
 subway interface in the form of tiles perfectly 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.110
 adapted to control with your fingers and 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.240
 touch part of the screen on asus 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.729
 transformer black is better than ever 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.380
 although the question is friend or consumer 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.270
 so wanted to see touch 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.610
 laptops that microsoft company was 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.229
 forced to make such an interface or 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.030
 manufacturers are forced to let out 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.599
 sensory devices because companies 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.669
 microsoft 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.260
 banged to the head that decent systems 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.090
 should be controlled with a finger 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.500
 please write in the comments what 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.870
 exactly you think about it 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.090
 it remains to discuss the most painful topic 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.710
 which concerns any laptop which 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.720
 running windows 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.000
 battery life speaking 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.190
 about the technical component of the situation 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.590
 looks like this in the dock 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.690
 fit 5000 battery capacity 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.940
 milliampere hour and immediately located 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.699
 500 gigabyte hard drive tablet 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.680
 has a battery capacity of 3100 20 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.050
 milliampere hour at the same time when the device 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.090
 assembly the tablet will not charge from 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.949
 docking station as all the energy goes away 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.870
 to work hard drive and all 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.880
 functional outputs but if translated 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.280
 tablet to sleep it will start to eat 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.500
 from docking station in full mode 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.510
 laptop with Wi-Fi enabled while working 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.020
 browser and office application suite 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.060
 laptop 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.650
 keeps about five and a half hours in 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.539
 tablet mode with the same load 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.910
 honest four and a half hours 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.919
 asus transformer book order value 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.840
 one and a half thousand dollars for this money you 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.150
 get productive enough 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.069
 laptop with an impressive memory and 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.759
 important with the ability to turn it 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.009
 in an ordinary tablet with a diagonal of 13.3 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.610
 all the advantages and disadvantages 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.710
 device + and 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.990
 good performance excellent 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.069
 display versatility convenient 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.990
 keyboard and touchpad 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:51.909
 quality sound from the speakers and 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.130
 quite good working time compared to 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.900
 other solutions on windows to minuses 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.759
 I would like to include the dimensions and weight 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.650
 devices the thing is that by 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:02.020
 design features of asus 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.000
 transformer 2 is thick enough and weight 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.659
 device assembly is almost two 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.970
 kilogram 

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:08.979
 and for a laptop of this size it is soft
