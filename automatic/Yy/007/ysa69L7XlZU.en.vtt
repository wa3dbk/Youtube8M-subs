00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I got to the upper trellis 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.650
 this plaid cucumber 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.440
 Ivan attempts to tomato because he already 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 wrapped around them what i do in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 In this case, but this case is very necessary 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.320
 neatly so if you don't have one 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:31.800
 experience again here i have a loop 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.440
 on done very loosely and that is to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 don't pinch yourself just me and 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:47.059
 raise higher honestly raise raise 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.059
 so neat 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.040
 here 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.170
 even higher and the whip itself 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.449
 quietly omit here she herself under 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.150
 the actual gravity drops only 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.020
 fragile stalks walked very carefully 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.500
 cucumber they are here hooked do not want 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.300
 go down here he himself for the trellis 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.210
 caught neatly with cotton 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:25.140
 attack and here it is narrowly hooked and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.140
 quietly gently gently omit 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 here 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:43.259
 Basically, you can still raise, lower, or 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:50.340
 here here we twist the string to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:57.259
 Us the lash did not fall and did not break, but 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 so down already nothing will give us 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.340
 here urine raked 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:12.959
 neatly laid ring again 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.140
 very neat and that's such a stud when 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.980
 spire or 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.709
 so its not going out on the plain 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.959
 very very neat and take from 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.620
 humus earth or something who has 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 compost here you can make another 60 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.810
 to 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.200
 where they were issued this part 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.519
 take root and the cucumber will continue then 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.239
 have we can extend the time 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:56.910
 fruiting plant like this 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:03:03.440
 here we are well 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:06.000
 zamulchirovali material charms cut 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.910
 lower lash here it is whip nothing too 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.280
 won't give us that is here because of 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.560
 lack of illumination simply 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:21.299
 envy withered we clean it 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.739
 you can leave this shoulder here personally 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 the best will be able to put it 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.430
 cutting exactly this cucumber further 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:36.260
 what do we have here can people 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.160
 leave here here now go further 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.660
 on the main stalks 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.549
 cucumbers here eset here they will continue 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.449
 fruiting the plant until they come 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:52.910
 colds here we take mustaches in order not to 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:57.079
 no extra energy from the plant 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.079
 neatly further obliged again 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.840
 that is, if we donâ€™t have this procedure 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.380
 would have made the plants simply 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.900
 and would have grown together he would have gone under the roof 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.200
 greenhouse useful side tomato 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.299
 would start choking and now here we have 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.220
 there is no such sheet apparatus and 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.220
 the sun falls on the spot
