00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
quarter length of it can be quite

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.950 
quarter length of it can be quite
difficult<00:01:41.050> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:42.640> on<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:42.910> off<00:01:43.000> easily<00:01:43.240> you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
difficult to get on it off easily you

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.630 
difficult to get on it off easily you
have<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.200> pull<00:01:44.380> them<00:01:44.500> over<00:01:44.680> your<00:01:44.950> head<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.160> I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
have to pull them over your head and I

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.510 
have to pull them over your head and I
see<00:01:46.390> when<00:01:46.540> there's<00:01:46.900> no<00:01:47.080> stretch<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.220> I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
see when there's no stretch to this so I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.910 
see when there's no stretch to this so I
went<00:01:48.940> for<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.150> size<00:01:49.360> up<00:01:49.660> to<00:01:49.900> allow<00:01:50.620> me<00:01:50.770> that

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
went for a size up to allow me that

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.990 
went for a size up to allow me that
extra<00:01:51.220> room<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:53.650> you<00:01:53.980> just<00:01:54.400> make<00:01:54.610> put<00:01:54.850> it

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
extra room so that you just make put it

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.920 
extra room so that you just make put it
on<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.300> off<00:01:55.390> a<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.950> easier

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
on and off a bit easier

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.040 
on and off a bit easier
I<00:01:59.500> find<00:02:00.040> easiest<00:02:00.430> way<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.760> put<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:01.450> I'm

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
I find easiest way to put it on I'm

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.050 
I find easiest way to put it on I'm
still<00:02:02.440> first<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:04.900> slide<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.350> head

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
still first and then slide the head

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.620 
still first and then slide the head
under<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.600> fit<00:02:10.990> I<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:13.570> very

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
under so the fit I don't think it's very

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.449 
under so the fit I don't think it's very
good<00:02:13.990> I<00:02:14.170> mean<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.100> went<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.780> size<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.680> it

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
good I mean I went for a size up and it

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.790 
good I mean I went for a size up and it
is<00:02:18.700> fairly<00:02:18.970> baggy<00:02:19.270> around<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:19.930> body<00:02:20.080> which<00:02:20.709> is

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
is fairly baggy around the body which is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.580 
is fairly baggy around the body which is
kind<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.130> what<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.310> was<00:02:21.490> expecting<00:02:22.380> that's<00:02:23.380> not

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
kind of what I was expecting that's not

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.699

a<00:02:23.620> that's<00:02:24.150> not<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.240> major<00:02:25.510> issue<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:26.080> use<00:02:26.530> this

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
a that's not a major issue I use this

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.840 
a that's not a major issue I use this
for<00:02:26.920> running<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.910> if<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:28.990> wearing<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.530> pack<00:02:30.520> a

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.199 
for running so if I'm wearing a pack a
running<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.470> waist<00:02:32.800> belt<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.670> holds

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
running back or a waist belt that holds

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.030 
running back or a waist belt that holds
it<00:02:34.239> in<00:02:34.360> place<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.840> stops<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.380> flapping<00:02:35.830> about

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
it in place and stops it flapping about

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.460 
it in place and stops it flapping about
so<00:02:36.610> that's<00:02:36.790> not<00:02:36.910> really<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.180> problem<00:02:37.320> I'm<00:02:38.320> not

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
so that's not really a problem I'm not

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.110 
so that's not really a problem I'm not
wearing<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.890> running<00:02:39.160> parkour<00:02:39.370> waist<00:02:39.670> belt<00:02:39.880> I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
wearing a running parkour waist belt I

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.930 
wearing a running parkour waist belt I
will<00:02:40.600> normally<00:02:40.959> tuck<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.470> into<00:02:41.590> my<00:02:41.920> shorts<00:02:42.670> or

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
will normally tuck it into my shorts or

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.210 
will normally tuck it into my shorts or
tights<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.840> solves<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.830> problem<00:02:45.160> as

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
tights and that solves the problem as

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.970 
tights and that solves the problem as
well<00:02:45.370> really<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.720> what<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:46.959> what<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.680> don't<00:02:47.920> like

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
well really but what I what I don't like

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.690 
well really but what I what I don't like
about<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.459> fit<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.840> arms<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.700> sort

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
about the fit is that the arms and sort

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.660 
about the fit is that the arms and sort
under<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.090> arms<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.480> really<00:02:53.170> really<00:02:53.410> tight<00:02:53.670> so

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
under the arms is really really tight so

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.420 
under the arms is really really tight so
you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:55.410> if<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.530> pull<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.830> sea<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.280> end

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
you can see if I pull the sea to the end

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.350 
you can see if I pull the sea to the end
this<00:02:58.030> move<00:02:58.270> right<00:02:58.390> up<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.370> moves<00:03:00.640> quite<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.120> lot

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
this move right up it moves quite a lot

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.770 
this move right up it moves quite a lot
and<00:03:02.020> it's<00:03:02.170> really<00:03:02.380> tight<00:03:02.709> around<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.130> elbow

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and it's really tight around the elbow

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.199 
and it's really tight around the elbow
bagging<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:05.019> and<00:03:05.739> really<00:03:06.100> tight<00:03:06.340> around

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
bagging there and really tight around

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.320 
bagging there and really tight around
the<00:03:07.480> shoulder<00:03:07.870> there<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.730> just<00:03:09.790> feel<00:03:10.090> it's

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
the shoulder there so I just feel it's

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.110 
the shoulder there so I just feel it's
not<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.690> been<00:03:10.810> cut<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.769> well<00:03:12.040> or<00:03:12.280> see<00:03:12.910> it

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
not really been cut that well or see it

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.759 
not really been cut that well or see it
is<00:03:13.239> quite<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.480> basic<00:03:13.989> just<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.410> windproof<00:03:14.890> piece

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
is quite a basic just a windproof piece

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.699 
is quite a basic just a windproof piece
just<00:03:17.769> always<00:03:17.950> an<00:03:18.220> emergency<00:03:18.760> we<00:03:18.970> lightweight

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
just always an emergency we lightweight

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.380 
just always an emergency we lightweight
cut<00:03:20.709> it's<00:03:20.920> not<00:03:21.040> gonna<00:03:21.130> be<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.280> important<00:03:21.970> but

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
cut it's not gonna be that important but

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.720 
cut it's not gonna be that important but
you<00:03:23.350> are<00:03:23.470> paying<00:03:23.739> quite<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> lot<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:24.310> money<00:03:24.400> for

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
you are paying quite a lot of money for

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.780 
you are paying quite a lot of money for
this<00:03:24.850> compared<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:26.130> other<00:03:27.130> wind<00:03:27.489> proofs

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
this compared to other wind proofs

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.880 
this compared to other wind proofs
there's<00:03:28.209> not<00:03:28.360> many<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.870> are<00:03:28.900> as<00:03:29.350> light<00:03:29.709> as

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
there's not many that are as light as

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.030 
there's not many that are as light as
this<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:31.060> there's<00:03:31.299> some<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.780> maybe<00:03:32.470> 20

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
this but there's some that maybe 20

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.370 
this but there's some that maybe 20
grams<00:03:33.250> or<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.820> more<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.660> pain<00:03:34.930> maybe

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
grams or so more that you pain maybe

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.740 
grams or so more that you pain maybe
half<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.860> price<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.549> does<00:03:37.239> call<00:03:37.570> into

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
half the price it does call into

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.600 
half the price it does call into
question<00:03:37.840> whether<00:03:38.080> whether<00:03:38.950> it's<00:03:39.190> worth<00:03:39.340> it

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
question whether whether it's worth it

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.670 
question whether whether it's worth it
just<00:03:39.820> just<00:03:40.030> for<00:03:40.239> those<00:03:40.299> 20<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.840> 30<00:03:41.019> grams<00:03:41.350> so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
just just for those 20 and 30 grams so

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.860 
just just for those 20 and 30 grams so
like<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:42.010> say<00:03:42.220> in<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> cut<00:03:42.640> under<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.540> arms

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
like I say in the cut under the arms

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.080 
like I say in the cut under the arms
it's<00:03:44.530> really<00:03:44.739> tight<00:03:45.070> in<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> back<00:03:47.040> there

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it's really tight in the back there

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.340 
it's really tight in the back there
considering<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.299> is<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.450> size<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:50.049> from<00:03:50.079> what

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
considering this is a size up from what

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.170 
considering this is a size up from what
it<00:03:50.470> normally<00:03:50.560> go<00:03:50.860> I'm<00:03:51.400> quite<00:03:51.670> glad<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:51.940> didn't

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
it normally go I'm quite glad I didn't

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.000 
it normally go I'm quite glad I didn't
go<00:03:52.299> for<00:03:52.510> smaller<00:03:52.870> because<00:03:53.200> I<00:03:53.290> probably<00:03:53.560> rip<00:03:53.860> it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
go for smaller because I probably rip it

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.340 
go for smaller because I probably rip it
anytime<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.700> try<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:54.910> move<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.900> even<00:03:56.170> something

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
anytime I try to move and even something

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.560 
anytime I try to move and even something
like<00:03:56.500> bending<00:03:57.310> down<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.549> do<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.880> places<00:03:58.390> it

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
like bending down to do it places it

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.020 
like bending down to do it places it
just<00:03:58.959> really<00:03:59.230> pulls<00:03:59.560> on<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:00.310> shoulders

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
just really pulls on the shoulders

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.270 
just really pulls on the shoulders
they're<00:04:01.239> just<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.560> know<00:04:02.590> this<00:04:02.920> is<00:04:03.130> not

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
they're just you know this is not

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.270 
they're just you know this is not
comfortable<00:04:03.750> other<00:04:04.750> than<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.049> it's<00:04:05.829> you

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
comfortable other than that it's you

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.030 
comfortable other than that it's you
know<00:04:06.310> as<00:04:06.640> you<00:04:07.000> would<00:04:07.120> expect<00:04:08.040> lightly

it in summer even if it was windy I did
I'd<00:06:20.310> give<00:06:20.580> something<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.969> bit<00:06:21.090> more<00:06:21.150> breathable

was a bit heavier maybe carry this as an
emergency<00:06:25.839> piece<00:06:26.319> but<00:06:27.189> I<00:06:27.249> would<00:06:27.369> keep<00:06:27.550> this

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
emergency piece but I would keep this

this<00:06:40.149> sort<00:06:40.419> of<00:06:40.509> weight<00:06:40.749> range<00:06:41.050> a<00:06:41.379> little<00:06:41.529> bit

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
this sort of weight range a little bit

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.559 
this sort of weight range a little bit
more<00:06:42.129> if<00:06:42.429> you'd<00:06:42.819> if<00:06:42.969> you're<00:06:43.089> not<00:06:43.179> too<00:06:43.389> bothered

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
more if you'd if you're not too bothered

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.179 
more if you'd if you're not too bothered
about<00:06:43.749> it<00:06:44.080> it<00:06:44.559> would<00:06:44.679> probably<00:06:44.889> give<00:06:45.099> you

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189 
about it it would probably give you

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:48.029 
about it it would probably give you
similar<00:06:45.429> performance<00:06:45.699> for<00:06:46.629> maybe<00:06:47.559> less<00:06:47.770> money

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
similar performance for maybe less money

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:52.290 
similar performance for maybe less money
I<00:06:48.279> would<00:06:49.119> have<00:06:49.240> thought<00:06:49.419> for<00:06:50.849> the<00:06:51.849> extra<00:06:52.179> money

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
I would have thought for the extra money

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.679 
I would have thought for the extra money
you<00:06:52.629> obviously<00:06:52.990> get<00:06:53.169> that<00:06:53.619> really<00:06:53.919> low<00:06:54.189> weight

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:54.689 
you obviously get that really low weight

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.269 
you obviously get that really low weight
but<00:06:55.689> I<00:06:55.719> would<00:06:55.959> like<00:06:56.229> to<00:06:56.259> see<00:06:56.589> maybe<00:06:56.919> a<00:06:57.039> slightly

00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:57.279 
but I would like to see maybe a slightly

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:59.309 
but I would like to see maybe a slightly
better<00:06:57.520> cut<00:06:58.020> maybe<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.139> bit<00:06:59.289> more

00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 
better cut maybe a bit more

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.309 
better cut maybe a bit more
breathability<00:06:59.860> for<00:07:00.279> that<00:07:00.399> but<00:07:01.169> that's<00:07:02.169> just

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 
breathability for that but that's just

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.109 
breathability for that but that's just
