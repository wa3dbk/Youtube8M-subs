00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
can see you got a really really tiny

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969 
can see you got a really really tiny
sample<00:01:21.240> size<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.930> i'm<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> open<00:01:22.890> it

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sample size of this i'm going to open it

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
sample size of this i'm going to open it
anyway<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.939> tiniest<00:01:24.450> little

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
anyway but this is the tiniest little

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.260 
anyway but this is the tiniest little
side<00:01:25.170> ever<00:01:25.500> that's<00:01:26.280> like<00:01:26.460> smaller<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
side ever that's like smaller than the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.749 
side ever that's like smaller than the
little<00:01:27.420> sephora<00:01:27.990> samples<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.009> oh

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.749 

so<00:01:32.759> tiny<00:01:33.090> um<00:01:33.570> i'll<00:01:34.439> probably<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.549> try

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
so tiny um i'll probably use it and try

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.109 
so tiny um i'll probably use it and try
it<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.479> haven't<00:01:36.780> try<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> while<00:01:37.470> but

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
it out I haven't try it for a while but

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.210 
it out I haven't try it for a while but
it's<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.570> favorite<00:01:39.750> liner<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.650> there<00:01:41.040> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's not my favorite liner out there I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's not my favorite liner out there I
think<00:01:41.430> there's<00:01:41.610> much<00:01:41.820> better<00:01:42.060> ones<00:01:42.299> um<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
think there's much better ones um and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.600 
think there's much better ones um and
I'm<00:01:43.470> kind<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> disappointed<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.340> such<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I'm kind of disappointed that's such a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
I'm kind of disappointed that's such a
small<00:01:44.909> sample<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.540> feel<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.350> they<00:01:46.500> should

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
small sample I feel like they should

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.170 
small sample I feel like they should
