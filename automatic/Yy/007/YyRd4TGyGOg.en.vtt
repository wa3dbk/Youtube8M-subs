00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
cartoon based ones they definitely have

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.009 
cartoon based ones they definitely have
more<00:00:47.379> musculature<00:00:48.570> throughout<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.780> can<00:00:49.809> see

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
more musculature throughout you can see

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.540 
more musculature throughout you can see
in<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:50.170> shoulders<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:51.040> then<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.309> legs

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
in the shoulders and then the legs

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.670 
in the shoulders and then the legs
especially<00:00:51.790> it<00:00:52.239> stands<00:00:52.600> out<00:00:52.720> they<00:00:53.379> definitely

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
especially it stands out they definitely

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.829 
especially it stands out they definitely
have<00:00:53.979> a<00:00:54.010> better<00:00:54.220> sculpt<00:00:54.699> in<00:00:54.820> that<00:00:55.000> regard<00:00:55.390> I'm

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
have a better sculpt in that regard I'm

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.920 
have a better sculpt in that regard I'm
not<00:00:56.170> sure<00:00:56.409> the<00:00:56.589> heads<00:00:56.860> actually<00:00:57.640> mimic<00:00:58.360> the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
not sure the heads actually mimic the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.729 
not sure the heads actually mimic the
movie<00:00:59.530> as<00:00:59.739> much<00:01:00.159> as<00:01:00.339> they<00:01:00.489> would<00:01:00.850> like<00:01:01.059> them<00:01:01.300> to

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
movie as much as they would like them to

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.160 
movie as much as they would like them to
I<00:01:02.739> don't<00:01:03.580> know<00:01:03.640> they<00:01:03.760> just<00:01:03.790> look<00:01:04.089> kind<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.540> kind

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
I don't know they just look kind of kind

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.530 
I don't know they just look kind of kind
of<00:01:05.229> goofy<00:01:05.620> but<00:01:06.400> they<00:01:06.880> do<00:01:06.940> look<00:01:07.180> good<00:01:07.240> they<00:01:07.450> have

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
of goofy but they do look good they have

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.850 
of goofy but they do look good they have
the<00:01:07.659> all<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.870> same<00:01:08.020> articulation<00:01:08.290> pretty

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
the all the same articulation pretty

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.800 
the all the same articulation pretty
much<00:01:09.070> another<00:01:09.520> thing<00:01:09.790> that<00:01:09.820> drives<00:01:10.270> me<00:01:10.479> nuts

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
much another thing that drives me nuts

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.930 
much another thing that drives me nuts
is<00:01:11.049> that<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:11.740> ankles<00:01:12.159> instead<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.520> having<00:01:12.820> an

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
is that the ankles instead of having an

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.030 
is that the ankles instead of having an
ankle<00:01:13.240> rocker<00:01:13.510> they<00:01:14.140> just<00:01:14.350> have<00:01:14.500> a<00:01:14.530> swivel

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
ankle rocker they just have a swivel

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.389 
ankle rocker they just have a swivel
here<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:16.630> no<00:01:16.840> ankle<00:01:17.259> rocker<00:01:17.500> at<00:01:17.890> all

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
here so there's no ankle rocker at all

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.100 
here so there's no ankle rocker at all
you<00:01:18.640> just<00:01:18.670> have<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.030> hinge<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:19.689> swivel

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
you just have the hinge and the swivel

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.139 
you just have the hinge and the swivel
of<00:01:20.740> course<00:01:20.979> each<00:01:21.189> toe<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.610> individually

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
of course each toe is individually

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.690 
of course each toe is individually
hinged<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.500> you<00:01:23.649> could<00:01:23.799> kind<00:01:24.039> of<00:01:24.219> get<00:01:24.369> an<00:01:24.460> ankle

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
hinged so you could kind of get an ankle

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.219 
hinged so you could kind of get an ankle
rocker<00:01:24.939> out<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.630> bend<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.990> foot

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
rocker out of that if you bend the foot

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.830 
rocker out of that if you bend the foot
and<00:01:26.380> put<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.430> toe<00:01:27.640> at<00:01:27.850> an<00:01:28.000> angle<00:01:28.329> but<00:01:28.509> it's<00:01:28.689> not

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
and put the toe at an angle but it's not

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.289 
and put the toe at an angle but it's not
really<00:01:29.200> an<00:01:29.259> ankle<00:01:29.530> rocker<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.909> have<00:01:31.030> double

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
really an ankle rocker we have double

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.599 
really an ankle rocker we have double
jointed<00:01:31.600> knees<00:01:31.659> nicely<00:01:32.560> sculpted<00:01:32.619> kneepads

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
jointed knees nicely sculpted kneepads

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.760 
jointed knees nicely sculpted kneepads
we<00:01:34.149> have<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.329> thigh<00:01:34.630> swivel<00:01:35.289> which<00:01:35.560> is

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
we have a thigh swivel which is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.099 
we have a thigh swivel which is
completely<00:01:36.460> redundant<00:01:37.000> since<00:01:37.750> there's<00:01:38.049> a

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
completely redundant since there's a

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.410 
completely redundant since there's a
swivel<00:01:38.530> at<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.829> hip<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:39.820> I'm<00:01:39.909> not<00:01:40.060> sure<00:01:40.240> why

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
swivel at the hip so I'm not sure why

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.940 
swivel at the hip so I'm not sure why
they<00:01:40.600> did<00:01:40.780> both<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.200> those<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.560> can't<00:01:41.770> even

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
they did both of those you can't even

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.469 
they did both of those you can't even
actually<00:01:42.159> do<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.640> thigh<00:01:42.820> swivel<00:01:43.179> unless<00:01:43.329> you

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
actually do the thigh swivel unless you

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.789 
actually do the thigh swivel unless you
pull<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> hip<00:01:43.899> to<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.079> side<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.500> kind<00:01:44.740> of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
pull the hip to the side and kind of

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.889 
pull the hip to the side and kind of
hold<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.189> place<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:46.090> it's<00:01:46.270> still<00:01:46.509> kind<00:01:46.810> of

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
hold it in place then it's still kind of

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.950 
hold it in place then it's still kind of
tricky<00:01:47.289> but<00:01:47.950> there<00:01:48.159> is<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.549> thigh<00:01:49.240> swivel<00:01:49.719> and<00:01:49.869> a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
tricky but there is a thigh swivel and a

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.380 
tricky but there is a thigh swivel and a
ball<00:01:50.170> jointed<00:01:50.560> hip<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:51.460> mostly<00:01:51.820> has<00:01:52.090> a<00:01:52.119> thigh

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
ball jointed hip that mostly has a thigh

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.560 
ball jointed hip that mostly has a thigh
swivel<00:01:52.780> there<00:01:52.960> to<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:54.070> torso<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.759> lower<00:01:55.240> half

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
swivel there to the torso the lower half

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.260 
swivel there to the torso the lower half
of<00:01:55.749> the<00:01:55.869> torso<00:01:56.140> is<00:01:56.499> connected<00:01:57.159> via<00:01:57.340> at<00:01:57.999> least<00:01:58.179> a

of the torso is connected via at least a

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.910 
of the torso is connected via at least a
single<00:01:58.570> ball<00:01:58.719> peg<00:01:58.990> maybe<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.320> double<00:01:59.710> I'm<00:01:59.799> not

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
single ball peg maybe a double I'm not

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.289 
single ball peg maybe a double I'm not
sure<00:02:00.189> it's<00:02:00.340> not<00:02:00.460> connected<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.060> shell

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
sure it's not connected to the shell

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.969 
sure it's not connected to the shell
though<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:01.990> that<00:02:02.200> gives<00:02:02.469> you<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:02.710> waist

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
though so that gives you your waist

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.370 
though so that gives you your waist
twist<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.549> your<00:02:03.700> ab<00:02:03.880> crunch<00:02:04.329> it's<00:02:05.170> pretty

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
twist and your ab crunch it's pretty

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.580 
twist and your ab crunch it's pretty
limited<00:02:05.770> though<00:02:05.950> but<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.789> is<00:02:06.909> there<00:02:07.440> for<00:02:08.440> some

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
limited though but it is there for some

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.370 
limited though but it is there for some
reason<00:02:08.619> they<00:02:09.429> didn't<00:02:09.759> paint<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.869> size<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
reason they didn't paint the size of the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
reason they didn't paint the size of the
turtles<00:02:11.710> green<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.190> they<00:02:12.340> should<00:02:12.580> have<00:02:12.610> they

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
turtles green like they should have they

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.880 
turtles green like they should have they
painted<00:02:13.840> them<00:02:13.930> shell<00:02:14.200> color<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.860> looks

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
painted them shell color so it looks

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.160 
painted them shell color so it looks
pretty<00:02:15.340> weird<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.300> bottom<00:02:16.630> half<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.990> not

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
pretty weird that the bottom half is not

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.950 
pretty weird that the bottom half is not
shale<00:02:17.470> or<00:02:17.680> there's<00:02:18.130> not<00:02:18.220> green<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.850> don't<00:02:19.630> get

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
shale or there's not green I don't get

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.320 
shale or there's not green I don't get
that<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:21.010> shoulders<00:02:21.490> are<00:02:21.700> standard<00:02:22.120> ball

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
that the shoulders are standard ball

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.320 
that the shoulders are standard ball
hinges<00:02:22.810> bicep<00:02:23.530> swivel<00:02:23.890> double<00:02:24.250> jointed<00:02:24.580> elbow

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
hinges bicep swivel double jointed elbow

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.530 
hinges bicep swivel double jointed elbow
wrist<00:02:25.870> swivel<00:02:26.910> there<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:28.120> there<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.300> wrist

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
wrist swivel there is there a wrist

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.330 
wrist swivel there is there a wrist
hinge<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.019> don't<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:29.650> I<00:02:29.890> don't<00:02:30.040> think

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
hinge I don't think so I don't think

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.160 
hinge I don't think so I don't think
there's<00:02:30.489> one<00:02:30.610> in<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:30.970> then<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
there's one in there then we have the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.500 
there's one in there then we have the
thumb<00:02:32.620> hinge<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.190> actually<00:02:33.970> should<00:02:34.150> swivel

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
thumb hinge and actually should swivel

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.839 
thumb hinge and actually should swivel
also<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.620> we<00:02:35.769> have<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:36.430> each<00:02:36.700> of

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
also so we have that and then each of

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.000 
also so we have that and then each of
the<00:02:36.970> fingers<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.470> articulated<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.800> looks<00:02:38.950> a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
the fingers is articulated it looks a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.350 
the fingers is articulated it looks a
little<00:02:39.129> goofy<00:02:39.340> at<00:02:39.640> first<00:02:39.910> but<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.180> get<00:02:40.300> used

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
little goofy at first but you get used

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.360 
little goofy at first but you get used
to<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.720> pretty<00:02:40.900> quickly<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:41.920> okay<00:02:42.190> by

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
to it pretty quickly so that's okay by

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.530 
to it pretty quickly so that's okay by
me<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:43.120> head<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.400> humongous<00:02:46.030> ball<00:02:46.269> peg

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
me the head just a humongous ball peg

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.350 
me the head just a humongous ball peg
which<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:46.930> pretty<00:02:47.200> limiting<00:02:48.030> based<00:02:49.030> on<00:02:49.209> how

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
which is pretty limiting based on how

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.820 
which is pretty limiting based on how
they<00:02:49.510> designed<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.349> don't<00:02:50.500> really<00:02:50.709> get

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
they designed it you don't really get

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.070 
they designed it you don't really get
much<00:02:51.040> articulation<00:02:51.459> out<00:02:52.030> of<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.299> at<00:02:52.510> all<00:02:52.780> it's

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
much articulation out of it at all it's

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.960 
much articulation out of it at all it's
just<00:02:53.200> basically<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.680> swivel<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.760> that's<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
just basically a swivel so that's a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.449 
just basically a swivel so that's a
little<00:02:55.090> disappointing<00:02:55.810> in<00:02:56.769> terms<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:57.220> paint

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
little disappointing in terms of paint

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.050 
little disappointing in terms of paint
applications<00:02:58.150> there<00:02:59.049> are<00:02:59.260> none<00:02:59.769> all<00:03:00.579> we<00:03:00.849> have

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
applications there are none all we have

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.270 
applications there are none all we have
are<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.390> eyes<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.959> teeth<00:03:01.989> really<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
are the eyes and the teeth really the

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.490 
are the eyes and the teeth really the
bandana<00:03:04.030> is<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.299> separate<00:03:04.720> piece<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.319> that's

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
bandana is a separate piece so that's

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.050 
bandana is a separate piece so that's
not<00:03:05.680> painted<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.430> shells<00:03:06.760> are<00:03:06.910> all<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
not painted the shells are all a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.370 
not painted the shells are all a
separate<00:03:07.450> piece<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.930> only<00:03:08.140> paint

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
separate piece so the only paint

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.979 
separate piece so the only paint
application<00:03:09.010> we<00:03:09.190> have<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.640> this<00:03:10.269> miss<00:03:10.540> painted

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
application we have is this miss painted

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.360 
application we have is this miss painted
part<00:03:11.260> right<00:03:11.680> here<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:11.950> they're<00:03:12.040> all<00:03:12.069> like

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
part right here and they're all like

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.880 
part right here and they're all like
that<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:13.209> that's<00:03:13.390> pretty<00:03:13.690> disappointing<00:03:14.650> it's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
that so that's pretty disappointing it's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.350 
that so that's pretty disappointing it's
actually<00:03:15.220> really<00:03:15.549> really<00:03:15.730> disappointing

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
actually really really disappointing

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.819 
actually really really disappointing
that's<00:03:16.480> one<00:03:17.170> of<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.349> reasons<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:17.799> don't

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
that's one of the reasons they don't

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.069 
that's one of the reasons they don't
really<00:03:18.099> look<00:03:18.430> like<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.790> movie<00:03:19.060> turtles<00:03:19.420> is

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
really look like the movie turtles is

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.380 
really look like the movie turtles is
they<00:03:20.379> have<00:03:20.470> no<00:03:20.650> shading<00:03:21.040> no<00:03:21.400> spots<00:03:21.819> no<00:03:22.000> paint

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
they have no shading no spots no paint

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.509 
they have no shading no spots no paint
application<00:03:22.989> at<00:03:23.079> all<00:03:23.230> if<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.069> remember<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
application at all if you remember the

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.270 
application at all if you remember the
movie<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.269> bandana<00:03:25.750> didn't<00:03:26.140> only<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.709> their

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
movie the bandana didn't only have their

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.340 
movie the bandana didn't only have their
white<00:03:27.790> eyes<00:03:28.000> behind<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.780> had<00:03:28.930> some<00:03:29.139> green

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
white eyes behind it it had some green

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.410 
white eyes behind it it had some green
going<00:03:29.650> around<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.220> eyelids<00:03:30.639> and<00:03:30.880> then<00:03:31.299> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
going around for the eyelids and then it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.849 
going around for the eyelids and then it
had<00:03:31.600> their<00:03:31.750> eyes<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.319> then<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.650> had<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
had their eyes and then it had the

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.370 
had their eyes and then it had the
pupils<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.910> that<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.359> think<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.840> little<00:03:35.019> bit<00:03:35.139> of<00:03:35.319> a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
pupils so that I think a little bit of a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.349 
pupils so that I think a little bit of a
paint<00:03:35.620> touch-up<00:03:36.400> on<00:03:36.549> there<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:36.880> make<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.060> big

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
paint touch-up on there and make a big

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:37.860 
paint touch-up on there and make a big
difference

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
difference

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.840 
difference
the<00:03:38.530> teeth<00:03:38.739> are<00:03:38.950> painted<00:03:39.370> but<00:03:39.489> they're<00:03:39.639> kind

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
the teeth are painted but they're kind

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.759 
the teeth are painted but they're kind
of<00:03:39.940> yellowish<00:03:40.269> green<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.230> just<00:03:41.380> doesn't<00:03:41.650> look

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
of yellowish green it just doesn't look

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.589 
of yellowish green it just doesn't look
very<00:03:41.799> good<00:03:42.069> and<00:03:42.760> then<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.030> head<00:03:43.180> sculpts<00:03:43.540> I

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
very good and then the head sculpts I

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.759 
very good and then the head sculpts I
don't<00:03:43.780> think<00:03:43.959> look<00:03:44.139> very<00:03:44.380> good<00:03:44.560> either

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
don't think look very good either

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.500 
don't think look very good either
there's<00:03:45.160> no<00:03:45.280> paint<00:03:45.549> on<00:03:45.670> any<00:03:45.910> of<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> belts

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
there's no paint on any of the belts

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.819 
there's no paint on any of the belts
even<00:03:46.720> though<00:03:46.780> they're<00:03:46.930> all<00:03:47.019> separate<00:03:47.380> pieces

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
even though they're all separate pieces

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.009 
even though they're all separate pieces
that's<00:03:48.760> okay<00:03:49.090> that<00:03:49.120> they're<00:03:49.420> separate<00:03:49.690> pieces

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
that's okay that they're separate pieces

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.379 
that's okay that they're separate pieces
that's<00:03:50.170> a<00:03:50.230> good<00:03:50.410> thing<00:03:50.590> but<00:03:50.709> there's<00:03:50.920> no<00:03:51.040> paint

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
that's a good thing but there's no paint

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.390 
that's a good thing but there's no paint
we<00:03:52.389> do<00:03:52.569> have<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.720> little<00:03:52.989> bit<00:03:53.109> of<00:03:53.319> paint<00:03:53.560> on<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
we do have a little bit of paint on the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.159 
we do have a little bit of paint on the
bow<00:03:54.579> here<00:03:55.000> I'll<00:03:55.510> show<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.720> all<00:03:55.810> their<00:03:56.049> weapons

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
bow here I'll show you all their weapons

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.379 
bow here I'll show you all their weapons
individually<00:03:56.889> but<00:03:57.310> it's<00:03:57.459> really<00:03:57.609> sloppy<00:03:57.940> and

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
individually but it's really sloppy and

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.089 
individually but it's really sloppy and
there's<00:03:58.750> no<00:03:58.900> shading<00:03:59.380> or<00:03:59.500> anything<00:03:59.859> so<00:03:59.980> that's

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
there's no shading or anything so that's

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.430 
there's no shading or anything so that's
no<00:04:00.280> good<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.790> then<00:04:01.150> they<00:04:01.389> put<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.810> holder<00:04:02.230> for

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
no good and then they put the holder for

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.319 
no good and then they put the holder for
the<00:04:02.530> bow<00:04:02.709> straight<00:04:03.519> up<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.849> down<00:04:03.910> completely

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
the bow straight up and down completely

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.569 
the bow straight up and down completely
vertical<00:04:04.989> which<00:04:05.560> is<00:04:05.739> not<00:04:05.889> how<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.190> should<00:04:06.250> be

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
vertical which is not how it should be

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.069 
vertical which is not how it should be
it's<00:04:06.819> supposed<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.239> at<00:04:07.359> an<00:04:07.480> angle<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:07.840> can

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
it's supposed to be at an angle you can

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:09.479 
it's supposed to be at an angle you can
even<00:04:08.319> see<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.470> in<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.769> pictures<00:04:09.130> on<00:04:09.430> the

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
even see that in the pictures on the

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.330 
even see that in the pictures on the
back<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.450> packaging<00:04:10.930> so<00:04:11.290> there's<00:04:12.130> no

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
back of the packaging so there's no

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.250 
back of the packaging so there's no
reason<00:04:12.849> for<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.060> they<00:04:13.690> could<00:04:13.900> have<00:04:13.989> just<00:04:14.019> as

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
reason for that they could have just as

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.409 
reason for that they could have just as
easily<00:04:14.410> sculpted<00:04:15.040> that<00:04:15.160> at<00:04:15.310> an<00:04:15.459> angle<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:16.000> don't

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
easily sculpted that at an angle I don't

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.029 
easily sculpted that at an angle I don't
understand<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.109> like<00:04:17.530> I<00:04:17.680> said<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.889> little

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
understand it like I said a little

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.640 
understand it like I said a little
modification<00:04:18.400> will<00:04:18.940> help<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.329> but<00:04:20.079> you

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
modification will help that but you

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.500 
modification will help that but you
shouldn't<00:04:20.829> have<00:04:20.950> to<00:04:21.070> modify<00:04:21.459> figures<00:04:22.300> out<00:04:22.479> of

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
shouldn't have to modify figures out of

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.430 
shouldn't have to modify figures out of
the<00:04:22.630> package<00:04:22.960> so<00:04:23.080> that's<00:04:23.229> pretty

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
the package so that's pretty

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.400 
the package so that's pretty
disappointing<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.280> don't<00:04:24.460> care<00:04:24.880> for<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
disappointing I don't care for that

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.440 
disappointing I don't care for that

scared<00:05:09.900> look<00:05:10.110> on<00:05:10.259> and<00:05:10.439> it<00:05:10.529> doesn't<00:05:10.740> look<00:05:10.830> good

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
scared look on and it doesn't look good

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:11.779 
scared look on and it doesn't look good
to<00:05:11.610> me

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
to me

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.329 
to me
at<00:05:12.089> all<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.319> then<00:05:13.469> his<00:05:13.589> swords<00:05:13.889> the<00:05:14.009> swords

00:05:14.329 --> 00:05:14.339 
at all and then his swords the swords

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:15.860 
at all and then his swords the swords
are<00:05:14.460> okay<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.879> holders<00:05:15.240> go<00:05:15.449> in<00:05:15.629> the<00:05:15.719> right

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
are okay the holders go in the right

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.019 
are okay the holders go in the right
direction<00:05:16.050> for<00:05:16.469> the<00:05:16.529> most<00:05:16.740> part<00:05:17.039> but<00:05:17.789> it

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:18.029 
direction for the most part but it

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:19.730 
direction for the most part but it
really<00:05:18.300> suffers<00:05:18.930> from<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.139> lack<00:05:19.319> of<00:05:19.349> paint

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
really suffers from a lack of paint

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.899 
really suffers from a lack of paint
since<00:05:19.949> there's<00:05:20.159> all<00:05:20.279> this<00:05:20.430> kind<00:05:20.610> of<00:05:20.729> nice

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
since there's all this kind of nice

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.969 
since there's all this kind of nice
sculpted<00:05:21.389> detail<00:05:21.779> it<00:05:22.050> just<00:05:22.529> looks<00:05:22.770> really

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
sculpted detail it just looks really

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:26.300 
sculpted detail it just looks really
bland<00:05:23.370> without<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.879> paint<00:05:24.120> and<00:05:24.919> then<00:05:25.919> lastly

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
bland without the paint and then lastly

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.700 
bland without the paint and then lastly
Michelangelo<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.389> think<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.199> head<00:05:28.349> sculpt<00:05:28.620> is

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
Michelangelo I think the head sculpt is

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.529 
Michelangelo I think the head sculpt is
actually<00:05:28.949> a<00:05:29.009> pretty<00:05:29.279> good<00:05:29.520> suit<00:05:29.909> for<00:05:30.150> him<00:05:30.360> it

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
actually a pretty good suit for him it

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.089 
actually a pretty good suit for him it
looks<00:05:30.749> good<00:05:31.020> just<00:05:31.229> needs<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.740> paint

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
looks good just needs that paint

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.829 
looks good just needs that paint
application<00:05:32.699> for<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:32.909> eyes<00:05:33.029> especially<00:05:33.300> and

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
application for the eyes especially and

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.540 
application for the eyes especially and
it<00:05:33.900> would<00:05:34.020> look<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.229> lot<00:05:34.409> better<00:05:34.589> than<00:05:35.370> his

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
it would look a lot better than his

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.640 
it would look a lot better than his
non-toxic<00:05:35.939> do<00:05:36.240> actually<00:05:36.749> have<00:05:36.960> chains<00:05:37.379> on

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
non-toxic do actually have chains on

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.529 
non-toxic do actually have chains on
them<00:05:37.800> so<00:05:37.949> that's<00:05:38.159> pretty<00:05:39.029> good<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.270> can't

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
them so that's pretty good I can't

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.269 
them so that's pretty good I can't
really<00:05:39.659> complain<00:05:39.900> about<00:05:40.050> Mikey's<00:05:40.560> weapons<00:05:41.009> or

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
really complain about Mikey's weapons or

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:42.920 
really complain about Mikey's weapons or
anything<00:05:41.490> like<00:05:41.759> that<00:05:41.819> because<00:05:42.300> his<00:05:42.659> worked

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
anything like that because his worked

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.950 
anything like that because his worked
out<00:05:43.139> pretty<00:05:43.949> nicely<00:05:44.089> not<00:05:45.089> really<00:05:45.479> much<00:05:45.689> going

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
out pretty nicely not really much going

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.450 
out pretty nicely not really much going
on<00:05:46.020> in<00:05:46.169> terms<00:05:46.349> of<00:05:46.500> detail<00:05:46.680> but<00:05:47.099> having<00:05:47.370> the

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
on in terms of detail but having the

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.730 
on in terms of detail but having the
metal<00:05:47.699> chains<00:05:47.939> is<00:05:48.180> at<00:05:48.300> least<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.659> good<00:05:49.349> step<00:05:49.649> in

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
metal chains is at least a good step in

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.709 
metal chains is at least a good step in
the<00:05:49.800> right<00:05:49.919> direction<00:05:50.069> they<00:05:51.060> do<00:05:51.120> all<00:05:51.479> have

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
the right direction they do all have

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:56.029 
the right direction they do all have

Raph for some reason though Don and Raph

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.939 
Raph for some reason though Don and Raph
have<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.460> whole<00:06:05.699> lot<00:06:05.879> of<00:06:05.999> shading<00:06:06.210> in<00:06:06.419> there<00:06:06.629> and

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:06.949 
have a whole lot of shading in there and

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.739 
have a whole lot of shading in there and
Leo<00:06:07.949> has<00:06:08.249> a<00:06:08.279> little<00:06:08.639> bit<00:06:08.819> and<00:06:09.240> Mikey<00:06:09.569> has

Leo has a little bit and Mikey has
almost<00:06:10.169> none<00:06:10.469> so<00:06:10.800> that's<00:06:11.129> pretty

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:11.399 
almost none so that's pretty

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.519 
almost none so that's pretty
disappointing<00:06:12.149> I<00:06:12.300> mean<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:12.960> figures<00:06:13.289> are

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:13.529 
disappointing I mean the figures are

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.200 
disappointing I mean the figures are
definitely<00:06:14.039> good<00:06:14.189> enough<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.610> pick<00:06:14.819> up<00:06:14.999> if

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
definitely good enough to pick up if

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.939 
definitely good enough to pick up if
you're<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.389> Turtles<00:06:15.810> fan<00:06:16.050> like<00:06:16.289> I<00:06:16.439> am<00:06:16.469> and<00:06:16.889> you

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949 
you're a Turtles fan like I am and you

you're a Turtles fan like I am and you
grew<00:06:17.370> up<00:06:17.430> on<00:06:17.610> this<00:06:17.789> movie<00:06:18.349> it's<00:06:19.349> definitely

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
grew up on this movie it's definitely

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:22.459 
grew up on this movie it's definitely
worth<00:06:20.069> getting<00:06:20.479> her<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.659> set<00:06:21.870> is<00:06:22.050> definitely

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:22.469 
worth getting her the set is definitely

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:24.469 
worth getting her the set is definitely
worth<00:06:22.560> getting<00:06:22.770> but<00:06:23.460> there's<00:06:23.669> just<00:06:23.819> so<00:06:24.330> much

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
worth getting but there's just so much

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.519 
worth getting but there's just so much
laziness<00:06:25.259> in<00:06:25.529> the<00:06:26.219> design<00:06:26.669> that<00:06:27.360> it's<00:06:28.110> really

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529 
laziness in the design that it's really

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.290 
laziness in the design that it's really
upsetting<00:06:28.680> it's<00:06:29.399> kind<00:06:29.580> of<00:06:29.610> like<00:06:29.729> bebop<00:06:30.089> and

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
upsetting it's kind of like bebop and

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.209 
upsetting it's kind of like bebop and
Rocksteady<00:06:30.749> from<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.199> cartoon<00:06:31.649> series<00:06:31.889> there

Rocksteady from the cartoon series there

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.040 
Rocksteady from the cartoon series there
just<00:06:32.370> could<00:06:32.909> have<00:06:32.939> been<00:06:33.029> so<00:06:33.360> much<00:06:33.389> better<00:06:33.810> so<00:06:33.990> I

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
just could have been so much better so I

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.510 
just could have been so much better so I
can<00:06:34.289> see<00:06:34.589> a<00:06:34.620> lot<00:06:34.919> of<00:06:34.949> people<00:06:35.159> are<00:06:35.370> doing

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
can see a lot of people are doing

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.999 
can see a lot of people are doing
customs<00:06:36.089> with<00:06:36.270> these<00:06:36.419> guys<00:06:36.680> simply<00:06:37.680> just

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
customs with these guys simply just

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.800 
customs with these guys simply just
repainting<00:06:38.610> them<00:06:38.789> will<00:06:39.240> make<00:06:39.419> a<00:06:39.449> huge

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
repainting them will make a huge

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.889 
repainting them will make a huge
difference<00:06:39.899> and<00:06:40.589> then<00:06:40.710> turning<00:06:40.979> Donnie's<00:06:41.399> bow

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:41.899 
difference and then turning Donnie's bow

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.589 
difference and then turning Donnie's bow
at<00:06:42.899> an<00:06:43.199> angle<00:06:43.649> will<00:06:44.159> fix<00:06:44.759> him<00:06:44.939> pretty<00:06:45.149> much<00:06:45.240> so

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
at an angle will fix him pretty much so

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:47.089 
at an angle will fix him pretty much so
throw<00:06:46.199> some<00:06:46.379> paint<00:06:46.500> on<00:06:46.680> them<00:06:46.860> and<00:06:46.949> you<00:06:47.009> have

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:47.099 
throw some paint on them and you have

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.980 
throw some paint on them and you have
some<00:06:47.250> really<00:06:47.580> good<00:06:47.789> figures

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
some really good figures

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.920 
some really good figures
an<00:06:49.289> ankle<00:06:49.589> ankle<00:06:49.919> rocker<00:06:50.279> would<00:06:50.519> be<00:06:50.639> nice

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:50.930 
an ankle ankle rocker would be nice

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.140 
an ankle ankle rocker would be nice
but<00:06:51.139> it's<00:06:51.259> not<00:06:51.380> necessary<00:06:52.009> so<00:06:52.280> they<00:06:52.759> are<00:06:52.910> good

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150
