00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello, I want to tell you how 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.910
 make the enchantment table short and clear 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.630
 so we will like for one side 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 chirva not 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.830
 2 diamonds one book and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.109
 3 4 obsidian to obsidian break 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 many think that it does not break well 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.900
 obsidian is obtained by mixing lava 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.800
 with water that's not breaking them at all 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 like a long time to one block 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 you need to break a diamond pick here 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.399

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.239

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.780

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:03.040
 make a hundred enchantments repeat to us 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.040

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 if you have only 2 diamond bathrooms you want 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 spend no on the table enchantment and there 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.790
