it<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> ski<00:01:52.350> which<00:01:52.470> transitions

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
it really is a ski which transitions

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.300 
it really is a ski which transitions
well<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.369> sauce<00:01:53.549> no<00:01:53.790> nice<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:55.229> unique<00:01:55.710> feature

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
well into sauce no nice a unique feature

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
well into sauce no nice a unique feature
this<00:01:56.610> ski<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.940> the<00:01:57.060> powder<00:01:57.360> tip<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this ski is the powder tip right and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120 
this ski is the powder tip right and
that's<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:01.619> for<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that's really what that's there for is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.100 
that's really what that's there for is
to<00:02:02.280> help<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.820> transition<00:02:03.000> depth<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to help with that transition depth a

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.560 
to help with that transition depth a
little<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.880> thickening<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.150> front<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
little bit of a thickening in front of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.999 
little bit of a thickening in front of
the<00:02:06.630> fore<00:02:06.899> body<00:02:07.050> of<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.259> ski<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.770> little

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the fore body of the ski that little

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.380 
the fore body of the ski that little
fatter<00:02:08.190> tip<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.729> will<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.940> kind<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.179> think

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
fatter tip if you will I kind of think

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790 
fatter tip if you will I kind of think
helps<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.899> ski<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> float<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.709> in

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
helps the ski to float when you're in

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
helps the ski to float when you're in
softer<00:02:11.160> snow<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.420> much<00:02:12.600> easier

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
softer snow so that you have much easier

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900 
softer snow so that you have much easier
time<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.290> nice<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.010> then<00:02:14.580> we've<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
time it nice and then we've got a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.880 
time it nice and then we've got a
progressive<00:02:15.540> sidecut<00:02:15.780> which<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.319> been<00:02:16.770> on

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
progressive sidecut which is been on

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.559 
progressive sidecut which is been on
sets<00:02:17.220> models<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> couple<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.300> years<00:02:18.450> now

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
sets models for a couple of years now

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.290 
sets models for a couple of years now
yeah<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.800> k2<00:02:20.520> technology<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.180> use

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
yeah it's like k2 technology that we use

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.550 
yeah it's like k2 technology that we use
them<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.510> lot<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.690> different<00:02:21.780> models<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.440> kind

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
them a lot of different models that kind

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.259 
them a lot of different models that kind
of<00:02:22.590> thing<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.980> simple<00:02:23.310> blending<00:02:23.519> of<00:02:23.970> two

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
of thing it's a simple blending of two

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.540 
of thing it's a simple blending of two
known<00:02:24.690> different<00:02:25.200> types<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.709> taper<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
known different types of taper so that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.290 
known different types of taper so that
you<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.000> perfect<00:02:27.590> blend<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.060> ski<00:02:30.239> so

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
you get that perfect blend on the ski so

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.910 
you get that perfect blend on the ski so
when<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.600> are<00:02:30.750> using<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.200> in<00:02:31.530> an<00:02:31.620> all-mountain

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
when you are using it in an all-mountain

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
when you are using it in an all-mountain
style<00:02:32.459> fashion<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.269> gonna<00:02:33.450> work<00:02:33.690> well

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
style fashion it's gonna work well

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.500 
style fashion it's gonna work well
thanks<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.920> we<00:02:35.160> go<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.700> hyper<00:02:36.180> tech

thanks and we go to a hyper tech

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
thanks and we go to a hyper tech
sidewall<00:02:37.050> construction<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.800> right<00:02:38.580> in

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
sidewall construction here right in

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970 
sidewall construction here right in
Hypertech<00:02:39.510> after<00:02:40.050> all<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.350> all<00:02:40.500> about<00:02:40.769> once

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
Hypertech after all is all about once

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.610 
Hypertech after all is all about once
again<00:02:41.250> giving<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.690> one<00:02:42.989> additional

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
again giving you that one additional

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.229 
again giving you that one additional
feature<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.550> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.030> perform

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
feature so that it's going to perform

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.059 
feature so that it's going to perform
better<00:02:45.750> when<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.650> an<00:02:46.769> all-mountain

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
better when it's not an all-mountain

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.490 
better when it's not an all-mountain
situation<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.030> briefly<00:02:48.750> Hypertech<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.350> where

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
situation and briefly Hypertech is where

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.490 
situation and briefly Hypertech is where
you<00:02:49.590> have<00:02:49.739> a<00:02:49.769> little<00:02:50.040> bit<00:02:50.250> thicker<00:02:50.880> stiffer

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
you have a little bit thicker stiffer

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.080 
you have a little bit thicker stiffer
ski<00:02:52.500> underfoot<00:02:52.860> you<00:02:53.430> catch<00:02:53.610> everything<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
ski underfoot you catch everything and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.340 
ski underfoot you catch everything and
we'll<00:02:54.180> talk<00:02:54.269> about<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.510> sidewall<00:02:54.930> after<00:02:55.200> all

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
we'll talk about the sidewall after all

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.470 
we'll talk about the sidewall after all
and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.280> moves<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.640> tail<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.269> fits

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
and then as it moves to the tail it fits

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.710 
and then as it moves to the tail it fits
out<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> softens<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.600> initiates<00:03:00.600> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
out it softens up so that it initiates a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.970 
out it softens up so that it initiates a
turn<00:03:00.750> or<00:03:01.110> completes<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> turn<00:03:01.620> with<00:03:01.769> greater

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
turn or completes the turn with greater

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.110 
turn or completes the turn with greater
ease<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.730> sure

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
ease for sure

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.819 
ease for sure
