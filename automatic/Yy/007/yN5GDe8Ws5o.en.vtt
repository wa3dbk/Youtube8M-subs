00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
like more dynamic I guess more threats I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
like more dynamic I guess more threats I
would<00:00:21.750> say<00:00:21.960> I've<00:00:22.680> obviously<00:00:22.859> changed<00:00:23.699> adapted

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.720 

to<00:00:37.650> be<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.830> zag<00:00:38.630> you<00:00:39.630> know<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.700> what<00:00:41.700> I

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
to be a zag you know is just what I

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
to be a zag you know is just what I
really<00:00:42.180> relate<00:00:42.720> being<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> zag<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.590> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
really relate being a zag to is just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
really relate being a zag to is just
winning<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.250> that's<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> reason<00:00:45.150> why

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
winning and that's one of the reason why

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600 
winning and that's one of the reason why
I<00:00:45.300> came<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.310> coach<00:00:47.310> graves

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I came here is because coach graves

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.970 
I came here is because coach graves
since<00:00:48.180> he's<00:00:48.330> been<00:00:48.480> here<00:00:48.720> he's<00:00:48.780> know<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.920> to

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
since he's been here he's know how to

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.760 
since he's been here he's know how to
win<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:51.300> think<00:00:51.540> he<00:00:51.930> instills<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.620> all

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
win and I think he instills that in all

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.530 
win and I think he instills that in all
of<00:00:52.890> his<00:00:53.010> players<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.030> when<00:00:54.150> we<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.390> on

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
of his players is that when we get on

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.910 
of his players is that when we get on
the<00:00:54.570> court<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> doesn't<00:00:55.440> matter<00:00:55.500> who<00:00:55.770> we're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the court it doesn't matter who we're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.979 
the court it doesn't matter who we're
playing<00:00:56.000> we're<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.120> win<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> game<00:00:57.570> that's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
goal and that's just you know too well I

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.370 
goal and that's just you know too well I
we<00:01:12.180> always<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.200> type<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
we always you know have some type of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.410 
we always you know have some type of
handshaking<00:01:13.890> before<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> game<00:01:14.610> before<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
handshaking before the game before the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.930 
handshaking before the game before the
season<00:01:15.890> we<00:01:16.890> started<00:01:17.250> thinking<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
season we started thinking and I

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.760 
season we started thinking and I
actually<00:01:18.119> saw<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.630> off<00:01:18.840> jersey<00:01:19.229> shore<00:01:19.500> I'm

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
actually saw it off jersey shore I'm

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.520 
actually saw it off jersey shore I'm
like<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> huge<00:01:20.490> jersey<00:01:20.910> shore<00:01:21.119> fan<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.690> what<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
like a huge jersey shore fan and what I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.680 
like a huge jersey shore fan and what I
saw<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.340> just<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> short<00:01:24.119> clip<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.390> it

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
saw it was just like a short clip of it

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.749 
saw it was just like a short clip of it
and<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.740> carded<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.100> decided<00:01:26.399> that's<00:01:26.640> where

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
and so carded I decided that's where

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.740 
and so carded I decided that's where
we'd<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:28.830> want<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.729> maybe<00:01:30.390> coach

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we'd go with it I want to maybe coach

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
we'd go with it I want to maybe coach
eventually<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.770> think<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.160> why<00:01:32.280> I'm

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
eventually and I think that's why I'm

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.889 
eventually and I think that's why I'm
under<00:01:32.610> sports<00:01:32.790> management<00:01:33.149> route<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> because

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
under sports management route is because

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.109 
under sports management route is because
it's<00:01:34.050> pretty<00:01:34.259> broad<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.860> I've<00:01:35.729> always<00:01:35.880> been

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it's pretty broad and I've always been

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
it's pretty broad and I've always been
some<00:01:36.690> associated<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.560> sports<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.130> way

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
some associated with sports in some way

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.499 
some associated with sports in some way
and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:38.910> what<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.090> want<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.330> do<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and I think that's what I want to do it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969 
and I think that's what I want to do it
if<00:01:39.660> it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.020> coaching<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.590> somehow

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
if it's not coaching at somehow

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.550 
if it's not coaching at somehow
interacted<00:01:41.970> with<00:01:42.030> sports<00:01:42.300> well<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.289> I<00:01:43.380> could

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
interacted with sports well if I could

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
interacted with sports well if I could
play<00:01:43.679> for<00:01:43.740> any<00:01:44.009> W<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.459> 18<00:01:44.789> I<00:01:45.569> think<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> would

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
play for any W of 18 I think it would

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.570 
play for any W of 18 I think it would
probably<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.830> Seattle<00:01:47.130> Storm<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
probably be the Seattle Storm just

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.880 
probably be the Seattle Storm just
because<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.780> I'm<00:01:48.959> from<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.649> area

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
because it's you know I'm from that area

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.820 
because it's you know I'm from that area
it<00:01:50.310> would<00:01:50.459> be<00:01:50.610> familiar<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.240> me<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
it would be familiar for me but

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.410 
it would be familiar for me but
definitely<00:01:52.830> not<00:01:52.950> picky<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:54.149> go<00:01:54.270> anywhere

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
definitely not picky I will go anywhere

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.609 
definitely not picky I will go anywhere
I<00:01:54.660> think<00:01:54.959> a<00:01:55.020> change<00:01:55.229> would<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.470> good<00:01:55.590> anyways

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
I think a change would be good anyways

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.139 
I think a change would be good anyways
well<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.310> I'll<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.759> remembered<00:02:00.030> by<00:02:02.149> this

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
well I think I'll be remembered by this

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.880
