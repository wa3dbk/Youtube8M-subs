00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:14.720
 It is that it flowers you talk to have the New Testament of the Bible contents of up to it Hey now, to tell you the truth 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.480
 It intends Uhh to a story from this, to tell you the truth 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.500
 It is said that it was pref 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.950
 I was ready 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.470
 If you say the truth in this and the next two times, it will be the core part or the part that has always been there 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.740
 That one that did not let go 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.829
 New Testament it's the Bible is also the most essential parts 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.260
 so 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:46.810
 This does Mase Hotondoi those that know the people on that planet 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:49.020
 It's a level that it is the marmot put it when the angels and God God do not know 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:56.960
 It has been kept hidden for a long time 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 It's kind of like I can finally talk about that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
 Because I do not go and do not have to that door Well basic knowledge 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.730
 What 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:10.950
 Before we get into this story, that 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:15.690
 Well known basic facts, I would like to suppress from there a little 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.620
 Simon Magos was born as a cutting Nomura and was well-received as a sorcerer 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.719
 Thought that his Magos is a sorceress derived from this 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:25.380
 It looks like 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.380
 Or after Claudius 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 41-54 bad mood 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.770
 Simon went to Rome where he was worshiped with God and he was erected to a super statue 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.909
 Samaritan has already looked on him as a God 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.900
 that 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 It is what one of that religion its so because one of the place the mouse is 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:55.310
 The followers at that treat him as a god and he is also a sort of philosopher 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.510
 I'm writing a book but I have not left 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.410
 I'm writing it, I guess it's completely Gnostic 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:12.270
 Yes number fingerprint Mago vinegar is the city of the Phoenicians 0 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:13.110
 She had traveled with a raw wife from her former widow Helena, and she went one after another 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.990
 captivity 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.870
 Only until the vinegar prostitute finally it is mixed port in covered in shame intolerable for the 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.540
 Have done 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.170
 But because God revived in the form of Simon, he sought out and saved Henna. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.870
 Fingerprint is yourself updated with the update to take 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:43.580
 Of that Well property or the Gnostic who I say I mean Paul that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.780
 As the body of supreme god is it in the child update of yourself Fu that it is obtained by that appearance 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.290
 You said something 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.870
 The year also Magosu Haneshi update called fingerprint 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.890
 Says that it is the one who has transformed into flesh as flesh , and that Helena 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 The woman who was brought on the trip 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.140
 Half the amount of n 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.230
 that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.050
 Trapped in the mouth to Shinkuni mug 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.290
 After repeated incarnations on the ceiling, you have fallen by yourself 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:16.370
 It means that you were teaching like it was rescued 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:21.890
 This Hano Gnostic scene is a person one of the patterns that are very well also in the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:27.170
 So was decent of it is is that capital Mags Gnostic Runoa 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:32.120
 Most important is the Coptic Coptic storing principle of Pistist Sophia 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.180
 Both are similar and in this are clearly attached to Magdalene 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.360
 Sophia was covered then Pistist Sophia 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.970
 Captured Sofia 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.030
 It is Jesus to come to look for 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.730
 this 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.020
 In the tradition of Pistist Sophia, there is the same story, but in that it is that 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.470
 was taken 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.130
 A woman who is cuckold and taken in Miku 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.460
 It's a shame 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:04.530
 It's Sophia, but it's clearly that in that context this Magdalene Maria and that 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:09.090
 I'm I'm tied come to look for and rescue him I have become Jesus 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.930
 It has become quite competitive mirror to the one I I mean Ya' it similar shape after this 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.420
 It's a relationship 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:18.540
 So there was also a general gnostic like this 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.760
 And here the Mary of Jesus and Magdalene is finally here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.240
 that 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.010
 However, on the other hand, that child too grandson Helena 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:32.070
 Say that it is finally 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:33.990
 Philosophy on the one of these that is a Ukoto say correct selfishness is and indistinguishable 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.310
 It is said that 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.150
 What it Tteyuu how was thinking in the 12 disciples of The problem is Well then Jesus 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.330
 you know 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:48.740
 In the notion that is not the same as this clearly 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.380
 Pico's Gospel is clearly what Philip wrote, so if you read it 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.560
 is not it 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.400
 The reason is that Philip is actually standing a perfect Gnostic's 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:03.370
 That 's why one of 12 -1 is 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.409
 When thinking of this, Jesus also thinks that is really similar to Gothon Goth 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.469
 And 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:12.800
 I understand that I was also doing cash register etc. 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:14.560
 This is the case to bear little resemblance to the Christian that currently we know 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.740
 It means 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.250
 Der due Kuramen too point of the third century 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.620
 Among the disciple , fingerprints were most liked by John 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:31.479
 And when our John is gone, he's going to Alexandria 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.689
 It is also the same year that John was good and light clothes are super 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.030
 In other words , he was elected the head of the Johns in John Flower 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.210
 There is a description 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.569
 That's why 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:45.110
 It is from the description of this the car chair ceremony 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:50.800
 Simon was actually John's successor 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.800
 That was my most favorite disciple and a de facto successor 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:00.240
 I understand that 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:03.630
 In this because we know that the fingerprint's clearly of magician has learned from anyone 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 I thing I say is Tsu 5 victories decision instrument of 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.620
 As I've described , John the Baptist is a sexual magician, a master of alchemy 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.980
 I 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.610
 Baptist money is not a master of western alchemy 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.649
 I was a master 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:24.029
 And that partner was Mary Magdalene 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:27.629
 The next leader to John the Baptist was killed and beheaded in 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:29.740
 Yes anthropologist Jacob became an Essene leader 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:34.030
 Will be the leader 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.880
 I came to love Jesus and came to love bs 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:42.220
 But this was a platonic 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:43.160
 This is due to the strong will of the sheets and layers that were united in Jesus and that house 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.639
 is 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:52.400
 Christ must not have a female relationship 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:55.280
 That's why it's definitely not true if there is a sexual relationship in particular 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.090
 That being to be Christ 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.430
 It Well yourself well for me libido value that its wings 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.430
 It is in the form of being thrown away 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.660
 In the end, 4 mo school modes and usa have been eradicated by the Roma Association 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.129
 I think it's okay to look at the feces 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:22.190
 It would be nice to see that it was eradicated 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:25.580
 I guess John faction of that case and the Association was probably fear as an enemy of 1 bread 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:31.250
 I think the church of John and John skin 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:37.370
 I have seen that I was overthrown and I tried to eradicate it. 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:39.169
 Indeed sentenced of as heresy of Tteyuu sects in Christianity, such as Eastern Churches whether plants Association 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.400
 It offers frequency going farewell been 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:46.960
 That is not eradicated 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:50.710
 Because it is the same as recognizing the true Jesus as Christ 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:55.150
 I Toka there is different I mean if just admit went old 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:58.120
 Probably the same as the child has admitted me useful difference there you'll may But Messiah and insect Jesus 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:02.500
 That's why it has not been destroyed 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:06.420
 But it is to tentatively is what is destroyed been thoroughly crackdown 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.860
 It is a frequency that John thinks as a savior 

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.860
 This is an important part
