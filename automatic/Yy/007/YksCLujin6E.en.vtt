00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
movement everybody works a little
differently<00:03:56.790> but<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.540> turn<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.959> color<00:03:58.140> section

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
differently but I turn the color section

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.280 
differently but I turn the color section
by<00:03:58.830> section<00:03:59.209> once<00:04:00.209> i<00:04:00.360> have<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.690> tank<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
by section once i have the tank and the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.729 
by section once i have the tank and the
foreground<00:04:01.650> finish<00:04:02.100> i<00:04:02.370> might<00:04:02.910> lay<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.360> sky

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
foreground finish i might lay in a sky

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.010 
foreground finish i might lay in a sky
texture<00:04:04.739> then<00:04:05.549> put<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> gradient

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
texture then put a gradient

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.350 
texture then put a gradient
of<00:04:07.230> white<00:04:07.620> on<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.010> horizon<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:09.000> give<00:04:09.180> a<00:04:09.210> little

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
of white on the horizon to give a little

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.960 
of white on the horizon to give a little
atmospheric<00:04:10.020> haze<00:04:10.230> I<00:04:10.740> might<00:04:11.640> use<00:04:11.790> the

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
atmospheric haze I might use the

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.150 
atmospheric haze I might use the
airbrush<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:13.280> create<00:04:14.280> some<00:04:15.060> more<00:04:15.240> clouds

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.610 

or<00:04:18.700> enlarge<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.480> clubs<00:04:20.110> that<00:04:20.350> are<00:04:20.410> already

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
or enlarge the clubs that are already

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.340 
or enlarge the clubs that are already
there<00:04:21.390> basically<00:04:22.390> all<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.810> techniques<00:04:23.200> I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
there basically all the techniques I

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.680 
there basically all the techniques I
learned<00:04:23.380> as<00:04:23.770> an<00:04:23.890> illustrator<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.700> used<00:04:25.150> in<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
learned as an illustrator I used in the

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.310 
learned as an illustrator I used in the
computer<00:04:26.170> just<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.560> different<00:04:26.860> technology<00:04:31.320> if

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
computer just a different technology if

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.890 
computer just a different technology if
only<00:04:32.980> we<00:04:33.400> could<00:04:33.550> have<00:04:33.820> seen<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.240> maggot<00:04:34.780> the

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
only we could have seen the maggot the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.110 
only we could have seen the maggot the
sylphs<00:04:35.320> stickman<00:04:35.770> brought<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.370> life<00:04:36.550> by<00:04:36.820> the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.990 

I<00:05:30.419> don't<00:05:30.810> you<00:05:30.870> drop<00:05:31.229> it

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.330 

here's<00:05:37.000> something<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:37.960> little<00:05:38.260> bit<00:05:38.590> new<00:05:38.830> on<00:05:39.130> the

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
here's something a little bit new on the

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.530 
here's something a little bit new on the
antigravity<00:05:39.760> room<00:05:40.540> a<00:05:40.870> little<00:05:41.380> thing<00:05:41.740> we<00:05:41.980> call

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
antigravity room a little thing we call

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.540 
antigravity room a little thing we call
