00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.999
 that a family can not the madness that 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.190
 can not have water availability 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:23.620
 for 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.270
 to water a garden to make a 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.030
 farm for bathing 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.950
 it's very painful to me it touched me and the others 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.410
 do not know a few years ago the 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.960
 community is we were discussing the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.100
 first manifesto wichi touched me 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.320
 Cater to a sister who lost her baby 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.350
 by going to look for water of the goods 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.350
 heavy and I had to have that urgency 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.100
 and having in my hands is a little brother who 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.100
 that could not live let's say 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:02.370
 for this injustice that still continues 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.720
 then this is the theme of the project that 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 we want to do together because what 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.220
 we will do together as we have been doing 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.440
 everything so far is a project that does not 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.330
 has let's say state support does not have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.750
 support of politicians has no support 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.970
 of the government is a project that we come 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.520
 trying to generate among people who 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.290
 meet people who want a country 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.060
 different between people who want a 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.290
 different relationship between people who want 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.180
 a brotherhood a community we do not have 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.329
 the budget for all budgets 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.020
 with the budget for the materials 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.470
 and can rent let's say it looked like 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.380
 his team and in coordinating it we 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.100
 the other leg is missing let's say it would be 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.380
 staff to occupy but everything depends on 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.270
 community 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.770
 what the communities say 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.719
 I do not have problems 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.719
 and if you have to start tomorrow 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:14.240
 in the water well is also 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.490
 a symbol of unity of independence and 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.460
 as int says and repeats and repeats 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.020
 elpozo is also water that comes out of the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.690
 land but it is also a symbol of 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.610
 our ability to unite then 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.980
 us because this we commit ourselves to 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.990
 do we buy materials and turn off the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.300
 computer and rent them as a team 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.069
 you will commit as one acted 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.760
 as the community 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.829
 to work for the rest of the join a 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.439
 little fish and tomÃ¡s for that it 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.689
 dismantled when we finished the possible 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.459
 ad look here is the water the well already 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.200
 is ready are the pipes out all 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.739
 we are going to have to make another effort 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.109
 together to get the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.900
 bomb that goes inside I think you both 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.150
 the given conditions should not be doubted 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.620
 nothing since the fact of having the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.019
 material and the right of society to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.450
 its tool to the technical work and the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.000
 availability of you is already given 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.980
 I think the concretion of I believe that today 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.980
 sign the agreement and we are already tomorrow 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.490
 two 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.120
 The following benefits 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.120
 I do not know 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.280
 or not 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.370
 now
