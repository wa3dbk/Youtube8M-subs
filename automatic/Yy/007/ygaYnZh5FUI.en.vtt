energy<00:00:20.840> design<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:28.130> think<00:00:29.130> every<00:00:29.580> film<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
energy design I think every film is a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.600 
energy design I think every film is a
moment<00:00:30.539> because<00:00:30.810> every<00:00:31.560> film<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.980> did<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
moment because every film I did is the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.700 
moment because every film I did is the
caliber<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.360> new<00:00:35.390> part<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.540> time<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.469> life

it<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.319> first<00:04:53.650> game<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.979> learned<00:04:54.189> my<00:04:54.370> texts

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:54.819 
it the first game I learned my texts

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:56.999 
it the first game I learned my texts
then<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.330> found<00:04:55.689> out<00:04:55.870> this<00:04:56.020> much<00:04:56.259> better<00:04:56.529> not<00:04:56.830> to

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
then I found out this much better not to

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.670 
then I found out this much better not to
learn<00:04:57.189> it<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:58.479> read<00:04:58.659> it<00:04:58.809> a<00:04:58.900> few<00:04:59.080> times<00:04:59.289> so<00:04:59.589> you

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
learn it to read it a few times so you

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.559 
learn it to read it a few times so you
know<00:04:59.770> what<00:04:59.919> your<00:05:00.069> butts<00:05:00.339> all<00:05:00.490> about<00:05:00.789> and<00:05:01.180> then

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
know what your butts all about and then

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:02.939 
know what your butts all about and then
you<00:05:01.689> look<00:05:01.839> in<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:02.020> camera<00:05:02.409> and<00:05:02.559> you<00:05:02.589> read<00:05:02.830> it

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
you look in a camera and you read it

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:04.320 
you look in a camera and you read it
because<00:05:03.069> your<00:05:03.339> concentration<00:05:03.849> is<00:05:04.089> high

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
because your concentration is high

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.989 
because your concentration is high
because<00:05:05.259> you<00:05:05.439> have<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:06.009> look<00:05:06.249> you<00:05:06.550> have<00:05:06.819> to

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:06.999 
because you have to look you have to

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.850 
because you have to look you have to
stare<00:05:07.360> into<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:07.900> camera<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.469> you<00:05:08.559> have<00:05:08.680> to

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
stare into the camera and you have to

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.600 
stare into the camera and you have to
totally<00:05:09.610> not<00:05:09.789> miss<00:05:10.089> one<00:05:10.749> word<00:05:11.219> if<00:05:12.219> you<00:05:12.309> learn

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
totally not miss one word if you learn

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.920 
totally not miss one word if you learn
it<00:05:12.819> you<00:05:12.849> might<00:05:13.150> say<00:05:13.330> oh<00:05:13.509> yes<00:05:14.259> oh<00:05:15.150> yeah<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.809> you

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
it you might say oh yes oh yeah and you

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.079 
it you might say oh yes oh yeah and you
look<00:05:17.110> away<00:05:17.379> but<00:05:18.370> when<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.669> are<00:05:18.789> when<00:05:18.939> you

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.089 
look away but when you are when you

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.629 
look away but when you are when you
haven't<00:05:19.870> learned<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.349> I<00:05:20.589> mean<00:05:21.069> you<00:05:21.189> just<00:05:21.219> read

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
haven't learned it I mean you just read

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.070 
haven't learned it I mean you just read
it<00:05:21.759> a<00:05:21.849> few<00:05:22.029> times<00:05:22.210> you<00:05:22.479> have<00:05:22.659> to<00:05:22.779> concentrate

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
it a few times you have to concentrate

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.149 
it a few times you have to concentrate
on<00:05:23.319> the<00:05:23.439> monitor

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
on the monitor

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.159 
on the monitor
video<00:05:24.759> game<00:05:24.969> there's<00:05:25.210> more<00:05:25.419> interested<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.080> a

it's 90 minutes and that's what you see

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.839 
it's 90 minutes and that's what you see
if<00:05:31.779> you<00:05:31.839> want<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.229> replay<00:05:32.649> a<00:05:32.680> scene<00:05:33.039> you<00:05:33.219> can<00:05:33.430> do

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
if you want to replay a scene you can do

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.579 
if you want to replay a scene you can do
that<00:05:34.089> but<00:05:34.990> a<00:05:35.229> video<00:05:35.439> game<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.069> video<00:05:36.309> game<00:05:36.699> has<00:05:37.029> I

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
that but a video game a video game has I

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.249 
that but a video game a video game has I
want<00:05:38.589> that<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.979> be<00:05:39.189> here<00:05:39.520> man<00:05:39.909> to<00:05:40.719> listen<00:05:41.110> to

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:41.259 
want that you be here man to listen to

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:43.159 
want that you be here man to listen to
all<00:05:41.439> my<00:05:41.469> intelligence

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
all my intelligence

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:48.420 
all my intelligence
yes<00:05:44.169> be<00:05:44.529> here<00:05:44.800> be<00:05:45.099> inside<00:05:45.490> come<00:05:45.819> sit<00:05:46.059> down<00:05:47.430> so

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
yes be here be inside come sit down so

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.249 
yes be here be inside come sit down so
that<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.819> think<00:05:48.969> that's<00:05:49.300> it<00:05:49.419> as<00:05:49.569> if<00:05:49.839> that<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:50.259 
that I think that's it as if that is the

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.570 
that I think that's it as if that is the
difference<00:05:50.710> that<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:52.300> video<00:05:52.569> game<00:05:52.719> is<00:05:53.580> never

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
difference that a video game is never

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.809 
difference that a video game is never
ending<00:05:55.060> story<00:05:55.589> and<00:05:56.589> it<00:05:56.740> will<00:05:56.830> end<00:05:57.039> the<00:05:57.610> more

00:05:57.809 --> 00:05:57.819 
ending story and it will end the more

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:59.579 
ending story and it will end the more
intelligent<00:05:58.120> you<00:05:58.389> are<00:05:58.509> you've<00:05:58.870> probably<00:05:59.110> come

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
intelligent you are you've probably come

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.800 
intelligent you are you've probably come
to<00:05:59.860> an<00:05:59.919> end<00:06:00.089> as<00:06:01.089> I<00:06:01.149> think<00:06:01.449> it's<00:06:01.749> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
to an end as I think it's the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.649 
to an end as I think it's the
alternative<00:06:02.379> intelligence<00:06:03.240> it's<00:06:04.240> how<00:06:04.449> much

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
alternative intelligence it's how much

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.619 
alternative intelligence it's how much
you<00:06:04.719> believe<00:06:04.959> in<00:06:05.259> me<00:06:05.409> and<00:06:06.370> you<00:06:06.430> OSS<00:06:07.029> go<00:06:07.330> there

you believe in me and you OSS go there
