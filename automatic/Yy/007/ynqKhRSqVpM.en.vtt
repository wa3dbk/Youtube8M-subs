00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
centimeters step 3 fold it twice to get

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:33.660 
centimeters step 3 fold it twice to get

shown in the video
step<00:02:39.519> 5<00:02:40.120> place<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.750> onto<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.230> antenna<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.889> fix

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
step 5 place it onto the antenna and fix

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.459 
step 5 place it onto the antenna and fix
it<00:02:42.489> with<00:02:42.669> some<00:02:42.700> tape<00:02:43.590> done<00:02:45.959> here<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.109> can<00:02:47.290> see

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
it with some tape done here you can see

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.589 
it with some tape done here you can see
the<00:02:47.620> Wi-Fi<00:02:47.829> speed<00:02:48.400> before<00:02:48.939> applying<00:02:49.389> this

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
the Wi-Fi speed before applying this

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.009 
the Wi-Fi speed before applying this
well<00:02:49.810> fix<00:02:50.199> and<00:02:50.439> after<00:02:51.189> doing<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.699> at<00:02:52.510> the<00:02:52.750> same

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
well fix and after doing it at the same

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.860 
well fix and after doing it at the same
exact<00:02:53.709> location<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.579> guess<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:55.480> should<00:02:55.510> be

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
exact location I guess there should be

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.539 
exact location I guess there should be
some<00:02:56.109> math<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.379> physics<00:02:56.769> behind<00:02:57.340> that

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
some math and physics behind that

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.129 
some math and physics behind that
because<00:02:57.909> I've<00:02:58.060> tried<00:02:58.299> a<00:02:58.329> couple<00:02:58.449> of<00:02:58.870> world

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
because I've tried a couple of world

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.439 
because I've tried a couple of world
sizes<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.919> only<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> third<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.030> did<00:03:01.299> actually

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:01.449 
sizes and only a third one did actually

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.720 
sizes and only a third one did actually
achieve<00:03:01.989> some<00:03:02.230> results<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.189> make<00:03:03.430> sure<00:03:03.459> to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
achieve some results so make sure to

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.939 
achieve some results so make sure to
give<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.389> a<00:03:04.449> try<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.019> if<00:03:05.349> you<00:03:05.379> don't<00:03:05.709> succeed

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:05.949 
give this a try and if you don't succeed

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:09.059 
give this a try and if you don't succeed
the<00:03:06.250> first<00:03:06.280> time<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:07.060> try<00:03:07.359> once<00:03:07.659> more<00:03:08.069> that's

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
the first time just try once more that's

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.220 
the first time just try once more that's
it<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.489> this<00:03:09.609> video<00:03:09.790> guys<00:03:09.969> I<00:03:10.480> hope<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.989> was
