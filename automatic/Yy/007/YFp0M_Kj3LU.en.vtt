and<00:04:13.070> Wonder<00:04:13.459> Woman<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.850> think<00:04:14.150> that's<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.390> decent

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
and Wonder Woman I think that's a decent

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.300 
and Wonder Woman I think that's a decent
number<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:15.079> characters<00:04:15.560> I<00:04:15.739> think<00:04:16.010> once<00:04:16.190> you

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
number of characters I think once you

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.240 
number of characters I think once you
bring<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:16.700> any<00:04:16.880> more<00:04:17.120> characters<00:04:17.539> than<00:04:17.570> that

bring in any more characters than that

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.710 
bring in any more characters than that

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
then it's going to start getting a

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.030 
then it's going to start getting a
little<00:04:19.750> bit<00:04:20.140> bloated<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.739> there<00:04:20.890> you<00:04:20.920> have

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
little bit bloated so there you have

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.380 
little bit bloated so there you have
whether<00:04:21.459> or<00:04:21.640> not<00:04:21.760> they're<00:04:21.970> going<00:04:22.060> to<00:04:22.180> include
