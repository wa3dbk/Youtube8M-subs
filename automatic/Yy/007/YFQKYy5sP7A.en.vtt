fit the jeep the jeep itself is $60 and
I<00:01:22.330> know<00:01:22.390> that<00:01:22.600> sounds<00:01:23.080> pretty<00:01:23.350> expensive<00:01:23.619> for

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
I know that sounds pretty expensive for

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.770 
I know that sounds pretty expensive for
the<00:01:24.700> size<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.450> it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
the size of it

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.590 
the size of it
and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.890> reason<00:01:27.190> why<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:27.729> expensive<00:01:28.090> is

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
and the reason why I was so expensive is

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.130 
and the reason why I was so expensive is
because<00:01:29.640> there's<00:01:30.640> a<00:01:30.729> lot<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.150> custom<00:01:31.660> pieces

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
because there's a lot of custom pieces

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.320 
because there's a lot of custom pieces
that<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.410> can<00:01:32.560> rarely<00:01:32.979> find<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.790> it's<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
that you can rarely find and it's in the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.280 
that you can rarely find and it's in the
old<00:01:34.540> dark<00:01:34.960> gray<00:01:35.229> color<00:01:35.340> back<00:01:36.340> before<00:01:37.290> 2004

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
old dark gray color back before 2004

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.960 
old dark gray color back before 2004
when<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.619> introduced<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.190> new<00:01:39.400> color<00:01:41.760> it<00:01:42.760> was<00:01:42.910> a

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
when the introduced a new color it was a

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.900 
when the introduced a new color it was a
darker<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:43.930> of<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.170> darkish<00:01:44.619> gray<00:01:45.040> now<00:01:45.550> it's<00:01:45.790> a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
darker kind of a darkish gray now it's a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.850 
darker kind of a darkish gray now it's a
lighter<00:01:46.180> gray<00:01:46.600> you<00:01:46.900> can<00:01:47.080> tell<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.410> difference

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
lighter gray you can tell the difference

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.249 
lighter gray you can tell the difference
if<00:01:48.100> you've<00:01:48.310> built<00:01:48.640> like<00:01:49.030> Legos<00:01:49.509> before<00:01:50.080> and

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
if you've built like Legos before and

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.080 
if you've built like Legos before and
you're<00:01:50.350> using<00:01:50.530> gray<00:01:50.950> sometimes<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.729> your<00:01:51.850> old

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
you're using gray sometimes in your old

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.390 
you're using gray sometimes in your old
collection<00:01:52.690> will<00:01:53.290> have<00:01:53.440> old<00:01:53.680> dark<00:01:53.980> Gray's<00:01:54.220> and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
collection will have old dark Gray's and

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.500 
collection will have old dark Gray's and
you'll<00:01:54.550> see<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.730> difference<00:01:55.090> between<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
you'll see a difference between the

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.780 
you'll see a difference between the
greys<00:01:55.810> so<00:01:56.650> when<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.040> find<00:01:57.220> these<00:01:57.370> kind<00:01:57.700> of

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
greys so when you find these kind of

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.690 
greys so when you find these kind of
pieces<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:59.230> can<00:01:59.830> only<00:01:59.980> get<00:02:00.130> them<00:02:00.280> really

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
pieces you can only get them really

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.400 
pieces you can only get them really
prickling<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.450> can't<00:02:01.660> get<00:02:01.810> them<00:02:01.930> on<00:02:01.990> pick<00:02:02.380> a

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
prickling you can't get them on pick a

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.770 
prickling you can't get them on pick a
brick<00:02:02.740> so<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.670> what<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> cost<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> lot

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
brick so that's what the cost is a lot

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.460 
brick so that's what the cost is a lot
higher<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:06.420> there<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.510> some<00:02:07.690> unique<00:02:07.870> building

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
higher and there is some unique building

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.210 
higher and there is some unique building
on<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.920> think<00:02:12.700> probably<00:02:13.570> about<00:02:14.220> 10

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
on it so I think probably about 10

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.150 
on it so I think probably about 10
inches<00:02:15.519> maybe<00:02:16.980> maybe<00:02:17.980> about

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
inches maybe maybe about

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.600 
inches maybe maybe about
seven<00:02:19.910> inches<00:02:21.400> size<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.100> looks<00:02:25.400> like

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
fully loaded Jeep let's go ahead and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.180 
fully loaded Jeep let's go ahead and
take<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:10.910> figures<00:03:11.180> out<00:03:11.500> okay<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.800> took<00:03:13.040> up

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
take the figures out okay so I took up

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.190 
take the figures out okay so I took up
the<00:03:13.370> figures<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.180> put<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.840> figure<00:03:15.140> you

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
actually get with the kit and I guess we

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.230 
actually get with the kit and I guess we
don't<00:03:19.010> really<00:03:19.100> need<00:03:19.400> this<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:19.790> I'll<00:03:19.880> take<00:03:20.060> that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
don't really need this so I'll take that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
don't really need this so I'll take that

will say you get two shovels but they're

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.050 
will say you get two shovels but they're
supposed<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:21.920> be<00:04:22.040> part<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> kit<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:22.910> don't

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
supposed to be part of the kit you don't

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.200 
supposed to be part of the kit you don't
really<00:04:23.210> use<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.630> shovels<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.320> can<00:04:24.800> actually

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
really use the shovels I can actually

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.070 
really use the shovels I can actually
but

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
but

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.800 
but
I<00:04:27.110> think<00:04:27.470> that's<00:04:27.680> when<00:04:28.069> because<00:04:29.000> this<00:04:29.150> one<00:04:29.389> I

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
I think that's when because this one I

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.809 
I think that's when because this one I
think<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.470> Willys<00:04:30.800> Jeep<00:04:31.069> wasn't<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.639> total

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
think the Willys Jeep wasn't a total

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:36.129 
think the Willys Jeep wasn't a total
off-road<00:04:33.129> Jeep<00:04:34.129> because<00:04:34.699> I<00:04:35.599> was<00:04:35.900> told

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
off-road Jeep because I was told

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:38.409 
off-road Jeep because I was told
sometimes<00:04:36.680> got<00:04:37.069> stuck<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.490> mud<00:04:37.669> I<00:04:38.150> think

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419
