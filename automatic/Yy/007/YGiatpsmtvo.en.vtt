00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 unrestrained marsannay in all and for all that five minutes before that 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.959
 the Trojan team of the face definitely exploded 

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.739
 but also thanks to what

 masterfully controlled data traffic by players 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.400
 in the 13th minute the Aachen conquered advanced 9 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.670
 but that will not work out for the Burgundians who are completely 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.450
 overwhelmed by the speed of execution last Trojan he found the others 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.730
 compiles the buses in the opposing cage he advances reach the 10 goals 15 released to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.020
 the 23rd minute then she 16 goals away 21 5 and 2 minutes before halftime 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.480
 both teams 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.070
 this is German part on the score of 23 points 6 the match and for so 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.170
 say finished 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.059
 in Malaysia stops that we had to stay focused on our game 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.900
 do not pay attention to score 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.950
 the morning continued with France 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.440
 lost their bearings and to make you a little disappointed in individual before 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.880
 all areas of the game 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.210
 unfortunately it was not argued not defense 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.910
 a lot of shot chess and a record number of bullets 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.829
 lost of what 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.649
 angry carole martin and christophe guerry the tandem of coaches at 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:14.870
 job 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.920
 from March to May these benefited the largesse auboise to be more 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.610
 skillful in front of the bowman cage 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.560
 in eight minutes the Burgundians scored as many goals in the first 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 period for 25 to 12 in the 38th minute 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.600
 the Trojan players are going a little better end the meeting that had not 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 started win all the same from estac 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.390
 what do you mean 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 because in reality you have to stop staying focused 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.510
 we tried to stay focused we did not succeed 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.780
 it's weird here and elsewhere 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.760
 then we still managed to win half-time by a goal the second 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760
 half time but good 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.230
 deceased dna 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.940
 the collective is necessary 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.920
 the three parts of pleasure 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.750
 we must continue 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.750
 with this person never why not go up 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.380
