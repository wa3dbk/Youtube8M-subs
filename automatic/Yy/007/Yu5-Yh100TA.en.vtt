innocuous hand preflop ended up being
what<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.240> thought<00:00:06.509> was<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.990> most<00:00:07.020> interesting

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
what I thought was the most interesting

it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.759> fourth<00:01:48.090> straight<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.750> mean<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.290> it's

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it's a fourth straight I mean it's it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.550 
it's a fourth straight I mean it's it's
a<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> straight<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.149> board

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
a this there's a straight on the board

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.440 
a this there's a straight on the board
and<00:01:52.560> there's<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> four<00:01:53.009> flush<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.619> I<00:01:56.450> tanks

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and there's a four flush and I tanks

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.090 
and there's a four flush and I tanks
he's<00:01:58.320> getting<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.960> think<00:02:00.960> roughly<00:02:01.590> four<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:01.979> one

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
he's getting I think roughly four to one

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
he's getting I think roughly four to one
makes<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.549> call<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> nut<00:02:03.270> straight<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
makes the call with the nut straight and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.570 
makes the call with the nut straight and
it<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.159> shows<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> flush<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:07.580> think

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it so there shows the flush so I think

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.020 
it so there shows the flush so I think
you<00:02:09.149> know<00:02:09.270> preflop<00:02:10.099> preflop<00:02:11.099> seems<00:02:11.459> standard

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you know preflop preflop seems standard

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.050 
you know preflop preflop seems standard
on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.989> flop<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
on the flop is

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.610 
on the flop is
check<00:02:14.540> raising<00:02:14.930> there<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> think<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.410> pretty

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
check raising there I think is pretty

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.870 
check raising there I think is pretty
standard<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:17.260> three<00:02:18.260> betting<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.590> flop<00:02:18.980> given

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
standard I three betting that flop given

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.420 
standard I three betting that flop given
how<00:02:20.000> deep<00:02:20.300> they<00:02:20.510> are<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.040> giving<00:02:22.040> how<00:02:22.160> draw

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
how deep they are and giving how draw

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.880 
how deep they are and giving how draw
heavy<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.300> is<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:23.959> with<00:02:24.260> him<00:02:24.470> holding<00:02:24.620> him

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
heavy it is with with him holding him

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.220 
heavy it is with with him holding him
nuts<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.520> pretty<00:02:25.700> standard<00:02:26.230> it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230

the<00:03:02.450> flop<00:03:02.799> which<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:04.780> 1/4<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:06.349> a<00:03:06.470> stack<00:03:09.459> now<00:03:10.459> I

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
the flop which is 1/4 of a stack now I

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.630 
the flop which is 1/4 of a stack now I
guess<00:03:12.049> I<00:03:12.260> kiss<00:03:12.470> taking<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.830> chance<00:03:13.069> here<00:03:13.280> that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
guess I kiss taking a chance here that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.449 
guess I kiss taking a chance here that
is<00:03:14.239> so<00:03:14.390> there<00:03:14.569> isn't<00:03:14.780> gonna<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.560> mean

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
is so there isn't gonna have I mean

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.069 
is so there isn't gonna have I mean
basically<00:03:16.640> you<00:03:16.940> know<00:03:17.299> any<00:03:17.540> kind<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.810> blank

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
basically you know any kind of blank

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.780 
basically you know any kind of blank
rolls<00:03:18.350> off<00:03:18.620> it<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.400> there's<00:03:19.579> going<00:03:19.730> to

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
rolls off it so there's going to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.479 
rolls off it so there's going to
continue<00:03:19.970> betting<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.500> it's<00:03:22.190> just

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
continue betting and it's it's just

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.870 
continue betting and it's it's just
unlucky<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.450> card<00:03:23.780> came<00:03:24.109> but<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
unlucky that this card came but so I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.520 
unlucky that this card came but so I
guess<00:03:26.239> from<00:03:26.359> that<00:03:26.600> perspective<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:27.230> kind<00:03:27.470> of

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
guess from that perspective I kind of

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.030 
guess from that perspective I kind of
understand<00:03:27.980> his<00:03:28.130> flop<00:03:28.400> play<00:03:28.640> but<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.769> river

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
understand his flop play but the river

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.710 
understand his flop play but the river
just<00:03:31.370> really<00:03:31.700> blew<00:03:31.910> my<00:03:32.090> mind<00:03:32.359> how<00:03:34.480> not<00:03:35.480> only

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
just really blew my mind how not only

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.050 
just really blew my mind how not only
does<00:03:35.900> it<00:03:35.930> solder<00:03:36.470> shove<00:03:36.950> his<00:03:37.370> seven<00:03:37.880> high

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
does it solder shove his seven high

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.759 
does it solder shove his seven high
flush<00:03:38.660> for<00:03:38.959> value<00:03:39.380> here<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:41.299> calls<00:03:42.290> them<00:03:42.530> so

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
flush for value here but I calls them so

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.110 
flush for value here but I calls them so
