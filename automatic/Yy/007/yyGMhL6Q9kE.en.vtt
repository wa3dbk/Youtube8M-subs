here it's about trying to be as fast as
possible<00:00:53.059> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.320> as<00:00:55.410> wide<00:00:55.649> as

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
possible which is not going as wide as

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
possible which is not going as wide as
possible<00:00:55.879> hang<00:00:56.879> those<00:00:57.059> corners<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.420> get

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
possible hang those corners and get

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.430 
possible hang those corners and get
everything<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.769> a<00:01:02.359> lot<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> damage

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
everything out of the a lot of damage

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.350 
everything out of the a lot of damage
going<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.830> there<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.820> think<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.120> fans

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
going on there and I think the fans

going on there and I think the fans
going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.650> get<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.800> value<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
going to get the value out of the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:41.219 
going to get the value out of the
tickets<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.760> sure
