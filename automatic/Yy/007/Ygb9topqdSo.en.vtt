 hello everyone with you spoon and today we 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 We will consider the mod using 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.260
 which you can create an anvil 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 what makes it on coval yes just 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.820
 just mending things you probably 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 say that even without mods you can repair 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.149
 items but this mod has 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.860
 own highlight 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:25.169
 and let's first look at how 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.570
 crafting this here anvil us 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.029
 only 4 iron is needed and then 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.649
 there is an anvil she stacks what 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 really really cool 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.969
 wear one piece and now we have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.190
 Right-click and put back 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.020
 our broken object will show us 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 for example for the golden hoe us 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.700
 need two gold we put two 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.500
 gold and we all repaired 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840
 but it turned out that we only need 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.730
 one gold is very nice and then u 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.700
 we got obeyed i hoe what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.740
 damn cool cool also if we 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.430
 was broken and enchanted item and we 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.400
 put it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.950
 then when we will almost have it 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.930
 of course enchanted subject subject 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.909
 what's really cool because 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.890
 the author tried that is now if we 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.050
 earlier if we used to just plain 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 put two identical items even 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.940
 they were enchanted then we succeeded 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.770
 just one simple also now 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.300
 if we just zacharuy our 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.080
 simple thing here for example we have it 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.880
 enchants 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.340
 he shimmers us we his 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 we put on the anvil now our 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.240
 subject even if he is enchanted then he 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.490
 still shows exactly 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.500
 showing up on the anvil this is me 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.180
 I speak cool because the author does not 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.700
 tried hard let it be 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.530
 for example even a hoe you see, she 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.060
 Of course the hour does not overflow because 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.190
 she is not enchanted let it be 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.020
 any planted pickaxe pickaxe need 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.630
 for a complete fix as you see three 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.150
 boards for mychat 2 diamonds 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.080
 if you are a diamond sword and generally on 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.460
 this mod exhausts everything, but if 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.980
