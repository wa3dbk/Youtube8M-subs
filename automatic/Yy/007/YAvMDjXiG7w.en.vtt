other side oh shoot immensely no doubt
about<00:03:44.300> that

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
about that

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.800 
about that
just<00:03:45.560> be<00:03:46.160> careful<00:03:46.790> because<00:03:46.820> I<00:03:47.210> like<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
just be careful because I like the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.110 
just be careful because I like the
bravado<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.530> like<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.310> confidence<00:03:49.580> I

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
bravado I like the confidence I

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.030 
bravado I like the confidence I
certainly<00:03:50.780> love<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.230> fact<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.800> with

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
certainly love the fact that it with

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.580 
certainly love the fact that it with
their<00:03:52.220> hands<00:03:53.060> on<00:03:53.210> somebody<00:03:53.450> really<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.200> get<00:03:54.440> all

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
their hands on somebody really I get all

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.070 
their hands on somebody really I get all
of<00:03:54.620> that<00:03:54.830> I<00:03:55.250> get<00:03:55.760> all<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.240> but<00:03:56.780> at<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
of that I get all of that but at the

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.810 
of that I get all of that but at the
same<00:03:57.320> time<00:03:57.740> especially<00:03:58.130> when<00:03:58.640> you've<00:03:58.790> got

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
same time especially when you've got

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.510 
same time especially when you've got
assessment<00:03:59.660> outfits<00:04:00.170> you<00:04:00.620> think<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.220> isn't

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
assessment outfits you think that isn't

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.760 
assessment outfits you think that isn't
a<00:04:01.580> juggernaut<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.390> ultimately<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:03.260> defense

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
a juggernaut and ultimately the defense

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.380 
a juggernaut and ultimately the defense
is<00:04:03.920> left<00:04:04.160> on<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.370> field<00:04:04.640> all<00:04:04.850> far<00:04:05.150> more

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
is left on the field all far more

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.600 
is left on the field all far more
occasions<00:04:06.080> than<00:04:06.140> normal<00:04:06.740> because<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:07.430> don't

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
occasions than normal because you don't

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.790 
occasions than normal because you don't
have<00:04:07.790> open<00:04:08.420> options<00:04:08.840> you're<00:04:09.260> getting<00:04:09.650> even

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
have open options you're getting even

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.210 
have open options you're getting even
more<00:04:10.060> exposed<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.690> just<00:04:11.990> be<00:04:12.230> careful

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
more exposed so just be careful

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.860 
more exposed so just be careful
that's<00:04:13.730> all<00:04:13.880> I<00:04:13.910> want<00:04:14.240> I<00:04:14.300> just<00:04:14.330> want<00:04:14.510> them<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.780> be

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
that's all I want I just want them to be

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.440 
that's all I want I just want them to be
careful<00:04:15.320> because<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.830> think<00:04:16.280> Aaron<00:04:16.970> Rodgers<00:04:17.359> is

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
careful because I think Aaron Rodgers is

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.030 
careful because I think Aaron Rodgers is
the<00:04:17.540> best<00:04:17.750> quarterback<00:04:18.170> in<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.440> game<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.950> I

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the best quarterback in the game and I

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.500 
the best quarterback in the game and I
understand<00:04:19.400> they<00:04:19.489> beat<00:04:19.670> Aaron<00:04:19.940> Rodgers<00:04:20.359> and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
understand they beat Aaron Rodgers and

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.450 
understand they beat Aaron Rodgers and
now<00:04:20.570> they<00:04:20.630> beat<00:04:20.870> Tom<00:04:21.080> Brady<00:04:21.380> Tony<00:04:21.950> little<00:04:22.310> home

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
now they beat Tom Brady Tony little home

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.340 
now they beat Tom Brady Tony little home
you<00:04:22.730> know<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:22.850> get<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.330> but<00:04:23.450> at<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.750> same<00:04:23.990> time

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
you know I get it but at the same time

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.610 
you know I get it but at the same time
let's<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:24.830> careful<00:04:25.190> because<00:04:25.750> again<00:04:26.750> you<00:04:27.410> know

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620
