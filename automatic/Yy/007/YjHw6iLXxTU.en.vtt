00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.430
 friend jack you hello we are always 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.720
 in los angeles we are always at 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.160
 the narrow 2014 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.810
 and this time we will talk to you about a 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.360
 game that was announced exclusively 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.400
 during the press conference of 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.410
 microsoft it's rice and the blind 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.029
 forest has improved as we have seen 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.430
 both at microsoft 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.470
 a slap a slap which already a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.480
 graphic slap it's beautiful 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.250
 they have a sense of detail 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.650
 developers there since they hit me 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.660
 so it's actually an ode a tribute 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.860
 to the eyes to the flowing not what was 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.350
 interesting is that the developers 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.649
 was referring to mario every time 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.590
 metroid to zelda to castlevania also everything 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.000
 it's actually a source of inspiration 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.129
 inexhaustible for them for precisely 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.660
 to build rice to develop it - 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.129
 actually the creative director was 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.200
 there then the creative director of moon 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.539
 studios that told us that low of 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.830
 games like the legend of zelda a link to 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.229
 the past or metroid 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.940
 all these games that made the fame 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.220
 the reputation of the super nintendo these 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.630
 beautiful 2d games that were 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.070
 masterpieces at the time and who are 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.840
 still today actually twenty years 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.090
 later we play it's always the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.010
 even hungry the same fervor the same flavor 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.450
 cenap it has not lost anything without a visa it is 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.070
 ask the question but why we have more 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.810
 games like that today and it's up to 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.939
 from this postulate which decided to 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.590
 do so with rice and it's true that 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.500
 graphically then it's a game in 2d 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.610
 but that's not the subject of the d2d everything 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.020
 it serves me that it is really very 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 worked a depth effect 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.049
 exactly and decorations a bit a bit like 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.970
 ubisoft ubi 's tickets from ticket to 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.110
 montevrain - that's it or graphically 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.189
 it's very pretty it feels like 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.340
 in the heart of a cartoon 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.350
 and especially it's also a game in 2d 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.630
 who will tell a story that will 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.650
 full of emotion that's a point on 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 which he raised 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.590
 I do not know if you had told 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.060
 moment there because we have not if it is there 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.040
 the same demo but told us that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.200
 for a game in 2d the story is told 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.729
 and will be quite original and in the 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.079
 trailer we saw everyone was 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.259
 touched by the moment you see this little 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.090
 orifice trying to wake up his mom 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.500
 deceased and who understood that she was 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.290
 was dead and who will be there anymore for the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.040
 protect and who is going to see it just goes 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 grow up alone in this hostile world 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.459
 we immediately feel who in the dough 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 miyazaki told us to take inspiration too 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.080
 of touba miyazaki of all 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.180
 studios ghibli youth housing and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.620
 precisely had been done pastel colored 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.000
 have the impression of having made a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.200
 cartoon actually but seems to me that 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.310
 you your bitch and then play some 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600
 minutes anyway actually want to 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.040
 the end of the demo a life but he has 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.400
 proposed to someone here to take the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.069
 controller 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.269
 I immediately took and then that 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.000
 gives what is listening to the catch in the hands 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.769
 she is super intuitive the character 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.360
 will evolve over time it's 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.620
 to say that low initially there is no 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.569
 big thing that can just jumped 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.239
 then he will recover a species of orb 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.000
 who will be able so with which he goes 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.349
 to be able to hit enemies as and when 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.580
 measure they leave there trees of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.980
 skills that will allow him so 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.810
 to acquire a double jump the fact of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.100
 able to run on the walls he has us 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.500
 shown there are about ten or so 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.670
 skills to unlock and I laid a 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.140
 question to which he did not want 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.450
 answer but the mouse I asked is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.700
 what the creature will evolve from 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.810
 physical way here and there he did 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.400
 a little smile but I can really 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.500
 not talk about it but we see that the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.329
 creature go any trader that she 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.810
 will evolve and in my opinion we will have some 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.920
 surprises 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.810
 which is also interesting is the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.160
 land backup system never stops 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.930
 of energy gauge you can save 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.400
 anywhere there is no shareholder 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.359
 need to leave since the beginning of 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.310
 level so that too is a point 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.290
 interesting to point out yes that's it to 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.760
 players just to save his 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.160
 part actually it's going to create a species of 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.069
 light portals and from that 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.180
 portal there he can return to this check 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.859
 point actually once he will be dead 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.750
 but can also evolve his 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.750
 skill tree from this 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.209
 light gate so ben that's 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.200
 maybe for many the game of e3 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.569
 of the show 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.269
 yeah seen other very good games too 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.220
 but hey it's still early for for 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.130
 give you 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.140
 our final opinion but the game comes out 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.870
