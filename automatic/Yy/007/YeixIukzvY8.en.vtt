00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
but that's going to take a little bit of

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.280 
but that's going to take a little bit of
time<00:01:15.140> for<00:01:16.140> about<00:01:16.320> 30<00:01:16.590> seconds<00:01:18.110> we'll<00:01:19.110> let<00:01:19.260> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
time for about 30 seconds we'll let that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
time for about 30 seconds we'll let that
soak<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.100> we'll<00:01:20.340> whisk<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.880> again<00:01:21.120> in<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
soak and then we'll whisk it again in a

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.840 
soak and then we'll whisk it again in a
little<00:01:21.510> bit<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> while<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.160> soaking<00:01:23.460> we're

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
little bit so while that's soaking we're

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.840 
little bit so while that's soaking we're
going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.030> prepare<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:25.140> radish<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.850> want

and they feel firm on the touch then you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.230 
and they feel firm on the touch then you
just<00:01:32.940> cut<00:01:33.570> off<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> ends<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.490> discard<00:01:35.700> those

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
knife peel off the skin

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.820 
knife peel off the skin
that's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.300> daikon

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.310 

once<00:01:51.430> you've<00:01:51.610> peeled<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.180> daikon<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:53.170> want

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
once you've peeled the daikon you want

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.590 
once you've peeled the daikon you want
to<00:01:53.380> leave<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.650> in<00:01:53.770> long<00:01:54.520> strips<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.900> then<00:01:56.800> cut

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
to leave it in long strips and then cut

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.900 
to leave it in long strips and then cut
off<00:01:58.600> get<00:01:59.410> it<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.650> flat<00:01:59.920> surface<00:02:00.130> there<00:02:00.670> and

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
off get it on a flat surface there and

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.380 
off get it on a flat surface there and
then<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.630> cut<00:02:01.780> off<00:02:01.900> one<00:02:02.140> side<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.270> have

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
then just cut off one side so you have

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.250 
then just cut off one side so you have
an<00:02:04.630> evenly<00:02:05.200> flat<00:02:05.590> piece<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:07.780> continue

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
an evenly flat piece and then continue

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.280 
an evenly flat piece and then continue
to<00:02:08.380> cut<00:02:08.590> more<00:02:08.890> strips<00:02:09.369> about<00:02:10.360> 1/8<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.050> an<00:02:11.170> inch

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
to cut more strips about 1/8 of an inch

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.540 
to cut more strips about 1/8 of an inch
wide

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.060 

so<00:02:18.550> at<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.850> point<00:02:20.340> make<00:02:21.340> little<00:02:21.640> piles<00:02:21.880> with

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
so at this point make little piles with

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.650 
so at this point make little piles with
your<00:02:24.070> evenly<00:02:24.610> sliced<00:02:26.610> daikon

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.230 

and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.950> are<00:02:31.070> going<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.460> slice<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:31.910> into

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
and then we are going to slice it into

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.720 
and then we are going to slice it into
thin<00:02:32.390> strips<00:02:35.650> once<00:02:36.650> again<00:02:36.950> about<00:02:37.400> an<00:02:37.580> eighth

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
thin strips once again about an eighth

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.000 
thin strips once again about an eighth
of<00:02:37.910> an<00:02:38.060> inch<00:02:38.150> wide<00:02:39.820> if<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.030> have<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.210> mandolin

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
of an inch wide if you have a mandolin

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.390 
of an inch wide if you have a mandolin
you<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.190> also<00:02:43.340> use<00:02:43.760> that<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.410> might<00:02:45.650> speed

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
you can also use that and it might speed

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.460 
you can also use that and it might speed
up<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.670> process<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> little<00:02:47.360> bit<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:51.140> so<00:02:51.290> now<00:02:51.440> I

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
up the process a little bit and so now I

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.610 
up the process a little bit and so now I
have<00:02:51.680> some<00:02:51.890> nice<00:02:52.070> even<00:02:52.850> strips<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:54.380> I'm<00:02:54.440> going

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
have some nice even strips and I'm going

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.890 
have some nice even strips and I'm going
to<00:02:54.650> pop<00:02:54.830> those<00:02:55.040> into<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.580> large<00:02:56.240> mixing<00:02:56.660> bowl

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.510 

now<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:02:59.960> going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.260> add<00:03:00.380> some<00:03:00.650> yellow<00:03:01.160> pepper

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
now I'm going to add some yellow pepper

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.650 
now I'm going to add some yellow pepper
for<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> bit<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.810> color<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:05.090> I'm<00:03:05.150> simply<00:03:05.450> going

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
for a bit of color so I'm simply going

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:16.650 
for a bit of color so I'm simply going
to<00:03:05.780> cut<00:03:06.200> that<00:03:06.320> in<00:03:06.380> half<00:03:10.150> take<00:03:11.150> out<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:12.790> decor

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.230 

cut<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.780> into<00:03:17.900> quarters<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.820> then<00:03:19.820> I'm<00:03:19.910> going

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.520 
cut it into quarters and then I'm going
to<00:03:20.450> because<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.110> want<00:03:21.320> nice<00:03:21.650> thin<00:03:21.980> slices<00:03:23.530> crush

and they were removed carefully some of
that<00:04:06.860> inner<00:04:07.070> pitch

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.689 

if<00:04:15.689> you<00:04:15.870> didn't<00:04:16.109> want<00:04:16.229> to<00:04:16.259> remove<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.829> pit<00:04:17.039> it

if you didn't want to remove the pit it

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.370 
if you didn't want to remove the pit it
would<00:04:17.880> be<00:04:18.030> fine<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.660> wouldn't<00:04:18.900> affect<00:04:19.289> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
would be fine and it wouldn't affect the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.860 
would be fine and it wouldn't affect the
flavor<00:04:19.650> too<00:04:20.009> much<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.269> much<00:04:21.449> nicer<00:04:21.720> for

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
flavor too much it's just much nicer for

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.950 
flavor too much it's just much nicer for
presentation<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:24.210> at<00:04:24.300> this<00:04:24.419> time<00:04:24.660> I'm<00:04:24.930> going

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
presentation so at this time I'm going

presentation so at this time I'm going
to<00:04:25.320> stir<00:04:25.949> the<00:04:26.630> dressing<00:04:27.630> again<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.910> just<00:04:29.910> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
to stir the dressing again and just to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.360 
to stir the dressing again and just to
keep<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.389> sugar<00:04:30.810> from<00:04:31.110> settling<00:04:31.919> too<00:04:32.190> much

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
keep that sugar from settling too much

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.909 
keep that sugar from settling too much
in<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.669> bottom<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:34.400> still<00:04:35.400> bowl<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.919> it's

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
in the bottom of the still bowl and it's

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.909 
in the bottom of the still bowl and it's
about<00:04:38.639> 90%<00:04:39.000> resolved<00:04:39.870> I'm<00:04:40.500> also<00:04:40.620> going<00:04:40.860> to

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
about 90% resolved I'm also going to

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.340 
about 90% resolved I'm also going to
slice<00:04:41.220> some<00:04:41.430> scallions<00:04:42.090> and<00:04:42.300> that's<00:04:43.080> going<00:04:43.289> to

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
slice some scallions and that's going to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.320 
slice some scallions and that's going to
give<00:04:43.470> us<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.650> little<00:04:43.770> bit<00:04:43.979> of<00:04:44.100> color<00:04:44.340> we're<00:04:45.210> not

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330

the<00:04:47.280> end<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.729> marination<00:04:48.090> process<00:04:49.009> it's

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
the end of the marination process it's

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.360 
the end of the marination process it's
nice<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.430> slice<00:04:50.669> these<00:04:50.940> just<00:04:51.300> on<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.449> bias<00:04:52.370> for

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
nice to slice these just on a bias for

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.480 
nice to slice these just on a bias for
presentation<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:57.030> really<00:04:57.240> only<00:04:57.389> want<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.660> use

most of the green parts and just a
little<00:05:01.020> bit<00:05:01.229> of<00:05:01.349> the<00:05:01.410> white<00:05:01.620> parts<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.900> onion

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
little bit of the white parts the onion

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.620 
little bit of the white parts the onion
flavor<00:05:04.500> stands<00:05:05.039> up<00:05:05.130> really<00:05:05.580> really<00:05:05.820> nicely<00:05:06.090> to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
flavor stands up really really nicely to

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.219 
flavor stands up really really nicely to
the<00:05:06.750> daikon<00:05:07.229> radish<00:05:10.070> now<00:05:11.070> we're<00:05:11.250> going<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.490> mix

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
the daikon radish now we're going to mix

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.490 
the daikon radish now we're going to mix
the<00:05:13.229> vegetables<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:15.419> vinaigrette<00:05:16.229> or

the vegetables and the vinaigrette or
dressing<00:05:19.550> using<00:05:20.550> some<00:05:20.909> tongs<00:05:21.120> just<00:05:21.360> toss<00:05:21.780> that

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
dressing using some tongs just toss that

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.100 
dressing using some tongs just toss that
around<00:05:22.110> now<00:05:23.570> vinegar<00:05:24.710> is<00:05:25.710> going<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.070> begin<00:05:26.400> to

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
around now vinegar is going to begin to

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.070 
around now vinegar is going to begin to
essentially<00:05:28.110> cook<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:29.340> radish<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:30.080> it's

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
essentially cook the radish and it's

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.129 
essentially cook the radish and it's
going<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.289> soften<00:05:31.500> up<00:05:32.210> what<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.300> may<00:05:33.449> notice<00:05:33.870> I

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
going to soften up what you may notice I

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.800 
going to soften up what you may notice I
said<00:05:34.979> it<00:05:35.490> might<00:05:35.699> give<00:05:35.909> off<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> little<00:05:36.360> bit<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.690> a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
said it might give off a little bit of a

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.960 
said it might give off a little bit of a
smell<00:05:37.760> like<00:05:38.760> eggs<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:40.680> that's<00:05:41.280> because<00:05:41.669> the

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
smell like eggs and that's because the

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.290 
smell like eggs and that's because the
vinegar<00:05:42.720> is<00:05:43.110> denaturing<00:05:43.919> the<00:05:44.039> cells<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:45.150> it

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
vinegar is denaturing the cells and it

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.330 
vinegar is denaturing the cells and it
releases<00:05:45.630> compounds<00:05:46.500> that<00:05:47.099> include<00:05:47.460> sulfur

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.920 

so<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:50.850> can<00:05:51.090> tell<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.300> these<00:05:51.570> are<00:05:51.780> already

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730
