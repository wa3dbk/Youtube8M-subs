 It is the first of two days It is the first time or yes yes so we are beginning 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.900

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.900
 Thank you very much 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.120
 Do for sports 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.270
 There is also a pole for aggressive 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.610
 It is said that it is easy to use even for the first time today 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.610
 We used pole of rifen dance dance 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.730
 First adjust the length 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:57.740
 Yes have been a little disturbed this form with it in the house 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.200
 It is how to match the length 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.900
 First of all yeah 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 It is seen and opened upper one 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.340
 I do not go either towards the bottom in the right hand 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.010
 It is a good story if you and the fans 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.909
 If I challenge you call 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.490
 Stretched out 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.870
 Then I say it will stop 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.080
 I hope that only two races will be extended to that extent to some extent 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.140
 Te Gurippu' 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 ather 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.980
 A pen clip at the height of lies 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.430
 I was in 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.960
 Please also look at the length and yen sales 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.960
 I've been doing the is in my case 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.370
 It is a centimeter 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.620
 More than 100 people a day 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.620
 There was the opposite earlier this time 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.720
 I think so much 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.230
 We want to firm 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230
 Once a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 ni 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.620
 Our length is height multiplied by 0.63 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 A little than the elbow right angle when you got to with the pole 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.050
 Let's adjust the length to the extent that the fist falls 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.629
 Tei doing Japan 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 Masu entered Tei 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.840
 New pot 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.840
 Its is chosen by the earlier 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.150
 I do not think the app mountain 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.240
 But not a bought Kaiserslautern So yeah 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.150
 A 3 t 2 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.580
 It is a grip 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.010
 Well, let's have some wings so that this is the outside 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:05.440
 We received your feed There is a display in the fact that the right and left and pull each 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.440
 You loose the magic belt a little while 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.380
 Let me get a little old 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.380
 With the right hand I want to see the grip 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.800
 Lightly because s trap is okay with loosened in Yes 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.670
 Don't close 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.670
 Leaving 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.300
 It is how to enter, but with the middle finger 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.900
 3 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.490
 And thumb up 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.400
 It is on 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.360
 I entered and grabbed it as well 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.360
 Country control 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.760
 Yes this is 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.790
 If the grip continues to hold firmly, blood flow will stop 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.269
 It will cause swelling 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.810
 To relax and disconnect as much as possible force 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.810
 Let's cut into 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.090
 Well then 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.090
 It took first what I encounter 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.780
 is inside 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.780
 As always 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.310
 Tomorrow and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.370
 Failure I but 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.720
 Let's follow the vertical 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:38.430
 But I felt like I walked 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:43.160
 It is easy to walk by oneself by attaching a slant and adjusting the length afterward 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.160
 Please grab an image of the hand after here 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.730
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.490
 I think I entered 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.300
 No cold war 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.199
 Contains 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.199
 It does not contain 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.470
 Only because it uses the unknown indication 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.450
 I will do it 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.450
 This is 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.120
 I'm Jack
