about soundproofing we really have to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.630 
about soundproofing we really have to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sound dampening however this doesn't

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.420 
sound dampening however this doesn't
catch<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.090> low<00:01:39.299> frequencies<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.350> your<00:01:41.159> base

catch the low frequencies or your base
and<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.630> Rock's<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.200> safe<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.649> sound

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and this is a Rock's all safe and sound

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.670 
and this is a Rock's all safe and sound
can<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.490> help<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:45.149> adding<00:01:45.450> density<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
can really help by adding density to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.130 
can really help by adding density to
your<00:01:46.860> wall<00:01:47.100> by<00:01:47.820> installing<00:01:48.299> rocks<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:48.930> safe

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
your wall by installing rocks all safe

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.710 
your wall by installing rocks all safe
and<00:01:49.320> sound<00:01:49.759> doubling<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:51.030> your<00:01:51.180> wall<00:01:51.420> on

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and sound doubling up on your wall on

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.980 
and sound doubling up on your wall on
your<00:01:52.500> drywall<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.780> take

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
your drywall this is where you can take

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.319 
your drywall this is where you can take
care<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.409> both<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.399> high<00:01:56.579> frequencies<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
care of both the high frequencies and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.380 
care of both the high frequencies and
the<00:01:57.630> low<00:01:57.750> frequencies<00:01:58.759> so<00:01:59.759> there's<00:01:59.969> two<00:02:00.149> types

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the low frequencies so there's two types

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
the low frequencies so there's two types
of<00:02:00.600> noises<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.409> want<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> talk<00:02:01.860> about

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
of noises that we want to talk about

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
of noises that we want to talk about
there's<00:02:02.759> airborne<00:02:03.390> noise<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.930> there's

noise which is impact noise impact noise
is<00:03:33.060> things<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:34.170> when<00:03:35.130> you're<00:03:35.250> moving<00:03:35.459> around

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
is things like when you're moving around

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.759 
is things like when you're moving around
furniture<00:03:36.209> when<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> drop<00:03:37.080> something<00:03:37.410> on<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
furniture when you drop something on the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.180 
furniture when you drop something on the
floor<00:03:38.480> this<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.720> impact<00:03:40.320> noise<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.860> we<00:03:41.040> can

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
floor this is impact noise and we can

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.670 
floor this is impact noise and we can
highly<00:03:41.519> reduce<00:03:41.910> this<00:03:42.209> by<00:03:42.900> using<00:03:43.170> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
highly reduce this by using the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.890 
highly reduce this by using the
resilient<00:03:44.250> channel<00:03:44.489> now<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.299> resilient

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
resilient channel now the resilient

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.820 
resilient channel now the resilient
channel<00:03:46.140> is<00:03:46.470> installed<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:48.600> acts<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:49.799> a

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
channel is installed it acts like a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.120 
channel is installed it acts like a
shock<00:03:50.310> absorber<00:03:51.410> decoupling<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.470> wall<00:03:52.799> to

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
shock absorber decoupling the wall to

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.880 
shock absorber decoupling the wall to
allow<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:54.630> impact<00:03:55.049> noise<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.530> not<00:03:55.650> travel

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
allow the impact noise to not travel

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.280 
allow the impact noise to not travel
through<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:57.239> we<00:03:57.330> install<00:03:57.600> our<00:03:57.959> drywall

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
through it then we install our drywall

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.880 
through it then we install our drywall
on<00:03:58.680> top<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.840> let<00:04:01.380> me<00:04:01.470> show<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.650> now<00:04:01.769> how

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
on top of it so let me show you now how

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.880 
on top of it so let me show you now how

do<00:04:08.489> first<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.910> all<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.269> make<00:04:09.600> sure<00:04:09.630> that<00:04:09.840> we're

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
do first of all is make sure that we're

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.979 
do first of all is make sure that we're
installing<00:04:10.620> them<00:04:10.950> horizontally<00:04:11.720> I've<00:04:12.720> made<00:04:12.959> a

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
installing them horizontally I've made a

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.120 
installing them horizontally I've made a
mark<00:04:13.320> here<00:04:13.530> already

let's go ahead and do that part of it

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.399 
let's go ahead and do that part of it
install<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.989> using<00:04:22.860> some<00:04:23.070> screws

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:26.409 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:28.869 

once<00:04:27.409> we've<00:04:27.590> installed<00:04:27.949> a<00:04:28.159> resilient<00:04:28.639> channel

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
once we've installed a resilient channel

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:35.100 
once we've installed a resilient channel
we<00:04:29.539> can<00:04:29.689> go<00:04:29.810> ahead<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.229> install<00:04:30.439> the<00:04:30.710> drywall

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.080 

now<00:04:36.110> when<00:04:36.439> installing<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:37.009> drywall<00:04:37.490> it's

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
now when installing the drywall it's

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.980 
now when installing the drywall it's
important<00:04:38.689> to<00:04:39.349> not<00:04:40.039> install<00:04:40.969> it<00:04:41.180> into<00:04:41.389> the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
important to not install it into the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:49.119 
important to not install it into the
studs<00:04:42.439> but<00:04:43.340> in<00:04:43.490> between<00:04:47.650> because<00:04:48.650> what<00:04:49.009> we're

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
studs but in between because what we're

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.550 
studs but in between because what we're
creating<00:04:49.310> there<00:04:53.080> because<00:04:54.080> now<00:04:54.229> what<00:04:54.409> we've

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
creating there because now what we've

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.730 
creating there because now what we've
created<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:55.159> a<00:04:55.400> floating<00:04:55.969> wall

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
created is a floating wall

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.559 
created is a floating wall
okay<00:04:57.740> so<00:04:57.800> we've<00:04:58.069> installed<00:04:58.430> our<00:04:58.729> resilient

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
okay so we've installed our resilient

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.869 
okay so we've installed our resilient
channel<00:04:59.810> we've<00:05:00.469> installed<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.039> horizontally

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879 
channel we've installed it horizontally

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.110 
channel we've installed it horizontally
24<00:05:02.779> inches<00:05:03.080> from<00:05:03.349> one<00:05:03.500> another<00:05:03.830> and<00:05:04.120> we've

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
24 inches from one another and we've

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.950 
24 inches from one another and we've
installed<00:05:05.479> our<00:05:05.779> first<00:05:06.139> layer<00:05:06.439> of<00:05:06.770> drywall

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
installed our first layer of drywall

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.809 
installed our first layer of drywall
also<00:05:08.960> horizontally<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.099> we've<00:05:10.580> made<00:05:10.789> sure

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
also horizontally and we've made sure

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.080 
also horizontally and we've made sure
that<00:05:11.210> we've<00:05:11.389> screwed<00:05:11.840> not<00:05:12.740> where<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.610> stud<00:05:13.909> is

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
that we've screwed not where the stud is

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.329 
that we've screwed not where the stud is
but<00:05:14.779> into<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.259> resilient<00:05:15.770> channel<00:05:15.979> between

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:16.339 
but into the resilient channel between

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:22.420 
but into the resilient channel between
the<00:05:16.639> studs<00:05:17.089> now<00:05:17.870> what<00:05:18.080> we're<00:05:18.199> going<00:05:18.379> to<00:05:18.469> do<00:05:21.430> is

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
the studs now what we're going to do is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.920 
the studs now what we're going to do is
put<00:05:22.999> in<00:05:23.120> our<00:05:23.210> second<00:05:24.169> layer<00:05:24.319> of<00:05:24.650> drywall<00:05:25.460> over

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
put in our second layer of drywall over

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.980 
put in our second layer of drywall over
lapping<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.229> seams<00:05:27.529> and<00:05:28.300> again<00:05:29.300> making<00:05:29.569> sure

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
lapping the seams and again making sure

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.829 
lapping the seams and again making sure
that<00:05:30.560> we<00:05:30.770> screw<00:05:31.069> the<00:05:31.490> second<00:05:31.969> layer<00:05:32.629> of

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
that we screw the second layer of

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.040 
that we screw the second layer of
drywall<00:05:33.080> vertically<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:34.509> again<00:05:35.509> into<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
drywall vertically and again into the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.589 
drywall vertically and again into the

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
resilient channel not the studs so we've

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.719 
resilient channel not the studs so we've
added<00:05:38.719> a<00:05:39.020> second<00:05:39.439> layer<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.589> drywall<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:40.430> a
