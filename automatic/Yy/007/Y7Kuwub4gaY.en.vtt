00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.300 
let's correct that the easiest way to
make<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.390> correction<00:02:23.840> is<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:24.950> drag<00:02:25.250> your

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
make a correction is to just drag your

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.250 
make a correction is to just drag your
finger<00:02:25.640> through<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.090> word<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.959> scratch<00:02:27.230> it

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
finger through the word to scratch it

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.309 
finger through the word to scratch it
out<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.769> start<00:02:28.040> again<00:02:28.690> that's<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:29.959> one<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
out and start again that's just one of

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.800 
out and start again that's just one of
several<00:02:30.349> scratch<00:02:31.099> out<00:02:31.340> gestures<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.360> can<00:02:32.540> use

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
several scratch out gestures you can use

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.979 
several scratch out gestures you can use
for<00:02:33.680> example<00:02:34.160> another<00:02:34.849> is<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.150> draw<00:02:35.480> a<00:02:35.510> large<00:02:35.720> M

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
for example another is to draw a large M

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.280 
for example another is to draw a large M
shape<00:02:36.379> over<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.920> entire<00:02:37.190> text<00:02:37.780> now<00:02:38.780> let's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
shape over the entire text now let's

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.660 
shape over the entire text now let's
look<00:02:39.500> at<00:02:39.620> another<00:02:39.769> way<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.430> correct

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
look at another way you can correct

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.660 
look at another way you can correct
mistakes<00:02:41.019> for<00:02:42.019> example<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:43.190> if<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.400> wanted

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
mistakes for example what if you wanted

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.370 
mistakes for example what if you wanted
to<00:02:43.790> meet<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.120> friend<00:02:44.269> Tom<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.930> have<00:02:45.079> coffee
