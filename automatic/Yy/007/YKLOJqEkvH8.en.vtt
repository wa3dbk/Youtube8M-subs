hey everybody its Jason blah here and
it's<00:00:10.320> time<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.590> part<00:00:11.099> two<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.880> Monday<00:00:12.179> Q<00:00:12.450> &amp;

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
it's time for part two of the Monday Q &amp;

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.900 
it's time for part two of the Monday Q &amp;
A<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:12.690> let's<00:00:13.049> do<00:00:13.349> it

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
A so let's do it

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.730 
A so let's do it
first<00:00:14.910> question<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.320> when<00:00:16.470> there<00:00:16.590> has

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
first question what to do when there has

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.920 
first question what to do when there has
been<00:00:16.770> zero<00:00:17.460> progress<00:00:17.699> made<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.119> certain<00:00:18.630> lists

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
been zero progress made on certain lists

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
been zero progress made on certain lists
ie<00:00:19.050> bench<00:00:19.380> squat<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.949> example<00:00:20.340> on<00:00:20.400> how<00:00:20.460> much

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
ie bench squat for example on how much

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
ie bench squat for example on how much
progression<00:00:21.300> should<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.630> see<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.170> often

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
progression should you see and how often

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.340 
progression should you see and how often
ie<00:00:22.830> increased<00:00:23.490> X<00:00:23.789> amount<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.210> pounds<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.930> squat

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
ie increased X amount of pounds on squat

few months or per month okay the problem
is<00:00:33.829> increasing<00:00:34.829> something<00:00:35.190> like<00:00:35.340> your

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is increasing something like your

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.160 
is increasing something like your
benchpress<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.239> depends<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.630> how<00:00:36.780> progress

it if you're more novice lifter you just

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
it if you're more novice lifter you just
need<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> add<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.229> weight<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.710> bar<00:01:10.860> if<00:01:11.369> it

need to add more weight to the bar if it
stagnates<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.600> add<00:01:12.720> more<00:01:13.020> weight<00:01:13.290> or

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700 
stagnates you need to add more weight or
you<00:01:13.650> need<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.830> do<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> micro<00:01:15.030> reset<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:16.320> reduce

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you need to do a micro reset just reduce

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.640 
you need to do a micro reset just reduce
slightly<00:01:17.840> change<00:01:18.840> reps<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.259> volume<00:01:19.500> just

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
slightly change reps or volume just

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.810 
slightly change reps or volume just
slightly<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.189> go<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> add<00:01:20.790> more

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
slightly and then go back and add more

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
slightly and then go back and add more
weight<00:01:21.000> ooh<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.299> week<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.689> two<00:01:21.840> later<00:01:21.869> something

weight and you'll get to a point to
where<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.549> need<00:01:32.850> an<00:01:33.409> advanced<00:01:34.409> training

be a year-long program as an advanced
lifter<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.329> you're<00:01:45.479> asking<00:01:45.840> how<00:01:45.930> to

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
lifter and it's if you're asking how to

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.499 
lifter and it's if you're asking how to
increase<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> you'll<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> follow<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
increase it you'll have to follow a

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.789 
increase it you'll have to follow a
protocol<00:01:48.509> designed<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.649> at

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
protocol designed to get you there at

protocol designed to get you there at
that<00:01:49.950> point<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.240> question<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.810> isn't

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that point so your question really isn't

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
that point so your question really isn't
straightforward<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.460> answer<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
straightforward the the answer is if you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.240 
straightforward the the answer is if you
need<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> increase<00:01:55.170> those<00:01:55.409> things<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.009> need

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
need to increase those things you need

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.850 
need to increase those things you need
to<00:01:56.460> obviously<00:01:57.180> probably<00:01:58.049> eat<00:01:58.229> more<00:01:58.259> calories

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to obviously probably eat more calories

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.760 
to obviously probably eat more calories

I<00:04:14.130> mean<00:04:14.370> if<00:04:14.459> you're<00:04:14.580> getting<00:04:14.850> shit-faced<00:04:15.269> two

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
I mean if you're getting shit-faced two

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.909 
I mean if you're getting shit-faced two
or<00:04:15.600> three<00:04:15.720> times<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:16.109> week<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.500> problem

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
or three times a week it's a problem

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.289 
or three times a week it's a problem
that<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.100> person<00:04:17.549> who<00:04:17.700> goes<00:04:17.850> out<00:04:18.120> drinking

because you're hungover or dehydrated

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.330 
because you're hungover or dehydrated
but<00:04:34.300> outside<00:04:34.600> of<00:04:34.660> that<00:04:34.930> at<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> end<00:04:36.160> of<00:04:36.250> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
day it's still just food and fuel

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.660 
day it's still just food and fuel

sources and its source of vitamins and

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.910 
sources and its source of vitamins and
minerals<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.570> it<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.780> what<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.080> is<00:04:41.260> all<00:04:41.890> right

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
minerals so it is what it is all right

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.940 
minerals so it is what it is all right

let's<00:04:56.620> say<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.770> change<00:04:57.100> your<00:04:57.250> program

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
let's say you change your program

let's say you change your program
slightly<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:58.210> go<00:04:58.360> on<00:04:58.450> a<00:04:58.510> deficit<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.170> a

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
slightly you go on a deficit and a
