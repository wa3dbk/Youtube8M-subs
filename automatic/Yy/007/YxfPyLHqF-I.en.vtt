00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.180
 that is to say, all today does that 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.890
 to train but the term to sanaa better 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.120
 is an arcade emulator 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.980
 that's it for arcade games when I 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.889
 go back in time the 80s 90 and 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.829
 I'm going to throw it all so let go of 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.990
 Rome on the game and yes the buttons 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.360
 the whole cycle starts as a game 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.830
 arcade and to find the roms I 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.600
 you would put a little link to 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.440
 Jerome what to play in time the games 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.190
 also fighter 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.510
 the seven fights of yesterday everything and that's it and 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.280
 for the masters it will be necessary that you 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.850
 plug your phone into the pc or 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.489
 put the card and in the end you 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.649
 go on the limiter mam the file and 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.089
 inside there is a rom file comes 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.940
 just put the games in the file 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.039
 rom here is very easy to do 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.300
 then there to throw it is the b you 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:53.079
 see it's market to press the b 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.539
 so we'll let her start here 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.539
 to put the photos to 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 so great as a guest problem 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 early enough of the nickel walking emulator 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.850
 it's a fair fight there it's fighter 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.990
 but it's the foot tile here 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.770
 to go out if it exists but you're ok 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 so here is the second 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.729
 here 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.750
 patience is sure 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.080
 sometimes it can happen that it starts 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.490
 not either it is blocked or is that 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.220
 emulator you have that there is a problem 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.080
 if here the csc walked it can happen 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.200
 but it's very rare 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.410
 it's a bowling game not reminiscent of the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.410
 louvre 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.300
 these symbols 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.490
 we do not love each other here to show it 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.930
 he walks nickel everything I'll put you 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.570
 the lines to look for him to go 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 look for the Roma who are going with I go 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.200
 will tell you more
