00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
my opinion on a comfortability of the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.940 
my opinion on a comfortability of the
shoe<00:02:13.270> i<00:02:13.300> think<00:02:13.660> that<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:13.900> comfortable<00:02:14.380> but<00:02:14.530> i

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
shoe i think that is comfortable but i

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
shoe i think that is comfortable but i
mean<00:02:15.070> at<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> end<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.670> day<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.850> think

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
mean at the end of the day I think

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.300 
mean at the end of the day I think
people<00:02:16.480> are<00:02:16.810> saying<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.650> comfortable<00:02:18.100> just

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
people are saying it's comfortable just

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.040 
people are saying it's comfortable just
because<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.610> fact<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.360> upper<00:02:19.870> is

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
because of the fact that the upper is

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.220 
because of the fact that the upper is
really<00:02:20.470> nothing<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.330> nylon<00:02:22.960> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
really nothing it's just this nylon and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.720 
really nothing it's just this nylon and
just<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.530> your<00:02:23.710> foot<00:02:24.070> is<00:02:24.370> sitting<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:26.730> soul

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
just like your foot is sitting on a soul

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.520 
just like your foot is sitting on a soul
so<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.540> think<00:02:28.660> that's<00:02:29.050> why<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.230> lot<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.440> people

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
so I think that's why a lot of people

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.530 
so I think that's why a lot of people
are<00:02:29.800> saying<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.130> comfortable<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.730> mean<00:02:30.910> it's

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
are saying is comfortable I mean it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.650
