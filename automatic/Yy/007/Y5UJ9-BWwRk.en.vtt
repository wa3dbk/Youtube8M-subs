00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880 

it's<00:00:53.610> cutting<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.940> already<00:00:54.620> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.770> my

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
it's cutting out already this is my

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:14.890 
it's cutting out already this is my
guitar<00:00:56.040> clean<00:00:56.899> through<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.930> marvel

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.029 

on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> bridge<00:01:16.229> humbucker

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:30.450 

on<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.250> neck

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.980 

okay<00:01:31.460> this<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:31.940> what<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.180> pedal<00:01:32.450> sounds<00:01:32.810> like

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
okay this is what the pedal sounds like

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.640 
okay this is what the pedal sounds like
I've<00:01:33.320> got<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.090> level<00:01:35.300> at<00:01:35.630> five<00:01:36.050> the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
I've got the level at five the

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.340 
I've got the level at five the
distortion<00:01:37.190> at<00:01:37.340> ten<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.570> low<00:01:38.750> up<00:01:38.930> ten<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
distortion at ten the low up ten the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.469 
distortion at ten the low up ten the
high<00:01:39.500> at<00:01:39.650> ten<00:01:39.890> and<00:01:40.130> then<00:01:40.310> this<00:01:40.880> also<00:01:41.090> has<00:01:41.360> an

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
high at ten and then this also has an

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.330 
high at ten and then this also has an
enhanced<00:01:41.780> knob

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
enhanced knob

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.120 
enhanced knob
I'm<00:01:43.909> guessing<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:46.690> like<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:48.140> mid<00:01:48.590> frequency

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
I'm guessing it's like a mid frequency

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.240 
I'm guessing it's like a mid frequency
now<00:01:49.570> that's<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.979> sounds<00:01:51.979> like<00:01:52.040> to<00:01:52.220> me

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
now that's what it sounds like to me

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.270 
now that's what it sounds like to me
when<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.520> when<00:01:52.820> I<00:01:52.850> play<00:01:53.060> with<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:54.100> that's<00:01:55.100> what

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
when I when I play with it that's what

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.590 
when I when I play with it that's what
it<00:01:55.369> sounds<00:01:55.610> like<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.940> settings<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.330> have<00:01:56.360> it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
it sounds like on the settings I have it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:49.680 
it sounds like on the settings I have it
on<00:01:56.720> now

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.280 

it's<00:02:50.690> a<00:02:50.990> good<00:02:51.170> pedal<00:02:51.440> for<00:02:51.910> for<00:02:52.910> rock<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.990> to

things that doesn't money up your your
signal<00:03:57.870> like<00:03:58.080> much<00:03:58.710> like<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:59.400> metal<00:03:59.670> zone

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
signal like much like the metal zone

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.260 
signal like much like the metal zone
does<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.870> metal<00:04:01.020> zone<00:04:01.320> can<00:04:01.500> get<00:04:01.650> really<00:04:02.270> mucky

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
does the metal zone can get really mucky

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.710 
does the metal zone can get really mucky
if<00:04:03.360> you<00:04:03.570> turn<00:04:04.290> your<00:04:04.470> settings<00:04:04.770> up<00:04:04.890> too<00:04:05.010> high<00:04:05.190> on
