00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.359
 fundamental has been the relationship between

 Latin American theoretical studies

 action at the entrance of angel tram in that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320
 book whose branches try to clarify and 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.420
 review certain postures that bouquet had 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.269

 literature of the late 19th century the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.630
 image of martyr as a literary politician 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.700
 and intellectual 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.399
 that particular historical moment and 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.110
 analysis that has closed around the 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.509
 literary production and status 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.270

 force against dominant helps 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.759
 build a new base category and 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.560
 of speech that complete the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.140
 spaces of Creole city and city of

 another established by ramón as 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.579
 you can consider that branch and beautiful and 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.130
 martyr rolled are part of the same 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 category of lawyer to elucidate this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.939
 question ramos makes a tour 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.649
 historical perspective of the 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.380
 literary discourses of follow - up and 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.780
 beautiful these two analyzes settle 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.759
 on two props that will make up the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
 that this critic will then name the 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.689
 republic of the letters according to branches 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.270
 Sarmiento focuses on construction 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.700
 of knowledge of the other states that the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.560
 Argentine author opens the possibility for 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.049
 that the other finds a place within 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.610
 the national expression however this 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.619
 another is treated by the rules 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.190
 civilizing to found an idea of 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.350
 nation 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.540
 that is, despite the fact that the appropriation 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.250
 of the voice of the other allows his listening 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.980
 this they listen within the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.540
 stereotyping is subordinated to 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.900
 dichotomy between civilization and barbarism 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.640
 the nominative act of the barbarian 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.740
 constitutes an appropriation of the other 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.450
 does not take place within the letter as 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180
 real entity but as a cultural entity 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.940
 on the other hand the second strut for 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.250
 this analysis arises andré beautiful for 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.350
 beautiful bouquets speech focuses on 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 the political power of letters to know 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.460
 write correctly equals the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.160
 ability to clearly build the 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.350
 state laws therefore give a 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
 order to the idea of nation state to its 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.370
 once the correct Hispanic language 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.660
 maintains continental unity and allows 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.490
 the constitution of the nascent 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.140
 nation projects 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.270
 these two struts become 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.120
 then in tools of power and 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.350
 domination of both the values 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.720
 metropolitans of the Hispanic and what 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.880
 civilized as of the values ​​of the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.950
 fledgling creole society 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.260
 in relation to the constitution of the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.500
 society dominant letter is double 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.340
 Condition between sovereignty and subjugation 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.200
 internal contradiction within the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.240
 nation's discourse sustained by the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.650
 legal society of the time lead to 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.540
 ideological breakdown of the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.600
 republic of letters and the emergence 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.910
 of the intellectuals as the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.040
 19th century advances the apparent usefulness of 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.570
 the lyrics start to question 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.580
 As the technical division of the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.340
 knowledge demands a utility from the 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.840
 writing as science the letters that in 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.370
 a certain moment they were 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.530
 fundamental for the constitution of 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.120
 laws go to a secondary level in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.610
 how law schools are 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.470
 autonomizes the letters in this way 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.860
 claim a place within society 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.780
 according to the place where the letters 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.150
 is in its broadest space is 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.680
 in the press this puts the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.080
 intellectuals in situation of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.870
 co-responsible cabinet members or 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.790
 diplomats this way you start to build 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.120
 a double and contradictory situation 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.790
 within the intellectual branches assume that 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.370
 the intellectual as a network or a darío silva and 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.500
 others assumes a literary position in the 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.540
 what the literary journalistic content 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.940
 it is politically correct 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.890
 as escapist or informative and 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.180
 obeys a status quo of the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.049
 informative disclosure of 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.629
 newspapers 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.220
 on the other hand it also indicates that after 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:26.830
 its form evidences an act 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.740
 revolutionary if well in the intellectual 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.270
 the content of his work is part of 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.449
 the culture of informative consumption 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.030
 cosmopolitan exorcist his form makes 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:39.310
 part of a clear act of rebellion 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.750
 evidenced in the language 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.580
 as the point of origin of this condition 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.979
 intellectual to the processes 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:48.150
 Cuban independentists incarnated in 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.150
 the figure of exhibition martín 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.060
 Cuba as the last colony of the empire 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.460
 Spanish my colonial priority of the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.370
 the USA was in a situation with 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.930
 full in the social and political 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.810
 martínez and describe from exile 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.900
 and that's where due to two emergencies 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.940
 one the capture of one audience and the other 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.190
 the denunciation of political problems and 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.770
 Colonial of America assumes the position 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.630
 of correspondent in this position 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.940
 the poet acquires a concern for 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.100
 the way that beyond his trade 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.280
 informative to stimulate the act 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.440
 revolutionary so for bouquets this 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.900
 posture added to the prevention against 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.960
 a second almost invisible conquest of 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.270
 part of the USA generates in it a 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.400
 extremely valuable and complete position 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.620
 It is due this second colonization of 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.060
 territory is no longer the military but in 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.090
 the cultural and under the slogan 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.550
 civilizing that following bouquets 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.860
 American authors should appeal to the 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.690
 baricco place of our cam that 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.060
 barbaric is conceived as a renewal 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.250
 of the Hispanic language a rejection of the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.960
 learned notion can speak such 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.090
 exercise can be evidenced in the 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.100
 martín tests in which it assumes 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.840
 a new one is popular as well as in the 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.210
 darío tests in which the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.820
 language is renewed in its phonetics in the 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.740
 and richards in the Chilean game to this 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.900
 work indicates that the integration of 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.580
 journalistic system regards a 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.140
 autonomy of the letters that the 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.960
 verbal renewal as an act 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.970
 revolutionary make the intellectual a 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.060
 counterpart of the lawyer and therefore 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:22.800
 a counter dominance figure is 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.690
 against dominance min to unity 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.870
 lawyer and offers a space of 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.880
 empowerment to other speeches still 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.160
 despite countering some speeches 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.080
 hegemonic must also assume that 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.550
 the intellectuals intend to exercise their 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.170
 own hegemony 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.330
 that is the point where we branch 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.850
 masterfully complements the book 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.290
 in the branch in the literate city bouquet it 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.630
 begins to take on new categories 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:47.520
 social and ideological 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.490
 illustrated against dominant knowing how to say 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.520
 know the other useful for that I spell 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:55.320
 Literary of Latin America 'ramos a 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.240
 through his book offers the critic 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.760
 literary Latin American new 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.740
 work struts a look of sharp 

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.230
 and a key point for the constitution 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.820
 literary of a political state and a 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.430
 theoretical complement to a framework 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.140
 concrete historiographic finally its 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.390
 supports on the political issue and the 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.730
 literary are very useful to finish 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.590
 certain current situations and in turn 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:20.630
 to set up a retrospective 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.630
 criticism towards the literary past
