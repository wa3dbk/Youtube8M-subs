00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.350
 realistically in the construction market in the area 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.790
 quality is a lot of problems it is connected 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 so that the construction industry 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.690
 accumulates a few very much 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.320
 from technical technological processes 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.690
 that is, you need to be professionals and we 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.529
 This is a staff of professionals in difference 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 from other companies 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.910
 namely we have a project department 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 We have our own production, we 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 there are electrical and plumbing construction workers have 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.510
 we have a tendency that the state we have 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.279
 state turnover is not present in the state 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.260
 us people work with us constantly even 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.030
 since the founding of that is the brigade 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.040
 who here since opening which 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 we trained went on a business trip 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 specially that Moscow in Peter they 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.469
 I continue to work with you throughout 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.360
 many years because it feels too 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.670
 stability of the insured permanent 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
 orders we have almost no seasons 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.809
 season we have no crises no crises 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 People are constantly coming to us and the people who 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.559
 work with us constantly when working on 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.750
 construction market has a lot of problems 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 which we hear people see us 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.980
 There are situations when money comes in 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 took but did not start building either zack 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 does not finish construction on time either 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.989
 do not finish building either 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.299
 there are such situations that a person 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.090
 gave money and in general he was lost 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.820
 there is a lot of that market situation here 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 it's important to warn people of these all 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.140
 factors because back is already hard 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
 something can be returned to distinguish differently 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.040
 how many would be veiled but 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 you can distinguish first by 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.090
 reviews go to the finished object 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.009
 which they are currently building this moment 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.479
 take reviews and see china at all 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.970
 documents at least constituent 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.799
 see office see staff people 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.720
 usually face what they 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.670
 chasing the price ie all the problems 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.159
 due to the fact that they are somewhere something further 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
 slightly cheaper they started building and in 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 end up not getting that expected 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 the results that they would like later 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 start all finish modifying and already 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.509
 come and say we did it already 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.899
 more than even you read to us everything under 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.659
 key 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.670
 we don’t have one we think right away 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.560
 fully estimates man she completely 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.110
 open that is what he wants 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 get there and in it and consider later 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 happens situations come there not in another 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.350
 the company thought there is 300 thousand cheaper 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 would be 100 thousand cheaper ie they 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 take our estimates go some firm a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.610
 then it turns out that when at the conclusion 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.560
 contract or when 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.420
 yeah, they built a house that eventually 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.610
 they were not included in the price but this 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.310
 also did not include the cost when working with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.050
 we have people insured in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.850
 That plan that we do not take all the money a hundred 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.550
 percent for all construction ie 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.530
 we break in stages that is if he 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.840
 it is necessary to excavate first for the earth 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.360
 I paid for the work later 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.770
 aboveground part counted 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.350
 prepay did land part did 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.270
 it was considered then the roof then the facade and 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.340
 so all the stages for example if the house 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.350
 worth 3 million we do not ask him immediately 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.010
 one and a half or 2 let us start later 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.260
 build 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.400
 we all break down by stages 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.739
 works, that is, the client is completely 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.900
 insured throughout the whole 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.790
 the construction phase is often the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 common situation comes when 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.170
 to us man for example turned out in 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.500
 an average of 23 thousand rubles per square 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.860
 meter 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.989
 Well, respectively, the stage there part there 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.860
 10 percent foundation 10 percent then 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.900
 there is 15 different and it is divided into stages 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.910
 leaves him offering for example that is 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.239
 house 100 squares 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.310
 his cost is two million three hundred he 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.110
 goes to the organization he is offered 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.820
 let's we build for 2 million 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:24.220
 but the money immediately they give the money 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.780
 people start either not to break in 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.610
 their construction time or part 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.280
 will bring materials an hour will not bring 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.920
 Part of the finish time will not finish go 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.810
 have a rest somewhere then 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.019
 starts naseat on them and pity 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.220
 says that already all the terms we passed 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.650
 already the house should be 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.630
 stand a long time I did not settle in it already 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.640
 half a year has passed since he was supposed to surrender 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.709
 but in the end, people can not finish them 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.570
 because the money is already spent and 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.850
 they need to look for new customers to 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.549
 close this object first 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.500
 it turns out such a kind of pyramid on 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.239
 this object took the money but spent 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.180
 and that he finish him on it now 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.100
 other objects dial close first 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.320
 this object then look for money already on 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.239
 these objects for the subsequent ones here 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.850
 this is how it happens 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.829
 the most common problem with 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.500
 which we face either happen 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.570
 other situations 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.560
 the cost of the house is 2 300 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.750
 million home 100 squares 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.900
 people there prepay a million four hundred 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.840
 there gave them build build costs and not 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.760
 finish even for this amount and they us 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.669
 cause are asked to help them because not 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.650
 can neither wash the dishes get the money out 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.120
 people do not find the phone do not take either 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.090
 the organization of this office is no longer 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.030
 there are they already moved out and are planning 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.130
 finish this amount there yes there for 600 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.430
 thousand that is, they roughly represent 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.650
 the court itself is worth 2 million for 600 thousand 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.570
 here you can’t build many 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.070
 immortal many build without projects 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.570
 they can't even control everything 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.030
 construction stages at what stage 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.380
 how much money have I spent advising everyone 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.000
 handle only in normal 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.340
 organizations that have long been on the market 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.229
 which have a name which 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.750
 who can grab the show there 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.180
 ready objects of the house where they live 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.400
 already people a few years well, and generally worth 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.080
 think if a person can't you 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.150
 nowhere to sit down to speak now is not the season 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.639
 now we have nothing that people don't 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.710
 want there talking on this 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.310
 either or if they ask for a hundred 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.130
 percent 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.490
 payment having no projects no less 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.530
 their laugh that is just square meter 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.810
 as you thought in the carcass ashore and 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.210
 here is 23 thousand euros then meters and let's us 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.770
 you for twenty one will do only a hundred 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.280
 interest to pay here about it is necessary 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.280
 to think
