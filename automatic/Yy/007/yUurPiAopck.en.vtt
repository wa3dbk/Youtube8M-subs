00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.700
 great beauty and rising he has 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.560
 brought back into my guy in the form of 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:41.540
 triangle plus there's not some kind of 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.229
 customers to hide where are the customers I 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.210

 you will lose at the bar it's okay normal to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.360
 nine separating the current but getting 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.380
 cut absolutely nothing at all 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.440
 against when I make cakes with 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.750
 obama makes is very useful 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.010
 I'm tired of what it is 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.270
 that's so I have more salads and 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.290
 what are you doing janov if you 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.229
 think we guide our salads it 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.580
 is maybe ok okay so there 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.620
 it was the biggest disappointment of the month 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.240
 and the big return of Patrick to the circus 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.680
 are new numbers are going through the 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.389
 oven racks with tam on the right 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.120
 Patrick is back for the big 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.350
 amazing he's doing telekinesis 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.850
 but only on an oven door 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.870
 I have already done so much that the 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.419
 only thing I did not do is your peace 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.100
 must in a packet of sugar the hole the 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.360
 hole to little more regions as to as soon 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.860
 that I'm doing something that disappears you to 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.750
 all my travels so already end of this 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.800
 amazing cooking class and that's 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.880
 true that this game was really 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.900
 independent for the shot there was no 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.620
 a lot of content outside 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.640
 maybe a dlc 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.840
 I hope that now you all know 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.890
 how to cook a cake and you know 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.240
 as well as in both are 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.260
 already cooked areas so it is useful to 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.039
 the leather hérault we are in a 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.160
