so<00:00:03.169> today's<00:00:04.169> how<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> build<00:00:04.769> is<00:00:04.979> how<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> build

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
so today's how to build is how to build

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.930 
so today's how to build is how to build
a<00:00:05.669> cow<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.329> can<00:00:06.660> kick<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:08.010> this<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
a cow that can kick so this is the

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.629 
a cow that can kick so this is the
official<00:00:09.419> Lego<00:00:09.660> cow<00:00:10.080> which<00:00:11.070> i<00:00:11.250> think<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
official Lego cow which i think is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.390 
official Lego cow which i think is
pretty<00:00:12.120> awesome

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.019 

because<00:00:14.999> cows<00:00:15.240> are<00:00:15.480> cool<00:00:15.859> but<00:00:17.029> unfortunately

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
because cows are cool but unfortunately

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
because cows are cool but unfortunately
it's<00:00:18.390> legs<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:19.050> move<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.679> sometimes<00:00:20.359> you

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
it's legs don't move and sometimes you

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's legs don't move and sometimes you
need<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.539> cow<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.560> can<00:00:22.800> kick<00:00:23.099> over<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.429> lantern

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
need a cow that can kick over a lantern

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.529 
need a cow that can kick over a lantern
and<00:00:24.150> start<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> fire<00:00:25.170> or<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.550> kick<00:00:27.119> Molefi

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and start a fire or you know kick Molefi

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.230 
and start a fire or you know kick Molefi
O's<00:00:27.830> so<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:29.189> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.429> show<00:00:29.669> you<00:00:29.730> how<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
O's so I'm going to show you how to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.010 
O's so I'm going to show you how to
build<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.689> cow<00:00:30.900> here<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.270> this<00:00:36.270> cow<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.570> all

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
build this cow here so this cow is all

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.340 
build this cow here so this cow is all
held<00:00:37.350> together<00:00:37.530> by<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.310> one<00:00:38.670> 1<00:00:39.330> by<00:00:39.540> 6<00:00:39.870> plate

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
held together by this one 1 by 6 plate

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.670 
held together by this one 1 by 6 plate
and<00:00:41.120> you'll<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.540> important<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.080> is<00:00:43.320> in

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and you'll see how important this is in

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.520 
and you'll see how important this is in
a<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.760> we'll<00:00:44.940> start<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.240> the<00:00:45.450> back<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.990> 1

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
a bit so we'll start with the back a 1

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.840 
a bit so we'll start with the back a 1
by<00:00:46.710> 2<00:00:46.770> plate<00:00:47.930> jumper<00:00:48.930> plate<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:50.280> another

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
by 2 plate jumper plate then another

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.340 
by 2 plate jumper plate then another
jumper<00:00:51.360> plate<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.770> offset<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.350> I'll

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
jumper plate it's offset like that I'll

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.080 
jumper plate it's offset like that I'll
put<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.630> then<00:00:57.630> you<00:00:57.840> need<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.610> 1<00:00:59.610> by<00:00:59.850> 1

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
put it this way then you need a 1 by 1

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.319 
put it this way then you need a 1 by 1
plate<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:02.000> circle<00:01:03.000> holes<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.660> side

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
plate with the circle holes on the side

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:10.929 
plate with the circle holes on the side
then

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:21.780 

need<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:13.780> 1<00:01:14.780> by<00:01:14.960> 2<00:01:15.020> plate<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.740> white

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
followed by a hinge plate which I've

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.960 
followed by a hinge plate which I've
combined<00:01:29.180> a<00:01:29.390> black<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.110> white<00:01:30.320> one<00:01:30.970> kicking

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
combined a black and a white one kicking

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.730 
combined a black and a white one kicking
backwards<00:01:33.460> black<00:01:34.460> goes<00:01:34.850> there<00:01:35.360> and<00:01:35.710> put<00:01:36.710> a

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
one by one with a clip will be the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.780 
one by one with a clip will be the
others<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> just<00:02:21.640> hang<00:02:22.640> out

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
others but it's going to just hang out

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.449 
others but it's going to just hang out
there<00:02:22.850> for<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.390> second<00:02:24.130> connect<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.280> with<00:02:25.310> a

did<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.070> mention<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.579> cow<00:02:28.820> is<00:02:28.850> very<00:02:29.329> fragile

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
did I mention this cow is very fragile

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.210 
did I mention this cow is very fragile
it's<00:02:31.640> very<00:02:31.910> fragile<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:33.410> another<00:02:33.769> row<00:02:34.040> of

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
it's very fragile to another row of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.090 
it's very fragile to another row of
jumper<00:02:34.610> plates<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.989> then<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.709> we're

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
jumper plates and then going up we're

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.420 
jumper plates and then going up we're
going<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.280> do<00:02:40.459> one<00:02:40.730> jumper<00:02:41.150> plate<00:02:41.390> here<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:43.310> a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
going to do one jumper plate here with a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.170 
going to do one jumper plate here with a
one<00:02:43.670> by<00:02:43.850> one<00:02:44.060> black<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:44.600> top<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.610> then<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.640> 1<00:02:47.000> by

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
one by one black on top and then a 1 by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.870 
one by one black on top and then a 1 by
3<00:02:47.570> plate<00:02:47.780> across<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.680> we'll<00:02:49.459> leave<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.820> for

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
3 plate across here we'll leave that for

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.390 
3 plate across here we'll leave that for
a<00:02:50.120> while<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.600> reason<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.959> did<00:02:51.200> this<00:02:51.440> was

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
a while so the reason I did this was

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.720 
a while so the reason I did this was
because<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.700> wanted<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.090> mimic<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.730> spotting

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
because I wanted to mimic the spotting

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.949 
because I wanted to mimic the spotting
on<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.180> cow<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.049> get<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:58.120> this<00:02:59.120> shape<00:02:59.630> with

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
on the cow so to get the this shape with

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.380 
on the cow so to get the this shape with
black<00:03:00.410> plates<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.370> had<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.610> do<00:03:01.760> all<00:03:01.940> these<00:03:02.120> weird

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
black plates I had to do all these weird

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.110 
black plates I had to do all these weird
offsets<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:03.410> looks<00:03:04.280> like<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.519> mess<00:03:04.820> when<00:03:05.030> you

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
offsets so looks like a mess when you

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.970 
offsets so looks like a mess when you
look<00:03:05.269> at<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:05.720> angle<00:03:05.930> but<00:03:06.140> it'll

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
look at it from this angle but it'll

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.509 
look at it from this angle but it'll
look<00:03:07.130> fine<00:03:07.670> from<00:03:08.000> this<00:03:08.180> angle<00:03:10.870> then<00:03:11.870> over<00:03:12.140> here

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
look fine from this angle then over here

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.590 
look fine from this angle then over here
relatively<00:03:13.519> straightforward<00:03:14.150> build<00:03:14.360> for

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
relatively straightforward build for

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.280 
relatively straightforward build for
this<00:03:14.690> part<00:03:15.019> 1<00:03:15.890> by<00:03:16.070> 2<00:03:16.130> plate<00:03:17.290> 1<00:03:18.290> by<00:03:18.500> 2<00:03:18.560> brick

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
this part 1 by 2 plate 1 by 2 brick

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.920 
this part 1 by 2 plate 1 by 2 brick
a<00:03:22.140> one<00:03:23.140> by<00:03:23.519> well<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:25.000> corner<00:03:25.390> plate<00:03:25.599> is<00:03:25.750> going

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
a one by well the corner plate is going

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:36.500 
a one by well the corner plate is going
to<00:03:25.989> connect<00:03:26.349> that<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:30.930> here<00:03:33.450> going<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.510> have

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
to connect that and here going to have

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.349 
to connect that and here going to have
again<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.659> hinge<00:03:37.930> piece<00:03:38.230> but<00:03:38.700> flip<00:03:39.700> this<00:03:40.000> time

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
again the hinge piece but flip this time

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.420 
again the hinge piece but flip this time
so<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> piece<00:03:41.140> that<00:03:41.379> we<00:03:41.590> used<00:03:41.799> blackboard

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
so the piece that we used blackboard

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.629 
so the piece that we used blackboard
before<00:03:42.549> is<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:43.409> white<00:03:45.299> next<00:03:46.299> to<00:03:46.389> that<00:03:47.639> and

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
before is now white next to that and

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.809 
before is now white next to that and
actually<00:03:49.180> this<00:03:49.629> goes<00:03:49.900> right<00:03:50.139> here<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.609> is

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
actually this goes right here so this is

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.080 
actually this goes right here so this is
and<00:03:55.510> then<00:03:55.720> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.959> back<00:03:56.200> what<00:03:56.470> I<00:03:56.500> did<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.970> I

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and then on the back what I did was I

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.110 
and then on the back what I did was I
took<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.599> of<00:03:58.629> these<00:03:58.840> porn<00:03:59.319> pieces<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.970> the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
took one of these porn pieces in the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.809 
took one of these porn pieces in the
Islander<00:04:01.659> sets<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.400> they've<00:04:03.400> been<00:04:03.549> in<00:04:03.669> other

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
Islander sets and they've been in other

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:07.559 
Islander sets and they've been in other
sets<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.930> cut<00:04:05.230> off<00:04:05.379> part<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:07.269> stick

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
sets and I cut off part of it to stick

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.039 
sets and I cut off part of it to stick
in<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:08.319> to<00:04:08.769> round<00:04:09.010> out<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.939> butt<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.810> back

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
in here to round out the butt and back

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.189 
in here to round out the butt and back
of<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.290> cow<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> little<00:04:11.829> bit<00:04:12.010> and<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:15.310> of<00:04:15.430> these

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
of the cow a little bit and one of these

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.560 
of the cow a little bit and one of these
black<00:04:17.199> tooth<00:04:17.620> pieces<00:04:18.190> down<00:04:18.880> there<00:04:19.209> for<00:04:19.479> the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
black tooth pieces down there for the

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.950 
black tooth pieces down there for the
tail<00:04:20.639> because<00:04:21.639> again<00:04:22.030> that's<00:04:22.210> well<00:04:22.720> yeah

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
tail because again that's well yeah

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.450 
tail because again that's well yeah
that's<00:04:23.139> supposed<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.500> be<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.770> tail<00:04:24.009> of<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that's supposed to be the tail of the

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.779 
that's supposed to be the tail of the
cow<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:25.180> white<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.690> black<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.789> then

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789 
cow the white and the black and then

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.480 
cow the white and the black and then
this<00:04:28.599> was<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.810> cow<00:04:29.139> as<00:04:29.409> it<00:04:29.620> was<00:04:30.220> in<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
this was the cow as it was in the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.850 
this was the cow as it was in the
animation<00:04:31.030> because<00:04:31.360> when<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:31.780> kicked<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.740> was

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
animation because when it kicked it was

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.350 
animation because when it kicked it was
off-screen<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:33.639> I<00:04:33.669> didn't<00:04:33.880> have<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.090> build<00:04:34.270> a

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
off-screen so I didn't have to build a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.990 
off-screen so I didn't have to build a
head<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.770> mostly<00:04:36.099> I<00:04:36.190> just<00:04:36.400> sort<00:04:36.550> of<00:04:36.639> wanted<00:04:36.940> to

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
head and mostly I just sort of wanted to

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.820 
head and mostly I just sort of wanted to
look<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.449> cow<00:04:37.720> for<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:38.050> few<00:04:38.229> seconds<00:04:38.680> and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
look like a cow for a few seconds and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.969 
look like a cow for a few seconds and
have<00:04:39.010> a<00:04:39.039> kicking<00:04:39.430> leg<00:04:39.669> but<00:04:40.659> for<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:41.050> video<00:04:41.530> I

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
have a kicking leg but for this video I

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.659 
have a kicking leg but for this video I
built<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:42.880> head<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.570> can<00:04:43.659> actually<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.349> a

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
built a head so you can actually have a

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.560 
built a head so you can actually have a
full<00:04:45.669> kicking<00:04:46.120> cow<00:04:46.360> if<00:04:46.599> you<00:04:46.720> want<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
full kicking cow if you want so

with a hole through it that will work

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.680 
with a hole through it that will work
out<00:05:26.570> perfectly<00:05:26.630> for<00:05:27.440> the<00:05:27.530> eye<00:05:28.180> and<00:05:29.180> top<00:05:29.479> this

whole bit off with a 1 by 2 plate and
then<00:05:33.080> use<00:05:34.070> this<00:05:34.250> horn<00:05:34.639> piece<00:05:34.880> in<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.300> 2<00:05:36.370> that's

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
then use this horn piece in the 2 that's

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
looked at this way which works for

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.029 
looked at this way which works for
animation<00:05:53.440> and<00:05:56.229> you<00:05:57.229> know<00:05:57.320> I've<00:05:57.590> made<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.010> so

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
animation and you know I've made it so

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:06.430 
animation and you know I've made it so
all<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:58.400> legs<00:05:58.729> can<00:05:59.060> move<00:06:00.039> like<00:06:01.039> so<00:06:05.229> but<00:06:06.229> to

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
all the legs can move like so but to

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.500 
all the legs can move like so but to
stand<00:06:06.740> this<00:06:06.919> guy<00:06:07.039> app<00:06:07.370> whenever<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.000> had<00:06:08.330> him

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
stand this guy app whenever I had him

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.050 
stand this guy app whenever I had him
attached<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:09.139> something<00:06:09.560> and<00:06:10.370> put<00:06:10.639> head<00:06:10.850> like

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060

bricks<00:06:11.590> in<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.740> back<00:06:12.770> of<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.220> other<00:06:13.370> legs<00:06:13.810> and

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
bricks in the back of the other legs and

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.740 
bricks in the back of the other legs and
