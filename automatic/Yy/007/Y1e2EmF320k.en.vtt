what a square bore manifold looks like
in<00:00:45.340> case<00:00:45.460> you<00:00:45.579> do<00:00:45.730> have<00:00:45.760> one<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:47.770> look<00:00:47.920> like

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
in case you do have one they look like

in case you do have one they look like
this<00:00:48.250> and<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:49.180> course<00:00:49.210> the<00:00:49.480> gasket<00:00:49.870> fits<00:00:50.050> very

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
this and of course the gasket fits very

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.120 
this and of course the gasket fits very
nicely<00:00:53.430> now

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
nicely now

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.470

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
now we install the top gasket we're

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.380 
now we install the top gasket we're
up<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> carburetor<00:01:57.590> on<00:01:57.890> before<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.550> do<00:01:58.729> just

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
up the carburetor on before you do just

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.760 
up the carburetor on before you do just
kind<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.630> give<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.900> once-over<00:02:00.290> make<00:02:00.680> sure

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
kind of give it a once-over make sure

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.200 
kind of give it a once-over make sure
there's<00:02:00.950> no<00:02:01.010> packing<00:02:01.430> debris<00:02:01.700> inside<00:02:02.030> or

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
there's a vacuum port on the backside

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.740 
there's a vacuum port on the backside
now<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.159> front<00:02:07.430> side<00:02:07.580> is<00:02:07.700> for<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.060> PCV<00:02:08.509> valve

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
now the front side is for the PCV valve

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.530 
now the front side is for the PCV valve
the<00:02:09.140> back<00:02:09.319> side<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.800> for<00:02:10.009> power<00:02:10.520> brakes<00:02:10.910> now

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
the back side is for power brakes now

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.150 
the back side is for power brakes now
our<00:02:11.660> car<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.110> uses<00:02:12.500> power<00:02:12.680> brakes<00:02:12.920> coming

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
our car here uses power brakes coming

our car here uses power brakes coming
off<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.430> intake<00:02:13.730> manifold<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:14.270> we're<00:02:14.360> not

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
off the intake manifold so we're not

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.790 
off the intake manifold so we're not
going<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:14.600> be<00:02:14.690> using<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.080> port<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.620> want<00:02:15.680> to
