00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello today on how do we do 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.880
 I teach you to clean the sole 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.370
 of your oven so obviously I 'm going 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.580
 not be able to do all the video I'm going 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 do a before and after by this will be 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.109
 a little bit long is a little bit of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.210
 job 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.789
 simply you need for that it 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 must your ferr already be more or 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.130
 less hot not too huh but more or 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 less you need white vinegar 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.710
 classical approached ashton bridge 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.809
 then see is ccme buffers 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.130
 like that contrary to what we believe 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.989
 that does not rule by the way you can 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.170
 when you buy them you check 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.750
 although that does not solve the problem or 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.820
 anything it's done on purpose and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.000
 then obviously be careful to wipe 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.579
 then the principle 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.920
 the principle is simple to put 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 vinegar on the part to be cleaned then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 when you see staff things so there are 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:11.479
 training and alÃ¨s the bridge stuff 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.479
 give little heaps just like that 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.540
 so like that a little hot on May 8th 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 tendency to evaporate a little faster 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.840
 so men in green do not hesitate 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 looks and anyway it's an anti 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:36.060
 limestone so the limit it will get the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:40.620
 butchers your beautiful holes and rub them 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.620
 always ordering small rotations 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.230
 so I dolls five minutes and I 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.300
 you see again that's done about 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.910
 10 minutes that I never rubs said this 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:57.340
 would be easy you can see that my 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.869
 it has decreased in France worried 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.229
 by the way we can find her on the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:06.630
 dish I have more than to finish giving a 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:13.410
 last little shot then as always 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.410
 we give a little bit always in circles 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.540
 and finally we just give a little 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.090
 you can also be clothed 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.580
 anyway to finish it will be it will be 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.580
 a bib and vinegar 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.540
 so here we could still 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.590
 cleaner a little but hey it will work 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.940
 super good the best to avoid 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.640
 To rub too long is to do it 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.489
 as far as possible 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.750
 I hope it will serve you 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.080
 soon for new videos and 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.480
 especially do not forget to share his 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.519
 videos to everyone you know 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.519
