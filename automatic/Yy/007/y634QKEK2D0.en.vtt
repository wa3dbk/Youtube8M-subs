00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.510
 or farmers in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.760
 share the different tricks of 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.220
 saving light that I use at home not 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.750
 they serve both to save energy and 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.410
 so that the amount of our 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.410
 electricity bill 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.450
 do not contract more electrical power 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.800
 what are you going to need when 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.870
 put to charge your mobile or others 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.070
 appliances remember to unplug those from 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.070
 the light once charged 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.670
 if you use an electric air freshener 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.370
 something that I'm very good at are the 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.500
 programmers in this way you choose 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.660
 how often do you want it to be 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.220
 the air freshener in motion is a way of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.810
 prevent you from consuming energy 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.820
 throughout the day while you are 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.410
 plugged into the light these appliances 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.860
 programmers come in handy too 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.930
 for other appliances when 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.120
 I use the dishwasher I put the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.830
 full load if you put half load 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.230
 remember to select the program 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910
 suitable as I tell you I usually use 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.650
 the full load and the program that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.820
 I choose is the economic that saves 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.820
 energy and also water 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.900
 when I put the washing machine also soil 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.250
 put it full and I use 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.800
 energy class appliances and 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.690
 It is also important that the temperature 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.850
 be pulling cold and it is possible for you 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.680
 he consumes less and if you have a thermos 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.530
 electrical and you're going to go outside remember 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.810
 of unplugging the microwave always 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.670
 consumes less than the oven and if you have 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.960
 watch like mine you can unplug what 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.750
 of light and consumed will consume less 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.030
 something very important is to use the heat 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 residual take advantage of the residual heat of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.800
 the glass ceramic and very important 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 Also do not place hot containers 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.979
 On the fridge 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.170
 let them cool the express pot too 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.000
 is going to help you in the kitchen and the oven 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.940
 the less times we open it a lot 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.979
 better the freezer is important 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.750
 thaw it from time to time and not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.570
 open the fridge too many times to 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.550
 avoid a waste of energy if you go 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.170
 to go on vacation see all consuming 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.289
 the food you have and turn off the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.539
 fridge the air conditioning from 19 to 21 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.940
 degrees and very important to close the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.200
 windows and also the doors for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.390
 isolate it 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 both the TV and the radio if nobody 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.400
 pay attention the best is to turn them off and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 being there is very important consume 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040
 energy the low consumption lights and the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.590
 switch off and posts to save 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.930
 if nothing like winter covered with a 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.090
 blanket and put a candle so sure that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.090
 we save happy saving savers
