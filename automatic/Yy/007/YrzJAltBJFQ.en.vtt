clevis hitch which is going to give you

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.160 
clevis hitch which is going to give you
a<00:00:52.309> lot<00:00:52.550> more<00:00:52.790> strength<00:00:53.150> than<00:00:53.300> just<00:00:53.629> a<00:00:53.780> single

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
a lot more strength than just a single

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.200 
a lot more strength than just a single
pin<00:00:54.470> sticking<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.309> there<00:00:55.580> that<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:55.940> bend

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
pin sticking out there that you bend

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.479 
pin sticking out there that you bend
easily<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:57.410> easier<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:57.890> hook<00:00:58.129> up<00:00:58.370> because

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
easily so it's easier to hook up because

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.950 
easily so it's easier to hook up because
you<00:00:58.699> don't<00:00:58.879> have<00:00:59.030> to<00:00:59.239> readjust<00:00:59.510> your

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
you don't have to readjust your

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.500 
you don't have to readjust your
turnbuckles<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:00.949> your<00:01:01.070> stabilizers<00:01:01.909> it<00:01:02.390> will

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
turnbuckles and your stabilizers it will

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.020 
turnbuckles and your stabilizers it will
always<00:01:02.720> be<00:01:02.900> at<00:01:03.230> common<00:01:03.800> width<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.519> that's

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
always be at common width and that's

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.610 
always be at common width and that's

hole you have to take the bolt out move
it<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.560> top<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.460> way<00:01:34.670> we've<00:01:34.909> got<00:01:35.119> this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
it to the top the way we've got this

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.319 
it to the top the way we've got this
main<00:01:35.689> brace<00:01:36.049> in<00:01:36.380> here<00:01:36.710> which<00:01:37.030> indicates<00:01:38.030> the

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
main brace in here which indicates the

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.450 
main brace in here which indicates the
exact<00:01:38.750> angle<00:01:39.259> that<00:01:39.409> we<00:01:39.590> want<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:39.950> make<00:01:40.219> this

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
exact angle that we want to make this

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.600 
exact angle that we want to make this
right<00:01:40.840> it<00:01:41.840> has<00:01:42.020> plenty<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.530> strength<00:01:42.950> in<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.399> so

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
right it has plenty of strength in it so

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.969 
right it has plenty of strength in it so
it<00:01:43.759> isn't<00:01:44.090> going<00:01:44.119> to<00:01:44.299> matter<00:01:44.509> if<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.409> keep<00:01:45.770> it

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
it isn't going to matter if you keep it

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.069 
it isn't going to matter if you keep it
bolted<00:01:46.460> together<00:01:46.640> or<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.270> like<00:01:47.509> some<00:01:47.840> of<00:01:47.960> the

bolted together or not like some of the

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.749 
bolted together or not like some of the
smaller<00:01:48.229> implements<00:01:49.130> that<00:01:49.189> have<00:01:49.430> thinner

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
smaller implements that have thinner

holes<00:02:15.800> at<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.220> same<00:02:16.460> time<00:02:16.820> it's<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.930> fast

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
holes at the same time it's really fast

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080 
holes at the same time it's really fast
and<00:02:18.590> it's<00:02:18.740> really<00:02:18.950> accurate<00:02:19.250> where<00:02:19.730> all<00:02:19.880> your

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
and it's really accurate where all your

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.030 
and it's really accurate where all your
pins<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.630> everything<00:02:21.050> will<00:02:21.170> state<00:02:21.440> level<00:02:21.890> and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
pins and everything will state level and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.060 
pins and everything will state level and
lined<00:02:22.280> up<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:23.540> stands<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.170> we've<00:02:24.500> got<00:02:24.740> here

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
lined up the stands that we've got here

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.700 
lined up the stands that we've got here
pretty<00:02:25.340> neat<00:02:25.700> we<00:02:26.240> punch<00:02:26.600> two<00:02:26.930> holes<00:02:26.960> in<00:02:27.560> them

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
pretty neat we punch two holes in them

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.640 
pretty neat we punch two holes in them
right<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.180> bolt<00:02:29.750> them<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.200> and

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
right here so we can bolt them on and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.010 
right here so we can bolt them on and
leave<00:02:30.890> them<00:02:31.069> standing<00:02:31.340> up

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
leave them standing up

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.530 
leave them standing up
a little<00:02:32.380> bit<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.770> ship<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.610> and<00:02:33.910> then

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
a little bit and ship it to you and then

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.270 
a little bit and ship it to you and then
you'll<00:02:34.720> put<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.140> put<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.650> right<00:02:35.830> here<00:02:36.130> with

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you'll put it put it right here with

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640 
you'll put it put it right here with
your<00:02:36.460> locknuts<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.450> turn<00:02:38.170> me<00:02:38.290> around<00:02:38.380> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
your locknuts and turn me around a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
your locknuts and turn me around a
little<00:02:38.680> bit<00:02:38.980> more<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:40.180> put<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.420> side

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
little bit more see that we put a side

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.950 
little bit more see that we put a side
brace<00:02:41.110> in<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.680> for<00:02:41.920> strength<00:02:42.310> and<00:02:42.810> if<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
brace in here for strength and if you

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.010 
brace in here for strength and if you
can<00:02:44.140> see<00:02:44.380> right<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:44.650> there's<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.250> slot<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.570> if

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
can see right here there's a slot so if

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.720 
can see right here there's a slot so if
you<00:02:47.230> didn't<00:02:47.560> have<00:02:47.770> stands<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.580> other

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
you didn't have stands the other

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.430 
you didn't have stands the other
alternative<00:02:49.510> most<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.990> ones<00:02:50.200> I've<00:02:50.410> seen

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
alternative most of the ones I've seen

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.030 
alternative most of the ones I've seen
have<00:02:51.040> four<00:02:51.760> poles<00:02:52.180> post<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:53.830> this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
have four poles post on it because this

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400 
have four poles post on it because this
is<00:02:54.250> basically<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.910> wheel<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:56.050> it's<00:02:56.230> going<00:02:56.350> to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
is basically a wheel and it's going to

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.810 
is basically a wheel and it's going to
hit<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.920> head<00:02:56.950> if<00:02:57.280> you're<00:02:57.400> trying<00:02:57.700> to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
hit you in the head if you're trying to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.000 
hit you in the head if you're trying to
hook<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.150> up<00:02:58.300> without<00:02:58.570> some<00:02:58.990> type<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.290> stands

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
hook it up without some type of stands

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.860 
hook it up without some type of stands
so<00:03:00.490> instead<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.850> having<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.330> do<00:03:01.480> all<00:03:01.720> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
so instead of having to do all the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.380 
so instead of having to do all the
little<00:03:02.050> pins<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.770> raise<00:03:02.950> all<00:03:03.250> four<00:03:03.580> stands<00:03:03.940> on

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
little pins to raise all four stands on

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.540 
little pins to raise all four stands on
it<00:03:04.600> we've<00:03:05.230> done<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.770> where<00:03:05.950> when<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.310> pick

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
it we've done it to where when you pick

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.910 
it we've done it to where when you pick
this<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:06.820> with<00:03:07.180> your<00:03:07.330> tractor<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.800> gonna

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
this up with your tractor this is gonna

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.730 
this up with your tractor this is gonna
slide<00:03:09.370> down<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:10.060> these<00:03:10.180> slots<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:11.290> simply

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
slide down in these slots you simply

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.520 
slide down in these slots you simply
rotate<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.580> top<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.540> slides<00:03:13.930> back<00:03:14.110> in

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
rotate it to the top it slides back in

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.890 
rotate it to the top it slides back in
it<00:03:14.650> stands<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.850> can't<00:03:16.120> come<00:03:16.210> out<00:03:16.540> or<00:03:16.750> move

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
it stands and it can't come out or move

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.320 
it stands and it can't come out or move
it's<00:03:17.230> really<00:03:17.590> simple<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.610> works<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.120> best

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it's really simple it works the best

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.470 
it's really simple it works the best
holds<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.320> most<00:03:20.530> stable<00:03:21.060> now<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.240> is<00:03:22.450> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
holds it the most stable now this is a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.890 
holds it the most stable now this is a

block bearing here should last many many
years<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.620> reasonable<00:03:33.490> I'm<00:03:34.480> going<00:03:34.660> around

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
years it is reasonable I'm going around

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.180 
years it is reasonable I'm going around
to<00:03:35.020> the<00:03:35.050> back<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.140> can<00:03:38.320> see<00:03:38.650> that<00:03:38.830> all<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
to the back so you can see that all the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.860 
to the back so you can see that all the
edges<00:03:39.730> because<00:03:40.060> we're<00:03:40.300> cutting<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:40.840> a

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
edges because we're cutting it on a

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.370 
edges because we're cutting it on a
Whitney<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.590> which<00:03:41.770> is<00:03:41.950> just<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:42.430> easy<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:43.000> do

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
Whitney and which is just so easy to do

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.410 
Whitney and which is just so easy to do
all<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.590> edges<00:03:45.070> here<00:03:45.280> around<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.970> keeps<00:03:46.240> you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
all the edges here around it keeps you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.850 
all the edges here around it keeps you

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
good paint job painting it in-house in

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.449 
good paint job painting it in-house in
between<00:03:54.910> these<00:03:55.209> two<00:03:55.540> tubes<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:57.040> edge<00:03:57.430> here

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
between these two tubes this edge here

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.449 
between these two tubes this edge here
has<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.300> ninety<00:03:58.660> degree<00:03:58.959> Bend<00:03:58.990> on<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.830> so<00:04:00.310> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
has the ninety degree Bend on it so that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.210 
has the ninety degree Bend on it so that
pre<00:04:00.760> indicates<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.690> exact<00:04:02.080> width<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:02.860> we<00:04:02.890> can

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
pre indicates the exact width so we can

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.240 
pre indicates the exact width so we can
build<00:04:03.550> this<00:04:03.820> a<00:04:03.880> lot<00:04:04.270> faster<00:04:04.930> all<00:04:05.530> these<00:04:05.860> tubes

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
build this a lot faster all these tubes

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.090 
build this a lot faster all these tubes
are<00:04:06.550> cut<00:04:06.760> on<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.090> automatic<00:04:07.600> feed<00:04:08.020> saw<00:04:08.380> so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
are cut on the automatic feed saw so

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.680 
are cut on the automatic feed saw so
they're<00:04:09.250> cut<00:04:09.459> within<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.850> thousandth<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.570> an

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
they're cut within a thousandth of an

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.780 
they're cut within a thousandth of an
inch<00:04:10.840> every<00:04:11.200> time<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.040> it<00:04:12.400> just<00:04:12.580> makes

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
inch every time and it just makes

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.449 
inch every time and it just makes
everything<00:04:13.240> easier<00:04:14.140> quicker<00:04:14.530> and<00:04:14.950> better<00:04:15.130> for
