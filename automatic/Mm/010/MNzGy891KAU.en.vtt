00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
knife you never want to be in a long

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.480 
knife you never want to be in a long
open<00:01:57.810> area<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.469> something<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.189> because

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
open area or something like that because

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
open area or something like that because
you'll<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.090> gun<00:02:01.250> use<00:02:02.270> scenery<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.689> your

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you'll get out gun use scenery to your

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.800 
you'll get out gun use scenery to your
advantage<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.469> right<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:04.950> I'm

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
advantage like right here I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.359 
advantage like right here I'm
controlling<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.049> area<00:02:07.409> by<00:02:07.680> staying<00:02:08.099> hidden

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
controlling the area by staying hidden

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
controlling the area by staying hidden
forcing<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> enemy<00:02:09.509> to

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
forcing the enemy to

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.759 
forcing the enemy to
to<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> mistake<00:02:10.760> that's<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.910> big<00:02:12.500> aspect<00:02:13.500> of

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
to make a mistake that's a big aspect of

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.210 
to make a mistake that's a big aspect of
playing<00:02:14.010> with<00:02:14.160> shotguns<00:02:14.900> now<00:02:15.900> um<00:02:16.290> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
playing with shotguns now um the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.449 
playing with shotguns now um the
stakeout<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:18.750> by<00:02:19.019> far<00:02:19.230> my<00:02:19.349> favorite<00:02:19.709> since<00:02:20.250> I

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
stakeout is by far my favorite since I

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.759 
stakeout is by far my favorite since I
the<00:02:21.060> spaz<00:02:21.330> being<00:02:21.660> semi-automatic<00:02:22.440> doesn't

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the spaz being semi-automatic doesn't

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.670 
the spaz being semi-automatic doesn't
have<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> whole<00:02:23.099> lot<00:02:23.129> of<00:02:23.370> damage<00:02:23.550> Olympia<00:02:24.239> has<00:02:24.540> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
have a whole lot of damage Olympia has a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.470 
have a whole lot of damage Olympia has a
pretty<00:02:25.680> bad<00:02:25.769> damage<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.340> well<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.940> Olympia<00:02:27.420> is

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
pretty bad damage as well it Olympia is

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.039 
pretty bad damage as well it Olympia is
probably<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> worst<00:02:27.900> shotgun<00:02:28.610> um<00:02:29.810> because<00:02:30.810> it

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
probably the worst shotgun um because it

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.350 
probably the worst shotgun um because it
has<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.440> aspects<00:02:31.920> of<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.250> stakeout<00:02:33.090> just

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
has all the aspects of the stakeout just

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.430 
has all the aspects of the stakeout just
worse<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.819> I<00:02:35.819> never<00:02:36.239> really<00:02:36.540> used<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> HK<00:02:37.200> 10

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
worse and I never really used the HK 10

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.089 
worse and I never really used the HK 10

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
killstreaks uh not kill streaks shotguns
in<00:02:49.319> more<00:02:49.500> for<00:02:49.709> two<00:02:49.829> were<00:02:50.099> very<00:02:50.400> overpowered

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
in more for two were very overpowered

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.210 
in more for two were very overpowered
especially<00:02:51.480> for<00:02:51.630> being<00:02:51.720> secondaries<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
especially for being secondaries and I

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.360 
especially for being secondaries and I
think<00:02:53.569> what<00:02:54.569> track<00:02:54.900> did<00:02:55.140> was<00:02:55.709> they<00:02:55.920> looked<00:02:56.129> at

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
think what track did was they looked at

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.970 
think what track did was they looked at
that<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.819> they<00:02:57.390> said<00:02:57.629> oh<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.110> opie<00:02:58.650> we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
that and they said oh this is opie we

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.369 
that and they said oh this is opie we
got<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> nerf<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.819> think<00:03:00.690> they<00:03:00.810> nerf<00:03:00.989> did<00:03:01.230> too

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
got a nerf it I think they nerf did too

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.800 
got a nerf it I think they nerf did too
much<00:03:01.560> bringing<00:03:02.519> shotguns<00:03:02.940> back<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.329> primary

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
much bringing shotguns back to primary

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.400 
much bringing shotguns back to primary
and<00:03:03.989> still<00:03:04.200> having<00:03:04.500> them<00:03:04.620> this<00:03:04.799> bad<00:03:06.230> wasn't<00:03:07.230> a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
and still having them this bad wasn't a

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.339 
and still having them this bad wasn't a
good<00:03:07.560> idea<00:03:07.590> shotguns<00:03:08.489> are<00:03:08.610> supposed<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.090> a

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
good idea shotguns are supposed to be a

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.220 
good idea shotguns are supposed to be a
close-range<00:03:11.239> dominant<00:03:12.239> weapons<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.900> they

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
close-range dominant weapons and they

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.050 
close-range dominant weapons and they
just<00:03:13.379> get<00:03:13.530> destroyed<00:03:13.950> by<00:03:14.010> smgs<00:03:15.079> LMGs<00:03:17.060> even

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
just get destroyed by smgs LMGs even

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300 
just get destroyed by smgs LMGs even
decent<00:03:18.630> snipers<00:03:19.260> can<00:03:19.440> take<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.769> shotguns

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
decent snipers can take out shotguns

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.670 
decent snipers can take out shotguns
from<00:03:20.579> 4<00:03:20.819> feet<00:03:20.850> away<00:03:21.150> even<00:03:22.109> though<00:03:22.139> the<00:03:22.290> shotgun

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
from 4 feet away even though the shotgun

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.080 
from 4 feet away even though the shotgun
should<00:03:22.859> have<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> advantage<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.760> area

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
should have the advantage in that area

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.610 
should have the advantage in that area
now<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.480> other<00:03:27.569> thing<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.380> lack<00:03:28.590> of

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
now the other thing is the lack of

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.470 
now the other thing is the lack of
attachments<00:03:29.540> stakeout<00:03:30.540> has<00:03:30.930> four<00:03:32.480> bullets

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
attachments stakeout has four bullets

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.110 
attachments stakeout has four bullets
per<00:03:33.720> clip<00:03:33.959> and<00:03:34.139> it<00:03:34.530> comes<00:03:35.099> with<00:03:35.220> 12<00:03:35.670> extra

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
per clip and it comes with 12 extra

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.309 
per clip and it comes with 12 extra
without<00:03:37.400> scavenger<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.980> think<00:03:40.980> that<00:03:42.319> they

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
without scavenger now I think that they

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.020 
without scavenger now I think that they
should<00:03:43.349> definitely<00:03:44.190> have<00:03:44.310> extended<00:03:44.790> mags

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
should definitely have extended mags

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.479 
should definitely have extended mags
maybe<00:03:45.900> not<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.230> spaz<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.099> has<00:03:47.220> eight

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
maybe not on spaz because it has eight

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.909 
maybe not on spaz because it has eight
bullets<00:03:47.910> but<00:03:48.060> definitely<00:03:48.450> on<00:03:48.510> stakeout<00:03:49.079> lepo

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
bullets but definitely on stakeout lepo

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.319 
bullets but definitely on stakeout lepo
wouldn't<00:03:50.250> work<00:03:50.370> because<00:03:50.459> it's<00:03:50.730> double<00:03:51.060> barrel

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
wouldn't work because it's double barrel

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.370 
wouldn't work because it's double barrel
but<00:03:52.169> uh<00:03:52.430> HK<00:03:53.430> 10<00:03:53.669> I<00:03:53.700> believe<00:03:54.120> has<00:03:54.359> six<00:03:54.750> Ivan<00:03:55.230> I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
but uh HK 10 I believe has six Ivan I

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.080 
but uh HK 10 I believe has six Ivan I
don't<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:55.980> has<00:03:56.010> extended<00:03:56.549> mags<00:03:56.790> but

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
don't know if it has extended mags but

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.120 
don't know if it has extended mags but
it's<00:03:57.269> okay<00:03:57.540> because<00:03:57.569> it's<00:03:57.930> it's<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.620> semi-auto

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
it's okay because it's it's a semi-auto

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's okay because it's it's a semi-auto
it's<00:03:59.370> different<00:03:59.760> it<00:04:00.030> has<00:04:00.989> decent<00:04:01.410> damage<00:04:02.060> but

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
it's different it has decent damage but

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.409 
it's different it has decent damage but
um<00:04:03.209> stakeout<00:04:03.959> definitely<00:04:04.560> needs<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:05.459> extended

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
um stakeout definitely needs a extended

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.970 
um stakeout definitely needs a extended
mags<00:04:06.630> whether<00:04:06.989> it's<00:04:07.169> six<00:04:07.440> or<00:04:07.590> eight<00:04:07.739> it

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
mags whether it's six or eight it

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.970 
mags whether it's six or eight it
doesn't<00:04:08.310> really<00:04:08.370> matter<00:04:08.669> to<00:04:08.970> me<00:04:09.470> if<00:04:10.470> it's<00:04:10.739> six

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
doesn't really matter to me if it's six

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.349 
doesn't really matter to me if it's six
I<00:04:11.220> guess<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.549> would<00:04:11.669> kind<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.970> be<00:04:12.090> like<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
I guess it would kind of be like the

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.300 
I guess it would kind of be like the
m1014<00:04:12.750> just<00:04:13.620> not<00:04:13.799> semi-auto<00:04:15.620> yeah<00:04:16.620> there<00:04:17.220> are

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
m1014 just not semi-auto yeah there are

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.420 
m1014 just not semi-auto yeah there are
some<00:04:17.400> areas<00:04:17.609> i<00:04:17.849> think<00:04:18.060> chair<00:04:18.269> could<00:04:19.159> improve

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
some areas i think chair could improve

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.980 
some areas i think chair could improve
now<00:04:21.430> obviously<00:04:21.730> unless<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.540> do<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> complete

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
now obviously unless you do a complete

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.660 
now obviously unless you do a complete
engine<00:04:23.410> rehal<00:04:23.830> they<00:04:24.010> can't<00:04:24.250> make<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.520> hit

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
engine rehal they can't make the hit

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.280 
engine rehal they can't make the hit
detection<00:04:24.820> any<00:04:25.270> better<00:04:25.540> but<00:04:26.050> they<00:04:26.170> can

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
detection any better but they can

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.230 
detection any better but they can
definitely<00:04:27.750> now<00:04:28.750> I'm<00:04:29.080> not<00:04:29.260> saying<00:04:30.030> make<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240
