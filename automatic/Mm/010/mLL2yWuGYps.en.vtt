00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.570 
way to inspect the thickness because
many<00:05:30.599> of<00:05:30.690> them<00:05:30.870> taper<00:05:31.169> off<00:05:31.440> pretty<00:05:32.159> comparable

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
many of them taper off pretty comparable

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.270 
many of them taper off pretty comparable
amongst<00:05:33.240> these<00:05:33.479> four<00:05:33.810> devices<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.770> think<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
amongst these four devices I think the

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.159 
amongst these four devices I think the
decision<00:05:35.760> here<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.060> going<00:05:36.479> to<00:05:36.630> come<00:05:36.870> down<00:05:36.930> to

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
decision here is going to come down to

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.770 
decision here is going to come down to
whether<00:05:38.039> or<00:05:38.220> not<00:05:38.310> you<00:05:39.150> can<00:05:39.330> use<00:05:39.570> the

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
whether or not you can use the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.750 
whether or not you can use the
expandability<00:05:40.409> or<00:05:40.770> you<00:05:40.919> want<00:05:41.520> the

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
expandability or you want the

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.610 
expandability or you want the
expandability<00:05:42.360> in<00:05:42.659> your<00:05:42.780> device<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:43.320> if

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
expandability in your device and if

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.350 
expandability in your device and if
you're<00:05:43.770> looking<00:05:44.130> for<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.909> biggest<00:05:45.210> screen

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
you're looking for the biggest screen

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.300 
you're looking for the biggest screen
you<00:05:45.479> get<00:05:45.690> without<00:05:45.990> having<00:05:46.349> a<00:05:46.470> phone<00:05:47.039> that

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
you get without having a phone that

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.760 
you get without having a phone that
requires<00:05:47.820> two-handed<00:05:48.479> use<00:05:48.720> for<00:05:49.110> everything

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
requires two-handed use for everything

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.089 
requires two-handed use for everything
lastly<00:05:50.400> camera<00:05:51.270> as<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:52.050> know<00:05:52.229> the<00:05:52.680> camera<00:05:52.979> on

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
lastly camera as you know the camera on

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.390 
lastly camera as you know the camera on
the<00:05:53.190> s6<00:05:53.759> and<00:05:54.060> s6<00:05:54.270> edge<00:05:54.720> is<00:05:55.259> a<00:05:55.650> really<00:05:56.159> great

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
the s6 and s6 edge is a really great

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.820 
the s6 and s6 edge is a really great
performer<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.300> this<00:05:57.780> one<00:05:58.020> is<00:05:58.229> very<00:05:58.740> very

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
performer and this one is very very

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.010 
performer and this one is very very
close<00:05:59.250> it's<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.669> take<00:05:59.909> some<00:06:00.570> strict

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
close it's going to take some strict

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.839 
close it's going to take some strict
testing<00:06:01.650> in<00:06:01.740> order<00:06:01.919> to<00:06:02.009> figure<00:06:02.190> out<00:06:02.430> which<00:06:02.639> one

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
testing in order to figure out which one

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.999 
testing in order to figure out which one
is<00:06:02.970> better<00:06:03.210> but<00:06:03.419> I<00:06:03.479> think<00:06:03.539> you<00:06:04.229> probably<00:06:04.500> can't

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
is better but I think you probably can't

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.180 
is better but I think you probably can't
go<00:06:05.190> wrong<00:06:05.460> on<00:06:05.729> either<00:06:06.389> anyway<00:06:06.960> that's<00:06:07.919> my

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
go wrong on either anyway that's my

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.430 
go wrong on either anyway that's my
