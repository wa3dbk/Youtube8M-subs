00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 With you Olga Kanunnikova and today I will give you 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.080
 show you how to process beautiful silk 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
 edge 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.870
 so take a bit of shock and this is the edge 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.089
 As a result, we should have this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.490
 the right side is the left side of the seam 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.840
 called Moscow and so we need 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.840
 process this edge 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 Silk is very frayed and therefore it is difficult 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.130
 beautifully handle and the more he 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:39.110
 quite so thin and difficult to him 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:43.110
 work bend our edge around on 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:47.930
 centimeter and a half and at a distance 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.930
 about 1 millimeter from the edge 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.250
 start scribbling 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.240
 the tips are just about shifting 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.179
 do not pull power because here is the edge 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.270
 thin enough we can see wait 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:41.880
 fabrics and so now we take scissors now 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.149
 very carefully we have to cut here from 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.490
 from stitched your 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.799
 straight here quite a few 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.429
 branches just leave look after him 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.429
 extra 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.670
 do not rush to do it very carefully 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.690
 scissors need to choose sharp 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.360
 the main thing to do is let him write 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.870
 i could earlier to spikes less often 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.239
 something like this we should have 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.569
 here is childhood 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.209
 if you see what's cut off wrong 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.900
 completely better look again and 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.900
 walk 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:37.300
 now take it all goes 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:41.470
 now we take our turn 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:45.370
 literally millimeter by 2 maximum and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:54.970
 tuck it in again and again 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:54.970
 neatly stitching the main to us 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.770
 put a button 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:12.490
 tuck and straight around the edge somewhere 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:33.160
 receding 1 centimeter 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:36.450
 we have to build a second there need 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.450
 just gently cold 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.680
 that's what we've got so 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.930
 It looks our seam on the left side as well 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.860
 he looks very right 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.150
 neat and beautiful thank you for your attention 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.150
