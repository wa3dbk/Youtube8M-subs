adjustments going on from both sides

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.259 
adjustments going on from both sides
there<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:55.260> some<00:02:55.500> arcades<00:02:55.980> going<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.519> from

interrupt lights go out lights turn on
white<00:03:06.750> families<00:03:07.290> there<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.890> off<00:03:08.519> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
white families there and off the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.089 
white families there and off the
distraction<00:03:08.849> Randy<00:03:09.840> Orton<00:03:10.200> gets<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.590> win<00:03:10.799> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
distraction Randy Orton gets the win and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.720 
distraction Randy Orton gets the win and
then<00:03:11.250> after<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.909> match<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:14.069> Wyatt<00:03:14.280> family

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
then after the match the Wyatt family

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.039 
then after the match the Wyatt family
beat<00:03:14.909> up<00:03:15.000> on<00:03:15.180> John<00:03:15.390> Cena

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
beat up on John Cena

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.640 
beat up on John Cena
so<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:17.159> guess<00:03:17.549> that's<00:03:17.970> what<00:03:18.150> Cena's<00:03:18.720> new

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
so I guess that's what Cena's new

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.259 
so I guess that's what Cena's new
storyline<00:03:20.160> is<00:03:20.250> gonna<00:03:20.400> be<00:03:20.519> you'll<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:21.000> going
