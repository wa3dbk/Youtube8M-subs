00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.090
 yo everybody knows that max we get 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.799
 found for a new video 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.360
 commented on today's black ops a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.279
 gameplay in melee general I speak 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.480
 quickly for the nuclear series in 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.070
 all modes of play so today 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.539
 there will be a nuclear melee 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.160
 general and it's nice because 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.109
 a nuclear melee general it's 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.660
 not easy and it's a meter 4 goes 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 more than 200 x who would you say I have not 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.840
 counted but I guess since the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.850
 start of the game because it's a challenge that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 I try since the beginning of the game I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.380
 well done a lot more than 200 parties in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.059
 tempting this challenge i think maybe not 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.379
 200 parties already seen a little bit anyway 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.579
 I made a lot of it then 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.469
 today nuclear in general melee 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.700
 am happy to propose it to you for the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.910
 nuclear series in all modes of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.309
 Thu 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 especially since for me it is the most 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.430
 complicated after the game mode 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.230
 search and destroy 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
 after maybe I can put the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.070
 team death match but for me the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.360
 general melee is much more complicated 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.000
 that the team death match 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.289
 so that's the challenge I'm really 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.359
 glad to propose it to you today 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.739
 so there's a little thing I had 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.760
 want to talk about it from the beginning there is a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.140
 little trick that you will definitely 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.689
 not noticed but I owe it to myself 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.119
 to clarify is that the gameplay what 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.229
 you see this live but the sound is not 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.340
 not live then you will tell me 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.760
 what did you smoke what we 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 recounts 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.619
 no actually there I recorded the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 live gameplay and once 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.229
 the recording completed 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.460
 well there was no catch soumah 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.710
 card she still did bullshit 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.810
 need to know I have a capture card 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.130
 really chelou it's one to their media 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.070
 which dates from 2007 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 she has to the person using it does 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.030
 on youtube almost it's a slap on 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.070
 earth in celebration that allows with two three 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.540
 little tricks with following a tutorial 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 on the internet it allows me 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.979
 to record in hdmi my playstation this 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.659
 which is normally impossible so that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.740
 fun but it's really a 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.360
 galley guys I you cause I 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.009
 advise anyone and she makes me 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.820
 full of bullshit including alma does 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.430
 bullshit is that it reaches 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.140
 record the sound etc and it's not 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.810
 because I do not have better go out to jam 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 multiple jam on the playstation than that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.719
 did that to me guys I'm sure and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.100
 some I went to see after and 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.740
 I had seen a game come out 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.850
 multiple it was on wii so short that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.810
 it's for those who record 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 will know what I'm talking about 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.119
 after 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.289
 so those who record gameplay 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 they know what I'm talking about when I 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.010
 talking about going out of multiples here I am 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.510
 have to be clear 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.159
 so she made me a bullshit no 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.170
 meaning I said to myself you're going to enm at 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.689
 studio and I'm going to take lesson from the mode 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 studio it's a little chelou because the 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.890
 word studio I noticed by putting the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 to overlay gameplay in 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.090
 reality the word studio does not reflect the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.920
 reality in front of something that I already had 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.810
 noticed before but when I put it well 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.040
 both gameplay at the same time but the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 stuff that goes up it's not at all the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.129
 same things that happen in real 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.450
 while you play so I prefer 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.819
 you really let the gameplay on 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.489
 live is better and I tried to 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.049
 calais the case the lessons at the exact moment 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.329
 so normally if everything was going 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.099
 perfectly as soon as I pull I pull 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:50.480
 but normally guys if I would have 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.769
 not make small lags because at 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.239
 every time I had to cut the sound 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.349
 in some places to recover 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.510
 because they shift as they go 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.859
 measure of time if I would not have done it 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.090
 lesson it would be shifted a bit in the 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.889
 time while there I believe I have 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.209
 do a pretty decent thing so voila 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.900
 you would not have noticed but I 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.400
 have to specify it 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.569
 the sound is not live that's why 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.260
 especially that in the end there is a guy who 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.519
 speak to the microphone 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.139
 me she really get drunk to me 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.489
 drunk but I will not do select 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.079
 for the master better because I was 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.609
 really focused if I had selected 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.629
 he could at any time 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.489
 there was a guy who was coming from 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.650
 members in front of me to kill me and me 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.849
 I was focused so I could not 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.530
 put select for the dumb master but 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.620
 henin in the end he's talking to the microphone a 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.910
 cassette tell you me so here I am 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.959
 said today nuclear but the 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.590
 general I do not have much time anymore 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.299
 a pretty nervous gameplay fast enough 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.410
 and I'm happy because for me it 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.579
 has nice gameplay so some 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.109
 people who will say yeah that is 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.990
 in the same place all the part but the 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.550
 guys the gameplay 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.230
 even while staying in the same place all the 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.670
 part it does not mean I camped that 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.620
 means that I went around my 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.270
 spot I kill and the guys actually it's a 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.890
 just the best way to win 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.540
 general scrum and could also 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.290
 to make this nuclear title for me it's 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.300
 the best solution 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.550
 and it's far from an easy solution 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.050
 it's just the best mass and 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.270
 go around a place in a spot 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.500
 because as time goes by 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.970
 know the spawn so I know 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.100
 pretty much the spawn of this place 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.960
 and I was doing the trick to kill people 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.610
 have a picture the micro-station all 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.930
 became simpler and frankly 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.370
 it's far from easy because 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.810
 you guys not know the media Teubes 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.880
 it's not teubees they come back to 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.560
 every time tried to kill you faye 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.520
 almost at most there is 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.709
 all the time one who comes back for 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.970
 try to kill me and pledges account 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.630
 the more times I've done you have to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.650
 27 26 25 precisely because of that because 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.120
 that I stay at the same spot 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.620
 it allows me to do the kills 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.150
 quickly but it also allows me 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.770
 to be really in danger because the 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.260
 people they come kill me short me I 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 I'm really happy with the gameplay will 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.640
 tell me what you think about it and that 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.770
 will shut up more than one is that 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.910
 I unlocked the title explodes and 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.410
 why I'm going to shut up 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.590
 more than one because every time I 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.270
 poses a game post i post an episode of 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.070
 I'm going to blow you up there is all 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.810
 time one who tells me yes you can not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.190
 to evoke the exploded title with the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.230
 strict scores drones drone fog 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.610
 and microstation but the guys I want 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.680
 to tell you I want to tell you 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.260
 whore who I speak too badly I want 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.590
 to tell you yes I can be unlocked 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.520
 the title explodes and watch I went 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.590
 say right now but have to wait 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.590
 another two three seconds 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.590
 look 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.400
 all ears two sails exploded so I 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290
 played with the drop the potting soil 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.490
 fog and microstation brief that's it 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.630
 guys I was a little excited big 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.190
 order arrives I hope that you 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.389
 will have rained one finds oneself for a 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.160
 new video in a short time 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.419
 if you liked this gameplay my 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.760
 paris orders do not hesitate to put 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.290
 a little like and and that's it do not hesitate 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.330
 to put comments I try to 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.740
 answer when these same advisors not 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.810
 interesting I answer it so put some 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.010
 orders and on the guys we end up 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.639
 for a new video the next 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.639
 ciao times
