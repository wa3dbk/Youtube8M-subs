but<00:02:41.790> what<00:02:41.970> truly<00:02:42.240> makes<00:02:42.510> nether<00:02:42.780> an

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
but what truly makes nether an

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.330 
but what truly makes nether an
experience<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> atmosphere<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
experience is the atmosphere and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.650 
experience is the atmosphere and
immersion<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.090> graphics<00:02:45.480> are<00:02:45.630> pretty

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
immersion the graphics are pretty

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.600 
immersion the graphics are pretty
amazing<00:02:46.440> but<00:02:46.650> what<00:02:46.740> I<00:02:46.800> found<00:02:47.010> most<00:02:47.190> intriguing

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
amazing but what I found most intriguing

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.820 
amazing but what I found most intriguing
was<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> sound<00:02:48.330> there<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.900> no<00:02:49.260> music<00:02:49.560> in

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
was the sound there is no music in

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.559 
was the sound there is no music in
nether<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.640> gives<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.060> whole<00:02:51.240> thing<00:02:51.300> a

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
nether but that gives the whole thing a

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.150 
nether but that gives the whole thing a
more<00:02:51.720> surreal<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.319> truly<00:02:52.650> creepy<00:02:53.040> experience

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
more surreal and truly creepy experience

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.340 
more surreal and truly creepy experience
the<00:02:53.790> only<00:02:54.060> sound<00:02:54.300> is<00:02:54.420> your<00:02:54.569> footsteps<00:02:55.110> your

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
the only sound is your footsteps your

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
the only sound is your footsteps your
breathing<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.010> nether<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.610> gunfire<00:02:57.300> by<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
breathing the nether and gunfire by the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.330 
breathing the nether and gunfire by the
way<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.110> hear<00:02:58.350> gunfire<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:58.980> more<00:02:59.190> than

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
way if you hear gunfire it's more than

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.130 
way if you hear gunfire it's more than
likely<00:02:59.520> aimed<00:02:59.790> in<00:02:59.940> your<00:03:00.060> direction<00:03:00.209> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
likely aimed in your direction you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.240 
likely aimed in your direction you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
should probably duck or something

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.650 
should probably duck or something
