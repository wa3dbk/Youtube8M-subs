00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
overall i'll definitely recommend it all

overall i'll definitely recommend it all
you<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.820> give<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you have to give up for it is the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
you have to give up for it is the
concussion<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> flash<00:01:20.250> grenade<00:01:20.580> slot<00:01:20.850> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
concussion and flash grenade slot so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
concussion and flash grenade slot so
it's<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.869> you're<00:01:21.990> giving<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.590> primary

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's not like you're giving up a primary

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
it's not like you're giving up a primary
grenade<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.380> something<00:01:25.380> that's<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.680> i

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
grenade or something that's what i

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.530 
grenade or something that's what i
thought<00:01:25.860> at<00:01:25.920> first<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.549> that's<00:01:26.939> why<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> try<00:01:27.509> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
thought at first so that's why I try to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149

stay<00:01:27.720> away<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> realized

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159

I<00:01:40.079> spawn<00:01:40.380> throw<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> down<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:41.970> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I spawn throw it down and you don't have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.960 
I spawn throw it down and you don't have
to<00:01:42.180> babysit<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to babysit it you can but I just like to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.340 
to babysit it you can but I just like to
run<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.299> different<00:01:45.630> areas<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> map<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
run to different areas of the map you

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.319 
run to different areas of the map you
want<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.560> stay<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> general<00:01:47.250> area<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
want to stay in a general area but you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.719 
want to stay in a general area but you
could<00:01:48.479> run<00:01:48.630> back<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:48.960> forth<00:01:49.200> pace<00:01:50.009> across<00:01:50.369> an

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
could run back and forth pace across an

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.219 
could run back and forth pace across an
area<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.149> map<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.780> use<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
area of the map and just use the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.319 
area of the map and just use the
portable<00:01:52.560> radar<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.369> cover<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.820> bag<00:01:54.060> it's

portable radar you cover your bag it's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
portable radar you cover your bag it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
decisions so you'll see a zygote or to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.510 
decisions so you'll see a zygote or to
another<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> map<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.280> red

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

I in free for all the spawn zones are

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.120 
I in free for all the spawn zones are
kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.080> divided<00:02:17.350> into<00:02:17.560> different<00:02:17.709> sections

enough<00:02:50.980> about<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> port<00:02:51.550> of<00:02:51.580> Greater<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.060> think

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
enough about the port of Greater I think

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.449 
enough about the port of Greater I think
I<00:02:52.450> made<00:02:52.780> my<00:02:52.810> point<00:02:52.959> but<00:02:53.830> anyway<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.430> next

I made my point but anyway the next
thing<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.790> want<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.000> talk<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.989> best

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
thing I want to talk about is the best

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.350 
thing I want to talk about is the best
game<00:02:56.380> type<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.890> order<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.340> get<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.550> mode<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:58.030> the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
game type in order to get a mode now the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.180 
game type in order to get a mode now the
three<00:02:58.660> top<00:02:58.959> game<00:02:59.260> types<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.709> would<00:03:00.010> say

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
three top game types that I would say

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.729 
three top game types that I would say
are<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.060> easiest<00:03:01.480> forgetting<00:03:02.170> modes<00:03:02.410> are

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
are the easiest forgetting modes are

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.090 
are the easiest forgetting modes are
free<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.550> all<00:03:03.959> domination<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.110> kill<00:03:05.739> confirm

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
free for all domination and kill confirm

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.910 
free for all domination and kill confirm
now<00:03:06.390> free<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.540> all<00:03:07.630> can<00:03:08.050> be<00:03:08.290> challenging

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
now free for all can be challenging

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
now free for all can be challenging
especially<00:03:09.100> since<00:03:09.670> f<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:10.060> get<00:03:10.209> six<00:03:10.540> kills<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
especially since f you get six kills and

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.699 
especially since f you get six kills and
then<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.830> die<00:03:12.070> there's<00:03:12.430> no<00:03:12.670> way<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.330> can<00:03:13.480> get

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
then you die there's no way you can get

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.140 
then you die there's no way you can get
ammo<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:14.980> if<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.160> start<00:03:15.400> out<00:03:15.610> doing<00:03:15.790> well

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
ammo but if you start out doing well

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.650 
ammo but if you start out doing well
then<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.290> pretty<00:03:17.769> much<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.489> carries<00:03:19.450> over

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
then it pretty much just carries over

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.270 
then it pretty much just carries over
it's<00:03:19.959> like<00:03:19.989> the<00:03:20.170> snowball<00:03:20.620> effect<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:21.100> once

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it's like the snowball effect like once

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.530 
it's like the snowball effect like once
you<00:03:21.370> start<00:03:21.610> doing<00:03:21.700> well<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.180> continue

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
you start doing well you just continue

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.720 
you start doing well you just continue
to<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.959> well<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.410> it's<00:03:24.250> all<00:03:24.370> about<00:03:24.519> momentum

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
to do well and it's all about momentum

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.420 
to do well and it's all about momentum
so<00:03:25.390> use<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> strategy<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.890> should<00:03:27.070> be<00:03:27.190> easy

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
so use a strategy and it should be easy

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.940 
so use a strategy and it should be easy
enough<00:03:27.549> now<00:03:28.030> kill<00:03:28.570> confirmed<00:03:28.750> your<00:03:29.170> teammates

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
enough now kill confirmed your teammates

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.729 
enough now kill confirmed your teammates
65<00:03:30.519> dog<00:03:30.880> tags<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.360> win<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:31.750> your<00:03:32.380> team<00:03:32.560> usually

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
65 dog tags to win but your team usually

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.530 
65 dog tags to win but your team usually
doesn't<00:03:33.190> pick<00:03:33.310> up<00:03:33.400> all<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.880> dog<00:03:34.090> tags<00:03:34.360> they

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
doesn't pick up all the dog tags they

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.380 
doesn't pick up all the dog tags they
get<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:36.040> means<00:03:36.280> your<00:03:36.640> team<00:03:36.820> usually<00:03:36.970> ends

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
get so this means your team usually ends

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.600 
get so this means your team usually ends
up<00:03:37.450> with<00:03:37.690> somewhere<00:03:37.959> around<00:03:38.079> like<00:03:38.410> 80<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:39.160> 100

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
up with somewhere around like 80 to 100

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.370 
up with somewhere around like 80 to 100
kills<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:40.780> gives<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> big

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
kills so this gives you a big

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.759 
kills so this gives you a big
opportunity<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.760> get<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.930> Mobe<00:03:44.170> within<00:03:44.620> this

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
opportunity to get the Mobe within this

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.350 
opportunity to get the Mobe within this
time<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.310> same<00:03:45.579> thing<00:03:45.610> with<00:03:45.760> domination

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
time and same thing with domination

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.910 
time and same thing with domination
domination<00:03:46.900> games<00:03:47.110> usually<00:03:47.260> last<00:03:47.470> pretty

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
domination games usually last pretty

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.340 
domination games usually last pretty
long<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.489> there's<00:03:48.970> no<00:03:49.120> strict<00:03:49.540> kill<00:03:49.840> limit<00:03:50.170> so

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
long and there's no strict kill limit so

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.440 
long and there's no strict kill limit so
that's<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.590> really<00:03:50.620> good<00:03:51.070> game<00:03:51.640> mode<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.209> get

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
that's a really good game mode to get

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.900 
that's a really good game mode to get
the<00:03:52.600> moab<00:03:53.440> especially<00:03:54.340> if<00:03:54.430> it's<00:03:54.549> like<00:03:54.730> your
