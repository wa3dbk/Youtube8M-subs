00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Everybody knows this problem spontaneously 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.940
 barbecue party at home no drinks data 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.140
 go shopping fast but hardly 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.940
 is one at home even already the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.519
 friends in front of the door and the game is 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.780
 why this embarrassing situation too 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 there is one admittedly bypassing it 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.039
 not quite as new trick but 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 still far too rarely applied and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.869
 so we want you to again 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.060
 Show everything you need for it 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 salt ice water and of course that too 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 cool drinks and just pour that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 salt and that massive of rice water 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.700
 a little bit with me now 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 complicated but because I just come 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:56.430
 friendly so so hot in the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:59.719
 ice water hot water everything has to be 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.719
 to be on 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 in 90 seconds, the whole thing should be cold 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.540
 we want to change that quickly now 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.890
 so that the salt also quickly with the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890
 Mixing water gives a bit more 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.939
 and then the drink in and now 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.320
 Let's wait another 90 seconds 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.470
 little salt and we start the 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.470
 his 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.980
 a few seconds later we have something left 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.750
 Here in it happens very briefly me 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.970
 do not want to explain it to the north 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 has something to do with the salt and its 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.110
 johnen lattice this salt has the 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.150
 are split dissolve in the water 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.740
 on and with energy needed and 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.270
 these energies and heat will be the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.590
 environment deprived 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.810
 so now over 130 and I take off and 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.820
 we test times whether it worked as 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.140
 cold so it is well noticed the dose 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:15.780
 was previously at room temperature after 90 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.780
 seconds in the iced water she should now 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 measured that time with this great sex 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.590
 after 9 degrees that is cool cabinet 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 temperature in any case and that in 90 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.489
 in seconds that's the hammer 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 So everything you need at home is 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.760
 salt and ice water and that too has 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.760
 spontaneous always cool drinks
