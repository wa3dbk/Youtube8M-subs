00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
single hybrid that I've ever made and

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.920 
single hybrid that I've ever made and
uploaded<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.640> channel<00:00:05.970> so<00:00:06.210> this<00:00:06.660> was<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
uploaded to my channel so this was the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.690 
uploaded to my channel so this was the
first<00:00:07.080> ever<00:00:07.350> hybrid<00:00:07.710> I<00:00:07.799> uploaded<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.460> it

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
first ever hybrid I uploaded and it

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.070 
first ever hybrid I uploaded and it
wasn't<00:00:08.910> really<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.210> hybrid<00:00:09.360> because<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.780> used<00:00:09.990> a

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
wasn't really a hybrid because I used a

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.530 
wasn't really a hybrid because I used a
manager<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:11.190> also<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.880> each<00:00:12.059> player<00:00:12.389> has

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
manager and also like each player has

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.230 
manager and also like each player has
like<00:00:12.690> 4<00:00:13.200> 5<00:00:13.530> kem<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:14.549> ridiculous<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> know

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
like 4 5 kem it was ridiculous you know

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.430 
like 4 5 kem it was ridiculous you know
I<00:00:15.330> didn't<00:00:15.570> really<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:15.900> anything<00:00:15.929> about

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
I didn't really know anything about

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040 
I didn't really know anything about
hybrids<00:00:16.890> whatsoever<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:18.270> then<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.840> see

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
hybrids whatsoever and then you will see

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.200 
hybrids whatsoever and then you will see
sort<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> progression<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:20.250> like<00:00:20.730> like

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
sort of the progression of how like like

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.029 
sort of the progression of how like like
I<00:00:21.449> guess<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.140> opinion<00:00:22.470> they've<00:00:22.619> got<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> lot

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
I guess in my opinion they've got a lot

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
I guess in my opinion they've got a lot
more<00:00:23.189> better<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.760> see<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:24.570> still<00:00:24.779> using

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
more better and see here I'm still using

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.210 
more better and see here I'm still using
managers<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.529> know<00:00:25.560> not<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:25.949> players

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
managers you know not all the players

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.220 
managers you know not all the players
have<00:00:26.369> 9<00:00:26.550> chem<00:00:26.849> they're<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.840> bit<00:00:28.109> all<00:00:28.199> over

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
have 9 chem they're kind of bit all over

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
have 9 chem they're kind of bit all over
the<00:00:28.470> place<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.670> know<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> did<00:00:30.000> kind<00:00:30.210> of

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the place and you know I did kind of

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.609 
the place and you know I did kind of
learn<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> was<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> massive<00:00:31.170> learning<00:00:31.289> curve

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
learn it was a massive learning curve

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.250 
learn it was a massive learning curve
for<00:00:31.650> me<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.189> realized<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.719> know<00:00:33.840> people<00:00:34.170> I

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
for me I realized that you know people I

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.510 
for me I realized that you know people I
only<00:00:34.410> give<00:00:34.559> me<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.040> satisfied<00:00:35.250> with

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
only give me going to be satisfied with

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.270 
only give me going to be satisfied with
a<00:00:36.090> scored<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:37.170> they<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.620> 9<00:00:37.829> chemistry

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
a scored if they all have 9 chemistry

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.500 
a scored if they all have 9 chemistry
especially<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> hybrid<00:00:39.360> because

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
especially when it's a hybrid because

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
especially when it's a hybrid because

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
of gotta stay on the ball when actually

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
of gotta stay on the ball when actually
put<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.239> work<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> effort<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> kind

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
of try and find out the puzzle into how

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240 
of try and find out the puzzle into how
you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.870> actually<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.260> each<00:00:49.500> player<00:00:49.800> 9<00:00:49.980> chem

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you can actually get each player 9 chem

you can actually get each player 9 chem
and<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.420> really

know it's kind of like a puzzle you had
to<00:00:55.710> sort<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.980> fit<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.340> different<00:00:56.699> players

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to sort of fit in different players

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.689 
to sort of fit in different players
where<00:00:57.239> they<00:00:58.170> could<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.559> fit<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> still<00:00:59.550> get

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
where they could be fit in and still get
9<00:00:59.879> chemistry<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> try<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.170> make<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.559> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
9 chemistry and try and make it as you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
9 chemistry and try and make it as you
know<00:01:01.770> original<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.030> know<00:01:03.149> unique<00:01:03.510> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
know original and you know unique as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.810 
know original and you know unique as
possible<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.860> think<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.460> throughout

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
possible and I think you know throughout

possible and I think you know throughout
the<00:01:06.090> whole<00:01:06.270> time<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.680> YouTube<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.189> me

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the whole time one on like YouTube of me

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
the whole time one on like YouTube of me
doing<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:08.790> hybrids<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.080> prick

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
doing these hybrids I think I have prick

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
doing these hybrids I think I have prick
I<00:01:10.680> created<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:12.240> quite<00:01:12.450> cool<00:01:12.630> hybrids

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
I created some really quite cool hybrids

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
I created some really quite cool hybrids
some<00:01:13.950> nice<00:01:14.100> still<00:01:14.460> won't<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.760> build<00:01:15.150> by

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
some nice still won't actually build by

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
some nice still won't actually build by
the<00:01:15.360> end<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.780> 412<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.640> just
