00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.510 
you that right now I mean really nice
you<00:01:42.750> could<00:01:42.870> like<00:01:43.200> literally<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.310> at<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you could like literally see look at the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.220 
you could like literally see look at the
quality<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.810> color<00:01:49.080> is

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
quality of this but the color is

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.710 
quality of this but the color is
definitely<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> expected<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.330> if

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
definitely not what I expected so if

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.390 
definitely not what I expected so if
you're<00:01:52.020> looking<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.680> pick<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.010> up<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
you're looking to pick this up and

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.620 
you're looking to pick this up and
you're<00:01:53.490> looking<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.940> something<00:01:54.150> with<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> lot

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
you're looking for something with a lot

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're looking for something with a lot
of<00:01:54.750> pop<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:56.040> probably<00:01:56.250> recommend<00:01:56.970> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
of pop I would probably recommend the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.030 
of pop I would probably recommend the
other<00:01:57.420> colorways<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:58.230> would<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.830> with

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
other colorways I would think to go with

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.480 
other colorways I would think to go with
the<00:01:59.220> green<00:02:00.060> or<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.810> blue<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.440> still<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the green or the blue I still like the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.000 
the green or the blue I still like the
Cola<00:02:02.730> way<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.330> was<00:02:03.870> expecting<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.800> be

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
Cola way I just was expecting it to be

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.250 
Cola way I just was expecting it to be
brighter<00:02:05.370> so<00:02:05.730> this<00:02:06.030> threw<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.540> off<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.020> I

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
brighter so this threw me off but I

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.470 
brighter so this threw me off but I
still<00:02:08.070> like<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.520> color<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.270> coal

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
still like this color I think the coal

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.220 
still like this color I think the coal
is<00:02:09.660> dope<00:02:09.960> as<00:02:10.230> far<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.920> concept<00:02:11.550> wise<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.230> from

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is dope as far as concept wise and from

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.660 
is dope as far as concept wise and from
what<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.410> thought<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:14.010> gonna<00:02:14.130> look<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.400> I

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
what I thought it was gonna look like I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.760 
what I thought it was gonna look like I
thought<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.030> gonna<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.240> brighter<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.500> if

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
thought it was gonna be brighter so if

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.640 
thought it was gonna be brighter so if
you<00:02:16.920> looking<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.280> something<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.670> some<00:02:17.880> pop

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
you looking for something with some pop

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.240 
you looking for something with some pop
definitely<00:02:19.650> go<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.090> green<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:23.220> blue

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
definitely go with the green or the blue

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.490 
definitely go with the green or the blue
I<00:02:23.790> think<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.570> would<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.959> move<00:02:25.170> or<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
I think that would be the move or the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.070 
I think that would be the move or the
red<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.980> red<00:02:26.160> would<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.430> dope<00:02:26.640> too<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.900> this

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
red the red would be dope too but this

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.570 
red the red would be dope too but this
one<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.530> here<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:31.130> loud<00:02:32.130> which

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
one right here is not that loud which

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.490 
one right here is not that loud which
some<00:02:33.030> people<00:02:33.150> may<00:02:33.420> actually<00:02:33.600> like<00:02:34.020> also<00:02:34.470> that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
some people may actually like also that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
some people may actually like also that
it's<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.700> subtle<00:02:35.970> look<00:02:36.300> in

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
it's kind of more of a subtle look in

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
it's kind of more of a subtle look in
that<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.140> popping<00:02:38.600> with<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.780> said<00:02:40.110> look<00:02:40.380> at

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that so popping with that said look at

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.760 
that so popping with that said look at

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
to just represent this concept better I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.380 
to just represent this concept better I
love<00:03:25.530> when<00:03:25.890> they<00:03:26.340> do<00:03:26.400> stuff<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.239> with

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
collaborations I thought exactly should

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.160 
collaborations I thought exactly should
do<00:03:29.549> more<00:03:30.450> of<00:03:30.480> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
do more of that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.460 
do more of that
kind<00:03:31.349> of<00:03:31.500> different<00:03:32.250> work<00:03:32.580> when<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.940> comes<00:03:32.970> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
kind of different work when it comes to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.770 
kind of different work when it comes to
different<00:03:34.470> concepts<00:03:34.980> just<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.970> bring<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.510> more

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
different concepts just to bring it more

to<00:03:37.110> life<00:03:37.319> also<00:03:38.220> as<00:03:38.280> far<00:03:38.459> as<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.670> yellow<00:03:38.880> just

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
to life also as far as the yellow just

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.010 
to life also as far as the yellow just
so<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.780> get<00:03:39.959> an<00:03:40.080> idea<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.209> comparison

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
so you get an idea there's a comparison

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.479 
so you get an idea there's a comparison
of<00:03:43.260> these<00:03:43.890> right<00:03:44.160> here<00:03:44.370> above<00:03:44.730> these<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.430> you
