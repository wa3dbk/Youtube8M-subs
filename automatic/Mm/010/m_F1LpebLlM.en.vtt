in<00:00:19.260> black<00:00:19.829> now<00:00:20.579> the<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.880> about<00:00:20.909> this<00:00:21.179> guitar

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:21.329 
in black now the thing about this guitar

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.989 
in black now the thing about this guitar
is<00:00:21.720> when<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.929> patient's<00:00:22.380> descale<00:00:23.130> guitars<00:00:23.579> so

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:23.999 
is when a patient's descale guitars so

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.239 
is when a patient's descale guitars so
it's<00:00:24.659> got<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.839> longer<00:00:25.259> scale<00:00:25.499> neck<00:00:25.859> on<00:00:26.069> here

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
it's got a longer scale neck on here

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.540 
it's got a longer scale neck on here
it's<00:00:26.970> designed<00:00:27.509> to<00:00:27.599> be<00:00:27.749> tuned<00:00:28.019> down<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.919> D<00:00:29.310> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it's designed to be tuned down to D and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
it's designed to be tuned down to D and
below<00:00:29.909> so<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:31.109> pretty<00:00:31.259> much<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.499> baritone

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
below so it's pretty much a baritone

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
below so it's pretty much a baritone
acoustic<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> want<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.850> think<00:00:32.970> about<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
acoustic if you want to think about it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
acoustic if you want to think about it
like<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.100> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.250> ever<00:00:35.399> want<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> normal

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
like that if you ever want a normal

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.340 
like that if you ever want a normal
acoustic<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.720> capo<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
acoustic on it you can just capo the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600 
acoustic on it you can just capo the
second<00:00:37.740> fret<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.220> give<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> normal

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
second fret and that give you a normal

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.030 
second fret and that give you a normal
acoustic<00:00:39.240> but<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.720> really<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.380> this<00:00:40.560> because

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
acoustic but I really like this because

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.580 
acoustic but I really like this because
it's<00:00:41.250> got<00:00:41.370> big<00:00:41.670> deep<00:00:42.000> sounds<00:00:42.450> -<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.990> quite

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it's got big deep sounds - it's quite

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.880 
it's got big deep sounds - it's quite
different<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.310> other<00:00:44.460> acoustics<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.270> there

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
different to other acoustics out there

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.140 
different to other acoustics out there
you<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.040> lot<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.250> bass<00:00:47.400> coming<00:00:47.790> off<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
you get a lot of bass coming off of it

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.600 
you get a lot of bass coming off of it
it's<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.720> good<00:00:48.960> evasion<00:00:49.620> preamp<00:00:50.460> in

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's got a really good evasion preamp in

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.190 
it's got a really good evasion preamp in
there<00:00:50.790> with<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> tuner<00:00:51.330> built<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.630> as<00:00:51.810> well<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
there with the tuner built in as well so

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.540 
there with the tuner built in as well so
if<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.380> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:52.740> live<00:00:52.950> it's<00:00:53.370> great

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
if you want to use it live it's great

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.390 
if you want to use it live it's great
for<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.880> I<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.990> solid<00:00:55.380> spruce<00:00:55.710> top<00:00:56.100> grade

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
for that I got a solid spruce top grade

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.010 
for that I got a solid spruce top grade
a<00:00:56.430> spruce<00:00:56.880> so<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.450> lot<00:00:57.540> of<00:00:57.570> projection

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
a spruce so you get a lot of projection

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.230 
a spruce so you get a lot of projection
out<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.560> think<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.640> sounds<00:00:59.880> really<00:01:00.030> good

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
out of it I think it sounds really good

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.810 
out of it I think it sounds really good
but<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.870> big<00:01:00.990> thing<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.380> is<00:01:01.650> just<00:01:01.820> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
but the big thing about it is just you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
but the big thing about it is just you
can<00:01:02.970> chew<00:01:03.150> blow<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.810> it<00:01:03.930> still<00:01:04.140> sounds

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
can chew blow on it and it still sounds

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
can chew blow on it and it still sounds
great<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:04.799> lots<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.070> definition<00:01:05.579> check<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
great with lots of definition check it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:02:00.430 
great with lots of definition check it
out

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:03:04.080 

you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.120 

Oh
