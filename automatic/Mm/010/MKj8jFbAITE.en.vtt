to<00:05:17.270> see<00:05:17.420> how<00:05:17.870> what<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.710> response<00:05:19.190> would<00:05:19.460> be

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
to see how what the response would be

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.420 
to see how what the response would be
and<00:05:20.350> overwhelmingly<00:05:21.350> this<00:05:21.650> response<00:05:22.190> was

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
and overwhelmingly this response was

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.310 
and overwhelmingly this response was
positive<00:05:22.670> didn't<00:05:23.270> get<00:05:23.360> as<00:05:23.450> many<00:05:23.600> views<00:05:23.870> and<00:05:24.200> I

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
positive didn't get as many views and I

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.290 
positive didn't get as many views and I
wouldn't<00:05:24.800> expect<00:05:25.160> that<00:05:25.340> I'll<00:05:25.730> probably<00:05:25.910> get

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
wouldn't expect that I'll probably get

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.450 
wouldn't expect that I'll probably get
about<00:05:26.390> half<00:05:26.720> as<00:05:26.960> many<00:05:27.140> views<00:05:27.470> as<00:05:27.680> normal<00:05:27.710> but

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
about half as many views as normal but

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.770 
about half as many views as normal but
the<00:05:28.550> people<00:05:28.790> who<00:05:28.910> watched<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.330> seem<00:05:29.510> to<00:05:29.540> really

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
the people who watched it seem to really

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.930 
the people who watched it seem to really
like<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.080> to<00:05:30.440> see<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.650> lot<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.070> old<00:05:31.310> projects

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
like it to see a lot of the old projects

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.730 
like it to see a lot of the old projects
one<00:05:32.180> thing<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.420> realized<00:05:32.810> is<00:05:33.110> how<00:05:33.380> many

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
one thing I realized is how many

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.830 
one thing I realized is how many
projects<00:05:34.490> I've<00:05:34.610> made<00:05:34.910> that<00:05:35.120> are<00:05:35.240> still<00:05:35.540> all

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
projects I've made that are still all

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.810 
projects I've made that are still all
over<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.380> house<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.920> then<00:05:37.040> I<00:05:37.190> kept<00:05:37.520> finding

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
over the house and then I kept finding

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.870 
over the house and then I kept finding
them<00:05:38.300> after<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.230> had<00:05:39.680> shot<00:05:39.950> the<00:05:40.160> video<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:40.610> I<00:05:40.640> had

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
them after I had shot the video so I had

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.450 
them after I had shot the video so I had
a<00:05:40.910> whole<00:05:41.270> bunch<00:05:41.590> I've<00:05:42.590> got<00:05:42.830> sitting<00:05:43.220> out<00:05:43.430> here

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
a whole bunch I've got sitting out here

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.950 
a whole bunch I've got sitting out here
in<00:05:43.640> my<00:05:43.820> shop<00:05:44.060> that<00:05:44.300> I<00:05:44.330> was<00:05:44.450> gonna<00:05:44.570> show<00:05:44.660> on

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
in my shop that I was gonna show on

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.580 
in my shop that I was gonna show on
periscope

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
periscope

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.740 
periscope
but<00:05:45.800> periscope<00:05:46.370> kept<00:05:46.640> cutting<00:05:47.090> out<00:05:47.300> on<00:05:47.540> me

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
but periscope kept cutting out on me

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.990 
but periscope kept cutting out on me
this<00:05:47.990> morning<00:05:48.620> I<00:05:48.830> don't<00:05:49.610> know<00:05:49.700> if<00:05:49.790> there<00:05:49.910> was

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
this morning I don't know if there was

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.390 
this morning I don't know if there was
just<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.210> lot<00:05:50.360> of<00:05:50.390> people<00:05:50.780> using<00:05:51.080> it<00:05:51.440> or<00:05:51.800> what<00:05:52.370> I

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
just a lot of people using it or what I

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.700 
just a lot of people using it or what I
tried<00:05:52.760> it<00:05:52.910> on<00:05:53.000> Wi-Fi<00:05:53.510> I<00:05:53.540> tried<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:53.930> on<00:05:53.990> 4G<00:05:54.530> but

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
tried it on Wi-Fi I tried it on 4G but

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.380 
tried it on Wi-Fi I tried it on 4G but
it<00:05:54.800> just<00:05:54.950> kept<00:05:55.070> losing<00:05:55.490> its<00:05:55.670> connection<00:05:56.210> so

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
it just kept losing its connection so

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.240 
it just kept losing its connection so
I'll<00:05:56.900> try<00:05:57.230> that<00:05:57.260> again

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
I'll try that again

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.820 
I'll try that again
this<00:05:58.640> afternoon<00:05:59.180> you're<00:05:59.330> probably<00:05:59.840> if<00:06:00.530> it

this afternoon you're probably if it

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.020 
this afternoon you're probably if it
works<00:06:01.040> you'll<00:06:01.220> probably<00:06:01.370> have<00:06:01.580> already<00:06:01.700> seen

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
works you'll probably have already seen

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.450 
works you'll probably have already seen
it<00:06:02.180> by<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.420> time<00:06:02.630> I<00:06:02.660> added<00:06:03.290> this<00:06:03.410> video<00:06:03.800> down<00:06:04.160> I

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
it by the time I added this video down I

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.310 
it by the time I added this video down I
don't<00:06:04.760> know<00:06:04.850> how<00:06:05.030> many<00:06:05.090> projects<00:06:05.960> I've<00:06:06.080> made

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
don't know how many projects I've made

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.220 
don't know how many projects I've made
probably<00:06:06.970> 350<00:06:07.970> more<00:06:08.450> than<00:06:08.660> that<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:08.840> don't<00:06:09.020> know

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
probably 350 more than that I don't know

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.760 
probably 350 more than that I don't know
3<00:06:09.470> 400<00:06:10.150> over<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.270> years<00:06:11.510> I<00:06:11.810> probably<00:06:12.530> have

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
3 400 over the years I probably have

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.190 
3 400 over the years I probably have
about<00:06:12.920> half<00:06:13.280> of<00:06:13.550> those<00:06:13.880> still<00:06:14.450> in<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:15.020> house

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
about half of those still in the house

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.020 
about half of those still in the house
and<00:06:15.620> then<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.860> other<00:06:16.010> half<00:06:16.280> IVs<00:06:16.670> are<00:06:16.790> giving

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
and then the other half IVs are giving

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.600 
and then the other half IVs are giving
them<00:06:17.150> away<00:06:17.360> they've<00:06:17.840> been<00:06:18.020> gifts<00:06:18.770> I've<00:06:19.160> opted

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
them away they've been gifts I've opted

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.490 
them away they've been gifts I've opted
them<00:06:19.790> off<00:06:19.940> or<00:06:20.240> some<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.900> them<00:06:21.050> I've<00:06:21.290> just

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
them off or some of them I've just

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.020 
them off or some of them I've just
thrown<00:06:21.740> away<00:06:21.830> I<00:06:21.980> didn't<00:06:22.310> need<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.730> really<00:06:22.820> got

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
thrown away I didn't need it really got

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.730 
thrown away I didn't need it really got
me<00:06:23.150> thinking<00:06:23.330> after<00:06:23.750> looking<00:06:24.020> at<00:06:24.140> my<00:06:24.200> outdoor

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
me thinking after looking at my outdoor

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.530 
me thinking after looking at my outdoor
projects<00:06:25.310> and<00:06:25.490> how<00:06:25.580> they've<00:06:25.790> weathered<00:06:26.090> is

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
projects and how they've weathered is

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.920 
projects and how they've weathered is
that<00:06:26.810> I'm<00:06:27.260> not<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.800> sure<00:06:27.830> that<00:06:28.520> applying<00:06:29.419> an

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
that I'm not so sure that applying an

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.380 
that I'm not so sure that applying an
outdoor<00:06:30.680> finish<00:06:31.070> does<00:06:31.340> any<00:06:31.520> good<00:06:31.790> when<00:06:32.180> I<00:06:32.210> look

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
outdoor finish does any good when I look

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.610 
outdoor finish does any good when I look
at<00:06:32.510> my

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
at my

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.800 
at my
outdoor<00:06:34.070> patio<00:06:34.639> table<00:06:35.120> which<00:06:35.240> I<00:06:35.389> finished

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
outdoor patio table which I finished

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.560 
outdoor patio table which I finished
with<00:06:36.110> polyurethane<00:06:37.180> several<00:06:38.180> coats<00:06:38.389> of

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
with polyurethane several coats of

with polyurethane several coats of
polyurethane<00:06:39.199> outdoor<00:06:39.979> exterior

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
polyurethane outdoor exterior

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.719 
polyurethane outdoor exterior
polyurethane<00:06:41.650> compared<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:42.860> with<00:06:43.220> my

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:43.729 
polyurethane compared that with my

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.110 
polyurethane compared that with my
planter<00:06:44.720> that<00:06:45.260> I<00:06:45.290> made<00:06:45.740> as<00:06:46.010> an<00:06:46.550> experiment

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
planter that I made as an experiment

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.510 
planter that I made as an experiment
using<00:06:47.270> no<00:06:47.870> finish<00:06:48.410> and<00:06:48.590> that<00:06:48.800> was<00:06:49.010> had<00:06:49.250> to<00:06:49.280> been

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
using no finish and that was had to been

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.629 
using no finish and that was had to been
a<00:06:49.550> year<00:06:49.970> before<00:06:50.150> I<00:06:50.360> made<00:06:50.750> the<00:06:51.310> table<00:06:52.310> there's

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
a year before I made the table there's

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.310 
a year before I made the table there's
not<00:06:52.790> much<00:06:52.970> difference<00:06:53.180> between<00:06:53.750> those<00:06:53.930> I'm

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
not much difference between those I'm

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.750 
not much difference between those I'm
not<00:06:54.590> sure<00:06:54.740> what<00:06:54.949> to<00:06:55.070> make<00:06:55.340> of<00:06:55.370> that

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
not sure what to make of that

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.870 
not sure what to make of that
maybe<00:06:56.150> there's<00:06:56.510> certain<00:06:57.470> really<00:06:58.280> high-end

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
maybe there's certain really high-end

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.480 
maybe there's certain really high-end
finishes<00:06:59.570> you<00:06:59.780> can<00:06:59.810> get<00:07:00.199> to<00:07:00.410> protect<00:07:00.860> outdoor

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
finishes you can get to protect outdoor

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.689 
finishes you can get to protect outdoor
projects<00:07:02.060> but<00:07:02.270> I<00:07:02.510> think<00:07:03.080> Sun<00:07:03.860> and<00:07:04.190> rain<00:07:04.400> is

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
projects but I think Sun and rain is

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:07.779 
projects but I think Sun and rain is
just<00:07:04.940> going<00:07:05.150> to<00:07:05.330> destroy<00:07:06.139> any<00:07:06.800> finish<00:07:07.340> but

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789 
just going to destroy any finish but

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.610 
just going to destroy any finish but
again<00:07:08.210> I<00:07:08.389> look<00:07:08.570> at<00:07:08.660> my<00:07:08.750> purple<00:07:09.169> bench<00:07:09.410> out

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
again I look at my purple bench out

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.650 
again I look at my purple bench out
front<00:07:09.919> and<00:07:10.039> it<00:07:10.340> looks<00:07:10.610> as<00:07:10.789> good<00:07:10.880> as<00:07:11.090> the<00:07:11.330> day<00:07:11.630> I

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
front and it looks as good as the day I

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.689 
front and it looks as good as the day I
put<00:07:11.990> it<00:07:12.139> out<00:07:12.229> there<00:07:12.289> this<00:07:12.979> Friday's<00:07:13.400> video<00:07:13.520> I

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
put it out there this Friday's video I

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.909 
put it out there this Friday's video I
think<00:07:13.940> I'm<00:07:14.030> gonna<00:07:14.150> do<00:07:14.330> an<00:07:14.510> electronic<00:07:15.139> project

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
think I'm gonna do an electronic project

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.000 
think I'm gonna do an electronic project
I<00:07:16.070> when<00:07:16.460> I<00:07:16.490> was<00:07:16.669> at<00:07:16.789> Maker<00:07:17.060> Faire<00:07:17.180> I<00:07:17.720> met<00:07:18.680> these

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:23.139 
amps and they make this little

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.360 
amps and they make this little
electronic<00:07:24.139> component<00:07:24.770> that<00:07:24.830> allows<00:07:25.070> you<00:07:25.250> to

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
electronic component that allows you to

your<00:07:27.800> phone<00:07:28.220> so<00:07:29.090> I<00:07:29.120> think<00:07:29.330> I'm<00:07:29.479> gonna<00:07:29.600> do<00:07:29.720> that

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.810 
your phone so I think I'm gonna do that
make<00:07:30.050> a<00:07:30.080> little<00:07:30.260> boombox<00:07:30.979> and<00:07:31.340> it<00:07:31.490> looks

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:31.820

make a little boombox and it looks
really<00:07:31.940> cool<00:07:32.180> I<00:07:32.240> got<00:07:32.510> the<00:07:32.660> kit<00:07:32.930> and<00:07:33.169> so<00:07:33.860> I'll

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:34.039 
really cool I got the kit and so I'll

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:35.860 
really cool I got the kit and so I'll
try<00:07:34.190> to<00:07:34.280> assemble<00:07:34.760> it<00:07:34.910> it's<00:07:35.090> been<00:07:35.300> years<00:07:35.720> since

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.110 
try to assemble it it's been years since
I've<00:07:36.199> soldered<00:07:36.530> anything<00:07:37.310> in<00:07:37.430> fact<00:07:37.550> I<00:07:37.700> think<00:07:38.060> I

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
need to get a new soldering iron and

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.200 
need to get a new soldering iron and
some<00:07:40.099> solder<00:07:40.370> they're<00:07:40.669> not<00:07:40.789> gonna<00:07:40.880> sponsor

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.050 
and you can make these amplifiers out of

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.320 
and you can make these amplifiers out of
anything<00:07:45.380> so<00:07:45.860> I<00:07:45.889> think<00:07:46.340> it'll<00:07:46.460> be<00:07:46.610> fun<00:07:46.820> that's
