00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.030 
the short class the captaincy is a
massive<00:03:57.370> learning<00:03:57.490> curve<00:03:57.820> for<00:03:58.000> me<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:59.620> was<00:03:59.800> a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
massive learning curve for me it was a

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.800 
massive learning curve for me it was a
massive<00:04:00.460> honor<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.820> take<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.120> on<00:04:01.240> towards<00:04:01.720> the

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
massive honor to take it on towards the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.870 
massive honor to take it on towards the
end<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:01.960> last<00:04:02.080> season<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:03.490> think<00:04:03.700> I've<00:04:03.850> made

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
end of last season and I think I've made

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.310 
end of last season and I think I've made
improvements<00:04:04.570> but<00:04:04.720> I<00:04:04.750> still<00:04:04.930> got<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.080> long<00:04:05.230> way

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
improvements but I still got a long way

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:13.560 
improvements but I still got a long way
