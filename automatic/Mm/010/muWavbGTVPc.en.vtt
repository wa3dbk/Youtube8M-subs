everyone to remember that I just cling a
little<00:00:02.970> bit<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:04.110> airflow<00:00:05.040> sensor<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:06.029> just

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
little bit the airflow sensor is just

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.350 
little bit the airflow sensor is just
located<00:00:06.990> right<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:08.970> these<00:00:09.510> things<00:00:09.780> are

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
located right here so these things are

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.789 
located right here so these things are
we're<00:00:12.360> going<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.630> just<00:00:12.870> clean<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.349> out<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.679> a

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
we're going to just clean it out with a

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.210 
we're going to just clean it out with a
little<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:14.969> just<00:00:15.680> pushing<00:00:16.680> dots<00:00:16.949> or

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
little you know just pushing dots or

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210 
little you know just pushing dots or
pushing<00:00:18.150> air<00:00:18.539> compressor<00:00:19.410> here<00:00:19.680> into<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
pushing air compressor here into the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.240 
pushing air compressor here into the
flow<00:00:20.460> sensor<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.990> order<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.260> remove

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
on the B&amp;W just like an eagle pin so he

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.890 
on the B&amp;W just like an eagle pin so he
has<00:00:29.400> another<00:00:29.699> pin<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> pin

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
has another pin here I'm going to pin

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.740 
has another pin here I'm going to pin
here<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.920> remove<00:00:32.309> those<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.600> you're

going to be able to remove this part

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.360 
going to be able to remove this part
this<00:00:38.100> where<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.120> air<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.660> flowing<00:00:40.040> and<00:00:41.040> this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
this where the air is flowing and this

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.160 
this where the air is flowing and this
is<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> filter<00:00:42.120> cover<00:00:42.390> having<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is the filter cover having kind of

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.069 
is the filter cover having kind of
watches<00:00:43.710> over<00:00:43.980> here<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.399> another<00:00:45.300> one<00:00:45.600> unit

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
watches over here as another one unit

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.069 
watches over here as another one unit
has<00:00:46.200> another<00:00:46.559> day<00:00:46.890> around<00:00:47.840> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.020> just

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
has another day around you can just

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.479 
has another day around you can just
after<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:49.980> remove<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.870> and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
after that you can just remove it and

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.279 
after that you can just remove it and
after<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.520> remove<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.110> see

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
after you remove it just you will see

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
after you remove it just you will see
the<00:00:55.410> filter<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.340> here<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:57.629> here<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:57.960> where

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the filter right here and here is where

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.479 
the filter right here and here is where
it<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.460> airflow<00:01:00.030> sensor<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
it is the airflow sensor this is the the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.289 
it is the airflow sensor this is the the
unit<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.769> order<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> clean<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:06.119> use

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
unit so in order to clean it you can use

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
unit so in order to clean it you can use
a<00:01:06.570> toggle<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.310> does<00:01:09.110> just<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:12.350> compress<00:01:13.350> air

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
a toggle that does just to compress air

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.870 
a toggle that does just to compress air
just<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> clear<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.880> little<00:01:15.210> value<00:01:16.640> like<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
just to clear a little value like this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.590 
just to clear a little value like this
yes

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
yes

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.630 
yes
my<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.170> fine<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> special

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
my is fine but if you can get a special

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.640 
my is fine but if you can get a special
high<00:01:23.640> airflow<00:01:24.090> sensor<00:01:24.960> cleaner<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.439> would

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
high airflow sensor cleaner I would

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.230 
high airflow sensor cleaner I would
recommend<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.340> three<00:01:27.150> antennas<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:28.200> there

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
recommend it three antennas right there

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.560 
recommend it three antennas right there
there's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.450> piece<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.170> metal<00:01:31.590> just

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
there's a little piece of metal just

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.819 
there's a little piece of metal just
sensor<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.869> air<00:01:34.140> when<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> passing

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
sensor in the air when the passing

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.030 
sensor in the air when the passing
through<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> engine<00:01:36.500> using<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.650> little

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
through the engine using like little

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:47.350 
through the engine using like little
compressed<00:01:38.520> air<00:01:38.810> can<00:01:40.970> clean<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.420> bit

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.690 

that<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.600> help<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> system<00:01:49.759> work<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:53.810> so

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
that will help the system work on you so

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.160 
that will help the system work on you so
this<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.939> would<00:01:57.060> increase<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> power<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this one would increase the power of the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.300 
this one would increase the power of the
car<00:01:58.610> it's<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> help<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.420> work<00:02:00.810> better<00:02:01.310> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
car it's going to help to work better so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
car it's going to help to work better so
you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.549> put<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.240> back<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.049> is

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you can put your it in back so this is

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.100 
you can put your it in back so this is
how<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.189> this<00:02:05.820> B&amp;W<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.869> have

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
how it is the in this B&amp;W that I have

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290 
how it is the in this B&amp;W that I have
right<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.459> actually<00:02:08.910> really<00:02:09.090> nice

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
right here it is actually really nice

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.469 
right here it is actually really nice
car

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
car

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.839 
car
very<00:02:10.899> strong<00:02:11.580> that's<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:13.150> lot<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.420> power

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
very strong that's a lot of power

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.369 
very strong that's a lot of power
sometimes<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.000> more<00:02:16.299> or<00:02:16.480> you<00:02:16.629> feel<00:02:16.930> like<00:02:17.170> it's

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
sometimes you more or you feel like it's

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.250 
sometimes you more or you feel like it's
shaking<00:02:17.830> whatever<00:02:18.250> did<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.790> do<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.239> you<00:02:19.569> feel

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
shaking whatever did it do to you feel

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.050 
shaking whatever did it do to you feel
like<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:20.620> some<00:02:20.799> kind<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:21.159> spark<00:02:21.700> plug<00:02:21.970> or

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
like it's some kind of spark plug or

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.289 
like it's some kind of spark plug or
whatever<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.569> not<00:02:22.870> is<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.580> actually<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
whatever is not is it is actually the

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.630 
whatever is not is it is actually the
airflow<00:02:25.900> sensor<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.470> had<00:02:26.680> issues<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.280> sometimes

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
airflow sensor I had issues so sometimes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.280 
airflow sensor I had issues so sometimes
although<00:02:28.030> sometimes<00:02:28.420> it's<00:02:28.750> 30

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
although sometimes it's 30
