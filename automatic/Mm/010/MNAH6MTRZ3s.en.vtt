00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
making contact with its kind of punching

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.800 
making contact with its kind of punching
it<00:02:28.080> out<00:02:28.200> almost<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.180> with<00:02:30.180> how<00:02:30.330> their<00:02:30.510> arms

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.600

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
would be webbing on that ball you know

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.660 
would be webbing on that ball you know
spin<00:02:32.970> or<00:02:33.180> I'll<00:02:33.269> kind<00:02:33.510> okay<00:02:34.230> it's<00:02:35.129> believable

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
spin or I'll kind okay it's believable

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.729 
spin or I'll kind okay it's believable
this<00:02:36.000> looks<00:02:36.330> believable<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> fumble

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
this looks believable as a fumble

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.979 
this looks believable as a fumble
animation<00:02:38.310> could<00:02:39.030> look<00:02:39.239> better<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.780> it's

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
animation could look better but it's

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.770 
animation could look better but it's
believable<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:42.239> think<00:02:42.450> should<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.629> more

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
believable and I think should be more

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.910 
believable and I think should be more
