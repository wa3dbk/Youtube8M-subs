 the events from the heart betz brooms were clearly too much for 1 6 clear 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.419
 farewell 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.950
 At the beginning of the second part, the army is in a straitjacket and has to go out 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 escape the research labs of a space station 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.700
 I think the Space Station sports on a small moon of Saturn 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.700
 also offer little table and playful new 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.730
 Developer Visceral Games has by and large been good when 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.730
 functioning formula of the predecessor held 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.610
 there are a few new weapons and options wm opponents micromorph to 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 to distribute 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.269
 also for example passage 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:45.579
 in the 1 16 a Mansfield 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.579
 flying through space 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.750
 Nevertheless, for the sake of 2, it feels different 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.500
 the battles are faster 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.280
 alternate regularly with beautiful to look at Storey sequences 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 and players move in new environments in each chapter 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.460
 about half an hour 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.380
 At a workbench the own equipment is improved 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 what the whole plays a shallow roles are standing 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.380
 especially the sections in weightlessness are impressive again 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.570
 Great house to be and are very atmospheric 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.570
 The latter also applies to the plot of the title 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.350
 After about 16 hours, players can happily put the gamepad aside 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 or start over 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.659
 Dead Space 2 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.659
 has not been invented from scratch 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.770
 as part 1 pisa test adults with strong nerves first-rate space 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.690
 Action 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.289
 many who have no experience 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.819
 It is said to have murder but can also confidently 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.750
 make up for the now very favorable first part 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.780
 unless they value life on the new multiplayer mode 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.320
 All in all, Dead Space 2 is a typical successor 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.150
 which is a lot of fun
