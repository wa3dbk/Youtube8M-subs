it goes up to 28 miles per hour and it
does<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.029> with<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.390> pedal<00:00:24.779> assist<00:00:25.050> only

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
does that with the pedal assist only

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.920 
does that with the pedal assist only
function<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.939> no<00:00:27.180> throttle<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
function there is no throttle on this

function there is no throttle on this
bike<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.740> all<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.460> let's<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
bike so all right let's get into the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.150 
bike so all right let's get into the
details<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> unique<00:00:32.130> things

details so one of the unique things
about<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.850> 2b<00:00:33.149> bikes<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.660> they<00:00:33.809> look<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> little

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
about a 2b bikes is they look a little

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
about a 2b bikes is they look a little
bit<00:00:34.440> different<00:00:34.860> than<00:00:35.040> traditional<00:00:35.610> electric

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
bit different than traditional electric

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.990 
bit different than traditional electric
bikes<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.739> rectangular<00:00:38.730> style

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
bikes they have this rectangular style

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.959 
bikes they have this rectangular style
box<00:00:39.570> tubing<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> aluminum<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
box tubing here and this is aluminum and

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880 
box tubing here and this is aluminum and
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.660> see<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> has<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> pretty<00:00:43.410> nice<00:00:43.530> step

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
you can see it has a pretty nice step

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.619 
you can see it has a pretty nice step
through<00:00:44.129> area<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.760> makes<00:00:44.940> getting<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.420> and

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
through area so it makes getting on and

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.510 
through area so it makes getting on and
off<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.750> bike<00:00:45.989> pretty<00:00:46.260> easy<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> then<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
off the bike pretty easy and then you

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
off the bike pretty easy and then you
can<00:00:47.670> see<00:00:47.879> where<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> battery<00:00:48.660> pack<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
can see where the battery pack is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.709 
can see where the battery pack is
mounted<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.489> actually<00:00:50.850> slides<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
mounted there it actually slides on to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.270 
mounted there it actually slides on to
that<00:00:51.870> part<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> frame<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.920> below<00:00:53.129> the

can also see the internal cable routing
here<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> frame<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.150> again<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:12.479> kind

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
here on the frame so again it just kind

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.980 
here on the frame so again it just kind
of<00:01:12.750> keeps<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.200> whole<00:01:13.409> design<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:14.159> clean

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
of keeps the whole design pretty clean

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
of keeps the whole design pretty clean
this<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> 500<00:01:16.830> watt<00:01:16.950> direct<00:01:17.369> drive<00:01:17.580> rear

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this is the 500 watt direct drive rear

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.850 
this is the 500 watt direct drive rear
hub<00:01:18.090> motor<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.869> helps<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.290> up<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> 28

and speaking that you can see the TM m4

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
and speaking that you can see the TM m4
torque<00:01:26.220> sensor<00:01:26.549> here<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:26.970> mounted<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
torque sensor here it's mounted right on

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.080 
torque sensor here it's mounted right on
the<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> frame<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.700> basically

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the back of the frame and that basically

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.700 
the back of the frame and that basically
senses<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:30.689> much<00:01:30.869> pedal<00:01:31.229> power<00:01:31.409> you're

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
senses how much pedal power you're

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
senses how much pedal power you're
putting<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.460> depending<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.780> pedal

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
putting in and depending on which pedal

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
putting in and depending on which pedal
assist<00:01:34.470> level<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.950> selected<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.060> will

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
assist level you selected it will

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.990 
assist level you selected it will
provide<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.780> proportional<00:01:37.850> assistance<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
provide the proportional assistance to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.690 
provide the proportional assistance to
you<00:01:39.290> also<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:40.770> here<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.310> see

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you also in the back here you can see

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.380 
you also in the back here you can see
there's<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> eight<00:01:42.810> speed<00:01:43.729> freewheel<00:01:44.729> system

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
there's the eight speed freewheel system

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.240 
there's the eight speed freewheel system
and<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.290> Shimano<00:01:46.649> XT<00:01:46.950> rear<00:01:47.520> derailleur

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
and the Shimano XT rear derailleur

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.399 
and the Shimano XT rear derailleur
alright<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.729> 36<00:01:51.329> volt<00:01:51.600> 13<00:01:52.140> point

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
alright so this is the 36 volt 13 point

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.010 
alright so this is the 36 volt 13 point
2<00:01:52.680> amp<00:01:52.979> hour<00:01:53.220> lithium-ion<00:01:53.939> battery<00:01:54.450> pack<00:01:54.509> on
