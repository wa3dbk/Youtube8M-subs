I'm out here today to do a little random
driving<00:00:14.690> with<00:00:14.870> this<00:00:15.050> Bosch<00:00:15.410> or<00:00:15.650> le<00:00:15.920> carré

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
driving with this Bosch or le carré

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.529 
driving with this Bosch or le carré
party<00:00:17.720> to<00:00:17.900> get<00:00:18.290> to<00:00:18.349> know<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:18.590> the<00:00:19.070> car<00:00:19.279> and<00:00:19.640> see

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
party to get to know to the car and see

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.099 
party to get to know to the car and see
how<00:00:20.750> it<00:00:20.900> holds<00:00:21.260> up<00:00:21.500> on<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.920> tarmac<00:00:22.220> so<00:00:22.840> here<00:00:23.840> we

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
how it holds up on the tarmac so here we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:01:07.330 
how it holds up on the tarmac so here we
go<00:00:57.670> it's<00:01:00.609> reasonably<00:01:01.609> fast<00:01:02.030> I'd<00:01:02.449> say<00:01:06.340> it's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
go it's reasonably fast I'd say it's

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:19.179 
go it's reasonably fast I'd say it's
really<00:01:07.760> lacking<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.330> grip<00:01:08.659> by<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.080> way<00:01:18.189> well

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
really lacking in grip by the way well

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.530 
really lacking in grip by the way well
you<00:01:19.790> can<00:01:19.970> actually<00:01:20.540> drift<00:01:21.259> with<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.250> car<00:01:22.540> like

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
you can actually drift with the car like

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.800 
you can actually drift with the car like
this

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.780 

that's<00:01:28.810> nice<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:31.710> course<00:01:32.710> there<00:01:32.980> are<00:01:33.010> benefits

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
that's nice of course there are benefits

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.200 
that's nice of course there are benefits
to<00:01:34.470> not<00:01:35.470> having<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:36.040> much<00:01:36.280> grip<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.850> tires

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
to not having that much grip the tires

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.200 
to not having that much grip the tires
won't<00:01:37.630> wear<00:01:37.990> out<00:01:38.230> that's<00:01:38.530> fast<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.940> car

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
won't wear out that's fast and the car

00:01:40.210 --> 00:03:08.790 
won't wear out that's fast and the car
won't<00:01:40.450> flip<00:01:40.990> over<00:01:41.820> super<00:01:42.820> fast

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.140 

yeah<00:03:09.800> acceleration<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.819> quite<00:03:11.300> good<00:03:11.660> I'd<00:03:12.050> say

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
yeah acceleration is quite good I'd say

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.710 
yeah acceleration is quite good I'd say
of<00:03:14.150> course<00:03:14.480> not<00:03:15.970> enough<00:03:16.970> grip<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:17.660> go<00:03:18.170> to

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
of course not enough grip to go to

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.860 
of course not enough grip to go to
accelerate<00:03:20.720> without<00:03:20.900> without<00:03:21.319> spin<00:03:21.680> what<00:03:25.870> not

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
accelerate without without spin what not

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.309 
accelerate without without spin what not
super<00:03:27.260> bad

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.410 

top<00:03:33.319> speed<00:03:33.680> who<00:03:33.890> could<00:03:34.819> have<00:03:34.940> been<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.150> bit

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
top speed who could have been a bit

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:52.530 
top speed who could have been a bit
higher<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:47.319> should<00:03:48.319> add<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:51.220> almost

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
higher I should add that it's almost

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.250 
higher I should add that it's almost
freezing<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:55.010> will<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.540> lipo

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
freezing so that will have the lipo

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:47.230 
freezing so that will have the lipo
suffering<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.220> bit

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:56.810 

nice<00:04:53.510> okay<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:55.770> should<00:04:55.980> do<00:04:56.160> for<00:04:56.190> now

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
nice okay that should do for now

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.930 
nice okay that should do for now

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
videos I'll do real comparisons with

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.680 
videos I'll do real comparisons with
this<00:05:03.150> car<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.600> other<00:05:03.810> cars<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.530> I'll<00:05:05.160> do<00:05:05.340> some

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
this car to other cars and I'll do some

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.770 
this car to other cars and I'll do some
gravel<00:05:06.690> driving<00:05:07.230> as<00:05:07.380> well<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:08.610> see<00:05:09.450> you<00:05:09.570> back

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
gravel driving as well so see you back

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.220 
gravel driving as well so see you back
in<00:05:09.990> another<00:05:10.290> video<00:05:10.530> bye<00:05:11.160> bye
