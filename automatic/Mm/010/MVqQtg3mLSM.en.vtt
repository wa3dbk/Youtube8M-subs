I'm<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> Man<00:01:56.640> United<00:01:57.000> fan<00:01:57.180> I'll<00:01:58.079> try<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.560> be

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I'm a Man United fan I'll try not to be

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.800 
I'm a Man United fan I'll try not to be
as<00:01:58.829> buy<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.100> i'll<00:01:59.460> try<00:01:59.759> not<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.000> be<00:02:00.090> biased<00:02:00.270> but

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
as buy it i'll try not to be biased but

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.920 
as buy it i'll try not to be biased but
um<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.740> reckon<00:02:02.250> United<00:02:02.549> will<00:02:02.790> win<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.180> but

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
um I reckon United will win this but

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
um I reckon United will win this but
I've<00:02:04.110> seen<00:02:04.380> them<00:02:04.560> last<00:02:05.130> year<00:02:05.310> they<00:02:05.579> did

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
I've seen them last year they did

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.290 
I've seen them last year they did
struggle<00:02:06.509> against<00:02:06.990> sides<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:08.039> Braga<00:02:08.340> but

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
struggle against sides like Braga but

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.170 
struggle against sides like Braga but
hopefully<00:02:10.110> if<00:02:10.379> United<00:02:10.619> play<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
hopefully if United play well and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.970 
hopefully if United play well and
rise<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.900> occasion<00:02:12.989> they'll<00:02:13.620> beat<00:02:13.799> them

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
rise to the occasion they'll beat them

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.289 
rise to the occasion they'll beat them
to<00:02:14.760> nil<00:02:14.969> I<00:02:15.120> reckon<00:02:15.450> ah<00:02:15.659> but<00:02:16.500> who<00:02:17.069> knows<00:02:17.790> Braga

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
to nil I reckon ah but who knows Braga

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.610 
to nil I reckon ah but who knows Braga
could<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:19.680> next<00:02:19.969> FC<00:02:20.969> Basel<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.620> knock

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
could be the next FC Basel and knock

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.160 
could be the next FC Basel and knock
United<00:02:23.069> oh<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.400> Champions<00:02:23.969> League<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.480> the

United oh the Champions League in the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.380 
United oh the Champions League in the
group<00:02:25.349> stages<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:26.219> like<00:02:26.670> what<00:02:27.030> happened

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
group stages that like what happened

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.709 
group stages that like what happened
last<00:02:27.569> year<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.790> all<00:02:29.939> have<00:02:29.969> to<00:02:30.150> wait<00:02:30.510> and

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
last year but we all have to wait and

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.500 
last year but we all have to wait and
see<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:32.250> course<00:02:32.280> into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.939> final<00:02:33.359> game

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
see and of course into the final game

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.149 
see and of course into the final game
which<00:02:33.719> I'll<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:33.989> looking<00:02:34.290> at<00:02:34.439> on<00:02:34.620> Tuesday

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
which I'll be looking at on Tuesday

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.459 
which I'll be looking at on Tuesday
night<00:02:35.340> which<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.760> Shakhtar<00:02:36.540> vs<00:02:36.989> chelsea

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
night which is Shakhtar vs chelsea

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.089 
night which is Shakhtar vs chelsea
probably<00:02:38.400> one<00:02:38.549> of<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.730> biggest<00:02:38.909> games<00:02:39.319> on<00:02:40.319> the

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
probably one of the biggest games on the

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.869 
probably one of the biggest games on the
Tuesday<00:02:41.519> night<00:02:42.200> Shakhtar<00:02:43.200> were<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.489> UEFA<00:02:44.849> Cup

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
Tuesday night Shakhtar were the UEFA Cup

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.149 
Tuesday night Shakhtar were the UEFA Cup
champions<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.780> while<00:02:46.019> ago<00:02:46.349> a<00:02:46.590> few<00:02:46.799> years<00:02:46.950> ago

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
champions a while ago a few years ago

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.429 
champions a while ago a few years ago
and<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.750> reckon<00:02:49.970> Chelsea<00:02:50.970> will<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> very<00:02:52.319> good

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
and I reckon Chelsea will be a very good

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.890 
and I reckon Chelsea will be a very good
match<00:02:52.709> for<00:02:52.739> Shakhtar<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.760> chapter<00:02:54.659> will<00:02:54.780> be

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
match for Shakhtar and chapter will be

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.539 
match for Shakhtar and chapter will be
very<00:02:55.500> good<00:02:55.680> much<00:02:55.859> for<00:02:56.099> chelsea<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.459> course

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
very good much for chelsea of course

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.520 
very good much for chelsea of course
chelsea<00:02:57.540> being<00:02:57.719> the<00:02:58.019> champions<00:02:58.500> league

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
chelsea being the champions league

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.390 
chelsea being the champions league
champions<00:02:59.129> and<00:02:59.689> i<00:03:00.689> reckon<00:03:01.469> you<00:03:01.739> know<00:03:01.859> what<00:03:02.099> I'm

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
champions and i reckon you know what I'm

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.509 
champions and i reckon you know what I'm
gonna<00:03:02.819> go<00:03:03.030> over<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.269> old<00:03:03.629> drawn<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.200> one<00:03:04.519> just

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
gonna go over to old drawn this one just

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.509 
gonna go over to old drawn this one just
because<00:03:05.909> I<00:03:06.389> think<00:03:06.870> if<00:03:07.109> Shakhtar<00:03:07.799> play<00:03:08.280> well

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
because I think if Shakhtar play well

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.979 
because I think if Shakhtar play well
they<00:03:09.060> can<00:03:09.709> match<00:03:10.709> Chelsey<00:03:11.219> on<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:12.659> sort<00:03:12.959> of

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
they can match Chelsey on that sort of

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.849 
they can match Chelsey on that sort of
level<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.769> they<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.069> at<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.870> hopefully

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
level that they are at but hopefully

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.319 
level that they are at but hopefully
that<00:03:17.010> crap<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.549> prediction<00:03:17.970> will<00:03:18.209> be

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
that crap that prediction will be

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.849 
that crap that prediction will be
correct<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.019> it'd<00:03:19.440> be<00:03:19.560> quite<00:03:19.709> embarrassing

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
correct and it'd be quite embarrassing

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.830 
correct and it'd be quite embarrassing
if<00:03:20.430> Chelsea<00:03:20.879> beat<00:03:21.060> them<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.419> three<00:03:21.720> or<00:03:21.810> four

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
if Chelsea beat them like three or four

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.530 
if Chelsea beat them like three or four
now<00:03:22.169> which<00:03:22.889> they<00:03:23.069> could<00:03:23.220> end<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.519> doing<00:03:23.879> but<00:03:24.359> I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
now which they could end up doing but I

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.770 
now which they could end up doing but I
reckon<00:03:24.959> I'll<00:03:25.049> be<00:03:25.139> two<00:03:25.319> new<00:03:25.639> on<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.970> Wednesday's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
reckon I'll be two new on to Wednesday's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.409 
reckon I'll be two new on to Wednesday's
games<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.189> first<00:03:29.430> one<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.760> picked<00:03:30.030> out<00:03:30.120> was

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
games and the first one I picked out was

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.830 
games and the first one I picked out was
arsenal<00:03:30.959> vs<00:03:31.560> shulk<00:03:31.889> a<00:03:32.099> shell<00:03:33.090> gated<00:03:33.419> make<00:03:33.629> it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
arsenal vs shulk a shell gated make it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.929 
arsenal vs shulk a shell gated make it
quite<00:03:34.439> far<00:03:34.680> last<00:03:35.010> year<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> Champions

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:35.939 
quite far last year in the Champions

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.479 
quite far last year in the Champions
League<00:03:36.030> but<00:03:36.989> Arsenal<00:03:37.590> have<00:03:37.949> been<00:03:38.129> in<00:03:38.280> quite

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
League but Arsenal have been in quite

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.379 
League but Arsenal have been in quite
good<00:03:38.549> form<00:03:39.199> as<00:03:40.199> of<00:03:40.500> yet<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.239> Podolski's<00:03:42.239> been

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
good form as of yet and Podolski's been

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.719 
good form as of yet and Podolski's been
in<00:03:42.509> good<00:03:42.599> form<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:43.139> giroux<00:03:43.590> well<00:03:44.370> knows<00:03:44.519> not

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
in good form and giroux well knows not

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:48.140 
in good form and giroux well knows not
sure<00:03:44.909> ooh<00:03:44.939> sorry<00:03:45.299> sandy<00:03:46.229> Carolla<00:03:46.879> all<00:03:47.879> them

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
sure ooh sorry sandy Carolla all them

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.240 
sure ooh sorry sandy Carolla all them
all<00:03:48.720> those<00:03:49.109> players<00:03:49.500> have<00:03:49.709> been<00:03:49.769> playing<00:03:50.040> very

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
all those players have been playing very

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.179 
all those players have been playing very
well<00:03:50.519> for<00:03:50.729> our<00:03:50.790> snow<00:03:51.120> recently<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.829> think

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
well for our snow recently and I think

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.429 
well for our snow recently and I think
Arsenal<00:03:53.939> probably<00:03:54.329> beat<00:03:54.479> shell<00:03:54.750> gate<00:03:54.989> 21

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
Arsenal probably beat shell gate 21

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.619 
Arsenal probably beat shell gate 21
she'll<00:03:55.889> go<00:03:56.009> probably<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.519> able<00:03:56.669> to<00:03:56.819> get<00:03:57.180> one

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
she'll go probably be able to get one

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.649 
she'll go probably be able to get one
honor<00:03:57.959> over<00:03:58.500> on<00:03:58.620> our<00:03:58.769> snow<00:03:59.040> but<00:03:59.489> i<00:03:59.790> reckon

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
honor over on our snow but i reckon

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.819

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
which is aa quite a good matchup if you

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.659 
which is aa quite a good matchup if you
think<00:04:17.699> about<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.030> acts<00:04:19.190> used<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.459> quite

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
think about it acts used to be quite

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.120 
think about it acts used to be quite
good<00:04:20.940> side<00:04:21.209> they<00:04:21.630> still<00:04:21.840> are<00:04:22.019> but<00:04:22.130> they

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
good side they still are but they

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.070 
good side they still are but they
weren't<00:04:23.370> as<00:04:23.520> good<00:04:23.580> as<00:04:23.969> they<00:04:24.570> were<00:04:24.810> when<00:04:25.020> they

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
weren't as good as they were when they

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.610 
weren't as good as they were when they
had

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
had

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.300 
had
ler<00:04:25.970> Huntelaar<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.800> Suarez<00:04:28.800> I<00:04:28.979> think<00:04:29.160> the

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
ler Huntelaar and Suarez I think the

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.780 
ler Huntelaar and Suarez I think the
east<00:04:29.460> half<00:04:29.669> as<00:04:29.850> well<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:31.380> i<00:04:31.800> reckon<00:04:32.340> city<00:04:32.639> will

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
east half as well but i reckon city will

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.490 
east half as well but i reckon city will
probably<00:04:33.090> come<00:04:33.240> out<00:04:33.270> on<00:04:33.510> top<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.990> one<00:04:34.169> and

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
probably come out on top of that one and

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.120 
probably come out on top of that one and
the<00:04:34.620> squirrel<00:04:34.979> be<00:04:36.290> let's<00:04:37.290> go<00:04:37.470> for<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.740> big<00:04:37.919> one

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
the squirrel be let's go for a big one

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.640 
the squirrel be let's go for a big one
let's<00:04:38.280> go<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:38.580> three<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:39.169> five<00:04:40.169> goals<00:04:40.470> and

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
let's go for three to five goals and

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.350 
let's go for three to five goals and
that<00:04:40.740> game<00:04:41.010> I'd<00:04:41.340> like<00:04:41.550> to<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:41.790> that<00:04:41.820> I'll<00:04:42.180> be

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
definitely quite interesting and onto

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.810 
definitely quite interesting and onto
probably<00:04:45.690> the<00:04:45.960> biggest<00:04:46.229> game<00:04:46.620> out<00:04:47.010> of<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.520> two

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
probably the biggest game out of the two

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.150 
probably the biggest game out of the two
nights<00:04:48.060> which<00:04:48.479> is<00:04:48.720> borussia<00:04:49.290> dortmund<00:04:49.650> vs

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
know what malaga still have a pretty

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.230 
know what malaga still have a pretty
decent<00:05:37.139> team<00:05:37.380> after<00:05:37.950> that<00:05:38.430> sort<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.030> financial

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
decent team after that sort of financial

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.480 
decent team after that sort of financial
trouble<00:05:39.630> they<00:05:39.870> had<00:05:40.110> with<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.620> owner<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.160> think

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
trouble they had with the owner I think

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.040 
trouble they had with the owner I think
he<00:05:41.849> sort<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.090> like<00:05:42.300> drop<00:05:42.570> died<00:05:42.750> or<00:05:42.900> something

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
he sort of like drop died or something

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.129 
he sort of like drop died or something
like<00:05:43.229> that<00:05:43.340> they<00:05:44.340> seldom<00:05:44.610> Achilles<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.539> jack

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
like that they seldom Achilles and jack

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.690 
like that they seldom Achilles and jack
quinn<00:05:46.380> and<00:05:47.000> rocky<00:05:48.000> Santa<00:05:48.389> Cruz<00:05:48.660> I<00:05:49.580> think<00:05:50.580> he's

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
quinn and rocky Santa Cruz I think he's

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.820 
quinn and rocky Santa Cruz I think he's
on<00:05:50.820> loan<00:05:51.000> from<00:05:51.180> Manchester<00:05:51.690> City<00:05:51.900> I'm<00:05:52.169> pretty

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
certain of that and I reckon AC Milan

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.050 
certain of that and I reckon AC Milan
will<00:05:56.370> probably<00:05:56.849> win<00:05:57.449> to<00:05:57.930> nil<00:05:57.960> but<00:05:58.889> Malaga<00:05:59.340> will

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
will probably win to nil but Malaga will

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.510 
will probably win to nil but Malaga will
probably<00:06:00.479> put<00:06:00.630> up<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.840> fight<00:06:01.130> but<00:06:02.130> anyway<00:06:02.490> that

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
probably put up a fight but anyway that
