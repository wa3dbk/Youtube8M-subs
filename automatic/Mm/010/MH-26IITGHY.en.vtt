up in Green Bay and it's a beautiful day

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.179 
up in Green Bay and it's a beautiful day
for<00:00:27.449> football<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.109> nice<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> sunny<00:00:28.800> out<00:00:29.010> not

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
for football it's nice and sunny out not

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
for football it's nice and sunny out not
a<00:00:29.220> cloud<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.640> sky<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.240> little<00:00:30.660> chilly

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
a cloud in the sky it's a little chilly

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
a cloud in the sky it's a little chilly
but<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.769> were<00:00:31.920> playing<00:00:32.160> football

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
but I think if I were playing football

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
but I think if I were playing football
that<00:00:32.700> would<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.030> feel<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
that would probably feel good and it's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
that would probably feel good and it's
not<00:00:34.559> freezing<00:00:34.890> cold<00:00:35.309> like<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> probably<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
not freezing cold like it probably is in

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.369 
not freezing cold like it probably is in

people what they are is fear mongers

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
people what they are is fear mongers
they<00:01:15.299> live<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:15.990> trying<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> create<00:01:16.650> fear<00:01:17.280> in

they live for trying to create fear in
people<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> usually<00:01:19.080> irrational<00:01:19.890> fears

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
people and usually irrational fears

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.359 
people and usually irrational fears
about<00:01:20.759> things<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.689> highly<00:01:22.470> misplaced

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
about things that are highly misplaced

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.370 
about things that are highly misplaced
so<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> complaints<00:01:24.180> were<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.630> using<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
so the complaints were that using a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
so the complaints were that using a
power<00:01:25.650> strip<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.369> plugging<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> your

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
power strip and plugging in your

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.679 
power strip and plugging in your
Chargers<00:01:27.840> into<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> creates<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.700> much<00:01:30.150> heat

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
Chargers into that creates so much heat

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
Chargers into that creates so much heat
I<00:01:30.869> mean<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.650> probably<00:01:31.890> hotter<00:01:32.430> than

I mean it's it's probably hotter than
any<00:01:33.210> oven<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> would<00:01:34.110> have<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.409> your

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.499 
morning and I tested it I put my hand
back<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.970> actually<00:01:48.000> felt

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
back in there and it actually felt

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319 
back in there and it actually felt
colder<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> did<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.970> rest

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
colder in there than it did in the rest

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
colder in there than it did in the rest
of<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.659> house<00:01:51.930> some<00:01:52.350> people<00:01:52.619> were

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
of that house some people were

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
of that house some people were
suggesting<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.970> there<00:01:54.149> should<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.360> vent

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
suggesting that there should be vent

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810 
suggesting that there should be vent
holes<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.409> which<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.680> stupid

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
holes in it which is really stupid

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
holes in it which is really stupid
because<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> had<00:01:57.719> looked<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.500> video

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
because if you had looked at the video

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
because if you had looked at the video
you<00:01:58.829> would<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.280> seen<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.939> were<00:02:00.060> four

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
you would have seen that there were four

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
you would have seen that there were four
holes<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> front<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> put<00:02:01.530> chords<00:02:01.890> through

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
holes in the front to put chords through

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280 
holes in the front to put chords through
there<00:02:02.369> are<00:02:02.430> eight<00:02:02.579> slots<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.780> thing<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
there are eight slots in the thing and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.160 
there are eight slots in the thing and
there's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.649> big<00:02:04.920> hole<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> side<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.880> stick

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
there's a big hole in the side to stick

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
there's a big hole in the side to stick
the<00:02:07.170> charging<00:02:07.710> cord<00:02:08.009> through<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the charging cord through but if you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
the charging cord through but if you
want<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> look<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.869> Swiss<00:02:10.140> cheese

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
want to make it look like Swiss cheese

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.900 
want to make it look like Swiss cheese
you<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.280> right<00:02:11.550> ahead

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
you go right ahead

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
you go right ahead
punch<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.270> whole<00:02:12.420> bunch<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.780> holes<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.260> there

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
punch a whole bunch of holes in there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
punch a whole bunch of holes in there
this<00:02:13.800> might<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.400> those<00:02:14.520> things<00:02:14.820> that

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
this might be one of those things that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
this might be one of those things that
somebody<00:02:15.330> learned<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.930> school<00:02:16.110> in<00:02:16.590> theory

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
somebody learned in school in theory

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.100 
somebody learned in school in theory
that<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.610> could<00:02:17.820> generate<00:02:18.060> heat<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.810> maybe<00:02:18.990> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that it could generate heat and maybe a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.410 
that it could generate heat and maybe a
little<00:02:19.350> bit<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.710> heat<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.430> don't<00:02:20.730> know<00:02:20.940> all

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
little bit of heat more I don't know all

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.240 
little bit of heat more I don't know all
I<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.660> say<00:02:21.990> it's<00:02:22.260> not<00:02:22.500> generating<00:02:23.040> any<00:02:23.160> heat

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
I can say it's not generating any heat

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.890 
I can say it's not generating any heat
and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.850> don't<00:02:24.030> plug<00:02:24.210> everything<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
and I don't plug everything in and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.510 
and I don't plug everything in and
charge<00:02:25.230> everything<00:02:25.650> all<00:02:26.010> at<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> same<00:02:26.460> time

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
charge everything all at the same time

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480 
charge everything all at the same time
anyway<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.600> fact<00:02:28.140> here's<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> design<00:02:29.010> option

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
anyway in fact here's a design option

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.190 
anyway in fact here's a design option
for<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.880> thing<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.450> probably<00:02:30.810> doesn't<00:02:30.990> even

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
for that thing it probably doesn't even

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.230 
for that thing it probably doesn't even
need<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.710> big<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.610> probably<00:02:33.030> only

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
need to be that big you probably only

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.600 
need to be that big you probably only
need<00:02:33.360> an<00:02:33.630> area<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.290> store<00:02:34.530> maybe<00:02:34.800> two<00:02:35.130> devices

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
need an area to store maybe two devices

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.090 
need an area to store maybe two devices
but<00:02:36.300> have<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.570> whole<00:02:37.020> bunch<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.350> cords<00:02:37.770> running

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
but have a whole bunch of cords running

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.920 
but have a whole bunch of cords running
through<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.490> because<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.240> any<00:02:39.390> given<00:02:39.630> time

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
through it because at any given time

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.540 
through it because at any given time
you're<00:02:40.170> probably<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.770> going<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.100> charging

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
you're probably not going to be charging

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.490 
you're probably not going to be charging
all<00:02:41.760> six<00:02:42.180> devices<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> same<00:02:43.020> time

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
all six devices at the same time

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.440 
all six devices at the same time
probably<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.890> Kindle<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> one<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.210> charge

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
probably the Kindle is the one we charge

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.820 
probably the Kindle is the one we charge
the<00:02:45.570> most<00:02:45.750> cell<00:02:45.960> phones<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.350> go<00:02:46.440> for<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> few

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the most cell phones can go for a few

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.500 
the most cell phones can go for a few
days<00:02:47.040> without<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.580> having<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.330> even

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
days without really having to even

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.270 
days without really having to even
charge<00:02:48.750> them<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.020> my<00:02:49.260> house<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.710> still<00:02:49.950> around

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
charge them up my house is still around

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.160 
charge them up my house is still around
but<00:02:50.640> I'm<00:02:50.820> still<00:02:51.060> also<00:02:51.270> waiting<00:02:51.810> for<00:02:52.020> it<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
but I'm still also waiting for it to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.380 
but I'm still also waiting for it to
burn<00:02:52.320> down<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.490> made<00:02:53.760> those<00:02:53.970> wooden

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
burn down because I made those wooden

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.200 
burn down because I made those wooden
furnace<00:02:54.930> vent<00:02:54.960> covers<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.370> keep<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.000> heat

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
furnace vent covers and I keep the heat

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.720 
furnace vent covers and I keep the heat
in<00:02:57.420> my<00:02:57.450> house<00:02:57.810> cranked<00:02:58.380> up<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.560> about<00:02:58.800> 380

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
in my house cranked up to about 380

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.930 
in my house cranked up to about 380
degrees<00:02:59.970> also<00:03:00.540> oh<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.410> my<00:03:01.620> my<00:03:02.370> Christmas

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
degrees also oh and my my Christmas

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.050 
degrees also oh and my my Christmas
stocking<00:03:03.090> holders<00:03:03.840> because<00:03:04.760> they<00:03:05.760> used<00:03:05.940> a

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
stocking holders because they used a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.000 
stocking holders because they used a
candle<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.990> know<00:03:07.080> candle<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:07.860> have<00:03:07.950> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
candle and you know candle if you have a

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.500 
candle and you know candle if you have a
candle<00:03:08.520> in<00:03:08.610> your<00:03:08.730> house<00:03:08.880> that's<00:03:09.240> just<00:03:09.420> a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
candle in your house that's just a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.740 
candle in your house that's just a
recipe<00:03:09.780> for<00:03:10.440> disaster<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.460> doom<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.660> there

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
recipe for disaster and doom so there

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.160 
recipe for disaster and doom so there
you<00:03:12.810> go

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
you go

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.390 
you go
that's<00:03:13.530> what<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.710> think<00:03:13.890> about<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.160> fear

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that's what I think about the fear

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880 
that's what I think about the fear
mongers<00:03:14.850> and<00:03:15.120> their<00:03:15.600> misplaced<00:03:16.140> fears<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.830> I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
mongers and their misplaced fears and I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.090 
mongers and their misplaced fears and I
think<00:03:17.190> by<00:03:17.970> trying<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.840> instill<00:03:19.380> fear<00:03:19.410> in
