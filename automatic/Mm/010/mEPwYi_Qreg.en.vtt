00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.889
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.529
 Video guide because this time we 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.119
 bring a new analysis 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.099
 for this extra generation agency for 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.419
 poker for competitive battles and 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.880
 until they are I bring you to there is no see 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.050
 ok there is no see the dragon type pokemon 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.169
 flying 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.529
 of pokemon x and y and we have it here 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:35.520
 ahead good this pokemon stands out in its 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.700
 mostly because of its speed 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.860
 and good also for his decent special 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 It's not worth it, so it's not bad 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.440
 but above all its speed and also 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.950
 that we can pour it a 123 of 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.960
 base speed is good 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.880
 then as we have said as a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.270
 special attacker the best will be 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.560
 choose between two natures we have 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.560
 both timorous which is what is 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.650
 composed or the modest really depends 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.970
 of you if we put a fearful 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.620
 that I blocked this bet is because 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.159
 we want it to be faster than all 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.840
 the rivals 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 and the truth is that I always prefer a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.819
 little very fast so I surely 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.789
 would go for the fearful but we can also 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:20.520
 put the modest and increasing our 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.219
 special attack and it would be more even 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.539
 I uses another form of step I 'm not going 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.060
 to leave sent to know I like it 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.590
 more like this and this is not so balanced 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.399
 but well, very fast 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's go with the objects we have so much 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.070
 we have left to choose between chosen glasses 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.870
 like life sphere 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.010
 maybe the best thing is chosen glasses 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.640
 because it does not increase our attack 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.640
 special and 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.289
 although we are blocked instants 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.450
 we can choose to make an attack worth but 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.920
 good if we go back and forth in 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.940
 problems because let's get out of there 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.190
 No problem 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.080
 anyways today he always made a 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.650
 little bit so the weirdest is because I'm 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.250
 the whole nose a little go you know of 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.650
 colds then well let's continue 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.140
 with the ability on this occasion 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.000
 let's not do not have the hidden ability 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.500
 what is telepathy that the truth is that 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 yes you will be the double components 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.090
 what it does is really have 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.340
 apathy is that it does not affect us until it is 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 like south earthquake of our allies 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.410
 that come in handy though 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.640
 we can put both leveling and 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.140
 cache cache or what it does is that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.330
 we can see the object that carries the rival 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.030
 but I do not think that they have opened is the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.920
 better because he has had an improvement in 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.390
 this sixth generation of the previous 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 he let us attack through screens 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.040
 lights reflexes and so on is now sixth 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.830
 isolation generation also leaves it 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.750
 direct attack when we can for a 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.800
 substitute the other you can attack him 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.970
 directly to him no matter the 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.520
 substitute very well the truth something 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.860
 interesting and good let's go to the most 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.100
 important to attacks this one because 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.330
 When Bieber also stands out for his 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.250
 serious 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.650
 great evil attacks that they have to give 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 a lot of variety worth 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.849
 to begin with we have a movement 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.010
 stable dragon type both comet draco 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.110
 as a dragon pulse you can choose the one 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.319
 you want the drones too I would go more 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.959
 with a drake kite but to press something 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.909
 it is also a good attack and just like 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.579
 the gale these two are very 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.079
 responsible because they have to be 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.739
 Gale worth a good movement type 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:40.019
 flying and here in the third and stretches of 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.120
 mists one says now let's call her 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.250
 well I the truth that almost all 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.129
 against the raiders that the fighter 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.440
 previous flamethrower is worth it because 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.909
 truth that the flames are coming very well 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.720
 but it also depends on your equipment 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.610
 if you need and south 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.100
 because both are worth having attack 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.380
 fire type to which your team the 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.570
 weak between versus type plant by 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.710
 example by a flamethrower is quite 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.560
 all right 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:11.540
 but I can definitely put others like 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.980
 they are an accurate or the great rumble this 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 movement then this sixth generation 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.360
 that only learns to see and exploits 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.770
 normal type and with 120 power and I think 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 that was 120 or 140 minus 120 true and 100 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.740
 of precision so you can very well 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.240
 think both flames and extremes 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.720
 good also a sure one obviously 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.620
 but good 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.540
 extremes the novelty is worth and already as 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.160
 third then it is the round trip 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.470
 that with William or I said look at 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.450
 perfection with glasses chosen ida and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.580
 back because good we came out fast and 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:51.259
 we do a lot of damage or breathing 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.080
 and if we will stay longer in the 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.479
 battles and respite to recover 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.800
 basically there is not much more and already the 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.879
 truth is that I do not have much left 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.680
 to say for my part you have everything I hope 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.310
 that you liked this analysis 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:11.830
 bloomberg one like resenting and 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.719
 you know 2020 the decision with this series and 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.639
 subscribe for more if my image is of 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:18.650
 you against in the description and a 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.430
 greeting and see you in a next video

 goodbye
