00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
black gets this excellent point the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
black gets this excellent point the
middle<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.880> three<00:01:30.360> white<00:01:30.810> stones<00:01:32.600> white<00:01:33.600> plays

middle of three white stones white plays
here<00:01:34.700> black<00:01:35.700> plays<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.060> next<00:01:37.130> black<00:01:38.130> can

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
here black plays here next black can

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.260 
here black plays here next black can
throw<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:40.009> so<00:01:41.009> why<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.490> has<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> connect

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
throw in here so why it has to connect

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.860 
throw in here so why it has to connect
and<00:01:42.780> then<00:01:44.390> black<00:01:45.390> plays<00:01:45.659> here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
and then black plays here

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then black plays here
now<00:01:47.530> in<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.770> corner<00:01:48.220> white<00:01:48.970> cornerstones<00:01:49.780> are

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
now in the corner white cornerstones are

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.730 
now in the corner white cornerstones are
dead<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:51.070> this<00:01:51.550> group<00:01:51.850> is<00:01:52.120> in<00:01:52.360> very<00:01:53.350> bad<00:01:53.560> shape

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
dead and this group is in very bad shape

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.220 
dead and this group is in very bad shape
so<00:01:54.520> this<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.030> very<00:01:55.300> bad<00:01:55.570> for<00:01:55.980> white<00:02:00.990> at<00:02:01.990> this

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
so this is very bad for white at this

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.810 
so this is very bad for white at this
point<00:02:03.240> instead<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.420> escaping<00:02:05.320> here<00:02:05.820> white

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
point instead of escaping here white

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.910 
point instead of escaping here white
should<00:02:07.180> make<00:02:08.050> this<00:02:08.590> exchange<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.780> black<00:02:11.080> now

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
should make this exchange with black now

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.030 
should make this exchange with black now
why<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.520> can<00:02:13.470> descend<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:17.320> place<00:02:17.590> here

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
why it can descend here that place here

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.280 
why it can descend here that place here

point<00:04:12.030> black<00:04:12.900> should<00:04:13.110> play<00:04:13.350> here<00:04:15.350> why<00:04:16.350> not

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
point black should play here why not

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.050 
point black should play here why not
Harry's<00:04:17.040> then<00:04:17.850> black<00:04:18.120> plays<00:04:18.390> here<00:04:19.640> now<00:04:20.640> this

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
Harry's then black plays here now this

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.770 
Harry's then black plays here now this
is<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.269> double<00:04:21.570> quote<00:04:22.370> if<00:04:23.370> white<00:04:23.700> captures<00:04:24.330> this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
is a double quote if white captures this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.370 
is a double quote if white captures this
black<00:04:25.560> have<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.669> if<00:04:30.120> white<00:04:30.540> go

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
black have just that and if white go

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.520 
black have just that and if white go
find<00:04:31.710> some<00:04:32.030> co<00:04:33.030> threads<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.720> captures<00:04:34.290> this

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
find some co threads and captures this

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.260 
find some co threads and captures this
the<00:04:34.980> black<00:04:35.250> capture<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.240> so<00:04:37.020> this<00:04:37.290> corner<00:04:37.710> is

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
the black capture that so this corner is

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.990 
the black capture that so this corner is
dead<00:04:39.470> but<00:04:40.970> white<00:04:42.680> gets<00:04:43.680> a<00:04:43.950> lot<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.160> co<00:04:44.610> threat

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
dead but white gets a lot of co threat

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.050 
dead but white gets a lot of co threat
out<00:04:45.270> of<00:04:45.750> this<00:04:45.930> corner<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:47.280> that's<00:04:47.580> one<00:04:47.880> thing

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
out of this corner so that's one thing

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.530 
out of this corner so that's one thing
to<00:04:48.330> be<00:04:48.479> mindful<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:50.160> result

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:05.890 

also<00:04:59.740> if<00:05:00.740> white<00:05:01.160> plays<00:05:01.460> here<00:05:04.480> that<00:05:05.480> should<00:05:05.720> be

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
also if white plays here that should be

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.670 
also if white plays here that should be
careful<00:05:06.380> to<00:05:06.560> brag<00:05:06.890> should<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.340> play<00:05:07.550> this<00:05:08.680> if

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
careful to brag should and play this if

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:18.129 
careful to brag should and play this if
black<00:05:10.100> plays<00:05:10.310> this<00:05:11.860> white<00:05:12.860> place<00:05:13.160> this

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:26.459 

why<00:05:18.800> place<00:05:19.159> that<00:05:20.169> now<00:05:21.610> there's<00:05:22.610> another<00:05:22.819> coat

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:32.230 

which<00:05:27.469> is<00:05:27.710> again<00:05:28.340> bad<00:05:28.699> for<00:05:29.060> black<00:05:30.879> so<00:05:31.879> what<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
which is again bad for black so what it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:40.540 
which is again bad for black so what it
black<00:05:32.629> to<00:05:32.840> run<00:05:33.050> this<00:05:33.499> time<00:05:35.529> is<00:05:36.529> this<00:05:37.520> move<00:05:39.550> when

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
black to run this time is this move when

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.769 
black to run this time is this move when
why<00:05:40.729> place<00:05:41.060> here<00:05:41.479> black<00:05:42.469> should<00:05:42.710> play<00:05:42.919> here

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
why place here black should play here

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:51.370 
why place here black should play here
now<00:05:44.779> this<00:05:45.050> corner<00:05:45.469> is<00:05:46.029> dead

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.140 

so<00:05:52.380> there<00:05:52.680> are<00:05:52.770> two<00:05:53.010> things<00:05:53.250> black<00:05:53.730> should<00:05:53.970> be

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
so there are two things black should be

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.650 
so there are two things black should be
careful<00:05:54.660> about<00:05:54.890> if<00:05:55.890> white<00:05:56.160> plays<00:05:56.370> here<00:05:56.660> black

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
careful about if white plays here black

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.320 
careful about if white plays here black
plays<00:05:57.960> here<00:05:58.160> right<00:05:59.160> there<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.850> black<00:06:00.180> you

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
plays here right there and black you

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.670 
plays here right there and black you
honey<00:06:01.130> next<00:06:02.130> if<00:06:02.700> white<00:06:03.270> plays<00:06:03.480> here<00:06:03.680> black

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
honey next if white plays here black

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.850

should<00:06:04.920> honey<00:06:05.160> here<00:06:05.810> now<00:06:06.810> that's<00:06:07.140> the<00:06:07.440> correct

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
should honey here now that's the correct

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.340
