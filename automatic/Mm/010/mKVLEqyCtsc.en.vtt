00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
probably cooked with vanilla before but

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.450 
probably cooked with vanilla before but
most<00:00:15.570> likely<00:00:15.960> use<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> vanilla<00:00:16.560> extract<00:00:17.220> that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this I'm just gonna cut it in half I'm

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.260 
this I'm just gonna cut it in half I'm
using<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.250> paring<00:01:14.549> knife<00:01:14.700> because<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.030> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
using a paring knife because it's so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.050 
using a paring knife because it's so
little<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.470> like<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.670> teeny

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
little as you can see like it's so teeny

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.550 
little as you can see like it's so teeny
and<00:01:18.180> thin<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> use<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> chef's<00:01:19.170> knife<00:01:19.380> it

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and thin if I use a chef's knife it

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
and thin if I use a chef's knife it
might<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.880> difficult<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
might be like just really difficult to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960 
might be like just really difficult to
do<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.380> cut<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> half<00:01:23.070> I'm<00:01:23.850> gonna

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
do so I have cut it in half I'm gonna

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
do so I have cut it in half I'm gonna
lay<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.240> down<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> cut<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
lengthwise so I'm just gonna make an

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.140 
lengthwise so I'm just gonna make an

incision lengthwise all the way down and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.310 
incision lengthwise all the way down and
I'm<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.509> leave<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> little<00:01:31.020> bit<00:01:31.200> of
