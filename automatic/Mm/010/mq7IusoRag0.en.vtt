00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
bonus as the the springfield one does in

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
meter and the bigger percentage of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.320 
meter and the bigger percentage of
crushed<00:01:02.800> lantic<00:01:03.160> it's<00:01:03.309> an<00:01:03.430> XP<00:01:03.850> you're<00:01:04.149> gonna

get it looks like it goes up to five
percent<00:01:06.970> i<00:01:07.149> was<00:01:07.630> at<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.810> moment<00:01:08.080> ones<00:01:08.229> are<00:01:08.380> one

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
percent i was at the moment ones are one

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.650 
percent i was at the moment ones are one
percent<00:01:08.979> oh<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.670> if<00:01:09.790> i<00:01:09.880> get<00:01:10.000> up<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.210> five<00:01:10.420> that

percent oh and if i get up to five that
means<00:01:10.780> for<00:01:10.960> every<00:01:10.990> 100<00:01:11.500> tickets<00:01:11.890> i<00:01:12.160> pick<00:01:12.340> up<00:01:12.460> i

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
means for every 100 tickets i pick up i

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.670 
means for every 100 tickets i pick up i
actually<00:01:12.970> get<00:01:13.090> 105<00:01:13.810> for<00:01:14.050> every<00:01:14.259> thousand

tickets i pick up I actually get 1050

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.249 
tickets i pick up I actually get 1050
and<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.130> it's<00:01:18.280> nice<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:18.700> not<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:19.000> not

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and so it's nice it's not it's not

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.380 
and so it's nice it's not it's not
game-changing<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:21.490> nice<00:01:21.820> but<00:01:22.090> actually

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
game-changing but it's nice but actually

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.510 
game-changing but it's nice but actually
the<00:01:22.810> crust<00:01:23.020> o<00:01:23.170> meter<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.560> more<00:01:23.799> important<00:01:24.280> that

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
the crust o meter is more important that

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.289 
the crust o meter is more important that
because<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.630> will<00:01:25.750> notice<00:01:25.960> around<00:01:26.409> my<00:01:26.950> park

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
very nice and it makes the park seem

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.730 
very nice and it makes the park seem
busy<00:01:57.729> what's<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.119> point<00:01:58.330> but<00:01:58.540> no<00:01:58.659> no<00:01:58.869> no<00:01:59.140> these

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
busy what's the point but no no no these

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.950 
busy what's the point but no no no these
guys<00:02:00.189> give<00:02:00.759> you<00:02:01.060> tickets<00:02:01.509> and<00:02:01.689> you'll<00:02:01.780> know

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
guys give you tickets and you'll know

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.270 
guys give you tickets and you'll know
that<00:02:02.170> if<00:02:02.290> you've<00:02:02.439> had<00:02:02.560> some<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:02.890> your<00:02:03.009> Park

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that if you've had some in your Park

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.590 
that if you've had some in your Park
that<00:02:03.520> actually<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.970> longer<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.390> leave<00:02:04.540> them

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
that actually the longer you leave them

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.109 
that actually the longer you leave them
in<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.869> park<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.799> they'll<00:02:06.729> they<00:02:06.970> will

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
in the park that they'll they will

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.520 
in the park that they'll they will
eventually<00:02:07.299> have<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.720> little<00:02:07.930> ticket<00:02:08.229> appear

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
eventually have a little ticket appear

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.770 
eventually have a little ticket appear
above<00:02:08.649> their<00:02:08.950> head<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.160> they<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:10.450> up<00:02:10.600> every

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
above their head and they go up every

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.569 
above their head and they go up every
every<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:11.440> two<00:02:11.680> hours<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.190> they're

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
every like two hours I think they're

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.920 
every like two hours I think they're
amount<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:12.910> tickets<00:02:13.060> they<00:02:13.329> give<00:02:13.570> you<00:02:13.660> goes<00:02:13.900> up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
amount of tickets they give you goes up

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.560 
amount of tickets they give you goes up
but<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.100> not<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> sliding<00:02:15.850> scale<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.299> it's<00:02:16.420> not

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
but it's not a sliding scale so it's not

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.000 
but it's not a sliding scale so it's not
like<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:16.989> have<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.140> click<00:02:17.410> them<00:02:17.560> regularly<00:02:17.860> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
like you have to click them regularly to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.110 
like you have to click them regularly to
get<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.400> think<00:02:18.579> it's<00:02:18.700> something<00:02:18.910> like

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
get it and I think it's something like

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.660 
get it and I think it's something like
you<00:02:19.450> get<00:02:19.630> two<00:02:19.989> tickets<00:02:20.320> for<00:02:20.560> four<00:02:20.980> hours<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you get two tickets for four hours and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.580 
you get two tickets for four hours and
it<00:02:22.209> goes<00:02:22.390> up<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.630> like<00:02:22.660> 24<00:02:23.140> hours<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.470> get

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it goes up to like 24 hours and you get

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.789 
it goes up to like 24 hours and you get
about<00:02:23.709> 12<00:02:24.010> tickets<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.459> that's<00:02:24.730> per<00:02:25.030> person

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
about 12 tickets but that's per person

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.819 
about 12 tickets but that's per person
therefore<00:02:26.799> if<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.419> a<00:02:28.690> higher<00:02:29.079> crusto

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
therefore if you have a higher crusto

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.150 
therefore if you have a higher crusto
meter<00:02:30.070> you'll<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:30.609> more<00:02:30.790> peep

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
meter you'll get more peep

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.860 
meter you'll get more peep
if<00:02:31.340> you<00:02:31.460> have<00:02:31.610> more<00:02:31.790> people<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.630> means

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
if you have more people that means

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.600 
if you have more people that means
you'll<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.200> getting<00:02:33.530> more<00:02:33.740> sick<00:02:33.920> more<00:02:34.220> tickets

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
you'll be getting more sick more tickets

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.980 
you'll be getting more sick more tickets
and<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.880> isn't<00:02:35.210> just<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.600> be<00:02:35.660> an<00:02:35.750> extra

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
and this isn't just going to be an extra

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.870 
and this isn't just going to be an extra
five<00:02:36.230> tickets<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.770> or<00:02:36.890> there<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:37.760> a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
five tickets here or there that it's a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.970 
five tickets here or there that it's a
quite<00:02:38.120> significant<00:02:38.780> amount<00:02:39.140> if<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:39.650> have

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
quite significant amount if you have

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.200 
quite significant amount if you have
five<00:02:41.470> if<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:42.800> five<00:02:43.100> out<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.310> five<00:02:43.580> for

five if you have five out of five for
your<00:02:44.450> crust<00:02:44.960> ohmmeter<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.890> will<00:02:46.070> have<00:02:46.190> 30

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
your crust ohmmeter you will have 30

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580 
your crust ohmmeter you will have 30
people<00:02:46.790> walking<00:02:47.540> around<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.900> your<00:02:47.930> park<00:02:48.320> if

those 30 people all give you 12 tickets
per<00:02:53.150> day<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.870> means<00:02:54.260> you're<00:02:54.620> going<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.830> get

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100

an extra 360 tickets per day which is

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.660 
an extra 360 tickets per day which is

going to be a makeup which is going to

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
make a significant difference to the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.370 
make a significant difference to the
amount<00:03:04.100> that<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:04.520> can<00:03:04.790> build<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:05.780> lastly<00:03:06.140> and

amount that you can build now lastly and
this<00:03:06.440> one<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.160> perhaps<00:03:08.230> others<00:03:09.230> less

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
this one is perhaps others less

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.170 
this one is perhaps others less
important<00:03:09.920> but<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.430> less<00:03:10.640> kind<00:03:10.820> of<00:03:10.880> obvious

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
important but it's less kind of obvious

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.050 
important but it's less kind of obvious

very just looks a lot cooler really and
it's<00:03:37.490> definitely<00:03:37.700> something<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.090> aim<00:03:38.240> for<00:03:38.270> to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
it's definitely something to aim for to

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.000 
it's definitely something to aim for to
know<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.020> have<00:03:39.050> got<00:03:39.470> a<00:03:39.680> a

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
know that you have got a a

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
know that you have got a a
well-decorated<00:03:41.140> well-put-together<00:03:42.140> park<00:03:43.030> so

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
well-decorated well-put-together park so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.420 
well-decorated well-put-together park so
this<00:03:44.240> crust<00:03:44.540> o<00:03:44.690> meter<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.190> important<00:03:46.190> if<00:03:46.310> for

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
this crust o meter is important if for

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.010 
this crust o meter is important if for
no<00:03:46.580> other<00:03:46.610> reason<00:03:46.850> then<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.300> gets<00:03:47.420> more<00:03:47.690> people

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
no other reason then it gets more people

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.810 
no other reason then it gets more people
into<00:03:48.350> your<00:03:48.470> park<00:03:48.709> to<00:03:48.920> give<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.280> more<00:03:49.430> tickets

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
into your park to give you more tickets

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.360 
into your park to give you more tickets
and<00:03:50.000> just<00:03:50.600> like<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.110> could<00:03:51.860> form<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.190> meter

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
and just like the could form a meter

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.920 
and just like the could form a meter
there's<00:03:52.730> going<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.000> be<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.120> few<00:03:53.390> factors<00:03:53.810> you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
there's going to be a few factors you

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.449 
there's going to be a few factors you
need<00:03:54.080> to<00:03:54.140> do<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.530> get<00:03:54.650> this<00:03:54.800> up<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.100> it's<00:03:55.310> an

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
need to do to get this up and it's an

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.580 
need to do to get this up and it's an
average<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.630> there's<00:03:56.780> no<00:03:56.810> point<00:03:57.110> getting<00:03:57.290> one

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
average so there's no point getting one

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.930 
average so there's no point getting one
of<00:03:57.620> these<00:03:57.770> meters<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.340> completely<00:03:58.700> full<00:03:58.910> with

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
of these meters to completely full with

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.370 
of these meters to completely full with
the<00:03:59.120> other<00:03:59.270> three<00:03:59.540> are<00:03:59.570> completely<00:03:59.959> empty

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
the other three are completely empty

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.170 
the other three are completely empty
because<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:01.040> you've<00:04:01.160> got<00:04:01.280> three<00:04:01.610> zeros<00:04:02.030> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
because then you've got three zeros and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.940 
because then you've got three zeros and
15<00:04:02.600> and<00:04:02.810> that's<00:04:02.930> going<00:04:03.020> to<00:04:03.080> average<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:03.680> back

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
15 and that's going to average that back

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.220 
15 and that's going to average that back
down<00:04:04.160> or<00:04:04.340> one<00:04:04.610> or<00:04:04.790> something<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:06.020> want

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
down or one or something so you you want

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.050 
down or one or something so you you want
it's<00:04:06.739> going<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:06.980> actually<00:04:07.100> help<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.610> more<00:04:07.850> to
