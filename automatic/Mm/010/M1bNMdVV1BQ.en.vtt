00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.479
 as always please identify 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.160
 a full week 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.059
 and full already knew since 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.329
 many weeks we are working for 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.910
 do we still have eight days to 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.430
 close the group and we are doing everything 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.350
 effort to get it I do not have 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.540
 No doubt that any of the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 efforts that we are going to justify 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.070
 our four games that we need 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.130
 Well, they're going to get there about whether 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
 gone too soon the party I 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.490
 I think we have competed on a Friday 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.700
 ham premium of the sensations in 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.620
 As for competitiveness, we have been 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.510
 within it I always believe that 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.570
 we have done a fuck editor for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.700
 get the tie 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.500
 we have tried, we have had a 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.270
 good reaction capacity after 21 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.370
 of the last 10 minutes like getting into 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.040
 rne to your field 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.590
 I do not think that the game like that has not 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.350
 come too much since it's obvious 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.240
 that we would have liked to play with 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.650
 the template closed by I imagine that 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 we have we have what we have 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.850
 will have much more and you have to look for that 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.850
 type of argument or excuse 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.440
 if the patient 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 match first competition court the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.540
 teams are still not saying a better 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.540
 tactical technical physical point 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.719
 still and imbalances still lack of 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.549
 synchronization but there have been there 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.649
 much enthusiasm a lot of intensity in the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.979
 game and much played match in 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.659
 matched something more of interest domain 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.219
 grenade and especially the danger that 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.289
 you have is a very athletic team in 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.810
 white are very strong 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.099
 I think I know what justifies a little 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.049
 that is not the goal a goal of lack 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.780
 from the midfield plan thrown to the 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.840
 center the goal 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.860
 there is something with our deficit but 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.350
 there is the match 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.780
 tremendously matched from the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.450
 beginning with phases our phases of 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.860
 granada the best phase of the grenade has 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.270
 coincided in the second time in that 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.070
 15 or 20 minute stretch 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.930
 that stopped generally we are 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.400
 I know you have been sentenced 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 occasion of the curtain that supported sight 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 the crap in front of the goalkeeper and already 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.050
 they are the station pÃ©gate and from that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.760
 play and 10 comes a thousand euros 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.950
 the party has everything serious that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.750
 result the national draw has already been 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.430
 the most just thing but talk about justice of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 justice is to be another 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 d 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.330
 when the playing field they practice 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.330
 because it 's so that you have played half 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.140
 all matches last 90 minutes 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.750
 the rival rival also plays 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.610
 has started to play two with enough 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.250
 direct balls towards our area 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.860
 a lot of air play and it's still night 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.170
 looking for the texts to the area there we have 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.209
 suffered a bit in that phase 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.300
 we have to give the defendants more with 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.980
 the ball and much more exhausted enemy 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.360
 but it is also true that the pressure has 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.690
 been very insistent on the part of Granada 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.690
 when we have managed to take away that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.320
 pressure is that we have not returned to 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.190
 neutralizarles and have returned to equalize 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.650
 of the same 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.300
 We have lacked a bit more to have 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.300
 supported that that advantage 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.120
 so in some way 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.139
 it is evident that it is a deficit because of 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.139
 own physical presence that the 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:15.620
 team and we do not have a big spread 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:18.259
 of the group already and we can suffer because more 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.260
 here all of the field where that does not have 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:24.680
 to be produced as the second goal of 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.170
 in black a lack of 40 or 50 meters 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.600
 outside the area this was a very 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.460
 far away and it has been very frontal we have 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.220
 defended very close to in the area and we 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.360
 We have been wrong but I insist there is 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.580
 keep working you have to continue 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.260
 training trying to disguise the most 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.300
 possible of our defects and enhance 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.039
 more the fruits of that it's about fluorine 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.039
 no more clear
