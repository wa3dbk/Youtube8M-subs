one<00:01:18.520> thing<00:01:18.670> I'm<00:01:18.790> noticing<00:01:18.970> when<00:01:19.899> I'm<00:01:19.990> playing

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
one thing I'm noticing when I'm playing

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.080 
one thing I'm noticing when I'm playing
these<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.780> sort<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.580> use<00:01:24.580> my<00:01:24.759> stroke

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
these is how I sort of use my stroke

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.669 
these is how I sort of use my stroke
motion<00:01:25.450> really<00:01:25.570> changes<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.110> sound<00:01:26.350> if<00:01:26.590> I

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
motion really changes the sound if I

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.830 
motion really changes the sound if I
play<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.890> really<00:01:27.160> stiff<00:01:27.520> I<00:01:27.789> can<00:01:28.360> get<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.720> be

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
play it really stiff I can get it to be

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:38.240 
play it really stiff I can get it to be
kind<00:01:29.080> of<00:01:29.170> like<00:01:29.289> a<00:01:29.320> sixteenth<00:01:29.800> note<00:01:29.890> pattern<00:01:30.490> I

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.830 

keep<00:01:39.250> my<00:01:39.340> arm<00:01:39.550> really<00:01:39.640> stiff<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.420> elbow

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
keep my arm really stiff and that elbow

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.980 
keep my arm really stiff and that elbow
stiff<00:01:41.170> but<00:01:41.770> if<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.890> do<00:01:41.950> more<00:01:42.220> of<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.429> flowing

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
stiff but if I do more of a flowing

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:58.350 
stiff but if I do more of a flowing
motion<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.200> get<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.759> imagining<00:01:58.060> people

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
motion you get and I'm imagining people

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:15.280 
motion you get and I'm imagining people
would<00:01:58.750> do<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.930> lot<00:01:59.170> of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.150 

so<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.800> reversible<00:02:17.520> they're<00:02:18.210> great<00:02:19.160> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so these are reversible they're great so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.790 
so these are reversible they're great so

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
in my left hand he's just looking for

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.030 
in my left hand he's just looking for
different<00:03:42.130> tonality<00:03:42.489> 'he's<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:44.739> only<00:03:44.920> thing

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
different tonality 'he's the only thing

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.110 
different tonality 'he's the only thing
you<00:03:45.099> have<00:03:45.190> to<00:03:45.250> watch<00:03:45.459> out<00:03:45.670> these<00:03:46.000> are

you have to watch out these are
different<00:03:46.510> weights<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.349> have<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.620> adjust

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
different weights so you have to adjust

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.680 
different weights so you have to adjust
your<00:03:48.040> touch<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.340> if<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.060> can<00:03:49.180> do<00:03:49.360> it<00:03:49.510> it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
your touch but if you can do it it's
