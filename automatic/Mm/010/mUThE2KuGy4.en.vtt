was in modern warfare 3 it was hilarious

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.520 
was in modern warfare 3 it was hilarious
I<00:01:37.579> was<00:01:38.579> running<00:01:38.909> over<00:01:39.030> tags<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.290> game

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I was running over tags and the game

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
I was running over tags and the game
didn't<00:01:40.890> register<00:01:41.100> me<00:01:41.670> taking<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.210> tag<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
didn't register me taking the tag so I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.920 
didn't register me taking the tag so I
wasn't<00:01:43.500> able<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.860> play<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.250> objective

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
wasn't able to play the objective

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
wasn't able to play the objective
sometimes<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.079> was<00:01:46.229> walking<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sometimes I was walking and then it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.330 
sometimes I was walking and then it
pushed<00:01:48.390> me<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.770> walking<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.159> top

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
pushed me you know I was walking on top

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.330 
pushed me you know I was walking on top
of<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.820> then<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> ground

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
of something then I'm down on the ground

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
of something then I'm down on the ground
and<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.670> black<00:01:53.909> ops<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.450> Comcast<00:01:54.689> lag<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
and so in black ops the Comcast lag it

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440 
and so in black ops the Comcast lag it
translates<00:01:56.310> differently<00:01:57.030> because<00:01:57.210> I've

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
translates differently because I've

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.530 
translates differently because I've
already<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:58.049> clips<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:59.280> lagging<00:01:59.790> where<00:02:00.390> my

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
already had clips of me lagging where my

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
already had clips of me lagging where my
character<00:02:00.600> gets<00:02:01.259> frozen<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.549> guess<00:02:02.759> that's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
character gets frozen and I guess that's

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
character gets frozen and I guess that's
how<00:02:03.149> black<00:02:03.570> ops<00:02:03.840> handles<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> lag<00:02:04.530> look<00:02:04.740> at

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
how black ops handles the lag look at

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
how black ops handles the lag look at
that<00:02:05.070> guy<00:02:05.219> disappeared<00:02:05.880> he<00:02:06.210> likes<00:02:06.540> something

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that guy disappeared he likes something

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.359 
that guy disappeared he likes something
he<00:02:07.170> was<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:07.740> all<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> sudden<00:02:08.069> he

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
he was there then all of a sudden he

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
he was there then all of a sudden he
wasn't<00:02:08.729> there<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> funny<00:02:10.709> thing<00:02:10.770> about

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
wasn't there and the funny thing about

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.340 
wasn't there and the funny thing about
this<00:02:11.340> lag

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
this lag

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.580 
they can do and now I think we're still
we<00:04:02.000> still<00:04:02.299> might<00:04:02.510> even<00:04:02.690> be<00:04:02.840> lagging<00:04:03.079> who<00:04:03.379> knows

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
we still might even be lagging who knows

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.369 
we still might even be lagging who knows
because<00:04:03.860> I'm<00:04:04.670> about<00:04:04.879> to<00:04:05.030> kill<00:04:05.209> somebody

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
because I'm about to kill somebody

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.800 
because I'm about to kill somebody
that<00:04:07.250> guy<00:04:07.459> just<00:04:07.730> popped<00:04:07.970> out<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.209> nowhere<00:04:08.359> it

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
that guy just popped out of nowhere it

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.630 
that guy just popped out of nowhere it
seemed<00:04:09.049> like<00:04:09.319> but<00:04:10.010> I'm<00:04:10.099> about<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.370> kill

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.420 
like yeah that's the guy that was glitch
confirmed

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
confirmed

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.979 
confirmed
you<00:04:19.940> heard<00:04:20.120> him<00:04:20.269> he's<00:04:20.359> like<00:04:20.479> see<00:04:20.660> that<00:04:20.810> that's

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
you heard him he's like see that that's

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.680 
you heard him he's like see that that's
the<00:04:21.139> latch<00:04:21.320> switcher<00:04:21.769> I<00:04:22.240> don't<00:04:23.240> have<00:04:23.389> a<00:04:23.419> lag

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the latch switcher I don't have a lag

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.110 
the latch switcher I don't have a lag
switch<00:04:24.110> I<00:04:24.440> wouldn't<00:04:25.160> even<00:04:25.250> know<00:04:25.550> how<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.789> lag

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
switch I wouldn't even know how to lag

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.350 
switch I wouldn't even know how to lag
switch<00:04:26.479> all<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.720> know<00:04:26.900> is<00:04:27.199> I<00:04:27.320> got<00:04:27.470> that<00:04:27.650> Comcast

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
switch all I know is I got that Comcast

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.029 
switch all I know is I got that Comcast
so<00:04:29.360> Comcast<00:04:29.900> is<00:04:30.050> like<00:04:30.169> an<00:04:30.289> automatic<00:04:30.440> lag

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
so Comcast is like an automatic lag

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.360 
so Comcast is like an automatic lag
switch<00:04:31.370> that's<00:04:31.550> what<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:31.910> is

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
switch that's what that is

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.700 
switch that's what that is
then<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.550> has<00:04:34.760> me<00:04:35.000> wondering<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:36.530> ever

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
then this has me wondering have you ever

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.409 
then this has me wondering have you ever
been<00:04:36.919> in<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.160> game<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.700> someone<00:04:37.940> was<00:04:38.150> lagging

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
been in a game and someone was lagging

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.810 
been in a game and someone was lagging
lag<00:04:39.020> switching<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.830> speak<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.400> you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
lag switching so to speak and you

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.170 
lag switching so to speak and you
accused<00:04:41.270> them<00:04:41.479> of<00:04:41.570> lag<00:04:41.840> switching<00:04:42.910> maybe<00:04:43.910> they

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
accused them of lag switching maybe they

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.700 
accused them of lag switching maybe they
don't<00:04:44.360> own<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.599> lag<00:04:44.900> switch<00:04:45.200> maybe<00:04:45.380> they<00:04:45.560> just

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
don't own a lag switch maybe they just

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.890 
don't own a lag switch maybe they just
have<00:04:45.889> Comcast<00:04:46.430> like<00:04:46.639> me<00:04:46.849> you<00:04:47.570> know<00:04:47.690> maybe

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
have Comcast like me you know maybe

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.960 
have Comcast like me you know maybe
that's<00:04:48.169> what<00:04:48.380> ah<00:04:48.560> maybe<00:04:49.520> that's<00:04:49.789> what

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
that's what ah maybe that's what
