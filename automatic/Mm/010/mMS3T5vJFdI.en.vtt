00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
gameplay I think I found this gameplay

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.600 
gameplay I think I found this gameplay
somewhere<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.599> my<00:00:30.660> actual<00:00:31.289> computer<00:00:31.740> because

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
somewhere on my actual computer because

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.750 
somewhere on my actual computer because
all<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> videos<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
all of the kind of videos I got I just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.780 
all of the kind of videos I got I just
recorded<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.690> PlayStation<00:00:36.989> itself<00:00:37.829> and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
recorded from the PlayStation itself and

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.040 
recorded from the PlayStation itself and
I<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.180> download<00:00:39.300> them<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.719> whatnot<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
I can just download them and whatnot so

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.160

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
to find out whodunit what happened why

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.270 
to find out whodunit what happened why
where<00:01:15.630> who<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.259> why<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.439> how<00:01:16.619> stuff

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
where who what when why where how stuff

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
where who what when why where how stuff
like<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.360> eventually<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.200> came<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.470> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
like that and eventually it came down to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
like that and eventually it came down to
the<00:01:19.740> conclusion<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> my<00:01:20.490> people<00:01:20.640> got<00:01:20.970> banned

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the conclusion that my people got banned

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.570 
the conclusion that my people got banned
because<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.810> reason<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.189> phoned<00:01:23.400> up

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
because of this reason so I phoned up

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.940 
because of this reason so I phoned up
Sony<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.780> hold<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.140> five<00:01:25.560> hours

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Sony and I was on hold for five hours

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.700 
Sony and I was on hold for five hours
with<00:01:26.640> Sony<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.119> was<00:01:27.299> ridiculous<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
with Sony it was ridiculous and

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
with Sony it was ridiculous and
eventually<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.460> came<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> conclusion

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
eventually they came to the conclusion

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.600 
eventually they came to the conclusion
that<00:01:30.590> there<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.680> no<00:01:31.799> evidence<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.430> could

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that there was no evidence that it could

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.940 
that there was no evidence that it could
have<00:01:32.700> possibly<00:01:33.150> been<00:01:33.240> me<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.530> Unruh

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
have possibly been me so they Unruh

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
have possibly been me so they Unruh
moved<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.369> ban<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.030> turn<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
