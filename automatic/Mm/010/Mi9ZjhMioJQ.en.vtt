the cutscenes we did see a bit of a drop

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.100 
the cutscenes we did see a bit of a drop
in<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> framerate<00:01:24.000> almost<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> stutter

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
in the framerate almost like a stutter

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
in the framerate almost like a stutter
going<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:26.159> at<00:01:26.250> no<00:01:26.430> point<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.909> ever<00:01:27.119> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
going on but at no point did we ever see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
going on but at no point did we ever see
that<00:01:27.600> during<00:01:28.049> actual<00:01:28.590> gameplay<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.579> there's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that during actual gameplay so there's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.160 
that during actual gameplay so there's
nothing<00:01:30.090> here<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> would<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.960> think

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
nothing here that would make me think

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
nothing here that would make me think
this<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:31.740> requires<00:01:32.189> more<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> oven

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
this game requires more time in the oven

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.660 
this game requires more time in the oven
as<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> were<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> cutscenes<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
as it were some of the cutscenes like I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.030 
as it were some of the cutscenes like I
say<00:01:35.850> slight<00:01:36.509> drops<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.960> framerate<00:01:37.200> but<00:01:37.770> during

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
say slight drops in framerate but during

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
say slight drops in framerate but during
the<00:01:38.130> actual<00:01:38.430> gameplay<00:01:38.670> itself<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> framerate

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
the actual gameplay itself the framerate

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
the actual gameplay itself the framerate
is<00:01:40.110> solid<00:01:40.710> throughout<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.030> see

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is solid throughout so here you can see

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.550 
is solid throughout so here you can see
the<00:01:42.270> magic<00:01:42.540> marker<00:01:42.840> being<00:01:43.020> used<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.320> raise
