00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.219
 hello friends welcome a new week 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.440
 you should play before you die and this time 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.250
 a game as I always say very special 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 from stan getz 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.020
 this repetitive music 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.100
 and we're talking about a game plus 2 of 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.280
 year 90 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.660
 we are talking about we are talking about a 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.530
 year after it appeared super 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.960
 mario bros 3 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.730
 for nintendo nesos what is 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.290
 I did on pc and worked with graphics 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:43.770
 with three-dimensional polygons 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:46.480
 something very early something very early and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.060
 I'm going to catch him 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.580
 in university formula 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.620
 code very early on but of course 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.300
 this in his day this was the cock work 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.129
 already 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.670
 the keys the cubes in the key 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 snapshot 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.930
 like me 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.430
 that is, I just want you to fuck him 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.850
 one look the truth is that it is not a 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.400
 game that now 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.580
 and now lends itself to be judged 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.560
 the eyes even but for all 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.110
 those nostalgic as I do not go out 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.830
 of the game you always want to see what 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.330
 missed as 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.650
 to make the route on the left more 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.650
 pretty if I do not kill myself 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.710
 as I say it is very nice to see him 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.780
 nice to remember it and those that you have not 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
 seen then good then take advantage and throw 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.830
 an eye of what was a PC game of 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.790
 the 90s as I say already with polygons 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.880
 a pop and not exaggerated but well that's it 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.830
 what was 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.950
 safe 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 if I'm not wrong trackmania his game 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.460
 that regains the spirit of this the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.860
 grace of this game was also that the 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.350
 jump art was game was that I had a 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.000
 level editor where you could with 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.300
 he two tracks with your jumps with your 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.890
 loopings contuso those that the truth is 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.280
 that my brother and cuban playing obando 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.050
 we spent more time generating maps that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.910
 running we made them there our 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.910
 crazy our attempts 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:32.370
 there in front was very nice formula 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.920
 one 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.480
 and this is it so let's go here this is the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.840
 level editor just for you to see 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.980
 a little 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.150
 you could see very simple placed a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.150
 tree here some parts 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.390
 too 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:01.160
 why 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:04.170
 because in this time when there are children 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.000
 and well you can play it I'm playing 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.760
 with two box like all fingers 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.439
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.959
 I do not want to give you more the grill with this 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.200
 game has a lot of time and even the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.200
 next
