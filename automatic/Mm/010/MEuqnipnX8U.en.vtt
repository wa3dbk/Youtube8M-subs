00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
are starting to find those runs that

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.669 
are starting to find those runs that
you've<00:00:37.920> been<00:00:38.070> doing<00:00:38.399> over<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.059> years<00:00:39.269> so<00:00:39.679> we

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
you've been doing over the years so we

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.279 
you've been doing over the years so we
decided<00:00:41.039> last<00:00:41.850> year<00:00:42.089> that<00:00:42.269> it<00:00:42.359> was<00:00:42.390> really

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
decided last year that it was really

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.650 
decided last year that it was really
important<00:00:43.679> to<00:00:43.769> go<00:00:43.859> somewhere<00:00:44.219> else<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
important to go somewhere else it was a

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.630 
important to go somewhere else it was a
total<00:00:46.019> gamble<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.679> it<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.429> really

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
total gamble because we it was really

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.400 
total gamble because we it was really
hard<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> go<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.690> internet<00:00:49.019> and<00:00:49.260> look

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
hard to go like on the internet and look

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.529 
hard to go like on the internet and look
up<00:00:49.559> Petersburg<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> try<00:00:50.609> to<00:00:50.670> find<00:00:50.879> photos<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
up Petersburg and try to find photos and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.509 
up Petersburg and try to find photos and
there's<00:00:51.749> nothing<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> unluckily<00:00:53.249> we<00:00:53.429> were

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
there's nothing and unluckily we were

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.520 
there's nothing and unluckily we were
able<00:00:53.609> to<00:00:53.760> find<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> site<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.600> guy<00:00:54.780> has

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
able to find a site that some guy has

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.819 
able to find a site that some guy has
charted<00:00:56.149> all<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.600> mountains<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.559> coast

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
charted all the mountains of the coast

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.939 
charted all the mountains of the coast
range<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.909> Google<00:01:00.329> Earth<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.749> added<00:01:01.559> photos

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
range on Google Earth and added photos

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
range on Google Earth and added photos
so<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> could<00:01:02.429> see<00:01:02.749> he<00:01:03.749> was<00:01:03.839> like<00:01:03.960> flying

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
so you could see he was like flying

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
so you could see he was like flying
around<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> plane<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.790> like<00:01:05.790> mapped<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
around the plane and like mapped out the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730 
around the plane and like mapped out the
whole<00:01:06.479> zone<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.170> cool<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
whole zone so it was cool to get that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.380 
whole zone so it was cool to get that
information<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.030> feel<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> little

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
information and they just feel a little

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.940 
information and they just feel a little
bit<00:01:09.540> better

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
bit better

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.929 
bit better
there's<00:01:10.950> no<00:01:11.040> heli<00:01:11.280> operation<00:01:11.820> there

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there's no heli operation there

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.179 
there's no heli operation there
everybody<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.619> talked<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.979> said<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
everybody I talked to them and I said I

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
operation you're going with them it's

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
operation you're going with them it's
like<00:01:16.740> there<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.130> no<00:01:17.280> operation<00:01:17.850> we're<00:01:18.270> just

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
like there is no operation we're just

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.850 
like there is no operation we're just
bringing<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.780> helicopter<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:20.659> figuring<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
bringing a helicopter there figuring out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.470 
bringing a helicopter there figuring out
and<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.550> was<00:01:23.670> scary<00:01:23.730> just<00:01:24.120> because<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.420> out

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
and it was scary just because you're out

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.090 
and it was scary just because you're out
there<00:01:24.750> by<00:01:24.930> ourselves<00:01:25.050> all<00:01:25.770> these<00:01:25.950> other

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
there by ourselves all these other

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.010 
there by ourselves all these other
places<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.640> Alaska<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.210> probably

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
places in Alaska there's probably

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
places in Alaska there's probably
operations<00:01:28.620> flying<00:01:28.920> around<00:01:29.160> and<00:01:29.520> get

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
operations flying around and get

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.680 
operations flying around and get
Avalanche<00:01:30.960> beta<00:01:31.230> from<00:01:31.470> them<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.420> safety<00:01:33.420> you

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
Avalanche beta from them and safety you

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.640 
Avalanche beta from them and safety you
know<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:33.960> there's<00:01:34.140> something<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.440> goes
