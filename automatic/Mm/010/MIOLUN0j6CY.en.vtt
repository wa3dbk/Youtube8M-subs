00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.250
 my name is aerial dt and I come to treat 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.259
 the best scores that came out in 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.490
 this year in the description of the video I'm going 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.349
 to leave you the only thing that will take you to the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 page where you can download it and also 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.049
 a little tutorial of how I installed 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.460
 so let's start let's start the first 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.439
 texture country that I come to present 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 it's the finland here we can see the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.519
 stone bricks by is next to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 here we can see what the gravel for that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.119
 side towards the rock we can also see 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.439
 all woods the look that gives 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 the ways that the truth is that it is very 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.940
 I like it because it looks pretty 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.870
 bright and also pretty that I tell myself 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
 real 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.410
 I have put one of the different types of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 the anam and the directors colors as is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 the look that pretty real age that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
 what I tell you can also see from 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.530
 here the sun that is a very nice aspect 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 the truth here we can see also 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.059
 the minerals that I like the most 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.379
 that looks looks at the minerals and also 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.059
 we can see for example here I wanted him 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.559
 give value in case of armors not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.629
 change the appearance in the micro be 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.030
 following the line pretty much that is 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.770
 combine between what is real smoke and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.899
 the original look that michael gives you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.129
 I like how the eyes look 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.939
 mushrooms 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.939
 the flower 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.079
 that does not change much in the house of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180
 animals, we can see that the 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.470
 changes just killed me the chicken is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.659
 that these cats 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.250
 these kittens play even with these 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.560
 payments the flat bear hotel but good not 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.820
 he killed the chicken no way but we have everything 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.950
 there is the rabbit with him as a stadium 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.319
 well let's see the following for 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.539
 of texture let's see it the next 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.429
 for texture is the element and what 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.710
 does this country read to minecraft is 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.409
 give it a magical look so ideal 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 to play it is to magical or 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.000
 also with the town after being moved by 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.740
 here its different textures but of the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.289
 which stand out the most or are the ones that most 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.060
 have impressed is his armor see me 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.030
 here with armor as if it were from 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.569
 astronaut or something like that the truth he 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.119
 It is quite pretty good and original me 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.590
 like the armor I really love the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.360
 armor to know about here the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 minerals among those that stand out 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.610
 also the tools well with these 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.610
 tools 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.090
 these readings that are presenting 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.890
 they are in 64 bit format 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.690
 so you would have to have to enter 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.760
 not so good or so bad is a purchase 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.110
 intermediate because it also changes the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.450
 animal things unlike the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.849
 previous in which if it changes here it 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.480
 see much more real 12 lots also looks 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.480
 much more real 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.910
 look at me and you do not see me but around here the 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.790
 horse we have here the cow and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.280
 we have here the pulse and we have 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.500
 there the sheep very well and thinking about the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.349
 small we have also this extra country 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.349
 called 10 and I hope that when crystals 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.940
 this movie is thought smaller 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.730
 wife is here giving you a 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.709
 animation aspect that is from a 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.110
 cartoon so it would be ideal this 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.299
 for what they can with you, you cheer for 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.299
 example is where we are 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.760
 I think that from cartoon network there are ways of 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:08.069
 superheroes and I think with that country 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.889
 it would be quite good in those 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.499
 aspects has the aspect that I tell you of 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.629
 unanimous or a drawing so it's 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:18.689
 pretty good if you can go from 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:21.659
 suddenly a lover of the bunch we ended up 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.459
 of pokemon there is also monte this dragon 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.010
 You can install it or you can 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.379
 wear this for the restore in the 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.810
 animals almost change but a little too 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.519
 little and maximum or be one of the many not 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.069
 I know if they gave much but if the soil and 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.919
 everything else comes here because the grass 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.879
 yes it is very animated so guys 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.040
 recommended if you are a younger brother in 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.169
 house with this package is hard and goes 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.599
 to be happy guys who follow 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.040
 well to get from this country texture the 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.319
 Finally for texture that no lips 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.030
 present would be the being and nitti and this 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.280
 father of his light those marks that give 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.000
 more color to the herbs is done a lot 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 more clear 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.439
 in addition also much more cheerful in the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:02.200
 case of the materials almost new changes 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:07.150
 the only one that changes is in minerals 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.920
 I have not seen this form of parents and that 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.709
 feature in the murals in others 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.450
 countries and also what I like 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.810
 it would be in the wood that also gave 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.239
 a pretty nice and real look the 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.950
 true that very modern very modern is 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.260
 by equipment of the animals that either 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.940
 they change their originality and 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.950
 we can also measure the bricks 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.080
 stones very things that also looks 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.180
 pretty good it 's pretty pretty 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.100
 well the last hard part that I come 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.570
 to bring would be the same as what 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.550
 it makes the minecraft that comes out one aspect 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.169
 modern for something is called modern and therefore 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.729
 well over here, everything changes 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.770
 of things and is what I like the most 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.900
 I have also changed a lot what would be 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.300
 the tools and also also what 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.370
 would be the woods in animal cases 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.310
 because I get to change the water of 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.200
 this texture also carries change no 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.360
 be the animal and should also change 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:04.360
 what would be the pirate villager 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.259
 covered in poor poor cow 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.699
 mushroom 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.349

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.449

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.999
