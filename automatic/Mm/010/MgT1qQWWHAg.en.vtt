00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:17.530 
hey guys like engineering today I'm

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.810 
hey guys like engineering today I'm
gonna<00:00:17.710> be<00:00:17.800> talking<00:00:17.920> about<00:00:18.100> dark<00:00:18.400> simulacrum

gonna be talking about dark simulacrum

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.790 
gonna be talking about dark simulacrum
and<00:00:19.090> what<00:00:19.240> bosses<00:00:19.480> you<00:00:19.750> can<00:00:19.900> use<00:00:20.080> on<00:00:20.350> siege<00:00:20.770> of

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
Orgrimmar and what you can get from them

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.480 
Orgrimmar and what you can get from them
okay<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:23.170> first<00:00:23.440> up<00:00:23.650> we<00:00:23.740> have<00:00:23.770> Norrish<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.370> now

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
okay so first up we have Norrish and now

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.340 
okay so first up we have Norrish and now
blood<00:00:24.700> decays<00:00:25.030> while<00:00:25.300> in<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.540> old<00:00:25.690> phase<00:00:25.990> can

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
blood decays while in the old phase can

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.650 
blood decays while in the old phase can
dark<00:00:26.890> seemingly<00:00:27.190> from<00:00:27.430> the<00:00:27.550> spell<00:00:27.880> which<00:00:28.510> is

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
dark seemingly from the spell which is

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.690 
dark seemingly from the spell which is
called<00:00:28.930> whole<00:00:29.500> corruption<00:00:29.830> from<00:00:30.280> the<00:00:30.400> big<00:00:30.550> ad

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
called whole corruption from the big ad

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.360 
called whole corruption from the big ad
now<00:00:31.150> this<00:00:31.330> will<00:00:31.540> deal<00:00:31.750> deal<00:00:32.200> -<00:00:32.500> damage<00:00:33.100> to<00:00:33.250> you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
now this will deal deal - damage to you

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.430 
now this will deal deal - damage to you
allowing<00:00:33.700> you<00:00:33.789> to<00:00:33.910> absorb<00:00:34.329> it<00:00:34.539> but<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:35.230> should

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
allowing you to absorb it but you should

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.389 
allowing you to absorb it but you should
be<00:00:35.500> able<00:00:35.559> to<00:00:35.680> survive<00:00:35.860> that<00:00:36.039> with<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.250> nice

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
be able to survive that with a nice

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.889 
be able to survive that with a nice
cooldown<00:00:36.850> anti-magic<00:00:37.239> shell<00:00:37.570> should<00:00:37.750> be

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
cooldown anti-magic shell should be

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.479 
cooldown anti-magic shell should be
enough<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.590> you<00:00:38.680> will<00:00:38.770> be<00:00:38.860> able<00:00:38.949> to<00:00:39.159> unleash

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
enough and you will be able to unleash

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.860 
enough and you will be able to unleash
on<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.820> boss<00:00:39.969> when<00:00:40.179> you<00:00:40.239> get<00:00:40.390> out<00:00:40.480> for<00:00:40.629> a<00:00:40.690> high

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
into the fight the she cast it a lot

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.790 
into the fight the she cast it a lot
less<00:00:52.329> than<00:00:52.749> their<00:00:52.960> abilities<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.379> cast<00:00:53.589> but

frost<00:00:54.129> on<00:00:54.280> what<00:00:54.489> gets<00:00:54.729> cast<00:00:55.030> a<00:00:55.120> lot<00:00:55.329> you'll

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
frost on what gets cast a lot you'll

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.660 
frost on what gets cast a lot you'll
absorb<00:00:56.289> this<00:00:56.559> with<00:00:57.069> your<00:00:57.249> darks<00:00:57.460> in<00:00:57.550> the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
for 500,000 damage and it does create

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.530 
for 500,000 damage and it does create
often<00:01:02.109> as<00:01:02.229> well<00:01:02.379> so<00:01:02.710> very<00:01:03.370> nice<00:01:03.579> for<00:01:03.819> you<00:01:03.969> frost

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
yield decays I'm a streak since it

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.039 
yield decays I'm a streak since it
scales<00:01:06.340> with<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.549> damage<00:01:06.850> and<00:01:07.090> as<00:01:07.630> two-handed

creating<00:01:09.490> more<00:01:09.520> for<00:01:09.820> us<00:01:09.909> okay<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:10.900> next<00:01:11.110> we

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
creating more for us okay so next we

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.660 
creating more for us okay so next we
have<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.530> 8th<00:01:11.680> encounter<00:01:12.190> of<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.280> raid<00:01:12.520> which

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
have the 8th encounter of the raid which

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.100 
have the 8th encounter of the raid which
is<00:01:12.790> general<00:01:13.150> now<00:01:13.300> scream<00:01:13.570> he<00:01:13.690> will<00:01:13.840> summon

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
adds some of these are called corchran

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
ability which you can dark simulacrum

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.930 
ability which you can dark simulacrum
the<00:01:20.530> more<00:01:20.710> he<00:01:20.800> casts<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.310> more<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.520> stacks<00:01:21.760> up

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
the more he casts the more it stacks up

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.400 
the more he casts the more it stacks up
so<00:01:22.090> it<00:01:22.180> may<00:01:22.300> be<00:01:22.360> better<00:01:22.570> to<00:01:22.630> interrupt<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.290> and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
so it may be better to interrupt it and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.020 
so it may be better to interrupt it and
you<00:01:23.860> will<00:01:23.980> not<00:01:24.070> do<00:01:24.250> too<00:01:24.520> much<00:01:24.640> damage<00:01:24.700> this

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
you will not do too much damage this

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.880 
you will not do too much damage this
ability<00:01:25.300> but<00:01:25.540> you'll<00:01:25.660> do<00:01:25.810> some<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.410> it's<00:01:26.800> a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
ability but you'll do some and it's a

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.010 
ability but you'll do some and it's a
free<00:01:27.160> cast<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.640> suppose<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.210> kind<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.870> work

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
free cast so I suppose this kind of work

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.150 
free cast so I suppose this kind of work
for<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.440> but<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.620> won't<00:01:29.770> do<00:01:29.860> much<00:01:29.980> damage

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
for you but it won't do much damage

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.580 
for you but it won't do much damage
