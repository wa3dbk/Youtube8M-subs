00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.240
 hi friends previous video we are with you 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.010
 disassembled penetrations with Turkish beads 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.350
 today I offer you with the same view 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.650
 shaking do some overlay 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.900
 movements on each other remind 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.360
 Turkish beads we look like this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.870
 do small steps and 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.660
 swing hips 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:33.450
 This Turkish beads means what you can 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.890
 movement to impose on Turkish beads 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.340
 for example a circle of hips that is it in 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.079
 Basically, I would say not a big barrel and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.190
 now let's try such thunder thighs 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:55.200
 impose so do Turkish beads and 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.890
 send your hips in a circle one-two-three-four 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.790
 one-two-three-four one-two-three-four 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:08.840
 one-two-three-four bergu side 1 2 3 4 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:12.289
 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.420
 such a move on 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.789
 let's say we are like you in the previous one 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.630
 the video showed a great circle made 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:25.950
 scene on the Turkish bead times two three 4 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 5 six 7 8 times two three 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.270
 if music allows us to do that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.939
 finish it by going to him 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:40.439
 press just the same here with these circles 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:43.350
 legs can draw a circle but 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.710
 the hull must be in place tata ta ta 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.560
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta there principle 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.049
 you can and only hips do when 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.959
 legs in place and thigh works 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.130
 hips and legs 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.579
 depending on your own style 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.880
 how can I really like here next 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:08.360
 you can make a plate all of us 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:11.430
 we know the plate is this movement 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.269
 small circle of the thigh did not give more called 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.569
 and here using our paint we do 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.060
 plate that is already here many 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:27.090
 one hundred percent in one place 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.970
 work only hips looks that is 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.790
 we pulled 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.690
 stretched forward pulled foreheads back 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:42.590
 the other side is 1 and 4 times exactly the same 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.590
 can be rotated plate 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.460
 This is quite difficult. 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.260
 to train 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.600
 the next movement that I can still 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.640
 offer this for example the reverse she and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:09.920
 so here we are with you our Turkish beads 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:14.880
 and impose on him the reverse in 1 1 2 1 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:18.590
 2 this is with the chest until when we reverse 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:24.740
 waves do chest and can and hips 1 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.740
 until breasts do not use once or twice 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.850
 here is our backward wave 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:45.480
 along with just a shaped wave you can and 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:48.630
 Direct but this 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 pens 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:52.200
 you can put in favor of our position and 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.760
 advance for example in the period 1 2 3 4 1 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:00.120
 and 4 1 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.489
 Similarly, and collected and care about 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.959
 to do 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.750
 one-two-three-four one-two-three-four 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:09.350
 one-two-three-four one-two-three-four 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.900
 can all these kinds of 3 sukka overlays 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:17.400
 build for example make a big 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:20.040
 a circle with a sight to turn around 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.610
 on this circle then when the circle 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.979
 completed to do a reverse run and 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.940
 go ahead and finish there for example all this 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:33.419
 Lena can be done like yours 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.120
 fantasy it pleases that of course 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.060
 music dictates means you can and even 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.509
 make eight 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.080
 when our legs move along 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:49.560
 eight body in place is yes and the bottom 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:53.189
 would run out from under the top oh yes exactly 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.479
 same with Turkish beads 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:05:00.539
 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:03.180
 well, that's probably all for today 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.449
 what did I want to say if what else 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.939
 invented them of course share with you 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.129
 remember something 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:13.919
 foot the next video for some crash 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:17.089
 there will be all the girls of all 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.089
 I love, kiss for now
