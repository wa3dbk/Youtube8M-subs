00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.210
 mega evolution is something that when 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.190
 it was just announced many thought that 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.620
 it was a digimon copy that was bullshit 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.599
 or that they ran out of imagination I was 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.669
 one of those who thought that but 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.620
 later I took the time to meditate and 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.780
 I said maybe that's a good thing and 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.940
 that you should not judge it like this before 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.430
 I tried it for myself and they know what happened 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.430
 then I loved it 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.120
 good let's continue now with the new 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.220
 deliveries of pokemon ruby ​​omega and sapphire 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.470
 Alpha have been announced new mega 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.270
 evolutions and with this video I will say that 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 mega evolutions I would like to see in 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.180
 these new games 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.340
 remember that each of the mega 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.620
 evolutions that I would like to see myself 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.660
 I have drawn so that you can appreciate 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.850
 better than by timmons according to my tastes 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.860
 I would like them to have mega in addition to 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.660
 as I would like them to look and before 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.850
 start I would like to make a mention 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.890
 special since previously I was going to 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.140
 put a mega flavor there because already 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.630
 I had drawn it before but 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.940
 that same day that I draw it just that 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.460
 day officially revealed to mega flavor 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.160
 there and I was face to face but what the fuck 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.080
 apparently I'm psychic but hey what you 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.220
 I'm going to do good now, it 's time to 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 start with the video 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.950
 look at evolutions that I would like to see 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.830
 ro its king without a doubt is one of my pokemon 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.540
 of plant type favorites and certainly 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.310
 I would love it if I had a mega 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.380
 evolution and if it reached mega 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.420
 evolve I would like him to have the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 adaptation skill so that his 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.590
 attacks of the plant type and poison are 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.840
 they would benefit in addition to their 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.240
 stats would increase a lot in your attack 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.320
 special and would increase by more than 20 in its 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.320
 defenses and their speed 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.820
 bad sea is also another pokemon that 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.980
 I would like it to have given me evolution already 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.080
 which in my opinion is a good pokemon to 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.480
 despite not being very used by many 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.940
 but anyway if badly love mega evolve 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.250
 to give him the ability to respond 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.290
 that that ability is something useful to me 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.270
 since bad love can learn strength 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.060
 brute and with that skill your attack and 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.130
 physical defense would increase with each use 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.230
 of this movement and of course with the mega 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.420
 evolution would increase your physical attack 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.970
 because malamadre is a good attacker 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.100
 physical would also greatly increase your 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.110
 special defense for at least so 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.330
 endure special movements and their 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.820
 defense would increase a bit since with 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.160
 responded his attack and defense would increase 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.150
 for each use and its speed is also 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.150
 I would see it increased 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 if they made a mega evolution to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.209
 celebi would be the opportune moment to 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.190
 correct the error of not having it 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.920
 become a type pokemon to give 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.959
 I would definitely add this guy to cb vic 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.180
 since this one has the appearance of a fairy 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.160
 I would also give him the said ability to 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 so that it can be more used and 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.580
 of course it would increase his special attack 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.580
 defenses and speed 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.980
 and dances another pokemon that really 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.750
 like and I would love it to have mega 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.730
 evolution if you were given a mega 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.590
 evolution I would like to be given the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.870
 hard claw skill because of the great 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.030
 variety of physical attacks that are 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.830
 contact that has this pokemon and clear 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.110
 your attack speed and defenses 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.000
 would increase correspondingly for 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.160
 make it stronger and get more 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.380
 benefit to this pokemon because of the great 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.180
 speed that has more his skill what 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.180
 that would make it really unstoppable 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.620
 very well from here I will explain why the 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.689
 back he should stay with his guys 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.000
 water and ice and not replace the water by 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.280
 dragon as many want will see according to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.470
 my opinion the grill to the mega evolve 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.870
 I should still be water type and eloy 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.699
 have the ability to lightning as well 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.770
 it would remain as the only weakness of the 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.169
 type fight but the brass would have like 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.330
 defend yourself from these since she learns 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.400
 psychic besides that compare rays the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.860
 electrical movements would not do anything to him 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.740
 also that the special attack would rise 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.699
 and attacks fire and rock plants do not 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.699
 they would do a lot of damage 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.280
 I would like that alt would have 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.470
 mega evolution even if it's not exactly 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.450
 one of my favorites but when I played 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.640
 pokemon emerald this pokemon was me 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.980
 very useful and if you could mega evolve 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.230
 I would give him a chance I would like 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.210
 when altaria mega evolution and get 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.250
 the skill said since it has many 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.320
 attacks that have side effects and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.000
 this would also benefit him 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.370
 I would like him to acquire the fairy type 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.680
 happening thus to be of type dragon and fairy and 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.240
 clear his statistics would increase in 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.240
 special your special attack 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.080
 I had x is another one that I would like 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.910
 could mega evolve this pokemon 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.190
 it certainly makes me very beautiful and 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.870
 strong at the same time especially I touch x 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.699
 that won a char and a 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.620
 sardi since I touched x I knew 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.630
 flamethrower and power passed good 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.610
 returning to the subject I would like to 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.710
 mega evolve toy x acquire the 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.720
 skill said as well as altar 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.270
 already several of its attacks have effects 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.430
 side and this would help you a lot and 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.410
 his statistics would obviously increase 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.889
 in its special attack defenses and 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.889
 speed 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.610
 more than wayne is another pokemon that I do not use 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.650
 a lot but I still like it and also that 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.930
 just like I would lift it served me when 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.000
 I played Emerald Pokemon without anyone else 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.220
 could mega evolve I would like that 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.720
 have a new skill and in this case 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.300
 I invented the eyes skill 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.979
 intimidating the skill would consist of 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.669
 lower two levels all statistics 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.690
 of the opponent with the presence of mcqueen 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.819
 it would practically work as 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.680
 intimidation you should remove it and 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.720
 put it back in the battle so that 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.970
 operate the skill and its statistics 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.520
 they would also increase and more loose than 

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.650
 special and its speed in plus 30 and its 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.180
 defenses plus 20 fuck nintendo should 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.599
 hire me to do skills to 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.599
 the pokemon 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.040
 the little sister is definitely one of my 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.170
 favorite pokemon of the fifth 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.090
 generation if the little sister could goal 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.220
 evolve I would like you to acquire the 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.320
 self-esteem skill so that his 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.180
 Attack increases each time it expires 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.430
 an enemy besides that with the mega 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.560
 evolution would greatly increase your attack 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.570
 and speed thing that highlights this 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.880
 pokemon and of course I would not neglect their 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.880
 defenses also increasing them more 20 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.419
 the I list that is one of the pokemon that 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.669
 I liked more in this new generation 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:30.159
 being that it is a pokémon not very 

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:32.259
 used being how useful it is since 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:34.330
 you can use it to change it when you 

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:36.220
 opponent has a pokémon with attacks from 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.990
 water and you have a fire type for 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.300
 then change it for the jolly and so 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.370
 absorb your attack if you were given a mega 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.770
 evolution to him yolis sure out more 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.900
 used if he mega yolis will evolve him 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.330
 give a new skill which would be 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.340
 energizing sun which would consist of 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.080
 that when there is sun, two 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.000
 levels the special attack and the 

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.310
 speed thing in which the johns got 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.930
 specializes which would make it very strong 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.930
 this you montero not so much 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.210

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.340

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.340

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.150
 opinion 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.990
 do it because it's free so I say goodbye 

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.990
