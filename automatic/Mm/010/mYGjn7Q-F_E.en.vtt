I'm gonna walk you through some mods
that<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:14.090> did<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.660> circuit<00:00:15.080> I'll<00:00:15.259> explain

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
that I did to the circuit I'll explain

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:21.470 
that I did to the circuit I'll explain
the<00:00:15.860> circuit<00:00:16.250> a<00:00:16.279> bit

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.279 

is

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
is

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.590 
is
univox<00:00:24.100> square<00:00:25.029> wave

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
univox square wave

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.450 
univox square wave
which<00:00:26.960> is<00:00:27.230> pretty<00:00:28.070> nondescript<00:00:28.840> fuzz<00:00:29.840> from

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.560 

late<00:00:33.000> 70s

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
late 70s

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.110 
late 70s
I<00:00:34.630> was<00:00:35.079> in<00:00:35.230> that<00:00:35.350> series<00:00:35.829> of<00:00:36.010> univox<00:00:36.489> pedals

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
I was in that series of univox pedals

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.470 
I was in that series of univox pedals
that<00:00:37.329> had<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.840> sort<00:00:38.290> of<00:00:38.350> cartoon<00:00:39.090> foot<00:00:40.090> on

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
that had the sort of cartoon foot on

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.620 
that had the sort of cartoon foot on
them

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
them

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.210 
them
to<00:00:41.720> be<00:00:41.900> one

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
to be one

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.930 
to be one
two<00:00:43.280> knobs<00:00:43.610> on<00:00:44.030> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
two knobs on it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.250 
two knobs on it
this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.119 
this
two<00:00:47.920> months

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
two months

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.580 
two months
there<00:00:49.550> is<00:00:49.760> the

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
there is the

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.790 
there is the
circuit

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.670 

looking<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> while

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
looking at it for a while

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.810 
looking at it for a while
realized

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
realized

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.390 
realized
is<00:01:02.970> basically<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> fuzz-face<00:01:04.230> at<00:01:05.040> heart

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
is basically a fuzz-face at heart

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.940 
is basically a fuzz-face at heart
see<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:06.910> the<00:01:07.120> two<00:01:07.360> transistors<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.710> there's

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
see this the two transistors and there's

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.160 
see this the two transistors and there's
the<00:01:09.070> feedback<00:01:09.610> path<00:01:09.940> from

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610 

back<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.550> base<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> first<00:01:15.690> one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
back to the base of the first one

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.320 
back to the base of the first one
small<00:01:17.830> value<00:01:18.370> resistor<00:01:19.030> here

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.540 

to<00:01:24.690> ground<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:26.000> sets<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.350 

yes

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
yes

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.620 
yes
the<00:01:31.660> output

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.929 

through

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
through

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.399 
through
go<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.210> a<00:01:37.240> tap

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
go in a tap

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.360 
go in a tap
and<00:01:38.500> unlike<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.189> fuzz<00:01:39.520> face

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
and unlike a fuzz face

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.750 
and unlike a fuzz face
there<00:01:41.940> is<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> pair<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.960> clipping<00:01:43.410> diodes

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.860 

then<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.030> has<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.690> of<00:01:48.900> odd

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.560 

that<00:01:53.140> basically<00:01:53.650> has<00:01:53.980> that<00:01:54.580> capacitor<00:01:55.360> was

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
that basically has that capacitor was

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.590 
that basically has that capacitor was
always<00:01:56.080> less

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.609 

and<00:01:59.750> a<00:02:00.020> variable<00:02:00.560> resistance<00:02:01.250> here

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
and a variable resistance here

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.410 
and a variable resistance here
which<00:02:02.859> lets<00:02:03.189> various<00:02:03.820> amounts

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
which lets various amounts

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.610 
which lets various amounts
so<00:02:06.080> basically<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:06.890> a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
so basically it's a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.980 
so basically it's a
a<00:02:07.710> base<00:02:08.220> cut

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
a base cut

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.730 
a base cut
as<00:02:10.050> opposed<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
as opposed to the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.460 
as opposed to the
more<00:02:11.980> common<00:02:12.550> treble<00:02:13.300> cut

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.730 

the<00:02:17.470> start

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the start

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.860 
the start
this<00:02:19.920> song<00:02:20.430> control-r<00:02:20.970> decimas<00:02:21.660> their

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
this song control-r decimas their

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.760 
this song control-r decimas their
attempt<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.380> do<00:02:22.620> something

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
attempt to do something

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.619 
attempt to do something
simple<00:02:24.640> cheap<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.420> different

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.380 

it's<00:02:28.840> terrible

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it's terrible

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.200 
it's terrible
basically<00:02:31.170> gives<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.890> variations<00:02:32.790> between<00:02:33.000> a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
basically gives you variations between a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.240 
basically gives you variations between a
mosquito<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:34.170> sound

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.180 

snarling<00:02:39.250> fuss<00:02:40.120> sounds<00:02:40.660> only<00:02:40.870> part<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.070> is

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
snarling fuss sounds only part of it is

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.930 
snarling fuss sounds only part of it is
really<00:02:42.550> useful

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
really useful

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.240 
really useful
I've<00:02:44.240> done<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.540> couple<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:45.050> mods<00:02:45.320> to<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:46.130> the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
I've done a couple of mods to to the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.180 
I've done a couple of mods to to the
circuit<00:02:46.700> basically

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
circuit basically

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.460 
circuit basically
done<00:02:48.490> as<00:02:48.670> I've<00:02:48.820> installed<00:02:49.270> switch<00:02:49.930> toggle

done as I've installed switch toggle

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.650 
done as I've installed switch toggle
switch<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.580> selects<00:02:52.150> between

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.550 

values<00:02:55.440> or<00:02:56.340> another<00:02:57.270> pair

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
values or another pair

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.030 
values or another pair
silicon<00:02:59.520> diodes<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> same<00:03:00.690> location<00:03:01.470> or

silicon diodes in the same location or
else<00:03:02.310> lifts<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.880> diodes<00:03:03.360> entirely<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.470> that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
else lifts the diodes entirely so that

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.850 
else lifts the diodes entirely so that
you<00:03:04.800> get<00:03:04.980> something<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.760> much<00:03:06.660> more<00:03:06.720> like

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
you get something that's much more like

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.020 
you get something that's much more like
fuzz-face

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
fuzz-face

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.750 
fuzz-face
I'll<00:03:10.330> also<00:03:10.890> draw<00:03:11.890> attention<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.490> fact

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
I'll also draw attention to the fact

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.100 
I'll also draw attention to the fact
that<00:03:12.940> Mike

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
that Mike

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.000 
that Mike
those<00:03:15.650> faces

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
those faces

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.570 
those faces
this<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:17.760> uses<00:03:18.000> an<00:03:18.299> athlete<00:03:18.629> to

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
this one uses an athlete to

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.390 
this one uses an athlete to
in<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> second<00:03:20.450> transistor<00:03:20.960> position<00:03:21.800> so

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
in the second transistor position so

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.990 
in the second transistor position so
again<00:03:22.940> slightly<00:03:23.360> different<00:03:24.080> sound

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
again slightly different sound
