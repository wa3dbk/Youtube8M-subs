about scaring disease crazy for

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.950 
about scaring disease crazy for
everything<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> decided<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.570> want<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> build

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
everything so I decided I want to build

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
everything so I decided I want to build
bat<00:00:34.230> houses<00:00:34.440> because<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.670> find<00:00:35.969> their

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
bat houses because if they find their

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
bat houses because if they find their
way<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.360> there<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> lot<00:00:36.870> less<00:00:37.079> likely

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
way in there they're a lot less likely

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
way in there they're a lot less likely
to<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.710> someone's<00:00:38.190> house<00:00:38.340> where<00:00:38.910> they're

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to get someone's house where they're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.500 
to get someone's house where they're
more<00:00:39.239> likely<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:40.010> meet<00:00:41.010> there<00:00:41.190> an<00:00:41.309> afterlife<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
more likely to meet there an afterlife I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
more likely to meet there an afterlife I
