function<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> shock<00:02:34.549> absorber<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.090> inside

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
function the shock absorber and inside

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.270 
function the shock absorber and inside
here<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.230> spherical<00:02:36.680> bearing<00:02:37.190> because

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
here is the spherical bearing because

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.610 
here is the spherical bearing because
obviously<00:02:37.610> it<00:02:38.090> needs<00:02:38.599> to<00:02:38.900> move<00:02:39.049> like<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.319> as

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
obviously it needs to move like that as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.280 
obviously it needs to move like that as
the<00:02:39.890> shock<00:02:40.069> absorber<00:02:40.459> goes<00:02:40.640> up<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:40.970> down<00:02:41.290> this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
the shock absorber goes up and down this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.949 
the shock absorber goes up and down this
is<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.560> helper<00:02:43.010> spring<00:02:43.280> which<00:02:43.959> complete

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
is the helper spring which complete

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.800 
is the helper spring which complete
keeps<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.590> spring<00:02:46.459> fully<00:02:46.819> captured<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.540> full

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
keeps that spring fully captured on full

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.569 
keeps that spring fully captured on full
travel<00:02:48.109> so<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.470> don't<00:02:48.769> get<00:02:48.950> any<00:02:49.010> spring

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
travel so you don't get any spring

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.210 
travel so you don't get any spring
rattle<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.870> between<00:02:51.290> here<00:02:51.620> one<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.129> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
rattle in between here one of the

rattle in between here one of the
particular<00:02:52.519> features<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.329> there's<00:02:53.599> actually

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
particular features is there's actually

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.349 
particular features is there's actually
a<00:02:54.019> little<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.739> little<00:02:55.160> guide<00:02:55.760> between<00:02:56.239> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
a little a little guide between the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.819 
a little a little guide between the
helper<00:02:56.629> spring<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.079> the<00:02:57.140> main<00:02:57.319> spring<00:02:57.560> so

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
helper spring and the main spring so

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.949 
helper spring and the main spring so
there's<00:02:58.040> less<00:02:58.220> rattle<00:02:58.849> or<00:02:59.239> interference<00:02:59.780> of

there's less rattle or interference of

there's less rattle or interference of
the<00:02:59.989> moving<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:01.099> is<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.459> main<00:03:01.730> spring<00:03:02.209> which

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the moving this is the main spring which

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.240 
the moving this is the main spring which
obviously<00:03:02.720> supports<00:03:03.349> the<00:03:03.530> body<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.040> car

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
obviously supports the body of the car

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.270 
obviously supports the body of the car
and<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.849> overall<00:03:05.239> mass<00:03:05.920> obviously<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.099> whole

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
and the overall mass obviously the whole

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.490 
and the overall mass obviously the whole
body<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.790> what<00:03:07.970> makes<00:03:08.180> up<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.930> McPherson

people<00:04:15.920> do<00:04:16.070> these<00:04:16.340> days<00:04:16.579> is<00:04:16.959> have<00:04:17.959> a

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
people do these days is have a

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.259 
people do these days is have a
compromise<00:04:18.530> on<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.859> spring<00:04:19.130> rate<00:04:19.340> but<00:04:20.090> have

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
compromise on the spring rate but have

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.029 
compromise on the spring rate but have
an<00:04:20.449> adjustable<00:04:20.900> shock<00:04:21.199> rate<00:04:21.440> so<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.889> good

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
an adjustable shock rate so the good

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.740 
an adjustable shock rate so the good
thing<00:04:22.070> about<00:04:22.280> these<00:04:22.580> shocks<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.180> when<00:04:23.539> you<00:04:23.630> go

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
thing about these shocks is when you go

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.719 
thing about these shocks is when you go
to<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:23.960> track<00:04:24.199> we<00:04:24.680> can<00:04:24.830> stiffen<00:04:25.280> up<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.490> shock

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
to the track we can stiffen up the shock

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.700 
to the track we can stiffen up the shock
rate<00:04:25.970> which<00:04:26.509> gets<00:04:26.780> more<00:04:26.990> performance<00:04:27.500> out<00:04:27.650> of

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
rate which gets more performance out of

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.439 
rate which gets more performance out of
the<00:04:27.949> whole<00:04:28.130> assembly<00:04:28.669> gives<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> better

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
the whole assembly gives you a better

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.659 
the whole assembly gives you a better
track<00:04:29.780> time<00:04:30.050> better<00:04:30.380> control<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.039> obviously

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
track time better control and obviously

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.589 
track time better control and obviously
that's<00:04:31.910> what<00:04:32.060> you're<00:04:32.150> going<00:04:32.240> to<00:04:32.300> be<00:04:32.419> chasing

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:32.599 
that's what you're going to be chasing

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:56.020 
that's what you're going to be chasing
at<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:32.960> track

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.970 

overall<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.420> a<00:04:57.600> very<00:04:57.630> reliable<00:04:58.200> package<00:04:58.770> I

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
overall it's a very reliable package I

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.250 
overall it's a very reliable package I
mean<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.850> long<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.510> short<00:05:00.540> of<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.020> you

mean the long and the short of it is you

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.750 
mean the long and the short of it is you
definitely<00:05:01.680> get<00:05:01.860> what<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.100> pay<00:05:02.310> for<00:05:02.340> and

definitely get what you pay for and

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.940
