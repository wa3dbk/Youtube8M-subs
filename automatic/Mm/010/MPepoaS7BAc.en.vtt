00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
view now the first question I would ask

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.920 
view now the first question I would ask
here<00:00:34.580> is<00:00:34.760> why<00:00:35.240> are<00:00:35.390> there<00:00:35.510> are<00:00:35.570> only<00:00:35.660> two

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
here is why are there are only two

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.260 
here is why are there are only two
soldiers<00:00:36.290> if<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.370> military<00:00:37.760> sent<00:00:38.060> out<00:00:38.240> a

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
soldiers if the military sent out a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.210 
soldiers if the military sent out a
search<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:38.900> rescue<00:00:38.990> mission<00:00:39.590> with<00:00:39.920> such<00:00:40.190> a

search and rescue mission with such a

search and rescue mission with such a
small<00:00:40.610> force<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.180> would<00:00:41.630> have<00:00:41.809> to<00:00:41.960> assume<00:00:42.260> they

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
small force I would have to assume they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.320 
small force I would have to assume they
do<00:00:42.470> not<00:00:42.739> yet<00:00:42.950> know<00:00:42.980> how<00:00:43.400> serious<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.300> threat

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
do not yet know how serious the threat

do not yet know how serious the threat
is<00:00:44.690> this<00:00:45.440> could<00:00:45.739> therefore<00:00:46.010> mean<00:00:46.460> this<00:00:46.610> will

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
is this could therefore mean this will

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.240 
is this could therefore mean this will
be<00:00:46.910> an<00:00:47.030> early<00:00:47.180> scene<00:00:47.570> in<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.780> movie<00:00:48.160> after<00:00:49.160> the

be an early scene in the movie after the
two<00:00:49.430> soldiers<00:00:49.760> turned<00:00:50.180> to<00:00:50.360> run<00:00:50.570> we<00:00:50.750> see<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.020> huge

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
two soldiers turned to run we see a huge

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.680 
two soldiers turned to run we see a huge
spike<00:00:51.830> crash<00:00:52.190> into<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.580> track<00:00:52.879> killing<00:00:53.570> one

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
spike crash into the track killing one

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.080 
spike crash into the track killing one
of<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.930> men<00:00:54.080> in<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.290> process<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.430> size<00:00:55.700> shape

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
of the men in the process the size shape

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.600 
of the men in the process the size shape
and<00:00:56.270> layout<00:00:56.720> of<00:00:56.750> these<00:00:57.020> spikes<00:00:57.410> suggests<00:00:58.280> this

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
and layout of these spikes suggests this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.730 
and layout of these spikes suggests this
isn't<00:00:59.060> Godzilla<00:00:59.570> but<00:00:59.750> instead<00:01:00.110> one<00:01:00.500> of<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
isn't Godzilla but instead one of the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.220 
isn't Godzilla but instead one of the
Muto<00:01:01.100> monsters<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:01.760> also<00:01:02.480> wonder<00:01:02.960> if<00:01:03.079> this

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
Muto monsters I also wonder if this

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.260 
Muto monsters I also wonder if this
monster<00:01:03.650> actually<00:01:04.040> set<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:04.400> scenario<00:01:04.880> up<00:01:05.089> as

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
monster actually set this scenario up as

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.570 
monster actually set this scenario up as
a<00:01:05.330> trap<00:01:05.750> if<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:06.830> creature<00:01:07.160> has<00:01:07.340> shown

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
a trap if so this creature has shown

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.210 
a trap if so this creature has shown
considerable<00:01:08.030> intelligence<00:01:08.860> next<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:09.979> see<00:01:10.190> a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
considerable intelligence next we see a

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.490 
considerable intelligence next we see a
devastated<00:01:11.060> City<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.660> very<00:01:12.020> clear<00:01:12.229> path

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
devastated City with a very clear path

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.650 
devastated City with a very clear path
of<00:01:12.680> destruction<00:01:12.890> running<00:01:13.610> through<00:01:13.820> it<00:01:13.970> from

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
of destruction running through it from

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.330 
of destruction running through it from
the<00:01:14.750> path<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.170> would<00:01:15.259> seem<00:01:15.500> as<00:01:15.649> if<00:01:15.800> only<00:01:16.130> one

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the path it would seem as if only one

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.760 
the path it would seem as if only one
client<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:16.790> has<00:01:16.910> caused<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:17.330> damage<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:18.350> also

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
client you has caused the damage it also

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.440 
client you has caused the damage it also
seems<00:01:19.100> as<00:01:19.310> if<00:01:19.340> whatever<00:01:19.610> caused<00:01:20.090> this<00:01:20.270> damage

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
seems as if whatever caused this damage

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.540 
seems as if whatever caused this damage
had<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> very<00:01:21.380> clear<00:01:21.619> destination<00:01:22.280> in<00:01:22.369> mind

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
had a very clear destination in mind

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.790 
had a very clear destination in mind
there<00:01:23.330> is<00:01:23.479> very<00:01:23.750> little<00:01:23.869> deviation<00:01:24.320> from<00:01:24.649> the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
there is very little deviation from the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.160 
there is very little deviation from the
path<00:01:24.979> of<00:01:25.130> destruction<00:01:25.340> itself<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.840> could

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
path of destruction itself this could

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.690 
path of destruction itself this could
therefore<00:01:27.530> indicate<00:01:28.220> that<00:01:28.250> whichever

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
therefore indicate that whichever

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.789 
therefore indicate that whichever
creature<00:01:29.090> did<00:01:29.390> this<00:01:29.540> Godzilla<00:01:30.229> or<00:01:30.380> Muto

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
creature did this Godzilla or Muto

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.620 
creature did this Godzilla or Muto
didn't<00:01:31.400> destroy<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> city<00:01:32.060> for<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.390> sake<00:01:32.600> of

didn't destroy the city for the sake of

didn't destroy the city for the sake of
destroying<00:01:33.170> it<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:33.770> instead<00:01:34.130> just<00:01:34.370> to<00:01:34.460> get<00:01:34.670> to

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
destroying it but instead just to get to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.510 
destroying it but instead just to get to
a<00:01:34.850> specific<00:01:35.060> location<00:01:35.770> here<00:01:36.770> we<00:01:36.920> have<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.130> shot

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
a specific location here we have a shot

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.010 
a specific location here we have a shot
of<00:01:37.670> Bryan<00:01:38.000> Cranston<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.630> Aaron

taylor-johnson<00:01:39.320> if<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.460> look<00:01:40.610> behind<00:01:40.760> them

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
taylor-johnson if you look behind them

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.490 
taylor-johnson if you look behind them
there<00:01:41.270> is<00:01:41.390> definitely<00:01:41.810> been<00:01:42.049> a<00:01:42.080> disturbance

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
there is definitely been a disturbance

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.770 
there is definitely been a disturbance
so<00:01:43.400> it<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.670> very<00:01:43.820> likely<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.330> these<00:01:44.540> two<00:01:44.750> are

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
so it is very likely that these two are

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.030 
so it is very likely that these two are
trying<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.200> figure<00:01:45.320> out<00:01:45.470> what<00:01:45.770> could<00:01:45.950> have

we have a great scene that is very

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.890 
we have a great scene that is very

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
destruction was I suspect it may

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.440 
destruction was I suspect it may
actually<00:02:19.040> have<00:02:19.370> been<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.519> mutant<00:02:19.880> monster<00:02:20.269> or

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
actually have been a mutant monster or

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.030 
actually have been a mutant monster or
at<00:02:20.810> least<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:21.079> combination<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.739> the<00:02:21.860> two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
at least a combination of the two

at least a combination of the two

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
seeing some compelling evidence it looks

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.449 
seeing some compelling evidence it looks
as<00:02:27.049> if<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.290> client<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.860> destroys<00:02:28.250> his

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
extremely difficult to make out but the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.750 
extremely difficult to make out but the
face<00:02:33.349> of<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.709> creature<00:02:33.980> does<00:02:34.250> appear<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.640> have

here<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.720> see<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.960> military<00:02:39.500> engaging<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
here we see the military engaging a

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.770 
here we see the military engaging a
preacher's<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.850> right<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.300> bridge<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
preacher's to the right of a bridge and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.960 
preacher's to the right of a bridge and
I'm<00:02:42.170> very<00:02:42.590> confident<00:02:43.130> this<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.490> the<00:02:43.670> Muto

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
I'm very confident this is the Muto

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.090 
I'm very confident this is the Muto
monster<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.570> while<00:02:45.140> back<00:02:45.170> there<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:45.920> leak

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
monster a while back there was a leak

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.890 
monster a while back there was a leak
toy<00:02:46.370> set<00:02:46.730> which<00:02:46.940> included<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.510> destroyed

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
toy set which included a destroyed

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.810 
toy set which included a destroyed
bridge<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.860> monster<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.370> definitely

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
bridge and a monster that definitely

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.540 
bridge and a monster that definitely
wasn't<00:02:50.090> Godzilla<00:02:50.710> ever<00:02:51.710> since<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.160> earlier

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
wasn't Godzilla ever since the earlier

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.220 
wasn't Godzilla ever since the earlier
trailers<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.150> found<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.570> idea<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:53.990> these

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
trailers I found the idea that these

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.810 
trailers I found the idea that these
planes<00:02:54.590> have<00:02:54.770> been<00:02:54.800> knocked<00:02:55.070> out<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.460> the<00:02:55.580> sky

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
planes have been knocked out to the sky

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.420 
planes have been knocked out to the sky
by<00:02:56.000> Godzilla<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.900> be<00:02:57.020> unconvincing<00:02:57.470> if<00:02:57.950> that

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
by Godzilla to be unconvincing if that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.010 
by Godzilla to be unconvincing if that
was<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.700> case<00:02:58.730> surely<00:02:59.630> there<00:02:59.810> would<00:02:59.870> be<00:02:59.930> a

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
was the case surely there would be a

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.960 
was the case surely there would be a
clear<00:03:00.260> smoke<00:03:00.650> trail<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.400> from<00:03:01.610> what<00:03:01.670> I<00:03:01.790> can

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
clear smoke trail but from what I can

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.150 
clear smoke trail but from what I can
see<00:03:02.090> here<00:03:02.270> the<00:03:02.900> plane<00:03:03.140> has<00:03:03.440> remained<00:03:03.770> intact

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
see here the plane has remained intact

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.460 
see here the plane has remained intact
this<00:03:05.060> leads<00:03:05.390> me<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.720> believe<00:03:05.750> that<00:03:05.990> one<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
this leads me to believe that one of the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.110 
this leads me to believe that one of the
monsters<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.070> movie<00:03:07.430> has<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.760> ability

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
monsters in this movie has the ability

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.270 
monsters in this movie has the ability
to<00:03:08.150> send<00:03:08.510> out<00:03:08.660> an<00:03:08.810> EMP<00:03:09.260> similar<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.860> lever<00:03:10.040> back

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
to send out an EMP similar to lever back

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.790 
to send out an EMP similar to lever back
from<00:03:10.490> Pacific<00:03:10.880> Rim

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
from Pacific Rim

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.160 
from Pacific Rim
now<00:03:13.550> this<00:03:13.730> scene<00:03:14.030> is<00:03:14.060> very<00:03:14.270> difficult<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.020> make

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
now this scene is very difficult to make

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.110 
now this scene is very difficult to make
out<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.710> looks<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.010> if<00:03:16.070> a<00:03:16.340> group<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.760> people

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
out but it looks as if a group of people

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.210 
out but it looks as if a group of people
have<00:03:17.270> been<00:03:17.390> evacuated<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> rooftop<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.950> the

have been evacuated to a rooftop and the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.710 
have been evacuated to a rooftop and the
military<00:03:19.400> are<00:03:19.670> sending<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.150> extraction<00:03:20.690> of

military are sending up extraction of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.990 
direction of the explosion i would say
that<00:03:30.200> a<00:03:30.410> monster<00:03:30.830> has<00:03:30.980> ever<00:03:31.190> thrown<00:03:31.430> something

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
that a monster has ever thrown something

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.040 

I<00:03:40.980> think<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:41.970> probably<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.450> shot<00:03:42.810> most

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
I think this is probably the shot most

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.290 
I think this is probably the shot most

people are interested in to my eyes this

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.180 
people are interested in to my eyes this
looks<00:03:45.540> as<00:03:45.690> if<00:03:45.720> it<00:03:45.930> could<00:03:46.140> be<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> Muto<00:03:46.739> monster

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
looks as if it could be the Muto monster

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.070 
looks as if it could be the Muto monster
by<00:03:47.640> due<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.209> lighting<00:03:48.569> effects<00:03:48.900> it's

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
by due to the lighting effects it's

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.660 
by due to the lighting effects it's
still<00:03:49.290> tricky<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.770> really<00:03:50.040> get<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.370> good<00:03:50.610> look

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
still tricky to really get a good look

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.450 
still tricky to really get a good look
as<00:03:50.940> it

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
as it

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.740 
as it
finally<00:03:53.460> we<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.820> get<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> great<00:03:54.450> shot<00:03:54.480> of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
finally we do get a great shot of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.720 
finally we do get a great shot of
Godzilla<00:03:55.350> roaring<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:56.190> will<00:03:56.340> notice<00:03:56.520> that

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
Godzilla roaring you will notice that

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.950 
Godzilla roaring you will notice that
Godzilla<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.390> looking<00:03:57.690> straight<00:03:57.930> forward

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
Godzilla is looking straight forward

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.080 
Godzilla is looking straight forward
which<00:03:58.710> suggests<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.250> me<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.460> he's<00:03:59.700> about<00:03:59.910> to

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
which suggests to me that he's about to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.150 
which suggests to me that he's about to
engage<00:04:00.360> something<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.380> a<00:04:01.470> similar<00:04:01.920> size

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
engage something that is a similar size

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.550 
engage something that is a similar size
to<00:04:02.190> himself<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.540> dust<00:04:03.810> surrounding<00:04:03.990> him<00:04:04.410> also

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
to himself the dust surrounding him also

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.140 
to himself the dust surrounding him also
makes<00:04:04.860> me<00:04:05.010> think<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.310> he's<00:04:05.520> standing<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
makes me think that he's standing in the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.170 
makes me think that he's standing in the
remains<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.660> destroyed<00:04:07.020> City<00:04:07.850> this<00:04:08.850> was<00:04:09.030> my
