00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
looking at it's not the best value not

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
looking at it's not the best value not
only<00:00:52.680> but<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.160> certainly<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> long-

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
only but it's certainly about the long-

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
only but it's certainly about the long-
for<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.539> money<00:00:54.719> behind<00:00:54.949> Alex<00:00:55.949> Ferguson<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for my money behind Alex Ferguson it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
for my money behind Alex Ferguson it
seems<00:00:56.940> inconceivable<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.350> man<00:00:58.800> she'd<00:00:59.010> met

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
seems inconceivable that a man she'd met

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.470 
seems inconceivable that a man she'd met
would<00:00:59.309> do<00:00:59.399> anything<00:00:59.699> other<00:00:59.910> than<00:01:00.090> winning

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
would do anything other than winning

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
night winning both halves and I can't

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
night winning both halves and I can't
really<00:01:26.100> think<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.640> West<00:01:26.939> Brom<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.299> really

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
really think what West Brom can really

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
really think what West Brom can really
do<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> combat<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.110> suppose<00:01:28.950> even<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.490> of
