00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.620 
the 6-foot 175-pound er that physical
play<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.320> be<00:01:27.350> such<00:01:27.800> a<00:01:27.830> huge<00:01:28.520> factor<00:01:29.120> in<00:01:29.330> some

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
play can be such a huge factor in some

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.380

of<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.810> games<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.380> that<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.820> momentum

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
of the games now that and the momentum

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.750 
of the games now that and the momentum
shift<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:33.020> really<00:01:33.830> spark<00:01:34.160> your<00:01:34.310> teammates

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
shift and really spark your teammates

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.670 
shift and really spark your teammates
and<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.150> really<00:01:35.630> like<00:01:35.810> doing<00:01:35.990> that<00:01:36.140> stuff<00:01:36.500> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
and I really like doing that stuff and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.220 
and I really like doing that stuff and
the<00:01:37.160> opportunity<00:01:37.730> comes<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:38.120> like<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.870> take<00:01:39.050> it

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
the opportunity comes I like to take it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.590 
the opportunity comes I like to take it
I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:39.890> he's<00:01:40.070> made<00:01:40.280> big<00:01:41.060> strides<00:01:41.300> in<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
I think he's made big strides in that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.660 
I think he's made big strides in that
regard<00:01:42.110> as<00:01:42.290> far<00:01:42.500> as<00:01:42.620> picking<00:01:42.950> his<00:01:43.040> spots<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
regard as far as picking his spots and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.510 
regard as far as picking his spots and
and<00:01:43.880> learning<00:01:44.630> when<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.900> use<00:01:45.080> that<00:01:45.110> and<00:01:45.980> that's

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
and learning when to use that and that's

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.070 
and learning when to use that and that's
all<00:01:46.730> part<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:47.000> his<00:01:47.090> learning<00:01:47.270> process<00:01:47.480> but

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
all part of his learning process but

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.740 
all part of his learning process but
certainly<00:01:48.580> it's<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.700> special<00:01:50.120> ability<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.659> it

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
certainly it's a special ability and it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.360 
certainly it's a special ability and it
can<00:01:50.900> change<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.380> change<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.010> flow<00:01:52.190> of<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
can change the change the flow of the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.580 
can change the change the flow of the
game<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:53.180> seventeen-year-old<00:01:53.990> is<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
game the seventeen-year-old is on the
