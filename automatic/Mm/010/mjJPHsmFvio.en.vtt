rotation<00:02:23.190> here<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:24.540> much<00:02:24.660> rotation<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
rotation here that much rotation is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.610 
rotation here that much rotation is
fairly<00:02:25.830> simple<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.870> lot<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> opener

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
fairly simple it's a lot on the opener

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.559 
fairly simple it's a lot on the opener
and<00:02:28.770> then<00:02:29.010> afterwards<00:02:29.550> it's<00:02:29.819> more<00:02:30.300> of

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
and then afterwards it's more of

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.690 
and then afterwards it's more of
repetitive<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.380> keeping<00:02:31.860> track<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.160> cool

I'll<00:05:34.409> usually<00:05:34.710> I'm<00:05:35.610> really<00:05:35.849> good<00:05:35.969> at<00:05:36.000> keeping

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
I'll usually I'm really good at keeping

I'll usually I'm really good at keeping
track<00:05:36.419> of<00:05:36.479> it<00:05:36.690> I<00:05:36.810> don't<00:05:36.990> really<00:05:37.080> have<00:05:37.199> a

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:37.289 
track of it I don't really have a

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.279 
track of it I don't really have a
problem<00:05:37.500> with<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.770> but<00:05:39.110> you<00:05:40.110> need<00:05:40.199> to<00:05:40.259> keep

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
problem with it but you need to keep

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.040 
problem with it but you need to keep
track<00:05:40.529> of<00:05:40.590> that<00:05:40.770> also<00:05:41.629> sacrifices<00:05:42.629> using<00:05:42.960> for

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
track of that also sacrifices using for

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.899 
track of that also sacrifices using for
our<00:05:43.110> sacrifice<00:05:43.620> that's<00:05:44.039> really<00:05:44.279> huge<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.729> mean

out like that it's just it wasn't
switching<00:07:12.860> targets<00:07:13.250> for<00:07:13.370> me<00:07:13.490> so<00:07:13.850> that<00:07:14.000> happens

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
switching targets for me so that happens

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.129 
switching targets for me so that happens
to<00:07:14.419> do<00:07:14.510> just<00:07:14.780> be<00:07:14.900> careful<00:07:15.530> of<00:07:15.620> that<00:07:15.650> um<00:07:16.039> on

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:17.139 
to do just be careful of that um on

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.310 
to do just be careful of that um on
gruel<00:07:18.139> you<00:07:18.380> may<00:07:18.820> want<00:07:19.820> I<00:07:20.360> mean<00:07:20.660> I<00:07:20.690> think<00:07:20.990> I

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
gruel you may want I mean I think I

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.020 
gruel you may want I mean I think I
think<00:07:21.500> it's<00:07:21.620> just<00:07:21.680> for<00:07:21.889> the<00:07:21.949> Stampede<00:07:22.370> pets<00:07:22.580> so

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
think it's just for the Stampede pets so

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.969 
think it's just for the Stampede pets so
if<00:07:23.419> you're<00:07:23.750> gonna<00:07:24.020> take<00:07:24.320> blink<00:07:24.530> strikes<00:07:24.680> I

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:24.979 
if you're gonna take blink strikes I

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.650 
if you're gonna take blink strikes I
don't<00:07:25.280> think<00:07:25.340> it'll<00:07:25.789> be<00:07:25.820> much<00:07:26.030> benefit<00:07:26.360> I<00:07:26.449> just

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.660 
don't think it'll be much benefit I just

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:27.760 
don't think it'll be much benefit I just
go<00:07:26.840> with<00:07:26.960> murder<00:07:27.169> of<00:07:27.260> crows<00:07:27.380> because<00:07:27.590> blink

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770 
go with murder of crows because blink

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.740 
go with murder of crows because blink
strikes<00:07:27.860> is<00:07:28.039> only<00:07:28.160> for<00:07:28.370> your<00:07:28.610> actual<00:07:29.150> main<00:07:29.449> pet

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
strikes is only for your actual main pet

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.180 
strikes is only for your actual main pet
so<00:07:30.110> I'm<00:07:30.169> pretty<00:07:30.289> sure<00:07:30.410> Stampede<00:07:30.889> will<00:07:31.010> still

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
so I'm pretty sure Stampede will still

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.210
