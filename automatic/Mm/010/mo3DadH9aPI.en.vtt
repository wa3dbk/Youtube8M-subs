00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
together how difficult is it for an

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.310 
together how difficult is it for an

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
Hollywood yeah I mean that's I think

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.610 
Hollywood yeah I mean that's I think
it's<00:03:39.030> difficult<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.540> an<00:03:39.720> actor<00:03:40.020> from<00:03:40.110> any<00:03:40.350> way

to sort of get into Hollywood and it was

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.170 
to sort of get into Hollywood and it was
it<00:03:43.230> was<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.680> ironic<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.550> I<00:03:44.610> sort<00:03:45.090> of

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it was very ironic that I sort of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.870 
it was very ironic that I sort of
managed<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.630> do<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.870> by<00:03:46.560> playing<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.460> South

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
managed to do it by playing a South

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.880 
managed to do it by playing a South
African<00:03:48.270> character<00:03:48.960> you<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.500> think

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
African character you know that I think

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.120 
African character you know that I think
is<00:03:50.010> particularly<00:03:50.460> unusual<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:52.260> even<00:03:52.890> a<00:03:52.980> South

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
is particularly unusual and even a South

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.470 
is particularly unusual and even a South
African<00:03:53.490> character<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.940> South<00:03:54.060> Africans

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
African character that South Africans

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.090 
African character that South Africans

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
would not ordinarily have been proud of

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.410 
would not ordinarily have been proud of
you<00:03:56.400> know<00:03:56.490> something<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.760> Vicki's<00:03:57.180> phantom

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
you know something like Vicki's phantom
