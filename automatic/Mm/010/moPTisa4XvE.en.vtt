00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 are two teams that during the 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.760
 have had a phase in which they have 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.350
 much praised but now projects 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.570
 final stage of the competition is hands 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.920
 that match and bigger important 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.720
 yes the sweetest bolt peter team 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 bosz of course known separately but then 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.770
 we go wrong here with bicycle and has the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.020
 twenty four men under 16 meters 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.039
 provides castaignos with the chance to have ring 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.039
 of field houses 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.640
 Yes alright 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.660
 there is something there is something about it 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.920
 from or natural his left leg 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.580
 tari twents god 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.580
 or that you thought 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.100
 yet again to come democracy 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.820
 the outside right now but will succeed 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.229
 whoever prints you 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.229
 in the end that is searching 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.729
 and then the ball is again the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.570
 outside it is the tree is too 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.570
 stutter dietrich 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.110
 come on jos this is well played here 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.110
 something about the side of the competition 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.450
 feyenoord doesn't actually do that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.570
 this answer it is nice to have something from 65 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.570
 meter 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.430
 as 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.100
 see it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.230
 from the second line this button that sure 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.620
 is not harmless from the start 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.989
 walk 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.989
 So by custom our office chance you 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.670
 and also with the e-mail 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.220
 precisely at a stage where I thought we were 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.080
 we had just completely in the grip 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.830
 you give such a phase as we call it 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.330
 at the one making my mistakes and then 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.330
 throw I ate call it much harder 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.400
 this is red from others 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.459
 yeah i just knew that to set up 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.240
 Penalty Martine goes here with two 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.240
 years may like me 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.040
 castaignos chestnuts beautiful silent 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.040
 thalys I can decide thalys 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.870
 curious after four 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.370
 matches this can bring against the 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.610
 they no terms always one of the best 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.349
 plowing from van netherlands you have to go alone 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.400
 but in this plan lobster 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.989
 therefore, undoubtedly more 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.780
 the ball goes it but it also has to be 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.790
 can accept them and and and create 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.230
 that just doesn't have enough chances 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.550
 one did not disagree though 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.989
 then backing to walking and 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.510
 I suspected his touch and I had 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.780
 just feel that you are 100 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 that we are the spaces at that moment 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.940
 that he was going to fall and that we 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.940
 spaces could use peter
