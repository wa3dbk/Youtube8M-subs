you put oil on it to the previous of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.449 
you put oil on it to the previous of
squeaking<00:02:23.730> so<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.780> order<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.410> prevent<00:02:26.100> any

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
squeaking so in order to prevent any

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.730 
squeaking so in order to prevent any
jams<00:02:26.880> in<00:02:27.209> your<00:02:27.360> muscles<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.020> keep<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.320> moving

gonna get really fat so I think it's

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.670 
gonna get really fat so I think it's
pretty<00:02:38.430> simple<00:02:38.700> well<00:02:39.690> I'm<00:02:39.900> thinking<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
pretty simple well I'm thinking about it

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.070 
pretty simple well I'm thinking about it
one<00:02:40.980> more<00:02:41.220> awesome<00:02:41.940> benefit<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.510> keeping<00:02:42.780> it

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
one more awesome benefit of keeping it

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.520 
one more awesome benefit of keeping it

negative as in you just took that water

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.530 
negative as in you just took that water
out<00:05:24.950> of<00:05:25.100> your<00:05:25.190> body<00:05:25.460> you<00:05:25.760> gets<00:05:26.150> coffee<00:05:26.360> is

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
out of your body you gets coffee is

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.420 
out of your body you gets coffee is
actually<00:05:26.870> a<00:05:26.900> natural<00:05:27.350> laxative<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:28.040> it

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
actually a natural laxative and it

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.760 
actually a natural laxative and it
removes<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.880> water<00:05:29.060> from<00:05:29.330> your<00:05:29.360> body<00:05:29.660> so<00:05:30.410> if

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
removes the water from your body so if

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.890 
removes the water from your body so if

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.260 
you're having a cup of coffee a good
rule<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.140> thumb<00:05:33.290> is<00:05:33.650> that<00:05:33.680> you<00:05:34.130> need<00:05:34.310> to<00:05:34.580> match

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
rule of thumb is that you need to match

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.450 
rule of thumb is that you need to match
it<00:05:35.510> up<00:05:35.570> with<00:05:35.630> about<00:05:35.840> two<00:05:36.260> glasses<00:05:36.740> two<00:05:37.220> 8-ounce

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
it up with about two glasses two 8-ounce

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.120 
it up with about two glasses two 8-ounce
glasses<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:38.300> water<00:05:38.600> so<00:05:39.230> say<00:05:39.470> you<00:05:39.530> took<00:05:39.800> two<00:05:40.010> out

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
glasses of water so say you took two out

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.650 
glasses of water so say you took two out
eight-ounce<00:05:40.520> glasses<00:05:40.850> of<00:05:41.150> water<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.570> then

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
eight-ounce glasses of water and then

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.420 
eight-ounce glasses of water and then
you<00:05:41.750> have<00:05:41.870> your<00:05:41.900> cup<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.260> coffee<00:05:42.470> basically
