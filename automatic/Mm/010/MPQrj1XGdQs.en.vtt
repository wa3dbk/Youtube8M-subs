00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.990 
surprised like how little damage has
been<00:01:22.990> doing<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.500> stuff<00:01:23.710> so<00:01:24.009> maybe<00:01:24.729> it's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
been doing to stuff so maybe it's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.400 
been doing to stuff so maybe it's
because<00:01:25.119> I'm<00:01:25.330> running<00:01:25.630> sort<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.899> calm<00:01:26.140> nature

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
because I'm running sort of calm nature

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.779 
because I'm running sort of calm nature
i<00:01:26.649> guess<00:01:26.709> i'm<00:01:27.039> running<00:01:27.250> more<00:01:27.369> specially

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
i guess i'm running more specially

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.749 
i guess i'm running more specially
defensive<00:01:28.240> nature<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.810> stuff<00:01:28.959> but<00:01:29.349> overall<00:01:30.280> I

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
defensive nature and stuff but overall I

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.880 
defensive nature and stuff but overall I
guess<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.450> doesn't<00:01:31.630> do<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.110> much<00:01:32.170> now<00:01:32.649> here<00:01:32.860> I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
guess it doesn't do that much now here I

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.999 
guess it doesn't do that much now here I
was<00:01:33.160> I<00:01:33.429> was<00:01:34.119> thinking<00:01:34.479> maybe<00:01:34.750> switch<00:01:35.649> out<00:01:35.860> to

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
was I was thinking maybe switch out to

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.440 
was I was thinking maybe switch out to
something<00:01:36.369> but<00:01:36.520> I<00:01:36.550> didn't<00:01:36.940> think<00:01:37.030> nine<00:01:37.209> tails

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
something but I didn't think nine tails

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.440 
something but I didn't think nine tails
was<00:01:37.660> really<00:01:37.899> worth<00:01:38.140> keeping<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.009> be<00:01:39.099> honest

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
was really worth keeping to be honest

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.779 
was really worth keeping to be honest
nothing<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:40.539> his<00:01:40.660> team<00:01:40.840> was<00:01:41.050> you<00:01:41.319> know<00:01:41.440> that

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
nothing on his team was you know that

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.550 
nothing on his team was you know that
much<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:42.970> problem<00:01:43.000> when<00:01:43.720> something<00:01:44.380> else

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
much of a problem when something else

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.249 
much of a problem when something else
couldn't<00:01:44.950> take<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.160> out<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.789> I<00:01:46.060> guess<00:01:46.720> I<00:01:47.110> was

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
couldn't take it out so I guess I was

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.050 
couldn't take it out so I guess I was
kind<00:01:47.289> of<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.679> sacrifice<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.310> made<00:01:48.340> he<00:01:48.789> didn't

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
martyred a little bit I guess overall in

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.070 
martyred a little bit I guess overall in
the<00:04:29.010> long<00:04:29.220> run<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.610> did<00:04:29.790> matter<00:04:29.970> too<00:04:30.270> much<00:04:30.300> but

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the long run it did matter too much but

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.050 
the long run it did matter too much but
at<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.410> point<00:04:31.680> volcarona

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
at this point volcarona

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.240 
at this point volcarona
you<00:04:33.660> know<00:04:33.780> he<00:04:34.020> has<00:04:34.200> everyone<00:04:34.770> in<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.040> palm<00:04:35.220> of

sweeping<00:04:38.520> everyone<00:04:38.910> as<00:04:39.120> i<00:04:39.300> said<00:04:39.540> the<00:04:40.080> Sun<00:04:40.260> team

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
sweeping everyone as i said the Sun team

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.950 
sweeping everyone as i said the Sun team
is<00:04:40.740> is<00:04:41.220> cool<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.880> stuff<00:04:42.150> but<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.480> lot<00:04:42.810> of<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
is is cool and stuff but a lot of the

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.629 
is is cool and stuff but a lot of the
time<00:04:43.139> it<00:04:43.290> just<00:04:43.320> goes<00:04:43.680> ahead<00:04:43.830> and<00:04:44.040> sweep<00:04:44.400> stuff

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
time it just goes ahead and sweep stuff

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.280 
time it just goes ahead and sweep stuff
as<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.850> can<00:04:44.970> see<00:04:45.120> sleep<00:04:45.480> powder<00:04:45.750> miss<00:04:46.050> there

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
as you can see sleep powder miss there

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.220 
as you can see sleep powder miss there
which<00:04:46.500> was<00:04:46.620> pretty<00:04:46.980> big<00:04:47.540> but<00:04:48.540> you<00:04:48.840> know<00:04:48.990> I

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
which was pretty big but you know I

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.860 
which was pretty big but you know I
dodged<00:04:49.889> it<00:04:50.160> because<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.520> volcarona<00:04:50.820> and<00:04:51.300> hit

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
dodged it because it's volcarona and hit

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.070 
dodged it because it's volcarona and hit
Dodgers<00:04:52.230> stuff<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:53.040> I<00:04:53.280> guess<00:04:54.090> those<00:04:54.570> three

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
Dodgers stuff so I guess those three

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.290 
Dodgers stuff so I guess those three
mrs.<00:04:55.710> were<00:04:55.919> kind<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.280> big<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.610> him<00:04:56.760> overall

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
mrs. were kind of big for him overall

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.060 
mrs. were kind of big for him overall
though<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.630> he'd<00:04:57.750> hit<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:57.990> toxic<00:04:58.500> first<00:04:58.770> turn

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
though if he'd hit the toxic first turn

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.409 
though if he'd hit the toxic first turn
than<00:04:59.250> his<00:04:59.370> derrida<00:04:59.700> wouldn't<00:05:00.060> have<00:05:00.150> been<00:05:00.300> able

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
than his derrida wouldn't have been able

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.780 
than his derrida wouldn't have been able
to<00:05:00.600> do<00:05:00.750> anything<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.230> me<00:05:01.350> pretty<00:05:02.280> much<00:05:02.490> sleep

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
to do anything to me pretty much sleep

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.310 
to do anything to me pretty much sleep
powder<00:05:02.970> was<00:05:03.210> his<00:05:03.300> only<00:05:03.419> option<00:05:03.660> so<00:05:03.960> I<00:05:04.020> guess<00:05:04.200> it

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
powder was his only option so I guess it

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.530 
powder was his only option so I guess it
was<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.440> blessing<00:05:04.800> that<00:05:05.010> his<00:05:05.400> uh<00:05:05.430> his<00:05:05.790> toxics

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
was a blessing that his uh his toxics

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.960 
was a blessing that his uh his toxics
missed<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.169> um<00:05:07.320> yeah<00:05:08.250> I'm<00:05:08.550> just<00:05:08.729> gonna<00:05:08.880> be

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
missed but um yeah I'm just gonna be

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.010 
missed but um yeah I'm just gonna be
able<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.150> finish<00:05:09.240> off<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.510> rest<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.750> his<00:05:09.840> guys

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
able to finish off the rest of his guys

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.540 
able to finish off the rest of his guys
