00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.880
 the cup classic comes to mesut özil 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.680
 at its best time of the season 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.629
 point to meet 100 games with the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.760
 Real Madrid The German has taken stock 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.500
 for bwin of this time as Madridista 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.539
 and its best moments curiously 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.430
 they have victories against the barça 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.730
 and the titles conquered in one place 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.730
 of honor 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.239
 first of all I am very grateful for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.649
 to be able to play in such a big club on 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.419
 first match with Real Madrid was 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.759
 something very special for me naturally 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.739
 but the most beautiful moments arrived 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.659
 when you win titles with the club and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.670
 for me those were the most 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.019
 nice for example the final against the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.540
 barcelona when we beat them 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:46.370
 supercopa or league title that's left 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.590
 in the memory forever I sign 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.329
 because the imminent classic is again 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.579
 an incentive a motivation for mesut 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.649
 the Real Madrid likes the competition of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.809
 Cup likes to face this rival and 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.940
 has the keys to be able to defeat him and 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.280
 stand in the end 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.110
 and naturally we know that Barcelona 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.940
 has a very powerful team with very 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.549
 good players but we focus on 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.930
 we are at a good time and 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.970
 now we play at home against him 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.350
 barcelona our goal is to win the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.630
 match and offer it to our 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.890
 amateurs we want to qualify for 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 the end that is clear 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.590
 it's the biggest derby in the world and all 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.720
 world follows naturally is always 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.759
 something special for us 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.610
 players we want to show us measure ourselves 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.960
 always the best logically one 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.580
 he always wants to win this kind of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 matches mostly by fans 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.690
 that support us all year and that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.140
 we want to thank you with a victory 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.140
 before Barcelona 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.429
 no balloon 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.149
 and if we talk about classics obviously the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.979
 role of Christian ronaldo in them not 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.909
 has gone unnoticed for one of his 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.909
 senior attendees 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.210
 we know the potential that Christian has 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.860
 ronaldo is one of the best players 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.479
 of the world and in recent years has 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.399
 demonstrated how important it is to 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.680
 this equipment but after all 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.819
 it's about the team not Christian or other 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.349
 player 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.930
 naturally we know your points 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.180
 We need you strong but we have to 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.900
 function as a team to succeed 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.130
 the mansion 2003 is the best level 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.750
 shown by özil has made the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 qualifiers are sold out for the game 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.069
 of the German full of magic class a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.930
 definitely different player though 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.209
 when I mentioned this qualifier 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.209
 mesut is prudent and modest 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 I do not know how I should answer that question 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.720
 logically I'm happy because the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.490
 people see me like this 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.590
 my goal is always to offer my potential 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.510
 I have fun playing on the grass 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.610
 soccer I enjoy being in the field and 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.620
 playing with the ball that says something 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.740
 so I'm proud to walk 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.360
 with souza it was time for the classic 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.360
 the time came for the best mesut özil
