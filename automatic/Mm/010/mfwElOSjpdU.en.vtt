00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.040
 app 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.980

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:45.290

 hang on this screen the name of the seller name 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.939
 of the account owner in that case is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.280
 an account where the main user 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.890
 has more sellers registered then the 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 registered seller and sandro and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.090
 account owner 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.960
 in this second screen that would be 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.570
 register the card reader and the player 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.939
 chic as we do not have then click the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.009
 symbol of the pagseguro in the superior part 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:44.520
 left and he falls on that other one as well. 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.229
 where you can report is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 check registered readers 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.060
 accepted cards 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.939
 so let 's go for sale 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.890
 he already has on his little screen would be for 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:03.560
 to carry out the sale let's simulate a sale 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.550
 a real eg puts the rock value 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 put the card number 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.560
 I'll put any number 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:27.470
 in ok is is the validity of the magnetic card 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.170
 with the security code of the card who 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 are those three discs that are behind 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:40.630
 of anyone putting a code card 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:44.990
 ok here the summary of the sale value 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:51.230
 real time validity card final 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.330
 credit operation and confirms how the 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:00.490
 are wrong and it is logical that the sale 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.490
 It will not work and that's here
