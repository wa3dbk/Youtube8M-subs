00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.179
 governing bodies 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.730
 how do we hold hands on the steering wheel 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.429
 let's say we agree that we are 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.210
 Speech to novice drivers 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:23.789
 or students begin with a base point at 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.750
 pupil is formed all landing posture 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.970
 hand position even gaze position 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.309
 we start here the simplest 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.309
 positions without fifteen three 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.320
 hand position when switching gears 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:51.320
 right hand here left hand no lower than 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.320
 here for what if need 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.590
 starting position in both directions i 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 I have the opportunity to change direction 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:13.790
 movement is furthermore an important factor 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:18.670
 how to operate the turn signal switch neither 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.230
 by no means wrong wrong here 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.800
 it's not that you just break 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.690
 and that's what the point of contact is minimal and 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.580
 novice driver by virtue of his 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.530
 inexperience begin to look away from 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.750
 roads and look for this switch 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.330
 turn signals and again with all 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 the resulting cars started walking on 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.020
 the road 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.080
 like this, the point of contact is big 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:49.160
 miss it is simply impossible 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:51.700
 left-right in motion if you are not 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.500
 make a foothold on the steering wheel 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.080
 let's say you want to disable with right 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.929
 side turn signal into neutral in motion 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.360
 it's very hard to dose and in 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.009
 the inexperienced driver turns on instead 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.619
 neutral left turn signal 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.200
 immediately begins to look at the instrument 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.250
 I find out what board he turned on and on again 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.870
 car him walk all the way in no 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.750
 in no case should turn on the turn signal 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.560
 this part of the fingers 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 underlining it is about 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.710
 beginner driver what's the matter with 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.490
 some cars forward turns on 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.770
 main beam headlights with careless inclusion 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.360
 now this place of fingers you accidentally 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.280
 turn on the high beam naturally 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.100
 cut off on the driver post comes 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.980
 same signal in the eyes and you 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.480
 find yourself smoking and turning 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.940
 turn on as you know always before 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.430
 pulling away rebuilding turning 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.510
 turn or stop 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.830
 no advantage blinker does not 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.930
 but nevertheless we must advance 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.650
 warn others of their intentions 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.930
 drivers before stopping especially 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.450
 be careful 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.110
 you must first see the salon 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.600
 mirror make sure 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.440
 your signal understands rear diff or not 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.310
 and it is desirable to take care of it 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.310
 well in advance not at the moment of stopping
