00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
down pat i gets no breakage i guess a

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.779 
down pat i gets no breakage i guess a
lot<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.199> shedding<00:05:18.560> though<00:05:18.860> but<00:05:19.580> i<00:05:19.610> think

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
lot of shedding though but i think

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.790 
lot of shedding though but i think
that's<00:05:20.120> normal<00:05:20.479> since<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:21.020> don't<00:05:21.199> call<00:05:21.409> my<00:05:21.590> hair

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
that's normal since I don't call my hair

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800 
that's normal since I don't call my hair
every<00:05:22.099> day<00:05:22.129> so<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.669> do<00:05:22.819> think<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.300> shedding<00:05:23.659> is

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
every day so I do think the shedding is

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.939 
every day so I do think the shedding is
normal<00:05:24.699> but<00:05:25.699> yeah<00:05:25.939> um<00:05:26.389> I<00:05:26.960> don't<00:05:27.500> know<00:05:27.740> I'm

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
normal but yeah um I don't know I'm

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.230
