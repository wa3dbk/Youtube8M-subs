their rope lengths a straight line has

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.850 
their rope lengths a straight line has
come<00:00:55.629> up<00:00:55.780> with<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.019> different<00:00:56.530> bunch<00:00:56.680> of

combinations for line lengths and line

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.750 
combinations for line lengths and line
extensions<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:01.480> know<00:01:01.600> using<00:01:02.519> five<00:01:03.519> foot

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
extensions you know using five foot

doesn't really give you that many

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.389 
doesn't really give you that many
options<00:01:07.270> for<00:01:07.479> having<00:01:08.259> multiple<00:01:08.800> line<00:01:08.920> lengths

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
options for having multiple line lengths

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.310 
options for having multiple line lengths
I<00:01:09.430> mean<00:01:09.729> they've<00:01:09.880> come<00:01:10.030> up<00:01:10.060> with<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.330> three<00:01:10.990> foot

the spot we use all these different rope
lengths<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.420> try<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.660> set<00:01:22.899> people<00:01:23.110> up<00:01:23.350> for

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lengths to try to set people up for

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.090 
lengths to try to set people up for
tricks<00:01:25.390> that<00:01:25.570> they're<00:01:25.720> learning<00:01:25.899> or<00:01:26.350> even<00:01:27.009> the

tricks that they're learning or even the
pro<00:01:27.280> riders<00:01:27.520> we<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.270> know<00:01:28.360> we<00:01:28.509> use<00:01:28.720> different

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
pro riders we you know we use different

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.410 
pro riders we you know we use different
line<00:01:29.500> lengths<00:01:29.860> on<00:01:30.039> different<00:01:30.429> boats<00:01:30.580> but

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
line lengths on different boats but

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.480 
line lengths on different boats but
instead<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.690> having<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.170> make<00:01:32.320> knots<00:01:32.590> halfway

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
instead of having to make knots halfway

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.010 
instead of having to make knots halfway
between<00:01:33.640> your<00:01:33.909> five<00:01:34.119> foot<00:01:34.300> sections<00:01:34.690> which<00:01:34.840> is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
between your five foot sections which is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.469 
between your five foot sections which is
what<00:01:35.229> we've<00:01:35.679> had<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.009> past<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:37.060> we've<00:01:37.270> got

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
length often when you're too far back

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.580 
length often when you're too far back
you'll<00:01:48.280> get<00:01:48.459> awake<00:01:48.729> that's<00:01:48.970> cresting
