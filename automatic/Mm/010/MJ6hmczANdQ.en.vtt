00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.340
 at 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.870
 m 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello world that is more beautiful and we 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.070
 find today for a new 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.480
 episode of bioman alise then in this 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.530
 episode as you surely 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.779
 guessed we're going to talk about the taiga biome then 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.330
 the taiga biome these two men who are 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.160
 find under our feet 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.099
 so that's what it looks like so 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.270
 it's a pair of cold type is for 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.130
 that the grass is rather a little a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.950
 little gray I do not really know how 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
 to say but it's not a very very drink 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.520
 welcoming I find it a little green 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.280
 blue green or style a little hungry it's not 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.079
 a glass that I like then a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.149
 guillaume tougas simply a bio 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.559
 where you can find fir trees 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.109
 so Russian dspe tree trees 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 the taiga as some say so 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.670
 it's the trees that allow 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.079
 to get black wood that is no longer the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.510
 darkest wood now since he 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.340
 there was the dark rock but it's a wood the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.650
 spruce wood what are you 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.850
 know all 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.250
 then in this bio but you will find 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.480
 of course trees trees 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.140
 like that and so 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.620
 you can pick up soda spray 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.870
 so this bio is made up of only 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.160
 large expanses and file is big enough 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.800
 when we find in general it's a 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.100
 pretty big size look like that one 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.880
 is super big with trees everywhere 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.830
 only this type of tree is here 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.640
 so at the level of the relief it can be 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.160
 enough and that it can there may be some 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.890
 relief see here for example that goes up 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.010
 a little bit so know it's not a biome of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.780
 more flat we can say that like that 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.340
 and so is so it's not a bios put 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.990
 halls to install his house 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.260
 except if you find a flat area 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.870
 like Paris May 6 but it's not at all 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.880
 to this favorite medium personally from 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.410
 that at the level of specificities on 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.790
 biome what keeps us more 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.160
 compared to other bulbs so already 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.510
 it's one of the only places but get the 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:19.420
 spr us the street food so the oud 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:22.240
 like that, here's the one here 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.100
 it's also one of the only organic you 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.180
 find wolves so I tried to 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.670
 find out I saw some earlier 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.780
 just before you start 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.140
 I have to find them but it must 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.630
 not be too hard that's what 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.890
 ah here is for example final to a wolf 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.110
 so you can find wolves in 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.400
 this bio so there it may be of interest 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.380
 if you find one like that you 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.540
 may have wolves or dogs 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.190
 as you want but at the level of the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.709
 vegetation is quite poor since 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.060
 it's a cold type biome so at 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.940
 vegetation level is only 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.550
 these trees you can not find big 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.020
 more thing see there are small 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.430
 lakes here and there but there is very little 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.010
 of flowers as you can see on 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 find it but it's not the things the 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.000
 more common there are ferns of 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.260
 tall grass 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.310
 see here in flowers and you can 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.230
 also find mushrooms 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.790
 normally 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.489
 to not squeeze the mushrooms 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.830
 it's pretty rare and it's in 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.860
 a lot of small biomes but for this purpose 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.810
 me especially at this bio in my opinion 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.700
 it's not a biome that has a big 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.780
 interest 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.239
 already when you find one they are 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.540
 very very tall ships are even can 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.700
 to be huge is a bios moderately 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.849
 rare but given its size when you 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.610
 find a low you have what you 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:43.510
 what to see come wood level with everything 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:46.989
 we're really full full 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:52.150
 then there is also a variant of this 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:54.220
 biome another another taiga biome but 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.230
 it's a variant so I try to 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.299
 find while I will talk to you this 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.269
 who was not there I had seen everything 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.950
 on time but it must certainly be 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.500
 next door we'll see it's going to go 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.510
 there I see it then we'll go there 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620
 it's like you can see in the background 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.500
 map 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.230
 it's a snowy taiga biome so 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.120
 it's the same thing as the taiga biome 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.359
 on which we are except that there is some 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.359
 snow 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.060
 as you can see here 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.220
 yes there is snow covering the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.050
 soil and trees 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.180
 so it's the same thing only 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.190
 snow and other difference the lakes 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.530
 of this biome are mostly 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.440
 frozen which is not the case in 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.310
 the other taiga so if you put any 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.630
 water in this bio but it will be 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.380
 turn into ice that is not the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.570
 case in the tijd 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.479
 it's one of the rare diom you can 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.500
 find snow like this so that 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.539
 can be practical if you want to do 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.270
 the decor with snow or I do not know 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.150
 what else that needs the 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.039
 snow then that's the same thing a 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.080
 return of the wolves who spawn it's 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.120
 always the same thing except that there is 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.610
 snow ice on the ground and water 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.520
 will turn into ice there is no 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.840
 light from nearby light sources 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.680
 any case of heat source such as 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:11.139
 torches or lava or black blood stone 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.760
 So that's like playing, do not tell 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.949
 biome the most interesting for me 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.620
 after if you want to build something 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.599
 in the Nordic Scandinavian atmosphere or 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.510
 where the atmosphere of the Alps 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.390
 it can not be bad but it's not 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.650
 according to me the 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.340
 that I recommend for you 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.780
 to install sees climate needed climate 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.700
 is cold but that on minecraft you 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.510
 do not feel but it's not hyper 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.460
 pleasant 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.050
 I do not know, I do not think it's hyper 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.870
 nice to walk around all the time 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:42.140
 in something like that here so 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.210
 the unique interest for me is for 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.980
 find wolves after you can 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.380
 also pick up soccer sprint like that 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:53.300
 but it's not because I knew 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.500
 al more personally but yeah 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.710
 this as you say it interests 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.000
 it's for wolves there is not much 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.960
 interest to go into this premium 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.330
 in my opinion but good after more some 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.520
 of you find it perfect for 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.310
 to settle but it's not my case so 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.260
 here is this biome analysis will be more 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.570
 short because the biome does not have 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.350
 a lot of specificities or to choose 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.880
 to note so here it will be all for this 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.690
 little episode I still hope he 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.700
 you will have liked 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.460
 if you liked it do not hesitate to leave 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.020
 a little secular and a commentary if 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.780
 you have something to add or to 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.320
 say and on this month I will tell you to 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.540
 the next 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.540
 go hi to all and and ipad hugo
