00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 I am here for david simon fruit farmer 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.250
 also burned in the street 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:27.240
 affected how bad is it with them 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 very bad is discussed a lot about 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.970
 this medium streptomycin would have them 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.970
 that helped 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.680
 That was the next two years 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 what kind of damage do you have to fear? 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 everything does not work on their cultures yet 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 predict how many trees have they 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.660
 and how many customers would be affected in the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.550
 worst case about 6000 trees but 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.789
 in the plant and in the worst case 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.670
 could be between 800 and 1000 trees 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.619
 be affected 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.180
 they wanted to invest some in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 next year and have this 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:16.280
 they can think about it because they think so 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.009
 I have now filed everything but files 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.120
 where to see how it goes on 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:28.040
 they excuse several 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.300
 we are here on the estate of viruses 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 Thüringer hin highest as hardwich who 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.790
 she has met the association 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.590
 It is difficult to say that you know 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.750
 not just as a matter the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.259
 advanced 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.910
 they have very strong orders so you 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.619
 do not know how much you have to red 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.450
 two with two ponds are 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.330
 to clear one hundred percent and have them 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.950
 then usually only in two weeks 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 once again developed with the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.119
 promote 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 how could it look like if it were completely 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.110
 bad comes that knows I can 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.330
 Do not give any information I want it that way 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.720
 I'm not shocked by that 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 can give information 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.260
 see it as fate or as a whole 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.330
 as something that could have been avoided 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.900
 and you avoid 100 percent 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.610
 can 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.790
 the investigators close in Germany 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.560
 is injected says take leave at 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.900
 we are opponents where easy 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:36.950
 push in between 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.690
 deliver them to trade very much like 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.790
 this will continue in the next 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.200
 years for her if at all 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.459
 I can not go on how can I go on 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.079
 I say that directly from one 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 race platforms I do not know how it works 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.070
 diploma engineer ulrich continues 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.959
 this top box values ​​at the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.280
 Chamber of Agriculture how bad has 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.860
 the body the local fruit farmers 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.269
 So some options caught that 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.459
 although the last fire has been burning for years 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.110
 have experienced that it is that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.450
 Worst year since occur in 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.519
 Vorarlberg so I once 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.470
 at least three hectares from us at about 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.220
 30 hectares of pomaceous fruit surface so the very 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.450
 that is also badly affected 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.269
 I endanger myself at risk 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.860
 now with clipping measures too 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.329
 save what is to be saved so you will 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.549
 in the next three weeks 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.290
 then probably see if it's something 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.269
 where has brought the whole thing 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.100
 extent of the infections and visible to me 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.080
 was 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.870
 late blooms symptom and they bloom 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.220
 that the symptoms bloom late 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.930
 come now only in those days or 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.610
 the beginning of next week and 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.430
 there will see if it synonymous with those 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.500
 also give infections or not 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.180
 you see solutions that you can 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.770
 at some point the body to her 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.410
 can 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.810
 yes, you know that there are agents that 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.370
 work relatively well 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.680
 of course that includes the whole 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.930
 so the field after the fruit like 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.700
 before knowing is done to 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.780
 monitor the infection 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.850
 eliminate and the like more 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.460
 So what else am I currently unfortunately 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.530
 Also not known how high or how 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.300
 Low value the opportunities 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.480
 that sometime in the next few years 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.140
 in an alternative medium is developed 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.630
 as an alternative to the controversial 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.340
 Streptomycin There are some agents that 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.410
 they have also been developed in the laboratory 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.270
 have worked relatively well but we have 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.650
 easy in our busy 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.260
 area realizes that so this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.990
 efficiencies because far too little 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.780
 sense of in alternative means the speech 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.490
 from the emptying pond and a yeast preparation 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.680
 and you consider these experiments as complete 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.510
 View failed 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.730
 yes at the yeast this morning had the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.440
 developer dogs of representatives of the 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.780
 manufacturer company there so were the goods too 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.720
 affected there despite four times help 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.310
 spraying 50 50 to 70 percent of 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.960
 flowers still vision of a tree 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.610
 stricken we are now, of course, 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.080
 trying to think where could that be 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.360
 there are possible 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.050
 sources of error or so was there but me 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.240
 So I think right now is the topic 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.030
 maxed out with our strong attack 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.740
 There was always pressure there 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.380
 alternatively mediterranean have that very much 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.280
 Many tests made with ball is ol with 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.440
 nanosilver and vital citrus extract 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.150
 and so on and so on 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.830
 but unfortunately you can not reach them 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.000
 effect me in our area 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.750
 would need 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.750
 Many Thanks
