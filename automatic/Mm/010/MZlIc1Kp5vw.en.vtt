00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
while I started off at Penn State I was

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.519 
while I started off at Penn State I was
in<00:00:15.719> ROTC<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:17.390> then<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.420> graduated<00:00:18.930> went<00:00:19.199> pilot

the Air Force which is Learjets and then
my<00:00:24.930> next<00:00:25.140> assignment<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.560> c5<00:00:25.890> so<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:27.000> how

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
my next assignment was c5 so that's how

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.490 
my next assignment was c5 so that's how
I<00:00:27.150> originally<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.930> aviation

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I originally got in aviation

my<00:00:28.949> dad<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.310> interested<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.849> flying<00:00:30.029> he

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
my dad was very interested in flying he

my dad was very interested in flying he
was<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> private<00:00:30.720> pilot<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:32.189> know

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
was a private pilot which you know

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.120 
was a private pilot which you know
piqued<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.610> interest<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.950> that's<00:00:34.950> what

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
piqued my interest in it and that's what

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.940 
piqued my interest in it and that's what
got<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> go<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> Penn<00:00:37.710> State

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
got me to go about going to Penn State

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.740 
got me to go about going to Penn State
in<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> Air<00:00:38.219> Force<00:00:38.460> ROTC<00:00:38.640> program<00:00:39.480> so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
in the Air Force ROTC program so

in the Air Force ROTC program so
probably<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.410> father<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:40.890> inspiration<00:00:41.399> to

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
probably my father was my inspiration to

the c-5m which is an outstanding
opportunity<00:01:01.070> my<00:01:02.070> most<00:01:02.280> challenging

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
opportunity my most challenging

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.070 
opportunity my most challenging
experience<00:01:03.180> was<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.420> first<00:01:03.600> time<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> flew

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
experience was the first time I flew

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.640 
experience was the first time I flew
into<00:01:04.229> Iraq<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.860> 2003<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:06.390> was<00:01:06.570> right<00:01:07.380> after<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
into Iraq in 2003 it was right after the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.120 
into Iraq in 2003 it was right after the
end<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.040> major<00:01:08.430> combat<00:01:08.760> hostilities<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
end of major combat hostilities and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.920 
end of major combat hostilities and
going<00:01:11.130> into<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> hot<00:01:11.580> zone<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> c5<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.780> was

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
going into a hot zone and a c5 it was

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.330 
going into a hot zone and a c5 it was
extremely<00:01:13.380> challenging<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> first<00:01:14.159> time

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
extremely challenging for the first time

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730 
extremely challenging for the first time
basically<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.540> used<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> transport<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.439> cargo

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
basically we used to transport any cargo

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.920 
basically we used to transport any cargo
around<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> world<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:18.330> transporting<00:01:18.840> from

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
around the world we transporting from

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.249 
around the world we transporting from
helicopters<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.950> Humvees<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.700> M<00:01:21.150> wraps<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
helicopters to Humvees to M wraps to

helicopters to Humvees to M wraps to
basic<00:01:22.680> supplies<00:01:22.979> mostly<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> States

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
basic supplies mostly from the States

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.320 
basic supplies mostly from the States
these<00:01:25.170> days<00:01:25.229> downrange<00:01:25.890> into<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.400> Iraq<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
these days downrange into the Iraq and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.690 
these days downrange into the Iraq and
Afghanistan<00:01:28.049> AORs<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> basically<00:01:29.549> we're

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
Afghanistan AORs and basically we're

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
Afghanistan AORs and basically we're
there<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> support<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> troops<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.020> field

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
there to support the troops in the field

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560 
there to support the troops in the field
to<00:01:31.710> get<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:32.549> need<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> very

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to get them what they need in a very

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
to get them what they need in a very
timely<00:01:33.689> manner<00:01:34.049> has<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> very<00:01:35.220> large<00:01:35.340> wing

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
timely manner has a very large wing

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.280 
timely manner has a very large wing
surface<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.240> allows<00:01:36.479> us<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.750> takeoff<00:01:37.079> at

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
surface which allows us to takeoff at

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.600 
surface which allows us to takeoff at
slower<00:01:37.560> air<00:01:37.799> speeds<00:01:38.070> with<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.460> heavy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
slower air speeds with very heavy

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
slower air speeds with very heavy
weights<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> swept<00:01:40.500> wing

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
weights and then it has a swept wing

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.039 
weights and then it has a swept wing
which<00:01:41.009> allows<00:01:41.250> us<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> speed<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.540> our<00:01:42.720> max

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
which allows us to speed up our max

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.899 
which allows us to speed up our max
speed<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.350> 8<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.770> Mach<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.280> cruise<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.700> about

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
speed is 8 to Mach we cruise at about

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.080 
speed is 8 to Mach we cruise at about
0.77<00:01:45.869> mop<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.740> 77%<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.759> speed<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.060> sound

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
0.77 mop which is 77% the speed of sound

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
0.77 mop which is 77% the speed of sound
up<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:49.020> altitude<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.100> discussed

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
up at altitude and then we discussed

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.280 
up at altitude and then we discussed
earlier<00:01:50.759> air<00:01:51.119> refueling<00:01:51.630> which<00:01:51.899> will<00:01:52.049> even

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
earlier air refueling which will even

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.219 
earlier air refueling which will even
take<00:01:52.409> us<00:01:52.590> farther<00:01:52.829> past<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.780> 5650<00:01:54.780> 800<00:01:55.079> mile

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
take us farther past that 5650 800 mile

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.010

aircrew<00:03:39.680> is<00:03:39.920> because<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.580> more<00:03:40.730> thrust<00:03:40.940> we

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
aircrew is because of the more thrust we

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.150 
aircrew is because of the more thrust we
can<00:03:41.239> take<00:03:41.420> off<00:03:41.540> with<00:03:41.720> more<00:03:41.959> weight<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.830> farther

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
can take off with more weight go farther

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.910 
can take off with more weight go farther
distances<00:03:43.760> with<00:03:44.030> more<00:03:44.269> fuel<00:03:44.540> and<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.769> end

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
distances with more fuel and in the end

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.979 
distances with more fuel and in the end
that<00:03:46.160> allows<00:03:46.370> us<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.580> over<00:03:46.940> fly<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.570> root

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
that allows us to over fly and root

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.720 
that allows us to over fly and root
locations<00:03:48.590> where<00:03:48.739> we<00:03:48.769> normally<00:03:48.950> stop<00:03:49.430> for<00:03:49.610> gas

bypass engine

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.820 
bypass engine
was<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:12.879> huge<00:04:13.090> leap<00:04:13.330> in<00:04:13.450> technology<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:14.319> the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
was a huge leap in technology and the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.319 
was a huge leap in technology and the
ironic<00:04:15.069> thing<00:04:15.310> in<00:04:15.400> our<00:04:15.459> research<00:04:15.790> was<00:04:16.120> we

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
ironic thing in our research was we

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.939 
ironic thing in our research was we
found<00:04:16.540> that<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:16.840> was<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.139> quiet<00:04:17.470> engine<00:04:17.709> at

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
found that that was a quiet engine at

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.800 
found that that was a quiet engine at
the<00:04:18.040> time<00:04:18.250> and<00:04:18.579> just<00:04:19.299> watching<00:04:19.720> how

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
the time and just watching how

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.719 
the time and just watching how
technology<00:04:20.440> and<00:04:20.470> now<00:04:20.650> we're<00:04:20.829> getting<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.190> to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
technology and now we're getting it to

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.340 
technology and now we're getting it to
this<00:04:21.880> aircraft<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.600> capabilities<00:04:23.169> it's

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
this aircraft and the capabilities it's

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.500 
this aircraft and the capabilities it's
giving<00:04:23.620> us<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.490> serve<00:04:24.669> the<00:04:24.850> warfighter<00:04:25.030> is

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
giving us to to serve the warfighter is

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.020 
giving us to to serve the warfighter is
incredible<00:04:26.050> as<00:04:26.979> you<00:04:27.160> can<00:04:27.280> see<00:04:27.430> behind<00:04:27.580> us<00:04:27.850> we

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
incredible as you can see behind us we

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.210 
incredible as you can see behind us we
have<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.240> avionics<00:04:28.960> modernization<00:04:29.320> program

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
have the avionics modernization program

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.010 
have the avionics modernization program
it's<00:04:30.550> basically<00:04:30.970> upgrading<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.510> from<00:04:31.780> an

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
it's basically upgrading it from an

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.010 
it's basically upgrading it from an
analog<00:04:32.530> system<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> digital<00:04:33.400> system

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
analog system to a digital system

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.120 
analog system to a digital system
compare<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.169> having<00:04:35.320> a<00:04:35.440> map<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.800> your<00:04:35.919> car

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
compare it to having a map in your car

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.950 
compare it to having a map in your car
and<00:04:36.340> looking<00:04:37.060> down<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.389> seeing<00:04:37.600> where<00:04:37.840> you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
and looking down and seeing where you

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.150 
and looking down and seeing where you
are<00:04:38.110> okay<00:04:38.320> I'm<00:04:38.440> here<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.710> this<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.919> where<00:04:39.039> I'm

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
are okay I'm here and this is where I'm

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.029 
are okay I'm here and this is where I'm
going<00:04:39.520> now<00:04:40.510> we<00:04:40.570> can<00:04:40.840> look<00:04:40.960> at<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.199> navigation

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
going now we can look at the navigation

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.100 
going now we can look at the navigation
display<00:04:42.400> right<00:04:42.580> there<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.090> now<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.570> can<00:04:43.930> see

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
display right there and now you can see

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.900 
display right there and now you can see
just<00:04:44.350> like<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.620> GPS<00:04:44.889> in<00:04:45.160> your<00:04:45.190> car<00:04:45.310> where<00:04:45.880> you

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
just like the GPS in your car where you

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.189 
just like the GPS in your car where you
are<00:04:46.210> where<00:04:46.419> you're<00:04:46.510> going<00:04:46.780> and<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:46.990> gives<00:04:47.139> you

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
are where you're going and it gives you

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.870 
are where you're going and it gives you
directions<00:04:47.500> on<00:04:47.740> how<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.919> get<00:04:48.130> there<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.580> we

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
directions on how to get there and we

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.060 
directions on how to get there and we
can<00:04:49.000> hook<00:04:49.120> up<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.330> autopilot<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:50.080> that<00:04:50.860> and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
can hook up the autopilot to that and

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.840 
can hook up the autopilot to that and
that's<00:04:51.220> a<00:04:51.310> big<00:04:51.490> help

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
that's a big help

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.310 
that's a big help
especially<00:04:52.300> in<00:04:52.389> a<00:04:52.419> combat<00:04:52.750> environment<00:04:52.810> we're

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
especially in a combat environment we're

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.510 
especially in a combat environment we're
doing<00:04:53.440> combat<00:04:53.710> approaches<00:04:54.130> when<00:04:54.220> things<00:04:54.370> are

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
doing combat approaches when things are

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.490 
doing combat approaches when things are
very<00:04:54.610> busy<00:04:54.880> having<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.630> top-down<00:04:56.110> view<00:04:56.350> of

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
very busy having that top-down view of

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.689 
very busy having that top-down view of
where<00:04:56.650> we<00:04:56.800> are<00:04:56.979> it<00:04:57.070> gives<00:04:57.160> us<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.430> lot<00:04:57.580> of

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
where we are it gives us a lot of

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.550 
where we are it gives us a lot of
situational<00:04:58.330> awareness<00:04:58.449> on<00:04:59.199> where<00:04:59.440> we<00:04:59.530> are

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
situational awareness on where we are

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.469 
situational awareness on where we are
and<00:04:59.800> where<00:04:59.919> we're<00:05:00.070> going<00:05:00.100> and<00:05:00.460> is<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.639> big<00:05:01.300> aid

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
and where we're going and is a big aid

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.629 
and where we're going and is a big aid
to<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.810> crew<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.620> allows<00:05:02.919> us<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.250> fly<00:05:03.430> into

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
to the crew it allows us to fly into

mission<00:06:48.870> because<00:06:49.170> we<00:06:49.200> as<00:06:49.680> we<00:06:49.860> talked<00:06:50.040> about

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
mission because we as we talked about

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.310 
mission because we as we talked about
before<00:06:50.220> it<00:06:50.520> carries<00:06:50.850> just<00:06:51.120> huge<00:06:51.900> amounts<00:06:52.230> of

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
before it carries just huge amounts of

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.980 
before it carries just huge amounts of
cargo<00:06:52.560> what<00:06:53.310> it<00:06:53.430> does<00:06:53.640> change<00:06:53.970> is<00:06:54.240> the<00:06:54.510> time<00:06:54.810> it

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:54.990 
cargo what it does change is the time it

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.750 
cargo what it does change is the time it
takes<00:06:55.020> to<00:06:55.380> get<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.680> equipment<00:06:55.950> downrange

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760 
takes to get the equipment downrange

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.010 
takes to get the equipment downrange
because<00:06:57.150> we<00:06:57.240> can<00:06:57.360> cut<00:06:57.480> out<00:06:57.570> those<00:06:57.690> n<00:06:57.840> route

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
because we can cut out those n route

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.750 
because we can cut out those n route
stops<00:06:58.260> which<00:06:58.860> allows<00:06:59.130> the<00:06:59.250> airplane<00:06:59.550> to<00:06:59.640> come

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
stops which allows the airplane to come

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.000 
stops which allows the airplane to come
back<00:06:59.940> faster<00:07:00.390> load<00:07:00.630> up<00:07:00.810> more<00:07:01.080> cargo<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:01.860> get

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
back faster load up more cargo and get

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.110 
back faster load up more cargo and get
it<00:07:02.100> back<00:07:02.190> out<00:07:02.340> on<00:07:02.460> the<00:07:02.490> road<00:07:02.640> again<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.030> you

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
it back out on the road again so you

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.820 
it back out on the road again so you
almost<00:07:03.270> increase<00:07:03.720> the<00:07:03.870> virtual<00:07:04.260> size<00:07:04.530> of<00:07:04.710> your

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
almost increase the virtual size of your

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.410 
almost increase the virtual size of your
fleet<00:07:05.010> because<00:07:05.340> you<00:07:05.430> can<00:07:05.580> turn<00:07:05.730> it<00:07:05.910> faster

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
fleet because you can turn it faster

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.070 
fleet because you can turn it faster
this<00:07:07.170> modification<00:07:07.770> will<00:07:08.250> pay<00:07:08.400> for<00:07:08.460> itself

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
this modification will pay for itself

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.870 
this modification will pay for itself
approximately<00:07:10.080> twice<00:07:10.260> over<00:07:10.710> in<00:07:11.310> fuel<00:07:11.670> savings

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
approximately twice over in fuel savings

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.200 
approximately twice over in fuel savings
and<00:07:12.210> maintenance<00:07:12.390> savings<00:07:12.870> costs
