00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.029
 after being well-placed as a villa and paralyzed those users with 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.920
 balcony with balcony 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.350
 I remember that they want to synchronize 18 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.550
 and used in some to catalog their videos and series as we have explained 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.970
 for some other occasion 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.869
 they will have told me that sometime 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.869
 8 accounts 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 can play the videos as we are seeing 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 through height without problems 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.290
 when we take this video and we want to synchronize it with our high 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040
 we meet 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.400
 what of vido 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.250
 to the size format that they have that video can not m sync with 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.250
 our 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 thanks there all 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.730
 if we select they would ask we do against what he says 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.940
 and it does not come out 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.980
 the drop down menu according to all the options 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.570
 As you can see there is no option 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.869
 to allow conversion 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.090
 if we change 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 in sight 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.130
 by items 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.110
 agreement 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.810
 the classic 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.640
 if we can make another click on that file we will see that it appears 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.560
 good options 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.990
 create alcor pressure or iphone another version of the atleti 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.670
 yes i something that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 in creating version of the popular iphone 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.860
 what I'm going to do is eat dinner 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.070
 that file 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.810
 here we are converting it to an agreement as you can see 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.230
 same as when 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.820
 We perform 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.180
 the conversion of an audio cd 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.680
 aa artist 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.840
 for him all 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.670
 here we will see the time 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.820
 that will take 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.149
 the progress bar 

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.149
 and immediately we are frightened to movies 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.269
 a new punishment 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.429
 asked for agreement 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:22.219
 that will be compatible 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.839
 with our to the well in this case and with which we are going to be able to synchronize without 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:29.319
 problems 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.919
 As you can see directly from heights we can make the conversions 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:40.249
 many times we can find that depending on the list to see if this 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.420
 is solved 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.040
 in future versions that he achieves by selecting our view I follow 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.879
 we found that we do not have the option 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.489
 Of conversation 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.789
 you can 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.350
 another the list 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.410
 will allow us to update that conversion directly from there 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.010
 everyone 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.890
 and after a few minutes 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.870
 we will find a file fully compatible with our boat 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.649
 don bosco acz 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.929
 then that's all we'll see in a next bilic
