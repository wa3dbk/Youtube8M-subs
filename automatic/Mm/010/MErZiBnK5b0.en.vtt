Oh

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:06.860 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.820 

hey<00:00:07.580> welcome<00:00:07.819> to<00:00:07.940> ID<00:00:08.210> creatures<00:00:08.750> so<00:00:09.139> today<00:00:09.590> we

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
hey welcome to ID creatures so today we

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.400 
hey welcome to ID creatures so today we
are<00:00:09.980> going<00:00:10.309> to<00:00:10.460> talk<00:00:10.879> about<00:00:11.260> proportions<00:00:12.260> in

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
are going to talk about proportions in

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.100 
are going to talk about proportions in
perspective<00:00:13.450> so<00:00:14.450> what<00:00:14.629> you<00:00:14.719> see<00:00:14.929> right<00:00:14.960> here

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
perspective so what you see right here

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.390 
perspective so what you see right here
is<00:00:16.210> this<00:00:17.410> rectangular<00:00:18.410> shape<00:00:18.800> that's<00:00:19.130> being

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
is this rectangular shape that's being

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.780 
is this rectangular shape that's being
repeated<00:00:20.000> right<00:00:20.570> next<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.960> each<00:00:21.050> other<00:00:21.200> and

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
repeated right next to each other and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.910 
repeated right next to each other and
sometimes<00:00:22.790> you<00:00:23.000> just<00:00:23.300> sort<00:00:23.869> of<00:00:23.990> imagine<00:00:24.650> where

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
sometimes you just sort of imagine where

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.279 
sometimes you just sort of imagine where
the<00:00:25.189> middle<00:00:25.460> place<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.840> know<00:00:26.869> an<00:00:27.109> object

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
the middle place of you know an object

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.200 
the middle place of you know an object
is<00:00:27.650> but<00:00:28.160> I'm<00:00:28.250> going<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:28.430> show<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:29.000> correct

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
is but I'm going to show you the correct

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.420 
is but I'm going to show you the correct
way<00:00:29.390> of<00:00:29.510> figuring<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:30.109> out<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:30.680> once<00:00:31.340> you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
way of figuring this out and once you

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.799 
way of figuring this out and once you
have<00:00:31.550> enough<00:00:31.699> practice<00:00:32.210> then<00:00:32.330> you<00:00:32.449> won't<00:00:32.660> need

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
have enough practice then you won't need

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.270 
have enough practice then you won't need
to<00:00:32.989> make<00:00:33.140> all<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.500> lines<00:00:33.710> here<00:00:33.949> I<00:00:33.980> don't<00:00:34.160> know

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
to make all the lines here I don't know

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.670 
to make all the lines here I don't know
if<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:34.430> can<00:00:34.550> tell<00:00:34.760> how<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.360> did<00:00:35.900> some<00:00:36.140> lines

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
if you can tell how I did some lines

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.770 
if you can tell how I did some lines
here<00:00:36.949> that<00:00:37.100> are<00:00:37.340> red<00:00:37.519> and<00:00:37.550> that's<00:00:38.239> what<00:00:38.449> tells

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
here that are red and that's what tells

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.899 
here that are red and that's what tells
me<00:00:38.960> where<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.350> draw<00:00:39.559> but<00:00:40.129> after<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> while<00:00:40.610> you

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:40.909 
me where to draw but after a while you

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.130 
me where to draw but after a while you
won't<00:00:41.000> really<00:00:41.210> need<00:00:41.449> to<00:00:41.570> do<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.809> and<00:00:41.989> you're

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
won't really need to do that and you're

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.829 
won't really need to do that and you're
just<00:00:42.320> gonna<00:00:42.500> like<00:00:42.769> estimate<00:00:43.489> where<00:00:43.940> estimate

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
just gonna like estimate where estimate

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.789 
just gonna like estimate where estimate
where<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:47.089> know<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:47.330> next<00:00:47.799> object

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:48.799 
where the you know the next object

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.590 
where the you know the next object
should<00:00:48.979> be<00:00:49.040> so<00:00:49.640> let's<00:00:50.360> start<00:00:51.049> with<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:52.600> um

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
should be so let's start with this um

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.869 
should be so let's start with this um
okay<00:00:54.320> what<00:00:54.589> I'm<00:00:54.710> gonna<00:00:54.799> do<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.190> I'm<00:00:55.400> going<00:00:55.760> to

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
okay what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.060 
okay what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
make<00:00:56.739> one<00:00:57.739> line<00:00:57.949> go<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.369> direction<00:00:58.519> and

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
make one line go in that direction and

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.729 
make one line go in that direction and
another<00:01:01.070> line<00:01:01.430> go<00:01:02.089> the<00:01:02.839> same<00:01:03.049> direction<00:01:03.290> okay

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
another line go the same direction okay

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.410 
another line go the same direction okay
so<00:01:04.129> that's<00:01:04.280> going<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.580> one<00:01:04.729> vanishing<00:01:04.970> point

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
so that's going to one vanishing point

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.690 
so that's going to one vanishing point
which<00:01:05.780> normally<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.320> call<00:01:06.799> it<00:01:06.920> vanishing<00:01:07.520> point

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
which normally I call it vanishing point

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.670 
which normally I call it vanishing point
number<00:01:07.880> two<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.299> then<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.590> have<00:01:10.360> another<00:01:11.680> two

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
number two and then you have another two

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.010 
number two and then you have another two
lines<00:01:12.920> here<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.850> are<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.300> vanishing

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
lines here that are going to vanishing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.590 
lines here that are going to vanishing
point<00:01:15.350> number<00:01:15.950> one<00:01:16.100> again<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.090> don't<00:01:17.300> have<00:01:17.480> to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
point number one again you don't have to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.040 
point number one again you don't have to
call<00:01:17.750> them<00:01:17.930> that<00:01:18.050> but<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.160> way<00:01:19.280> I<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:20.050> call

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
call them that but it's the way I I call

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.840 
call them that but it's the way I I call
them<00:01:21.200> so<00:01:21.380> okay<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.010> that's<00:01:22.280> Spanish<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.730> for

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
them so okay and that's Spanish in for

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.460 
them so okay and that's Spanish in for
number<00:01:23.060> three<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.600> I'm<00:01:23.690> going<00:01:23.810> to<00:01:23.870> use<00:01:23.990> three

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
number three so I'm going to use three

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.510 
number three so I'm going to use three
point<00:01:24.860> perspective<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.120> example<00:01:27.520> this

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
point perspective for this example this

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.080 
point perspective for this example this
line<00:01:28.810> is<00:01:29.810> also<00:01:30.530> going<00:01:31.010> eventually<00:01:31.910> to

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
line is also going eventually to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.710 
line is also going eventually to
vanishing<00:01:32.570> point<00:01:32.750> number<00:01:32.900> three<00:01:33.790> okay<00:01:34.790> this

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
vanishing point number three okay this

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.470 
vanishing point number three okay this
line<00:01:35.870> also<00:01:36.050> so<00:01:36.770> what<00:01:37.610> I'm<00:01:37.700> going<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.210> I'm

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
line also so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.970 
line also so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.720> close<00:01:39.350> off<00:01:39.680> this<00:01:40.990> this<00:01:41.990> side<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.440> the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
going to close off this this side of the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.110 
going to close off this this side of the
of<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.150> shape<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:44.659> I<00:01:45.290> can<00:01:45.650> close<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.880> way

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
of this shape so I can close it this way

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.760 
of this shape so I can close it this way
and<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.140> bring<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:49.040> line<00:01:49.280> over<00:01:49.550> there<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
and then bring this line over there and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.490 
and then bring this line over there and
this<00:01:52.700> line<00:01:52.940> whoops<00:01:53.750> okay<00:01:54.820> over<00:01:55.820> here

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
this line whoops okay over here

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
this line whoops okay over here
so<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.530> have<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.190> basic<00:01:59.640> shape<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.330> going

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so I have my basic shape that I'm going

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.390 
so I have my basic shape that I'm going
to<00:02:00.510> be<00:02:00.600> repeating<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.650> direction<00:02:01.890> over

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
to be repeating that direction over

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.670 
to be repeating that direction over
there<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:03.330> just<00:02:03.450> gonna<00:02:03.570> close<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> off<00:02:04.350> here

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
there I'm just gonna close it off here

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.850 
there I'm just gonna close it off here
okay<00:02:05.750> so<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.590> I'm

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.580 
okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.130> bring<00:02:08.580> another<00:02:08.789> color<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:10.500> am

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to bring another color and I am

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.750 
going to bring another color and I am
going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.009> make<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.430> lines<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.800> go<00:02:13.800> from<00:02:14.069> one

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
going to make two lines that go from one

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790 
going to make two lines that go from one
corner<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> opposite<00:02:15.900> one<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.560> one

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
corner to the opposite one and this one

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.830 
corner to the opposite one and this one
to<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.569> give<00:02:18.810> me

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
to this one and that's going to give me

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.770 
to this one and that's going to give me
one<00:02:19.260> point<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:20.150> that's<00:02:21.150> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.480> be<00:02:21.600> really

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
one point here that's going to be really

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.809 
one point here that's going to be really
helpful<00:02:22.020> because<00:02:22.380> that<00:02:22.680> finds<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.370> middle<00:02:23.700> of

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
helpful because that finds the middle of

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.690 
helpful because that finds the middle of
your<00:02:24.390> surface<00:02:24.840> okay<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.160> point<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.550> the

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
your surface okay so that point is the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.840 
your surface okay so that point is the
middle<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.090> this<00:02:28.340> box<00:02:29.340> right<00:02:29.580> here

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
middle of this box right here

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.280 
middle of this box right here
we're<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.090> box<00:02:30.330> with<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.630> square<00:02:30.930> in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
we're not box with this square in

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.259 
we're not box with this square in
perspective<00:02:31.440> okay<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.910> way<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.060> find

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
perspective okay that's the way to find

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.000 
perspective okay that's the way to find
the<00:02:33.330> middle<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.260> we're<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.620> use<00:02:34.800> this<00:02:34.980> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
the middle and we're going to use this a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.979 
the middle and we're going to use this a
bit<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.580> we<00:02:35.730> talk<00:02:35.910> about<00:02:35.940> ellipses<00:02:36.570> but

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
bit more when we talk about ellipses but

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.130 
bit more when we talk about ellipses but
okay<00:02:37.410> anyway<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:39.480> going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.720> make<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> line

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
okay anyway I'm going to make a line

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.850 
okay anyway I'm going to make a line
that<00:02:41.100> goes<00:02:41.420> through<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.780> point<00:02:42.930> two

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that goes through this point two

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.090 
that goes through this point two
vanishing<00:02:44.340> point<00:02:44.730> number<00:02:44.940> two<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:46.200> also

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
vanishing point number two and also

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.740 
vanishing point number two and also
vanishing<00:02:47.430> point<00:02:47.670> number<00:02:48.120> one<00:02:48.269> since<00:02:48.510> we're

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
vanishing point number one since we're

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.410 
vanishing point number one since we're
here<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.550> helps<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> find<00:02:51.300> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
here because this helps you find the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.780 
here because this helps you find the
middle<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.810> your<00:02:51.930> box<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.950> sometimes<00:02:53.130> you

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
middle of your box and sometimes you

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.880 
middle of your box and sometimes you
don't<00:02:53.880> need<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.810> know<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.290> nice<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
don't need it but you know it's nice to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.850 
don't need it but you know it's nice to
know<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.010> you<00:02:56.670> can<00:02:56.819> just<00:02:57.090> if<00:02:57.450> you're<00:02:57.860> let's

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
know that you can just if you're let's

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.140 
know that you can just if you're let's
say<00:02:59.010> you're<00:02:59.130> putting<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.519> button<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.030> you

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
say you're putting a button here and you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.910 
say you're putting a button here and you
want<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.360> draw<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.690> right<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.049> middle<00:03:01.230> this

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
want to draw it right in the middle this

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.470 
want to draw it right in the middle this
line<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.430> know<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.640> bring<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.910> up<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.299> now

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
line you know you bring it up and now

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.729 
line you know you bring it up and now
you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.750> where<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.079> middle<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.590> it's

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
you know where the middle is so it's

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.640 
you know where the middle is so it's
easier<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.549> do<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.060> do<00:03:06.180> things<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.630> way<00:03:06.780> so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
easier to do it to do things that way so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
easier to do it to do things that way so
another<00:03:08.400> thing<00:03:08.820> another<00:03:09.060> point<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.510> it's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
another thing another point that it's

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.830 
another thing another point that it's
important<00:03:10.200> is<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.560> one<00:03:10.709> right<00:03:10.860> here<00:03:10.920> where

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
important is this one right here where

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.080 
important is this one right here where
this<00:03:12.840> line<00:03:13.200> and<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.160> line<00:03:14.310> that's<00:03:14.579> going<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
this line and the line that's going to

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.180 
this line and the line that's going to
the<00:03:15.180> vanishing<00:03:15.480> point<00:03:15.630> number<00:03:15.989> two<00:03:16.230> where

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the vanishing point number two where

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.610 
the vanishing point number two where
they<00:03:17.310> both<00:03:17.430> meet<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.540> after<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.320> this

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
they both meet so after you have this

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.350 
they both meet so after you have this
point<00:03:19.890> you're<00:03:20.100> gonna<00:03:20.250> bring<00:03:20.760> you're<00:03:21.180> going<00:03:21.299> to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
point you're gonna bring you're going to

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.090 
point you're gonna bring you're going to
take<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> line<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:22.019> draw<00:03:22.200> line<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.680> goes<00:03:22.799> from

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
take a line or draw line that goes from

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.270 
take a line or draw line that goes from
this<00:03:23.280> corner<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:25.500> line<00:03:25.739> right<00:03:25.950> there<00:03:26.010> I

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
this corner to that line right there I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.420 
this corner to that line right there I
mean<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.519> that<00:03:26.609> point<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.190> another

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
mean to that point so this is another

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.830 
mean to that point so this is another
line<00:03:29.700> that's<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.299> be<00:03:30.420> really<00:03:30.600> helpful

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
line that's going to be really helpful

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.160 
line that's going to be really helpful
because<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.500> finds<00:03:31.950> our<00:03:32.359> last<00:03:33.359> important

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
because that finds our last important

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.710 
because that finds our last important
dot<00:03:34.829> there<00:03:35.100> on<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.400> sketch<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.299> what<00:03:36.450> we<00:03:36.540> want

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
dot there on this sketch so what we want

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.069 
dot there on this sketch so what we want
to<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:36.930> now<00:03:37.109> is<00:03:37.320> we<00:03:37.890> want<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.600> go<00:03:39.600> make<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.810> line

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
to do now is we want to go make a line

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.819 
to do now is we want to go make a line
go<00:03:40.260> through<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:41.239> through<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.709> dot<00:03:43.709> right

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
go through that through that dot right

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.849 
go through that through that dot right
there<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.329> going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.720> mark<00:03:45.930> our<00:03:46.170> next

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
there and that is going to mark our next

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.380 
there and that is going to mark our next
little<00:03:47.549> box<00:03:48.390> here<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.260> we're<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.620> do

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
little box here so we're going to do

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.670 
little box here so we're going to do
we're<00:03:51.390> going<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.600> do<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.959> line<00:03:52.170> that's<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.590> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
we're going to do a line that's going to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.550 
we're going to do a line that's going to
a<00:03:52.769> third<00:03:53.150> vanishing<00:03:54.150> point<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.540> now<00:03:55.200> we<00:03:55.260> have

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
a third vanishing point and now we have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.560 
a third vanishing point and now we have
our<00:03:56.190> next<00:03:57.380> our<00:03:58.380> next<00:03:58.910> repeated<00:03:59.910> object<00:04:00.359> here

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
our next our next repeated object here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.589 
our next our next repeated object here
so<00:04:01.140> let's<00:04:01.799> do<00:04:02.070> another<00:04:03.290> line<00:04:04.290> right<00:04:04.739> here

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
so let's do another line right here

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.920 
so let's do another line right here
and<00:04:06.230> you<00:04:06.769> can<00:04:06.890> see<00:04:07.069> how<00:04:07.310> we<00:04:07.370> have<00:04:07.579> two<00:04:08.540> boxes

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
and you can see how we have two boxes

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.720 
and you can see how we have two boxes
now<00:04:09.079> what<00:04:09.590> I'm<00:04:09.680> gonna<00:04:09.769> do<00:04:09.950> someone<00:04:10.189> to<00:04:10.249> take<00:04:10.430> a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
now what I'm gonna do someone to take a

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.300 
now what I'm gonna do someone to take a
sharpie<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.540> make<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:12.170> clear<00:04:15.130> I'm<00:04:16.130> gonna

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
sharpie to make this clear I'm gonna

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.469 
sharpie to make this clear I'm gonna
make<00:04:16.639> it<00:04:16.789> a<00:04:16.880> little<00:04:17.060> bit<00:04:17.239> round<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:19.729> where

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
make it a little bit round just so where

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.390 
make it a little bit round just so where
they're<00:04:20.900> divided<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.739> see<00:04:22.160> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
they're divided you can see the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.100 
they're divided you can see the
difference<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.330> I'm<00:04:23.449> gonna<00:04:23.570> do<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.810> tutorial

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
difference but I'm gonna do a tutorial

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.370 
difference but I'm gonna do a tutorial
on<00:04:24.759> round<00:04:25.759> edges<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.660> don't<00:04:26.930> worry<00:04:27.080> if<00:04:27.229> you

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
on round edges so don't worry if you

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.469 
on round edges so don't worry if you
don't<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.680> what<00:04:27.860> I'm<00:04:27.979> doing<00:04:28.849> right<00:04:29.060> now<00:04:29.120> it's

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
don't know what I'm doing right now it's

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.909 
don't know what I'm doing right now it's
just<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.840> arbitrary<00:04:30.530> round<00:04:32.320> not<00:04:33.320> calculator

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
just like arbitrary round not calculator

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.969 
just like arbitrary round not calculator
or<00:04:34.130> anything<00:04:37.090> but<00:04:38.090> here<00:04:38.810> it's<00:04:38.930> really<00:04:39.080> nice<00:04:39.710> to

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
or anything but here it's really nice to

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.420 
or anything but here it's really nice to
get<00:04:40.070> that<00:04:40.130> little<00:04:41.349> change<00:04:42.349> on<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.039> surface

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
get that little change on the surface

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.870 
get that little change on the surface
there<00:04:43.750> no<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:46.160> explain<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:46.639> a<00:04:46.699> little

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
there no just to explain this a little

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.800 
there no just to explain this a little
better<00:04:47.120> okay<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.320> now<00:04:48.949> you<00:04:49.009> can<00:04:49.190> see<00:04:49.370> that

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
better okay so now you can see that

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.800 
better okay so now you can see that
there's<00:04:50.979> one<00:04:51.979> object<00:04:52.849> right<00:04:53.000> here<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.599> then

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
there's one object right here and then

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.779 
there's one object right here and then
there's<00:04:53.930> another<00:04:54.110> one<00:04:54.320> next<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.770> okay<00:04:55.310> so

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
there's another one next to it okay so

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.189 
there's another one next to it okay so
let's<00:04:56.180> say<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.330> want<00:04:56.539> it<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.720> draw<00:04:56.960> another

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
let's say you want it to draw another

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.770 
let's say you want it to draw another
one<00:04:57.349> next<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.800> what<00:04:58.130> would<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.340> do<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:59.240> it's

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
one next to it what would you do so it's

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.779 
one next to it what would you do so it's
really<00:04:59.900> easy<00:05:00.229> now<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.710> have<00:05:01.099> this<00:05:01.550> line

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
really easy now you have this line

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.350 
really easy now you have this line
that's<00:05:02.000> going<00:05:02.240> across<00:05:03.080> all<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.800> middle<00:05:04.360> the

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
that's going across all the middle the

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.730 
that's going across all the middle the
middle<00:05:05.389> of<00:05:05.690> all<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.990> objects<00:05:06.410> cuz<00:05:06.560> you<00:05:06.650> know

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
middle of all the objects cuz you know

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.100 
middle of all the objects cuz you know
they're<00:05:06.860> next<00:05:07.039> to<00:05:07.099> each<00:05:07.250> other<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:07.930> there's<00:05:08.930> no

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
they're next to each other so there's no

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.719 
they're next to each other so there's no
reason<00:05:09.349> for<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.620> change<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.610> need

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
reason for that to change and you need

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.129 
reason for that to change and you need
to<00:05:10.880> go<00:05:11.000> from<00:05:11.360> this<00:05:11.800> little<00:05:12.800> corner<00:05:13.490> here<00:05:14.139> make

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
to go from this little corner here make

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.620 
to go from this little corner here make
a<00:05:15.169> line<00:05:15.409> that<00:05:15.590> goes<00:05:15.770> in<00:05:16.190> this<00:05:16.490> direction<00:05:16.630> and

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
a line that goes in this direction and

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.990 
a line that goes in this direction and
you<00:05:17.810> have<00:05:17.930> another<00:05:18.110> dot<00:05:18.409> so<00:05:18.740> after<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:19.400> you

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
you have another dot so after that you

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.120 
you have another dot so after that you
make<00:05:20.150> another<00:05:20.419> perspective<00:05:21.169> line<00:05:21.590> and<00:05:22.039> he

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
make another perspective line and he

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.100 
make another perspective line and he
have<00:05:22.280> your<00:05:22.430> next<00:05:22.639> item<00:05:23.570> right<00:05:23.690> here<00:05:23.930> because

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
have your next item right here because

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.589 
have your next item right here because
you<00:05:24.139> need<00:05:24.349> to<00:05:24.530> do<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.340> vertical<00:05:25.789> line<00:05:26.150> or<00:05:26.389> not<00:05:26.449> a

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
you need to do a vertical line or not a

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.969 
you need to do a vertical line or not a
vertical<00:05:26.780> but<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.349> know<00:05:27.440> going<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.830> that

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
vertical but you know going to that

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.089 
vertical but you know going to that
place<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.669> the<00:05:28.729> bottom<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:29.449> have<00:05:29.570> another<00:05:29.780> one

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
place at the bottom you have another one

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.409 
place at the bottom you have another one
and<00:05:31.099> you<00:05:31.190> have<00:05:31.310> another<00:05:31.520> line<00:05:32.090> right<00:05:32.210> there

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
and you have another line right there

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.810 
and you have another line right there
and<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:33.139> just<00:05:33.320> continue<00:05:33.500> this<00:05:33.949> line<00:05:34.490> this

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
and you just continue this line this

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.999 
and you just continue this line this
perspective<00:05:35.090> line<00:05:35.449> over<00:05:35.630> here<00:05:35.840> okay<00:05:36.680> so<00:05:36.740> now

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
perspective line over here okay so now

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.290 
perspective line over here okay so now
you<00:05:37.070> have<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.310> next<00:05:37.520> one<00:05:37.669> and<00:05:37.849> if<00:05:37.940> you<00:05:38.030> want<00:05:38.210> to

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
you have the next one and if you want to

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.640 
you have the next one and if you want to
do<00:05:38.389> another<00:05:38.509> one<00:05:38.659> you<00:05:38.900> go<00:05:38.990> from<00:05:39.199> this<00:05:39.380> corner

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
do another one you go from this corner

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.219 
do another one you go from this corner
to<00:05:39.800> this<00:05:40.729> place<00:05:41.060> now<00:05:41.570> you<00:05:41.630> have<00:05:41.750> another<00:05:41.930> dot

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
to this place now you have another dot

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.770 
to this place now you have another dot
so<00:05:42.770> you<00:05:42.830> do<00:05:43.400> another<00:05:43.639> perspective<00:05:44.150> line<00:05:44.539> and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
so you do another perspective line and

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.080 
so you do another perspective line and
you<00:05:45.289> know<00:05:45.380> it's<00:05:45.560> it's<00:05:45.919> you<00:05:46.460> can<00:05:46.610> just<00:05:46.789> keep

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
you know it's it's you can just keep

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.480 
you know it's it's you can just keep
going<00:05:47.479> and<00:05:47.570> going<00:05:47.870> until<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:49.009> know<00:05:49.130> you<00:05:49.310> don't

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
going and going until you know you don't

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.149 
going and going until you know you don't
want<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.699> do<00:05:49.789> it<00:05:49.849> anymore<00:05:50.000> so<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:51.889> can<00:05:52.009> just

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
want to do it anymore so you can just

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:54.339 
want to do it anymore so you can just
keep<00:05:52.280> going<00:05:52.340> and<00:05:52.729> going<00:05:52.789> so<00:05:53.750> that<00:05:53.900> was<00:05:54.050> our

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
keep going and going so that was our

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.350 
keep going and going so that was our
basic<00:05:54.560> rule<00:05:54.889> you<00:05:55.130> know<00:05:55.219> find<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.639> middle<00:05:55.789> once

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
basic rule you know find the middle once

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.760 
basic rule you know find the middle once
you<00:05:56.479> find<00:05:56.659> the<00:05:56.719> middle<00:05:56.840> you<00:05:57.050> need<00:05:57.169> to<00:05:57.259> draw<00:05:57.530> a

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
you find the middle you need to draw a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.680 
you find the middle you need to draw a
line<00:05:57.889> once<00:05:58.849> you<00:05:58.969> find<00:05:59.150> that<00:05:59.240> line<00:05:59.479> you're

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
line once you find that line you're

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.350 
line once you find that line you're
gonna<00:05:59.780> get<00:06:00.020> this<00:06:00.440> point<00:06:01.280> where<00:06:01.520> both<00:06:02.000> lines

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
gonna get this point where both lines

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.320 
gonna get this point where both lines
meet<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:03.800> go<00:06:03.919> from<00:06:04.070> this<00:06:04.280> corner<00:06:04.520> cross

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
meet and you go from this corner cross

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.510 
meet and you go from this corner cross
and<00:06:05.719> just<00:06:06.530> draw<00:06:06.680> another<00:06:06.740> perspective<00:06:07.099> line

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
and just draw another perspective line

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.430 
and just draw another perspective line
and<00:06:07.759> now<00:06:08.090> you're<00:06:08.360> basically<00:06:08.990> done<00:06:09.199> because

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
and now you're basically done because

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.020 
and now you're basically done because
all<00:06:09.680> you<00:06:09.949> need<00:06:10.099> to<00:06:10.190> do<00:06:10.310> is<00:06:10.460> go<00:06:10.639> from<00:06:10.789> that

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
all you need to do is go from that

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.879 
all you need to do is go from that
corner<00:06:11.389> over<00:06:11.570> there<00:06:11.900> that<00:06:12.259> corner<00:06:12.590> over<00:06:12.620> there

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
corner over there that corner over there

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.740 
corner over there that corner over there
you<00:06:13.340> know<00:06:13.430> just<00:06:13.669> keep<00:06:13.820> going<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.240> going<00:06:14.389> here

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
you know just keep going and going here

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.629 
you know just keep going and going here
you<00:06:14.779> can<00:06:14.990> do<00:06:15.110> another<00:06:15.320> one<00:06:15.560> you<00:06:16.279> know<00:06:16.400> they're

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
you can do another one you know they're

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.550 
you can do another one you know they're
gonna<00:06:16.729> get<00:06:16.909> really<00:06:17.330> smaller<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.169> smaller<00:06:18.380> as

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
gonna get really smaller and smaller as

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.100 
gonna get really smaller and smaller as
you<00:06:18.590> go<00:06:18.710> along

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
you go along

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.540 
you go along
okay<00:06:19.740> so<00:06:20.370> I<00:06:20.640> hope<00:06:21.000> you<00:06:21.270> understood<00:06:21.750> how

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
okay so I hope you understood how

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.730 
okay so I hope you understood how
proportions<00:06:23.550> and<00:06:23.700> perspective<00:06:24.260> work<00:06:25.260> because

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
proportions and perspective work because

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.070 
proportions and perspective work because
you're<00:06:25.860> going<00:06:26.010> to<00:06:26.070> be<00:06:26.390> using<00:06:27.390> this<00:06:27.540> technique

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
you're going to be using this technique

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.650 
you're going to be using this technique
a<00:06:28.200> lot<00:06:28.320> at<00:06:28.530> least<00:06:28.830> you<00:06:29.430> know<00:06:29.550> this<00:06:30.000> cross<00:06:30.300> and

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
a lot at least you know this cross and

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.050 
a lot at least you know this cross and
doing<00:06:31.140> a<00:06:31.230> dot<00:06:31.380> there<00:06:31.620> it's<00:06:32.220> really<00:06:32.520> helpful<00:06:32.880> to

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
doing a dot there it's really helpful to

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.190 
doing a dot there it's really helpful to
find<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.300> middle<00:06:33.540> and<00:06:33.720> you're<00:06:33.960> going<00:06:33.990> to<00:06:34.110> be

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
find the middle and you're going to be

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.340 
find the middle and you're going to be
using<00:06:34.320> that<00:06:34.650> basically<00:06:35.640> and<00:06:36.060> on<00:06:36.660> every<00:06:36.990> single

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
using that basically and on every single

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.920 
using that basically and on every single
sketch<00:06:37.650> you<00:06:37.860> do<00:06:38.010> after<00:06:38.280> this<00:06:38.460> so<00:06:39.210> we're<00:06:39.840> going

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
sketch you do after this so we're going

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.670 
sketch you do after this so we're going
to<00:06:40.020> go<00:06:40.260> on<00:06:40.560> to<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:40.980> next<00:06:41.130> thing
