00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.760

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.260
 so what aquarium without algae 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.989

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.040
 left to cut off the excess on the sides 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.100
 the main thing is not to forget to leave the tail 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.100
 add fins and fish eye is ready 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.500
 one more sea resident will turn out 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.050

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.970
 add the tail of colored paper and 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 should get this harmonica 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.650
