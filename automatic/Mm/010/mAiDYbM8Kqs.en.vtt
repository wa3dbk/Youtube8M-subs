00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.770
 the cabbages before the last pot 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.310
 inside the garage I will not be one of the year 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.280
 2000 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.550
 I bought myself this week 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.310
 the sample no state 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.430
 in the cycle part it's perfect but it's not 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.740
 in perfect condition gums with just one thousand 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.010
 and peak miles and remove very crawl 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.010
 fine 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.730
 the rear shock absorber 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.730
 It has also changed less than a year ago 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.570
 the front expression goes silent 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.000
 series of change in the springs in 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.610
 seals and oil last year 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 they painted white tires and they 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.220
 took the opportunity to change the bearings 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.560
 he had a small trace 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.560
 if there is a first back the passenger 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.030
 and he touched on the engine 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 no significant 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.020
 the footrest and I do not accept anything else 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.609
 a little bit of the veneers and disguised 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.440
 but since I'm going to paint it whole 

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.680
 new 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.850
 I do not care about the leak or dysfunction of 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.009
 dose 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.009
 but also standard 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.890
 and the beach with the lover part of the 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.899
 aesthetic details is that it has hundreds 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.490
 thousand kilometers and valves will 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.259
 They start to sound good, it gives me the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.749
 options that are the valves the 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.670
 previous owner told me that he was already throwing us 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:45.220
 like before 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.970
 I meet if you find us stretching 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.170
 and placing now I have power left over 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.890
 the matter and it's gone from seven thousand 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.400
 turns and in any gear pulls me from 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.170
 left over 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.560
 but you have to review the topics of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 workshop and what I'm going to start 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.420
 to check it to be the compression 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.060
 without forgetting whalers as it sounded 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 nice that sounds a sound of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.450
 valves 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.660
 let's say the actress you do not want women 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.489
 when 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 a monster 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.549
 ah 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.120
 i 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.940
 I suspect that maybe it can be 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.130
 also influence the theme of the chain 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.390
 of the distribution in any one 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.010
 license in a thousand kilometers on you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.879
 changed the tensioner 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.640
 and the unstable sound of 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.569
 the valves good of what could be 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.849
 the valves 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.510
 so if someone knows me this 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.510
 model this engine 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.910
 I would really appreciate any 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.190
 suggestive power shots go 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.450
 nothing and we will make progress as we 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.880
 go doing 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:23.830
 from the right ticket 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:23.830
 It is like a cucumber let something
