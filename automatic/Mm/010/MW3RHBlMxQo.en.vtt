00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.410
 I remind you that there is a fetus 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.450
 perfect hello be there 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 there is someone there is someone who still 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.900
 I remember the five fun facts as 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.279
 That's right bitches we're back with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.199
 five curious facts so we're going to 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.330
 start and I remind you that if you have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.750
 a curious fact, comment it and it 's time to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 that will finally return your hair and let's go 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 to start with the first curious data 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.410
 you knew that there is an art in mind or as 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 it is said in Spanish an achievement there is a book 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.460
 which is called times to you which 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.940
 consists in giving a diamond to another 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.399
 diamond but I do not have friends 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 lady cow wants to be my good friend the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.640
 lady cow already accepted my friend like this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 that we just throw a diamond 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.070
 and we will see the achievement of demon's yours 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.620
 In short the curious fact is that this achievement 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.329
 of time is yours is based on the phrase 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.070
 popular from a youtube was American which 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.109
 it's alive box which and sedesa phrase in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 their videos so delay them have said 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.910
 that achievement is dedicated to that youtuber 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.369
 and let's go with the second curious thing is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.240
 that if we put an advantage you already know for 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.600
 put him 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.509
 the name to name the maps 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.759
 and we have our mint with the name of 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.220
 dinner bone and we go with a map by 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.280
 example my new friend cow the name tag 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.020
 will turn around like that is and that works with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.820
 all maps for those who do not know 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.450
 dinner bone is this one of the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.110
 how stupid it looks is one of the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.160
 programmers if I remember correctly the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.840
 programmers of mollendo I remember very 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.690
 well what is the function of dinner boat 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.150
 but I do think that they are the programmers and 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.430
 in fact a lot of time on twitter where 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.130
 they started uploading photos upside down and 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.259
 even your profile picture on twitter the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.850
 put it upside down so that's good where 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.590
 comes what to put dinner bone what 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.540
 will change and yes yes it is a programmer I would 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 I was meeting with Jeff but if 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.729
 dinner bound is a programmer and good 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.869
 that is the curious fact you know that the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.820
 pocket edition version there is no 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.770
 dimensions but still there is a 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.810
 way to go to the leader and if you simply 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.509
 you have to make a craft eoi putting 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.489
 a type of ritual with different types 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530
 of objects and clicking on it will create 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.700
 a strength of the level and so you can 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.280
 get in the vintage version of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.920
 edit some materials from the never 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.709
 you knew I do not remember if it was jet dinner 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.690
 bone or night he said good night 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.180
 forgiveness above or night the one who said 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.300
 how good all minecraft maps 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 they do not have any sex they are not 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.430
 female and male except the dragon 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.730
 the dragon is female and not only that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.630
 it also has a name and is called james j 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:45.060
 in 2010 is a little woman with a 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.380
 little little machine you knew that when 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.840
 we have a map like in this case 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.060
 we can appreciate that we have the map with 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.519
 both hands but if we give f5 and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.580
 we change to third person we will see that 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.010
 we only have the map with only one 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.660
 hand while as in first 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.270
 person with two hands 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.710
 I do not understand why but good I bet 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.090
 that you had not realized that and if 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.760
 I had really realized it was worth it 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.110
 1500 kilos and 300 grams of cock 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.970
 horse writings I hope you have them 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.830
 really liked these 5 curious facts and 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.420
 a long time ago many months really 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.670
 and we as six seven months since 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.070
 I was uploading curious data but in the end 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.180
 they have uploaded five curious facts you 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.890
 I remember that if you have a data 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.540
 curious commenting and if you were surprised 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.820
 you do not know one thing please give it a like 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.170

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.010
 very much shares the video seriously 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.010
 share it in order 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.750
 and you have a curious fact, comment it 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.340
 he's waiting for us 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.709
 but do not commit anything first 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.269
 look at the one of 100 curious facts and the other 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.920
 they have curious facts because many 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.319
 Sometimes I discussed things and that is 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:53.720
 is making this map this map is 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.610
 witness of 210 good plus these 5 200 215 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.010
