00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:17.250

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.369
 and be able to play with friends without having to 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:31.179
 download nothing and hamas ya game is good 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.350
 very easy but it is for an emotion 1.5 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.579
 points 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.579
 this version 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.170
 and we are going to do 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.880
 and this first one is abel what would be 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.950
 what 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.250
 although in what would be the mind 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.250
 let's create 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 Y 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 why 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.040
 but 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.890
 okay 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.080
 and 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.210
 what would this be 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.040
 the operation of possibility 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 and good what we are going to do and we are going 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.790
 to open the land 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.450
 but before that they're going to create them 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.450
 gets to forget 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.360
 I detest that 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.820
 or yes 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:42.690
 Now what are we going to do? Let's 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:45.810
 open it to choose it they want from here 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 always leans 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.099
 what they are going to write easy this the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.099
 last moments 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.150
 68 02 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.750
 okay 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.260
 it's perfect 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.799
 what if 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.799
 now 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.970
 they will start more r 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.030
 and they will give you they will write 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.819
 cmd 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.130
 and they're going to write it to me and they're going to 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.690
 open how would you exercise this 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.690
 here they are going to write 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.340
 with tics 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.340
 of 40 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.220
 one click 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.640
 they have argenter 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
 up to the top 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.950
 Y 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.970
 they will go where it says 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.410
 where it says here 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.459
 address says 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.459
 v 4 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.910
 there 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.830
 and they're going to write what this would be 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.830
 so I would say this 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:39.500
 this is not going to be the way it is and here 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.580
 back to write what would be live 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.580
 I'm going to do it myself 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.810
 and here they are going to put us like this 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.060
 and that's how the server is going to be 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.889
 they close 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:21.320
 and what will be this ip 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:23.110
 and this one is only passed to your friends 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.560
 and style 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.370
 to be able to play quietly in 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.370
 Minecraft 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700
 good 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.220
 good guys 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.840
 more than anything 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.740
 but equal
