 We have a bomb to dirceu is not mine. 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.880
 if I will not use division I will use 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.119
 gasoline 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:23.470
 You take the stop to fill the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.360
 pump tank in choosing quality 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.869
 are three qualities and I will choose the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.640
 the highest is that my car asks 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.950
 can have up to 10 percent alcohol a 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.920
 worse quality in decreasing the quantity 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.500
 alcohol in other qualities then it is 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.520
 We simply insert a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.520
 sifted here 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.970
 no the guy still has to deal with it 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.670
 and if you have occupy 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 now, yes, I have already chosen the quality 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.130
 now I can supply that distracted 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.690
 I 'm filming, I forgot to take the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.970
 my good card the machine stayed 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.160
 So much, but it's that simple. 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.820
 the qualities are according to the 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.060
 octane then this is more impure 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.170
 average of impurity that is already more 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.820
 Pure has some having up to 93 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.250
 quality of fuel here in Canada 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.590
 It's very good compared to Brazil like that. 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.830
 awesome my old impala that 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.370
 was v6 3.4 was 12 kilometers by 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.350
 the price of flamenco 11 and 13 in the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.530
 true one on caa course 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.090
 the yttrium that of Canadian dollar and dollar 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.700
 Canadian is worth less than the 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.770
 in Canada is political if it is 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.310
 supply the United States and v in gallon 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.740
 in the balloon of almost 4 liters and and in Canada 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.650
 and in the United States the fuel is well 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.540
 cheaper than in Brazil depending on the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.310
 account of Canada. 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.260
 will give the same price but remembering that 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.489
 the fuel quality here is 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.440
 better than brazil's fuel but it is 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.750
 more or less as soon as you 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.170
 You have to stay in the machine by pressing 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.970
 Holding all the time, I do not know. 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.700
 What's your name, this is not the bomb on top. 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.560
 and if you know in some places it is 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 in new zealand remember do not know how 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.880
 is reaching the same service states 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.760
 You can stop and the bomb happens. 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.680
 automatically for safety reasons 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.160
 and it is prohibited in Canada to prevent 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.960
 these assholes kick very silly 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.850
 Forget the bomb in the car and walk away. 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.290
 You should have seen the video of 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.000
 accidents in which the person 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.930
 simply leaving with the car leads to 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.910
 pump together and it's very dangerous that 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.090
 The car tank I have is fine. 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.090
 big and more than that he is almost 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.420
 Empty then it's going to be very expensive here 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.990
 but must is almost full tank already had 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.150
 so thirsty out there liters of capacity 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.380
 this tank from 76 dollars to 67 liters 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.410
 It's time to take it, you have to drink a lot. 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.500
 care for nobody's fuel 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.640
 taking the utmost care of beauty here 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.770
 Just restart at the pump. 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.250
 the stop to fill to tighten for me the 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.250
 receipt 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.989
 and that's what I get face 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.060
 and that's it people, I hope you have 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.010
 helped you traveling abroad 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.940
 and kill the curiosity of many as 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.370
 refuel 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.910
 won here in Canada as well as 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.960
 other countries there are 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.300
 the front car has a 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.310
 on the stud is a flash 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.650
 I do not know what it was to be dignified. 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.380
 This is for me or something like that. 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.600
 turning and such but finally has a 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.120
 curiosity for you is proof below 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.900
 car there at least we know the plate 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.900
 of the car in combat
