00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:13.190
 what is a good deus ex machina according to the 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.710
 life of the geeks to wikipedia is a 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.240
 Latin expression that is used to 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.580
 refer to an external element that is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.020
 resolves in a state it was secret what 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.060
 HernÃ¡n's account from the point of view 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.160
 of the structure of a script speaks of 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.960
 speaks speaks that the main problem of 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.640
 that kind of event is that at 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.369
 perceive the lack of coherence 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.200
 internal can cause discomfort and 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.780
 be three spectators factors 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.970
 depending on the work the fair amount 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.730
 of chance imposed by the narrative 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.559
 forgiveness is a difficult ingredient of 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.149
 handle by the screenwriter on the one hand 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.370
 it's an easy method to learn the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.469
 desired plot but it also makes the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 whole is not credible or that 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.100
 even rubbing in surrealism 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.379
 in a few words is when a 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.280
 very difficult situation to solve 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.460
 also called Gordian knot 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.640
 resolves in a way that does not have much 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.310
 sense they look too forced and never 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.159
 it is explained 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.229
 but talking to talk I do not think that with 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.810
 That I will understand everything so 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.200
 I'm going to give you two examples of what 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:25.070
 yes it is a deus ex machina and another one that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.830
 simple view could appear but it is not 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.659
 they remember the series bliss that series 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.659
 that was pretty entertaining but 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.670
 then the direct to the good fuck 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.950
 well in the scene where they are fighting and 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.860
 I follow and urkiola there is a moment where 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.080
 I say they make a hole in my chest and in 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 instead of dying it becomes a 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.430
 hollow vast smell and good then 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.520
 technically defeat ulquiorra but for 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.560
 what they would not explain to us at all 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.860
 no no 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.530
 or just did not use it again in all 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.570
 the series is to say I only use it because the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.170
 script needed a boy to be saved 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.450
 and well, that happened, it does not have much 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.229
 meaning and that is cataloged as a 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.229
 deus ex machina 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.070
 They remind hunter x 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.740
 good who have followed the manga 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:25.840
 they will know that there is a part in the nfl 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.060
 where he ruled face army 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.410
 because there is a part that pisses enjoyment 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.170
 Y 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.320
 It has a very, very, very 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.890
 exaggerated or at least for this guy 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.070
 of character because many say that 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.440
 event does not make sense is not 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.230
 supported by the logic of the series that 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.990
 it is a little route that is a 2 ex machina 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.580
 this is true 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.770
 do not 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.310
 this transformation is thanks to what 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.920
 called the condition and commitment of the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.069
 which do not find out thanks aquatic in 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.890
 the saga the new yor singh 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.230
 a priest itch should be trained but for 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.450
 materialize chains and the only difficult thing 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.129
 of his training was to decide in what 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.560
 I would use the commitment condition 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.840
 but at no time do you see that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.389
 technique or the condition of commitment 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.870
 it resists a great training for 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:23.900
 master it and that unlike with this 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.389
 I sacrifice something so to speak more serious 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.709
 since it is believed that with your health and all 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:31.030
 your energy just for becoming very strong 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.560
 for a short period of time and then 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.900
 wear out completely and seemingly 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.939
 become an old man 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.189
 unlike cura pica that can only 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.919
 die attack to a member that is not 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:45.469
 of the river give which can decide thing 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:47.970
 that can not since once activated it 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.250
 fuck there there will be no going back 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.840
 how can the first one realize the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.480
 example of bleach does not have a whore 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.600
 explanation of anything does not make sense or 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.170
 even give a minimum mention of what 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.080
 what happened 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.980
 it simply changed because if not 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.260
 all costs of dying and the second 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.320
 we will see what it is and if it has an explanation 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.020
 so do not count on candy I hope that 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.430
 have understood and remember to subscribe 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.430
 from the like and I use it bots
