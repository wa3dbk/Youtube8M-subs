00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.949
 we are in secret shop here 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.509
 unreal many people just 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.300
 all glass is standing around the building 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.279
 here a huge square is unrealistic 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 only this is just the tip of the iceberg 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.750
 believe me about 500 people here 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.730
 here and maybe one and a half two thousand 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.540
 people queuing for treasured 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.170
 souvenirs for 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.170
 behind these doors 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.620
 everyone is eager to get the cherished souvenirs with 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.590
 internet again toys as promised 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.040
 enough for everyone let's see what happens at the end 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.830
 on the first day just who can 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.410
 end means at the initial stage 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.900
 secret shop 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.830
 standing up queue clogged orders 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.830
 behind these computers 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 orders are stuffed with these computers 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.700
 by the list 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.039
 both under the white books that are in 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.130
 in people's hands you can watch it 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:29.640
 special order when order warrant so 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.569
 say in it you mark what you 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.220
 and then you need to also come up with a computer 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.939
 these computers you stuffed 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.810
 your order quantity you verify everything 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.799
 here is represented seville can 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.799
 see what it looks like 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.440
 is shining 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.729
 nice people and that he is nothing to anyone 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:05.420
 does not simply impose unrealistic checks 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:09.709
 people . I personally have further dependencies 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:15.650
 from which room we were high in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:21.310
 queues go on your line and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.310
 look generally among the queue 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.040
 she's not de queue and already here 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 you are already waiting for your order without actually 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.440
 any problems except 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.870
 probably a five-hour queue which 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.300
 need to defend to get these 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.820
 toys 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.120
 it's already lucky who are ready 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.120
 receive 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.849

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.940

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.940

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.280

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.370
 top notch and even special hooks 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.720
 for bags 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.480

 two three people work with each 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.220
 everything is done at level very well 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.409
 there are collecting orders in the distance and 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.749
 lay them out on special stands 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.749
 which are behind the blue green boxes 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.650

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.650
