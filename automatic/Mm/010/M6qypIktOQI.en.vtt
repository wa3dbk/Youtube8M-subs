it will mark the distance in which that
grenade<00:01:56.939> will<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.210> programmed<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.780> explode<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
grenade will be programmed to explode so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.160 
grenade will be programmed to explode so
this<00:01:58.860> one<00:01:58.979> explodes<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> air<00:01:59.790> yes<00:02:00.689> based

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.260 
on the distance that he marked yes sir
if<00:02:03.870> somebody's<00:02:04.260> behind<00:02:04.410> a<00:02:05.030> something<00:02:06.030> right

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
if somebody's behind a something right

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.680 
if somebody's behind a something right
that<00:02:06.480> it<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.140> maybe<00:02:07.440> go<00:02:07.650> me<00:02:07.860> go<00:02:07.890> past<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
that it would maybe go me go past and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
that it would maybe go me go past and
explode<00:02:09.690> down<00:02:09.900> so<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.040> basically<00:02:11.220> be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
explode down so it can basically be

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.060 
explode down so it can basically be
rendered<00:02:11.820> cover<00:02:12.270> infected<00:02:13.080> yeah<00:02:13.410> but<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
rendered cover infected yeah but you

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.800 
rendered cover infected yeah but you
have<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.310> manually<00:02:14.730> lace<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.600> is<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
have to manually lace that this is a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.110 
have to manually lace that this is a
multiplayer<00:02:16.640> something<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:17.910> have<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
multiplayer something you don't have to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.550 
multiplayer something you don't have to
do<00:02:18.210> into<00:02:18.420> service<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.110> difference<00:02:19.440> between

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
do into service the difference between

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.650 
do into service the difference between
taking<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.490> same<00:02:20.730> weapon<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.060> was<00:02:21.210> in<00:02:21.360> single

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
taking a same weapon that was in single

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.870 
taking a same weapon that was in single
player<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.190> rebalancing<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:23.760> not

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
player and rebalancing it so it's not

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.930 
player and rebalancing it so it's not
overpowered<00:02:24.450> multiband<00:02:25.550> yeah<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.580> imagine

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
overpowered multiband yeah I imagine

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.980 
overpowered multiband yeah I imagine
that<00:02:27.060> something<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.570> challenge<00:02:27.780> right

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
that something that's a challenge right

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.080 
that something that's a challenge right
are<00:02:28.710> there<00:02:28.920> many<00:02:29.130> weapons<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.790> been

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
changed between multiplayer and single

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.170
