00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.440
 Welcome youtube to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.569
 new video on engineering casting in 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 this video you see the unboxing and 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:28.859
 review of the apple thunderbolt display 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:30.869
 now we have fun in the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 background you see now the unboxing 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.270
 and in retrospect follows the review 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.850
 to the apple thunderbolt display in advance 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.219
 few technical data in the apple 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.350
 thunderbolt display is a 27 inch 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 widescreen display with led 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.430
 backlight installed 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.100
 that really delivers really good pictures 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 has a page ratio of 16 9 and 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 a really good resolution of 2560 x 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 Pixelate 1440 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 the whole thing is a glossy display what 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.460
 in my opinion the only one 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.199
 disadvantage of the screen is namely 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 that he is real in sunlight 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.740
 strong reflects that you see the same 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.689
 still have in the run of the review 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.479
 her the little connection for the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.520
 seen magsafe adapter that's easy 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.100
 So you with the integrated plug 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.049
 from the tara gold display new macbook pro 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.210
 Can load that's really right 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.390
 practically here you can see the now 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.439
 actual plug with the German 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.920
 electricity connection exact dimensions from the ban 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.479
 I'll blind you here now 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.540
 and here you see the thunderbolt now 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.880
 connection and the actual charging 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.880
 can load with the new macbook 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.000
 Now we take off the film and that 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:03.180
 is really a great building 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.420
 That's why it's always easy 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.880
 again a very nice moment 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:18.270
 and now to the actual reveal of the 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:21.120
 displays and there we can see and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.190
 also directly the big disadvantage namely 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.770
 through the glossy display reflects the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.460
 screen really like a mirror say 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.100
 me once 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.290
 it is really crass and above all 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.370
 when directly sunlight on the display 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:40.410
 it is already hard to recognize something 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.060
 pull the foil from here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.500
 really makes a screen just like that 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.230
 every other apple product also has one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.209
 very high quality impression 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.250
 and now I have the smaller one 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.709
 on it and then the whole looks in the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.590
 setup from right a bit of cabled salad 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.690
 and in my opinion really right 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.090
 Great looks really good together from the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.810
 black frame from the display along with 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.160
 the macbook 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.200
 Here you can see the display 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.690
 in plants looks at the big program 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.640
 ifx a potato then it hooks something 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.110
 when enlarging but here at normal 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.320
 Internet sites like google are everything 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.670
 as fluid as if you were now 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.680
 window between two screens as well 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.020
 want to change this is all very much 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.370
 all in all, it makes you fluid 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.200
 welcome a really good screen 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.630
