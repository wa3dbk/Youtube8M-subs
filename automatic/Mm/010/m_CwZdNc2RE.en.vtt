still<00:00:00.240> nothing<00:00:00.659> but<00:00:01.190> hopefully<00:00:02.190> it'll<00:00:02.310> start

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
still nothing but hopefully it'll start

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.720 
still nothing but hopefully it'll start
forming<00:00:02.939> now<00:00:03.090> that<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.419> is<00:00:03.629> gone<00:00:04.560> from<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
forming now that this is gone from the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.220 
forming now that this is gone from the
top<00:00:05.879> there<00:00:06.060> there's<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.299> view<00:00:06.480> crystals<00:00:06.899> up<00:00:07.020> out

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
top there there's a view crystals up out

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.080 
top there there's a view crystals up out
of<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.470> top<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.830> water<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.309> we'll<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.849> huh

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
of the top of the water so we'll see huh

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.419 
of the top of the water so we'll see huh
my<00:00:09.420> dad<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:09.630> put<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:10.110> an<00:00:10.260> outdoor<00:00:10.530> chair<00:00:11.219> in

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
my dad just put like an outdoor chair in

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
my dad just put like an outdoor chair in
the<00:00:11.550> Corvair<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.240> he's<00:00:12.389> been<00:00:12.570> taking<00:00:13.049> out

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the Corvair because he's been taking out

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.589 
the Corvair because he's been taking out
the<00:00:13.230> carpet<00:00:13.530> painting<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> inside<00:00:14.450> so<00:00:15.450> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the carpet painting the inside so it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.750 
the carpet painting the inside so it
doesn't<00:00:15.929> rust<00:00:16.320> anymore<00:00:16.710> well<00:00:16.980> then<00:00:17.160> more<00:00:17.699> than

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
doesn't rust anymore well then more than

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.609 
doesn't rust anymore well then more than
likely<00:00:18.090> his<00:00:18.390> reasoning<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:18.900> probably<00:00:19.380> this

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
likely his reasoning was probably this

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.529 
likely his reasoning was probably this
giant<00:00:20.130> hole<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.670> floor<00:00:20.970> right<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.359> oh

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
giant hole in the floor right here oh

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.820 
giant hole in the floor right here oh
geez<00:00:22.199> oh<00:00:23.420> good<00:00:24.420> times<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:25.109> guess<00:00:25.560> we'll<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
geez oh good times I guess we'll have to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.460 
geez oh good times I guess we'll have to
get<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.039> floor<00:00:26.279> pan<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
get a floor pan for it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.859 
get a floor pan for it
yeah<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.830> found<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.340> why<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.730> dad<00:00:29.970> took<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> out

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
yeah I found out why my dad took it out

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.179 
yeah I found out why my dad took it out
it<00:00:31.019> wasn't<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.500> floor<00:00:31.679> was<00:00:31.859> too<00:00:32.009> far

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it wasn't because the floor was too far

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.299 
it wasn't because the floor was too far
gone<00:00:32.219> which<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.149> probably<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
gone which it probably is but it was

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.340 
gone which it probably is but it was
because<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> seats<00:00:36.059> were<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:36.870> really

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
because the seats were not really

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 
because the seats were not really
attached<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> ground<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.370> well<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.210> here

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
attached to the ground so well so here

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.200 
attached to the ground so well so here
are<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> rails<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:41.100> held<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> seats<00:00:42.030> down

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
are the rails that held the seats down

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
are the rails that held the seats down
you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.600> see<00:00:42.780> here's<00:00:43.110> where<00:00:43.320> they<00:00:43.440> were

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you can see here's where they were

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.090 
you can see here's where they were
supposed<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> bolt<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> floor<00:00:45.829> there<00:00:46.829> are

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
supposed to bolt to the floor there are

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
supposed to bolt to the floor there are
none<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.399> are<00:00:47.730> original<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.719> show<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
none that are original so I can show you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.590 
none that are original so I can show you

that I bought it from made up which has

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.740 
that I bought it from made up which has
holes<00:00:57.059> but<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:58.160> too<00:00:59.160> sturdy<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.030> what

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
new homemade fashioning devices here and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.460 
new homemade fashioning devices here and
here<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.670> bolt<00:01:09.659> through<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
here so that it can bolt through all the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.510 
here so that it can bolt through all the
way<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.830> floor<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.340> some<00:01:11.549> some

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
way through the floor with some some

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.030 
way through the floor with some some
like<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:15.180> -<00:01:15.479> not<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> square

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
like a like - not to be like a square

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
like a like - not to be like a square
stock<00:01:17.400> steel<00:01:18.140> that'll<00:01:19.140> give<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> bolt<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.710> go

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
stock steel that'll give the bolt to go

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.749 
stock steel that'll give the bolt to go
all<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> way<00:01:20.009> through<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.340> that'll<00:01:20.549> hold<00:01:20.700> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
all the way through and that'll hold it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.920 
all the way through and that'll hold it
up<00:01:20.880> off<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.060> ground<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.840> I'm

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
up off the ground so that's what I'm

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
up off the ground so that's what I'm
actually<00:01:22.080> sitting<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.650> rather<00:01:22.979> than<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.970> know

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
actually sitting on rather than you know

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.570 
actually sitting on rather than you know
rusted<00:01:24.960> old<00:01:25.080> metal<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.189> we'll<00:01:26.310> spread

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
rusted old metal and then we'll spread

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950 
rusted old metal and then we'll spread
out<00:01:26.700> some<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> weight<00:01:27.210> across<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> floor

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
out some of the weight across the floor

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.170 
out some of the weight across the floor
since<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> floor<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:28.979> good

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.980 

and<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.509> after<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.049> all<00:01:34.470> gets<00:01:34.770> done<00:01:35.180> then<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
and so after that all gets done then we

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.780 
and so after that all gets done then we
bolt<00:01:37.200> all<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.560> through<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.009> looked<00:01:38.610> at<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
bolt all the way through I looked at the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.429 
bolt all the way through I looked at the
price<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> new<00:01:39.329> floor<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.200> 500

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
price of a new floor it's like 500

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
price of a new floor it's like 500
dollars<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> whole<00:01:41.369> floor<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.939> can't

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
dollars for the whole floor and I can't

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.649 
dollars for the whole floor and I can't
can't<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:44.310> uh<00:01:44.369> starting<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> think

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
can't do that I'm uh starting to think

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
can't do that I'm uh starting to think
that<00:01:45.750> we<00:01:45.869> might<00:01:46.110> end<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.590> after<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.610> get<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
that we might end up after we get a
