like to brained my sawdust first before

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
like to brained my sawdust first before
I<00:00:40.110> paint<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.670> I'm

fibres you get shorter little chunky

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
fibres you get shorter little chunky
that's<00:00:55.590> better<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.430> leaves<00:00:56.730> then<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that's better more like leaves then you

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
that's better more like leaves then you
take<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> smaller<00:00:58.800> one<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.640> reason<00:01:03.030> for

take the smaller one the reason for

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.390 
take the smaller one the reason for
having<00:01:03.570> different<00:01:03.840> sized<00:01:04.320> grains<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.250> your

having different sized grains of your

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.990 
having different sized grains of your
sawdust<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> user<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.140> different

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
sawdust is the user for different

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
sawdust is the user for different
applications<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.350> bigger<00:01:10.350> grains<00:01:10.740> used<00:01:11.430> for

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
applications the bigger grains used for

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.760 
applications the bigger grains used for
larger<00:01:12.090> leaves<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.720> middle<00:01:13.140> size<00:01:13.380> grain

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
larger leaves the middle size grain

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
larger leaves the middle size grain
which<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> around<00:01:14.400> about<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.229> use

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
which is around about there you can use

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
which is around about there you can use
for<00:01:17.040> grass<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.390> fine<00:01:19.250> tree<00:01:20.250> stuff<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> the

for grass and fine tree stuff and the
very<00:01:21.540> tiny<00:01:21.930> stuff<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.619> can<00:01:22.830> use<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.939> monsters

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
very tiny stuff you can use for monsters

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.490 
very tiny stuff you can use for monsters
and<00:01:24.720> very<00:01:25.320> finest<00:01:26.000> applications<00:01:27.380> all<00:01:28.380> right

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and very finest applications all right

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.480 
and very finest applications all right
the<00:01:28.979> next<00:01:29.130> thing<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:31.490> sawdust

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the next thing to do is put your sawdust

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
the next thing to do is put your sawdust
into<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.360> disposable<00:01:34.320> cup<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.640> yogurt

your<00:01:38.850> water-based<00:01:39.540> paint<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.450> have<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
your water-based paint and have it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.719 
your water-based paint and have it
reasonably<00:01:42.899> runny<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:44.130> you're<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.640> to
