to<00:03:44.239> accommodate<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.870> sometimes<00:03:45.560> I'll<00:03:45.769> just

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
to accommodate it sometimes I'll just

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.060

throw<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.370> in<00:03:46.459> my<00:03:46.549> purse<00:03:46.790> this<00:03:47.780> knife<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.500> think

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
throw it in my purse this knife I think

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.870 
throw it in my purse this knife I think
it's<00:03:49.220> really<00:03:49.430> great<00:03:49.670> for<00:03:50.030> defense<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.880> for

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
it's really great for defense and for

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.599 
it's really great for defense and for
just<00:03:53.480> basic<00:03:54.049> use<00:03:54.260> around<00:03:54.590> the<00:03:54.709> house<00:03:54.859> and<00:03:55.220> at

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
just basic use around the house and at

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:57.250 
just basic use around the house and at
the<00:03:55.760> range<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.329> would<00:03:56.480> definitely<00:03:57.109> recommend

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
the range I would definitely recommend

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.870 
the range I would definitely recommend
it<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:59.859> I<00:04:00.859> think<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.280> really<00:04:01.519> safe<00:04:01.730> option

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
it and I think it's a really safe option

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.880 
it and I think it's a really safe option
