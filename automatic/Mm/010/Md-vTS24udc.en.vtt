and it will just go one by one whereas
this<00:00:25.830> one<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.310> go<00:00:26.550> one<00:00:26.760> by<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:26.939> but<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
this one I got to go one by one but this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.080 
this one I got to go one by one but this
one<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.140> awesome<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.890> also<00:00:29.070> great<00:00:29.369> scanner

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
one is awesome it's also great scanner

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.260 
one is awesome it's also great scanner
portable<00:00:31.050> enough<00:00:31.800> from<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.160> let's<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.880> into

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
portable enough from that let's go into

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.299 
portable enough from that let's go into

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
big news over the weekend was that some

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.880 
big news over the weekend was that some
researchers<00:00:38.870> they<00:00:39.870> figured<00:00:40.200> out<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> use

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
researchers they figured out how to use

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
researchers they figured out how to use
android<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.850> developed<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.450> android<00:00:42.930> app

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
android and developed on android app

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.490 
android and developed on android app
that<00:00:43.469> could<00:00:43.649> hijack<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.340> airplane<00:00:45.379> using<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that could hijack an airplane using the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790 
that could hijack an airplane using the
security<00:00:47.010> flaws<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.730> found<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.469> planes

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
security flaws are found on some planes

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.979 
security flaws are found on some planes
with<00:00:50.250> their<00:00:50.430> autopilot<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
with their autopilot so if it if the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
with their autopilot so if it if the
plane<00:00:52.199> goes<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.559> autopilot<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.399> can<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.059> know

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
plane goes on autopilot you can you know

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
plane goes on autopilot you can you know
you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.629> supposedly<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.980> android<00:00:56.520> app

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you can supposedly use this android app

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.240 
you can supposedly use this android app
up<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.480> control<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> plane<00:00:58.140> maybe<00:00:58.680> you're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
up to control the plane maybe you're

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.189 
up to control the plane maybe you're
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> china<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> you<00:01:00.600> make<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.960> go<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
going to china and you make it go to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
going to china and you make it go to
korea<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:01.949> something<00:01:02.280> but<00:01:02.760> once<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
korea or something but once the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.109 
korea or something but once the
autopilot<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.470> off<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.250> can't<00:01:05.549> really<00:01:05.700> hijack

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
autopilot is off you can't really hijack

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.940 
autopilot is off you can't really hijack
the<00:01:06.240> plane<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.920> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the plane now there's a lot of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
the plane now there's a lot of
misconceptions<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.760> android<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.750> causing

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
misconceptions that android is causing

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
misconceptions that android is causing
this<00:01:10.409> problem<00:01:10.500> though<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.159> some<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
this problem though it's some of the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.030 
this problem though it's some of the
headlines<00:01:12.060> are<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.600> off<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.990> they've<00:01:13.770> used

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
headlines are kind of off I they've used

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.810 
headlines are kind of off I they've used
android<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.619> open<00:01:16.619> source<00:01:16.890> vs.<00:01:17.520> iOS

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
android because it's open source vs. iOS

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
android because it's open source vs. iOS
they<00:01:18.090> couldn't<00:01:18.420> do<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.930> iOS<00:01:19.259> Android<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
they couldn't do that on iOS Android is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
they couldn't do that on iOS Android is
very<00:01:20.100> easy<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.400> develop<00:01:20.610> those<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
very easy to develop those kind of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140 
very easy to develop those kind of
applications<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.500> they're<00:01:23.280> using<00:01:23.729> Android

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
applications so they're using Android

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
applications so they're using Android
and<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.380> making<00:01:25.530> Android<00:01:26.159> look

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and it's kind of making Android look

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.390 
and it's kind of making Android look
good<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.659> guys<00:01:27.840> should<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.400> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
good so you guys should think that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
good so you guys should think that
Android<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.509> awesome<00:01:30.960> an<00:01:31.079> open<00:01:31.320> source<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
Android so awesome an open source a

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
Android so awesome an open source a
developers<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:33.030> use<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:34.200> those

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
developers can use it to make those

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.490 
developers can use it to make those
hijacking<00:01:35.100> apps<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> don't<00:01:36.780> suggest<00:01:37.020> using

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
hijacking apps but I don't suggest using

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.230 
hijacking apps but I don't suggest using
those<00:01:37.799> apps<00:01:38.070> unless<00:01:38.400> you're<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> terrorist<00:01:38.909> if

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
those apps unless you're a terrorist if

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.819 
those apps unless you're a terrorist if
you're<00:01:39.630> terrorists<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> shouldn't<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.590> high

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you're terrorists you shouldn't be high

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
you're terrorists you shouldn't be high
on<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> bombs<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.240> should<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> high<00:01:42.630> on

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
on you know bombs you should be high on

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.149 
on you know bombs you should be high on
