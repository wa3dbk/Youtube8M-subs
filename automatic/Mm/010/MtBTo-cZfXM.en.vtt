this figure is pretty awesome-looking
you<00:03:04.440> can<00:03:04.710> move<00:03:04.950> eagles<00:03:05.550> arms<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.720> well<00:03:06.870> there

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
you can move eagles arms so well there

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.220 
you can move eagles arms so well there
but<00:03:07.470> just<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.280> shoulders<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.420> at<00:03:09.780> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
but just at the shoulders not at the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.010 
but just at the shoulders not at the
elbow<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.010> then<00:03:11.490> at<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> shoulder<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
elbow and then at the shoulder on the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.770 
elbow and then at the shoulder on the
other<00:03:13.110> arm<00:03:13.380> as<00:03:13.590> well<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:14.490> legs<00:03:14.760> will<00:03:15.000> move<00:03:15.030> but

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
other arm as well the legs will move but

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.870 
other arm as well the legs will move but
they<00:03:15.960> will<00:03:16.170> twist<00:03:16.410> not<00:03:17.130> move<00:03:17.340> forward<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
they will twist not move forward and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670 
they will twist not move forward and
backwards<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:18.960> can<00:03:19.200> basically<00:03:19.410> just

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
backwards so you can basically just

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.180 
backwards so you can basically just
rotate<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:21.150> foot<00:03:21.390> there<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:22.950> put

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
rotate the foot there so as you can put

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.240 
rotate the foot there so as you can put
him<00:03:23.370> in<00:03:23.640> a<00:03:23.880> position<00:03:24.480> where<00:03:24.960> he<00:03:25.650> will<00:03:25.800> stand<00:03:26.130> up

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250
