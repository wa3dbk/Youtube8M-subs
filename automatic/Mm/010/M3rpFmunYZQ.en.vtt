growing<00:00:04.680> Bartlett<00:00:05.279> pears<00:00:05.629> now<00:00:06.629> I've<00:00:07.020> got<00:00:07.290> a

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
growing Bartlett pears now I've got a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.140 
growing Bartlett pears now I've got a
Bartlett<00:00:07.710> pear<00:00:07.859> here<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.730> semi<00:00:09.090> dwarf

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
Bartlett pear here it's a semi dwarf

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.650 
Bartlett pear here it's a semi dwarf
tree<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:11.040> thing<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> have<00:00:11.519> noticed<00:00:11.700> over

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
tree and one thing I have noticed over

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.360 
tree and one thing I have noticed over
the<00:00:12.840> other<00:00:13.080> fruit<00:00:13.410> trees<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.860> I've<00:00:13.980> put<00:00:14.219> in

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
the other fruit trees that I've put in

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.430 
the other fruit trees that I've put in
is<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.870> fast<00:00:16.170> growing

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is that this is a really fast growing

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.730 
is that this is a really fast growing
tree<00:00:17.010> it's<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.940> semi<00:00:18.330> dwarf<00:00:18.390> so<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.109> probably

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
tree it's a semi dwarf so it's probably

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.330 
tree it's a semi dwarf so it's probably
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.490> 20<00:00:21.330> feet<00:00:21.539> tall<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:22.340> already

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
going to be 20 feet tall it's already

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.740 
going to be 20 feet tall it's already
about<00:00:23.580> half<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:26.330> depending<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> size

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
about half that so depending on the size

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
about half that so depending on the size
that<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.289> buy<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:29.099> was<00:00:29.279> probably<00:00:29.760> about

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that you buy this one was probably about

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
that you buy this one was probably about
five<00:00:30.480> feet<00:00:30.840> tall<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.560> within<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.949> year<00:00:31.980> it's

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
five feet tall and within a year it's

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.540 
five feet tall and within a year it's
almost<00:00:32.700> doubled<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.899> you'll<00:00:34.620> probably<00:00:34.950> get

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
almost doubled so you'll probably get

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.660 
almost doubled so you'll probably get
fruit<00:00:36.480> within<00:00:36.930> three<00:00:37.290> years<00:00:37.590> from<00:00:38.010> planting<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
fruit within three years from planting a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
fruit within three years from planting a
Bartlett<00:00:38.969> pear<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
Bartlett pear but you have to have a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.240 
Bartlett pear but you have to have a
pollen<00:00:41.309> Iser<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> find<00:00:44.010> another

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
pollen Iser and you have to find another

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
pollen Iser and you have to find another
pear<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> happens<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> bloom<00:00:46.200> at<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.410> same

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
pear that happens to bloom at the same

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.850 
pear that happens to bloom at the same
time<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.820> I've<00:00:48.090> put<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> sec<00:00:48.870> Opare<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.649> is

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
time so I've put in a sec Opare which is

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.939 
time so I've put in a sec Opare which is
a<00:00:49.920> good<00:00:50.460> pollen<00:00:50.940> Iser<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> Bartlett<00:00:52.710> pear

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
a good pollen Iser for the Bartlett pear

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.369 
a good pollen Iser for the Bartlett pear
so<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.850> always<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.690> two<00:00:54.989> different

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
so you always have to have two different

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.979 
so you always have to have two different
varieties<00:00:56.070> blooming<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> same<00:00:57.420> time<00:00:57.719> or

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
varieties blooming at the same time or

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
varieties blooming at the same time or
you<00:00:58.109> won't<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.559> pears<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.520> remember<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you won't get pears so remember that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.470 
you won't get pears so remember that
fact<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:01.079> important<00:01:02.090> outside<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
fact that's important outside of that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
fact that's important outside of that
they're<00:01:03.809> very<00:01:04.019> easy<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> grow<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.010> isn't<00:01:05.309> a

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
they're very easy to grow there isn't a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.550 
they're very easy to grow there isn't a
whole<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> do<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
whole lot that you have to do when you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.469 
whole lot that you have to do when you
first<00:01:07.830> plant<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.700> want<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.150> very

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
first plant it you want to be very

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.320 
first plant it you want to be very
conscientious<00:01:10.140> about<00:01:10.590> watering<00:01:11.060> you<00:01:12.060> don't

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
conscientious about watering you don't

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.300 
conscientious about watering you don't
want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> fertilize<00:01:12.810> things<00:01:13.530> too<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:14.070> when

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
want to fertilize things too much when

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.460 
want to fertilize things too much when
you<00:01:14.340> first<00:01:14.640> plant<00:01:15.000> them<00:01:15.270> but<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> fall<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
you first plant them but in the fall you

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.370 
you first plant them but in the fall you
want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> take<00:01:17.159> maybe<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.909> nice<00:01:18.210> average<00:01:18.750> dose

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
want to take maybe a nice average dose

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.850 
want to take maybe a nice average dose
of<00:01:19.590> fertilizer<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> fertilizer<00:01:20.430> tree<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
of fertilizer and fertilizer tree the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
of fertilizer and fertilizer tree the
pruning<00:01:23.430> usually<00:01:24.060> comes<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.780> later

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
pruning usually comes a little bit later

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
pruning usually comes a little bit later
and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> most<00:01:25.770> important<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> want<00:01:26.880> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and the most important thing you want to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840 
and the most important thing you want to
remember<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> growing<00:01:29.009> kind<00:01:29.610> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
remember this one is growing kind of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.810 
remember this one is growing kind of
almost<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.840> columnar<00:01:31.590> tree<00:01:32.310> which<00:01:32.579> it's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
almost like a columnar tree which it's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
almost like a columnar tree which it's
not<00:01:33.000> supposed<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.990> at<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.590> point<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
not supposed to so at some point when it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
not supposed to so at some point when it
branches<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> get<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> little

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
branches out it's going to get a little

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.600 
branches out it's going to get a little
bit<00:01:36.930> clustered<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> always<00:01:38.340> want<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
bit clustered so what you always want to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.690 
bit clustered so what you always want to
do<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.210> keep<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.350> center<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.040> pear<00:01:41.310> tree

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
do is keep the center of your pear tree

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.120 
do is keep the center of your pear tree
open<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> airy<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.290> Sun<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.920> down

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
open and airy so the Sun can get down

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.910 
open and airy so the Sun can get down
inside<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.000> airflow<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> will<00:01:46.740> that

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
inside and airflow so that will that

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.039 
inside and airflow so that will that
will<00:01:47.220> resist<00:01:47.549> disease<00:01:47.970> plus<00:01:48.450> you'll<00:01:48.840> have

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
will resist disease plus you'll have

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
will resist disease plus you'll have
more<00:01:49.259> fruit<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.009> each<00:01:50.310> part<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> tree

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
more fruit because each part of the tree

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
more fruit because each part of the tree
that's<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> bear<00:01:51.840> fruit<00:01:51.869> has<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> get

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
that's going to bear fruit has to get
