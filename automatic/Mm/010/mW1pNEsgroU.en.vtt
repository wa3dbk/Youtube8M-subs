here<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.180> gnarled<00:00:27.570> tree<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.260> posts

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
here with a gnarled tree and some posts

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
here with a gnarled tree and some posts
but<00:00:28.800> I'll<00:00:28.949> get<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.369> later<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.539> let's

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
but I'll get into that later so let's

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.580 
but I'll get into that later so let's
get<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> closer<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> here's<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
get a closer look at them and here's the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
get a closer look at them and here's the
little<00:00:34.739> close-up<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> him<00:00:35.730> he's<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> really

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little close-up of him he's a really

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.930 
little close-up of him he's a really
simple<00:00:37.020> figure<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> build<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.760> did

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
simple figure to build but I think I did

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.729 
simple figure to build but I think I did
a<00:00:38.969> great<00:00:39.210> job<00:00:39.540> representing<00:00:40.140> him<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
a great job representing him from the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
a great job representing him from the
games<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> actual<00:00:42.420> mythical<00:00:42.899> creature

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
games and the actual mythical creature

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.709 
games and the actual mythical creature
even<00:00:44.100> though<00:00:44.250> his<00:00:44.430> tie<00:00:44.700> should<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:45.239> red<00:00:45.450> but<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
even though his tie should be red but I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.420 
even though his tie should be red but I
can<00:00:45.960> easily<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.379> paint<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.860> red<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.309> I

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
can easily just paint that red if I

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.299 
can easily just paint that red if I
really<00:00:47.760> wanted<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> looks

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
really wanted to but I think it looks

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
really wanted to but I think it looks
pretty<00:00:50.460> cool<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.930> course<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.559> very

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pretty cool as of course it is very

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
pretty cool as of course it is very
simple<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> build<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.300> hard<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
simple to build and not hard to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
simple to build and not hard to
represent<00:00:55.199> them<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> need<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.039> suit

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
represent them all you need is a suit

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.420 
represent them all you need is a suit
black<00:00:57.120> pants<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.899> white<00:00:57.960> hands<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> white

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
black pants and white hands and a white

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
black pants and white hands and a white
head<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.449> basically<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.930> color<00:01:01.379> any

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
head you can basically just color any

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
head you can basically just color any
Lego<00:01:02.070> head<00:01:02.280> white<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> can't<00:01:03.030> find<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
Lego head white if you can't find the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
Lego head white if you can't find the
white<00:01:03.570> head<00:01:03.840> or<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.710> custom<00:01:05.159> paint<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.489> figure

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
white head or just custom paint a figure

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.270 
white head or just custom paint a figure
to<00:01:05.939> look<00:01:06.119> like<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.830> easy<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
to look like this but really easy to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.710 
to look like this but really easy to
build<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.180> did<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> great<00:01:09.600> job

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
build but I think they did a great job

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
build but I think they did a great job
on<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.200> I'm<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.860> pleased<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.250> how<00:01:11.400> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on it I'm really pleased to how it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
on it I'm really pleased to how it
turned<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:15.530> of<00:01:16.530> course<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
turned out and of course the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.830 
turned out and of course the
articulation<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> same<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.600> other

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
articulation is the same of any other

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260 
articulation is the same of any other
Lego<00:01:19.320> figure<00:01:19.770> nothing<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.520> didn't<00:01:20.820> change<00:01:21.060> any

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
Lego figure nothing I didn't change any

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
Lego figure nothing I didn't change any
of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> articulation<00:01:22.320> about<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> his<00:01:23.189> head

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
of the articulation about it his head

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
of the articulation about it his head
can<00:01:23.700> turn<00:01:23.750> 360<00:01:24.750> degrees<00:01:24.830> his<00:01:25.830> arms<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.430> move

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
can turn 360 degrees his arms can move

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
can turn 360 degrees his arms can move
up<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> down<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.570> its<00:01:27.720> hands<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.320> move

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
up and down and its hands can move

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.850 
up and down and its hands can move
around<00:01:28.920> 360<00:01:29.850> degrees<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.630> also<00:01:31.350> both<00:01:31.590> legs

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
around 360 degrees and also both legs

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.999 
around 360 degrees and also both legs
can<00:01:32.130> move<00:01:32.310> forwards<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:36.950> alright<00:01:37.950> so

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
can move forwards and back alright so

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.310 
can move forwards and back alright so
here's<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.579> little<00:01:38.729> base<00:01:39.119> scene<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.900> made<00:01:40.110> for

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
here's the little base scene I made for

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.030 
here's the little base scene I made for
my<00:01:40.439> Lego
