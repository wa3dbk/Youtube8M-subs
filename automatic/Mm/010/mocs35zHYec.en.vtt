00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.340
 hi educate today will be a 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.860
 grass lamp I made using 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.480
 just recyclable things those 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.869
 that when you buy 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.939
 violet and pet bottle 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.360
 the bottle pet people i just cut the 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.210
 from san that top of it 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.040
 and sharp to cut this part right here 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.360
 in that game he can leave where the 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.550
 people went to the cap 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.950
 is important too and was thus 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.980
 People are the color you want a 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.690
 vasinho people these vases something easy 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.540
 to find the ones we buy 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.550
 as well not usually violent and 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.560
 people wind up playing outside after me 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.320
 they just painted out painted color 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.370
 brown and in here I put 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.570
 flasher 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.710
 but if you do not want to use the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.910
 Flasher can use any 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 luminaires in excess that we think 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.870
 in the stores of 1 99 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.780
 There are some roundabouts that are super 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.880
 baratinha around $ 4 and is led 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.009
 so it does not heat because people 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.190
 It has to be a lamp that does not 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.290
 warm up because this here is plastic, right? 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 so there is no danger, it has to be 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.229
 something is led but it is usually 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.390
 you find any place to 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.130
 do the polka dots here that are 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.680
 cherries in this one I used durepoxi 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.260
 in this other one I used styrofoam balls 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.080
 so this if you have balls of 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.890
 code or the perfume bottle or 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.530
 cream that is rounded also serves 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.760
 There you go, whatever you find in your house. 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.790
 You can do it. 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.950
 so people get really cool the format 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.810
 of the media is depending on the pet bottle that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.990
 you use you have a little format 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.720
 different in the upper part then these 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.710
 I only did several dinho rounds of 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.869
 guarana 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.570
 usually all of guaraná have this 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.820
 Round shape on the top and 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.189
 coca cola has this finer part 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.590
 that up there is going according to the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.840
 Your taste can do with anyone. 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.360
 just so important that it's a bottle 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.980
 pet two liters because such fits 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.170
 Right here in the pot 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.250
 OK 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.680
 I had this idea of ​​doing this 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 lamp that I stayed because I 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.170
 I got none from my husband on 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.819
 super beautiful mothers and I recorded a video and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.870
 one person asked me if it was me 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.220
 that I did 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.830
 This one I won her from Mother's Day 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.780
 And she's very beautiful, I do not know where my 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.120
 husband bought it and gave it to me 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.220
 but then ask me if it was me 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.310
 So people I did not do that. 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.370
 but there through it I had the idea of 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.989
 to do the one that practically comes out so I 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.830
 I did not like anything to do all the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.069
 things 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.709
 I was here at home so people are 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.590
 so you and I used craft ink 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.390
 to paint is the carnival asks more if 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.430
 Do not you have the ink of 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.489
 Crafts can paint with enamel 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.480
 Enamel has a very nice color that stays 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.180
 nice too 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.430
 but this craft paint compensates 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.299
 because it's very cheap and you think 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.680
 anywhere is around 2550 one 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.900
 most cute little pot 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.560
 ok if you want to learn only the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.989
 video to start we'll need 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.150
 a sawdust knife to warm her up 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.190
 stove to cut off that part of the 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.630
 bottle where we put the lid and 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.630
 will be a little hole 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.870
 We'll book while I 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.380
 I'll paint the vases so on its 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.750
 choose the color can be any color 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.450
 and while it dries I go decorating the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.209
 parts of the pet bottle that will be the 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.690
 our lamp or the cup cake 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:56.280
 so I caught a drop of coca cola and 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:58.350
 I will paint her pink and if you 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.980
 you want to make some nice 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:05.549
 To do this in this one I just tried and 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.650
 In this other one I painted her white and 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.609
 I made some embellishments on top as if it were 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.170
 a frosting 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:16.169
 There I painted in pink and painted 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.060
 then I took a bic pen and I go 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.850
 use this pen with a scorer 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.789
 I was making the balls in black to be 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.770
 the granules and became super cute 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:30.370
 now just paste the cherry 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.440
 and here I am passing the flashing 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.479
 he stays there inside the little pot 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.830
 empty it is already stuck underneath then 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.770
 it was very easy 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.569
 The result was this is very easy to 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.169
 I did and I did not like anything to do. 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.169
 this lamp 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.519
 So these are people if you liked 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.009
 video does not forget giving a couple of 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:55.110
 share and if you have any 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.789
 idea any suggestions to make the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.830
 next video just write here in 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.830
