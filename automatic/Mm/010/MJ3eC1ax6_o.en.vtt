00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.000
 and the guy from youtube is told this 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:09.230
 video will try a very change 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.110
 drastic that we are going to do in this 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.670
 team this time will accompany me 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.849
 churchill is how they are seeing it in the 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.190
 paris and then they will explain a 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.710
 little about the video 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.020
 and how many will know this reflection that 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.120
 It is a team that is only dedicated to 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.580
 the competitive what is owed and 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.000
 tournaments until lance we have wanted milestone 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.000
 developing 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.300
 but for certain little things 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.560
 inconveniences that have happened in addition to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.370
 that one of the goals that was always 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.860
 do is the best 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.540
 competitive of mexico and for many this 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.790
 mind is already fulfilled 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.970
 then we have looked for new options 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.410
 to expand and then have a 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.350
 new respect of soda to extend us 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
 and make them bigger so to speak and 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.860
 once you make the idea that came from 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.850
 expand the youtube climate this wants 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.980
 saying this does not mean that no 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.739
 let's continue in the competitive that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.280
 it's something that we 're not going to stop doing and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.320
 we hope not to get into YouTube you do not download 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.400
 our level or something like that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.310
 this but the idea is in 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.480
 put people towards players editors and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.760
 all those things that the truth does not 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.400
 we are also informed yet 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.720
 Well, we'll do it 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:26.210
 and you can go recruiting people who 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.390
 highlight moves the center makes 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.340
 exact 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.760
 At the moment we can not ask for quality 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:38.950
 obviously it's time to be very 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.479
 but very difficult to excel on youtube 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.479
 because we have already said the good teams 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 but then we plan to start 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.710
 put in this to see how is good 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.190
 as how can they send then they are 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.399
 players bears 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:05.380
 as they say they are 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:09.129
 editing private message and when 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 He consumed this fish send me his clips and 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:18.790
 they are publishers then their plays 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.239
 edited of portfolio all your work 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.239
 they have done 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.239
 what else do we talk about 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.799
 sponsors another and there is a white team 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.900
 who is looking for good 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.900
 sponsors because this year 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.260
 there we will pass the data to see if 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.240
 we can be 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.880
 in the end 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.680
 and in fact that is another one of ours 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.140
 next tasks or our next ones 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.230
 goals that is this 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.360
 now as you many know we are 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.430
 sponsored by area 51 with which 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.959
 we went to the tornado of mexico but no longer 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.300
 we have had so much contact with them and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.160
 they want to look for another senator factor for 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.040
 I want to see if it can be a little more 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.390
 big or a company something like that is for 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 continue to expand and grow 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.250
 well also tomorrow we are going to good 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.890
 I'm going to take my channel out a video for 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.330
 recruit players to the new ex boss 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.850
 editor is all that 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.580
 but the video of the requirements is coming 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.520
 that we are going to ask for not to be 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.200
 example the players will not be 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.690
 have the strength of hd quality because 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.730
 can 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.730
 the slobber does not even have 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.450
 and there may also be and for the moment 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.520
 the idea of ​​a change is being analyzed 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.410
 from gamertag we are still not sure 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.000
 of that or anything I hope so we have 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.650
 seen that most, but all 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.540
 YouTube teams, they have there as 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.100
 that is located and goal that the different and 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.020
 it's probably something that we do more 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.459
 ahead or depending on the 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.020
 suggestions from the people who are the kily 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.870
 myth develops and that are willing 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.209
 Well, that would be fine too, that was all 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.120
 We 're not going to say one last thing 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.770
 we will be creating the youtube channel 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.560
 the team is going to be in the description by 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.209
 If you want to go subscribe 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.000
 we still do not know we're going to go up there 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.480
 I suppose they are going to be the cons of 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.419
 some floors and it's not that most 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.040
 among other things commented because it produces 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.720
 have liked the video and see you in the 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.440
 next twitt bike 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.440
 all right
