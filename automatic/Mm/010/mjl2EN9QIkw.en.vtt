00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.570 
it out from using the microphone so one
of<00:03:32.320> these<00:03:32.410> cables<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:32.860> bill<00:03:33.040> to<00:03:33.130> mark<00:03:33.310> under

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
of these cables is a bill to mark under

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.539 
of these cables is a bill to mark under
here<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:35.799> can<00:03:35.920> control<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.430> audio

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
here and you can control the audio

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.380 
here and you can control the audio
playback<00:03:36.940> forward<00:03:37.720> back<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.320> volume

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
playback forward back and the volume

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
playback forward back and the volume
really<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.690> will<00:03:40.900> work<00:03:40.930> with<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.380> iphone

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
really so that will work with the iphone

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.479 
really so that will work with the iphone
all<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.310> iphones<00:03:42.810> that<00:03:43.810> allow<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.430> as

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489
