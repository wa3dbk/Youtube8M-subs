a new episode of ahsoka and Barris holy

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.410 
a new episode of ahsoka and Barris holy
and<00:02:03.840> she's<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> cool<00:02:04.710> Jedi<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.880> they

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
and she's a cool Jedi so I think they

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479 
and she's a cool Jedi so I think they
cool<00:02:06.630> figure<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.170> don't<00:02:07.829> know<00:02:07.920> who<00:02:08.099> else<00:02:08.250> will

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
cool figure I don't know who else will

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.430 
cool figure I don't know who else will
be<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.879> set<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.660> assuming<00:02:09.929> some

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
be in the set but I'm assuming some

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.950 
be in the set but I'm assuming some
clones<00:02:10.709> maybe<00:02:11.160> commander

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
clones maybe commander

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.520 
clones maybe commander
I<00:02:11.990> maybe<00:02:12.670> maybe<00:02:13.670> not<00:02:14.410> assuming<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.470> course

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
I maybe maybe not assuming of course

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.650 
I maybe maybe not assuming of course
closed<00:02:16.100> because<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> cultural<00:02:17.090> tanks<00:02:17.360> big

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
closed because the cultural tanks big

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.130 
closed because the cultural tanks big
and<00:02:18.500> also<00:02:19.220> i<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.910> know<00:02:20.210> they've<00:02:20.420> changed<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and also i do know they've changed the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.440 
and also i do know they've changed the
wheels<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.670> wheels<00:02:22.850> are<00:02:23.090> more<00:02:23.270> accurate

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
wheels so the wheels are more accurate

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
wheels so the wheels are more accurate
they<00:02:23.900> aren't<00:02:24.140> those<00:02:24.290> older<00:02:24.800> plastic<00:02:25.640> leg<00:02:25.820> of

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
they aren't those older plastic leg of

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.570 
they aren't those older plastic leg of
wheels<00:02:26.120> are<00:02:26.330> not<00:02:26.600> other<00:02:26.960> one<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:28.280> that's<00:02:28.460> cool

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
wheels are not other one so that's cool

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.440 
wheels are not other one so that's cool
and<00:02:30.940> also<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.270> know<00:02:32.590> Palpatine<00:02:33.590> shuttle<00:02:34.450> it's

Skywalker<00:02:56.930> when<00:02:57.710> he's<00:02:57.860> burnt<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.610> damaged

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
Skywalker when he's burnt and damaged

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.930 
Skywalker when he's burnt and damaged
you<00:03:00.200> know<00:03:00.320> cuz<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.680> that's<00:03:01.100> what<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.730> scene

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
you know cuz is that's what the scene

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.820 
you know cuz is that's what the scene
was<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.390> don't<00:03:02.900> know<00:03:02.960> what<00:03:03.140> else<00:03:03.320> will<00:03:03.500> be<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.710> it

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
was I don't know what else will be in it

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.380 
was I don't know what else will be in it
but<00:03:03.980> probably<00:03:04.280> some<00:03:04.430> shock<00:03:04.670> troopers<00:03:05.150> because

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
but probably some shock troopers because

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.720 
but probably some shock troopers because
they<00:03:05.510> were<00:03:05.660> also<00:03:05.840> in<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.230> scene<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.460> that's<00:03:07.610> a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
they were also in that scene so that's a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.890 
they were also in that scene so that's a
cool<00:03:07.880> set<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:09.190> also<00:03:10.450> there's<00:03:11.450> only<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.720> new

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
cool set and also there's only a new

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.650 
cool set and also there's only a new
slave<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.560> which<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.070> probably<00:03:13.580> know<00:03:13.820> but

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
slave one which you probably know but

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.740 
slave one which you probably know but
I'm<00:03:14.780> not<00:03:14.810> sure<00:03:15.050> about<00:03:15.860> what<00:03:16.580> exactly<00:03:17.240> have

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
I'm not sure about what exactly have

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.020 
I'm not sure about what exactly have
some<00:03:17.960> speculations<00:03:18.530> but<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.190> heard<00:03:19.700> someone

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
some speculations but I heard someone

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.240 
some speculations but I heard someone
say<00:03:20.300> on<00:03:20.630> YouTube<00:03:21.410> that's<00:03:21.650> going<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:21.890> be<00:03:21.950> Boba

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
say on YouTube that's going to be Boba

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.720 
say on YouTube that's going to be Boba
Fett<00:03:22.490> slave<00:03:22.880> one<00:03:23.620> which<00:03:24.620> actually<00:03:25.100> makes<00:03:25.460> so

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
Fett slave one which actually makes so

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.430 
Fett slave one which actually makes so
much<00:03:25.790> make<00:03:26.120> could<00:03:26.420> make<00:03:26.600> sense<00:03:26.870> but<00:03:27.140> I<00:03:27.200> would

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
much make could make sense but I would

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.930 
much make could make sense but I would
rather<00:03:27.560> have<00:03:27.800> Jango<00:03:28.190> Fett<00:03:28.430> because<00:03:28.820> they

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
rather have Jango Fett because they

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.910 
rather have Jango Fett because they
haven't<00:03:29.090> remade<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.750> one<00:03:29.900> but<00:03:30.680> if<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:30.890> is

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
haven't remade that one but if it is

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.880 
haven't remade that one but if it is
Boba<00:03:31.370> Fett's<00:03:31.640> I'm<00:03:32.510> i<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:33.170> a<00:03:33.200> specular<00:03:33.740> I'm

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
Boba Fett's I'm i have a specular I'm

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.070 
Boba Fett's I'm i have a specular I'm
speculating<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.910> going<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> be<00:03:35.270> cold

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
speculating that it's going to be cold

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.320 
speculating that it's going to be cold
war-style<00:03:36.400> because<00:03:37.400> we<00:03:37.580> saw<00:03:37.730> in<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.880> preview

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
war-style because we saw in the preview

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.780 
war-style because we saw in the preview
for<00:03:38.360> clone<00:03:38.810> wars<00:03:39.050> season<00:03:39.110> two<00:03:39.620> when<00:03:40.460> they<00:03:40.610> did

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
for clone wars season two when they did

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.570 
for clone wars season two when they did
the<00:03:40.910> previews<00:03:41.360> we<00:03:41.690> saw<00:03:41.840> Mandalorians<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.490> I'm

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
the previews we saw Mandalorians so I'm

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.010 
the previews we saw Mandalorians so I'm
guessing<00:03:43.760> maybe<00:03:44.000> we'll<00:03:44.300> get<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.570> see<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> young

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
guessing maybe we'll get to see a young

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.340 
guessing maybe we'll get to see a young
Boba<00:03:45.500> Fett<00:03:45.710> and<00:03:46.660> he's<00:03:47.660> going<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:47.900> appear<00:03:48.170> later

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
Boba Fett and he's going to appear later

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.710 
Boba Fett and he's going to appear later
in<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.620> season<00:03:48.830> maybe<00:03:49.160> I'm<00:03:50.030> just<00:03:50.330> just

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
in the season maybe I'm just just

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.570 
in the season maybe I'm just just
guessing<00:03:51.530> I'll<00:03:51.710> this<00:03:52.040> I<00:03:52.160> think<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.490> I<00:03:52.550> think

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
guessing I'll this I think and I think

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.280 
guessing I'll this I think and I think
it<00:03:52.910> would<00:03:53.030> make<00:03:53.210> sense<00:03:53.240> that<00:03:53.750> we<00:03:54.290> were<00:03:54.530> cool

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
it would make sense that we were cool

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.390 
it would make sense that we were cool
yep<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.580> also<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:59.920> heard<00:04:00.920> there's<00:04:01.130> gonna<00:04:01.250> be<00:04:01.370> a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
yep and also I heard there's gonna be a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.480 
yep and also I heard there's gonna be a
set<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:02.180> CAD<00:04:02.450> Bane<00:04:02.780> not<00:04:03.710> much<00:04:03.950> known<00:04:04.460> about

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
set with CAD Bane not much known about

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.480 
set with CAD Bane not much known about
this<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:05.170> think<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.470> if<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.800> set<00:04:07.070> comes<00:04:07.250> out

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
this I think that if this set comes out

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.700 
this I think that if this set comes out
will<00:04:07.670> be<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.600> know<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:08.960> Count<00:04:09.350> Dooku

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
will be like you know what Count Dooku

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.460 
will be like you know what Count Dooku
solo<00:04:10.010> sailor<00:04:10.430> came<00:04:10.640> out<00:04:10.850> not<00:04:11.600> much<00:04:11.780> no<00:04:12.080> it'll

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
solo sailor came out not much no it'll

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.310 
solo sailor came out not much no it'll
just<00:04:12.500> kind<00:04:12.800> of<00:04:12.950> like<00:04:13.100> came<00:04:13.340> out<00:04:13.600> like<00:04:14.600> this<00:04:15.110> is

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
just kind of like came out like this is

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.229 
just kind of like came out like this is
a<00:04:15.350> surprise<00:04:15.620> for<00:04:15.890> everyone<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.000> think<00:04:17.090> that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
a surprise for everyone so I think that

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.129 
a surprise for everyone so I think that
might<00:04:17.540> be

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
might be

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.129 
might be
cat<00:04:18.349> being<00:04:18.620> something<00:04:19.009> similar<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.549> that<00:04:20.139> we

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
cat being something similar to that we

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.839 
cat being something similar to that we
just<00:04:21.349> don't<00:04:21.469> know<00:04:21.680> much<00:04:22.039> about<00:04:22.069> it<00:04:22.340> until<00:04:22.610> it
