because Kathryn was just like she it was

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.889 
because Kathryn was just like she it was
so<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.439> emotion<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> real<00:02:03.239> emotion<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so much emotion and real emotion it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.490 
wasn't like put on it wasn't like it was
real<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> felt<00:02:06.539> like<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> experienced<00:02:07.409> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
real I felt like you experienced that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.620 
real I felt like you experienced that
deeply<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.729> wanted<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> same<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.599> you

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
deeply and I wanted the same from you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.350 
deeply and I wanted the same from you
because<00:02:10.079> you're<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.500> genius<00:02:10.829> so<00:02:11.670> just<00:02:12.180> be

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
because you're so genius so just be

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.509

aware<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.780> mm-hmm

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
aware of that mm-hmm

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.660 
aware of that mm-hmm
I<00:02:14.870> think<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.920> are<00:02:17.010> gonna<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.549> all

I think that you are gonna see it all

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.000 
I think that you are gonna see it all
and<00:02:17.819> play<00:02:17.970> back<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:19.560> that'll<00:02:19.920> be

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and play back I think that that'll be

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.349 
and play back I think that that'll be
the<00:02:20.129> greatest<00:02:20.160> thing<00:02:20.579> that<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:21.000> can<00:02:21.180> do

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
the greatest thing that you can do

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.280 
the greatest thing that you can do
because<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.840> are<00:02:23.959> superhuman

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
