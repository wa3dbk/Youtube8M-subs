00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.640
 We are interested in our culture here 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.760
 not even tourists think and so 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.210
 Just live on top of his house why 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:42.510
 Could not do it that way 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:45.379
 the nicest thing also find again what 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.379
 you say to German 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.489
 But this is not a break again 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 You're welcome 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:08.030
 that is so well in scene principle, good 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:23.079
 thinking they are good principle so super 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:33.409
 must stop his friends 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:34.599
 he also has to do something with us up here 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.159
 on the roof 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:40.399
 Chile was always a bit if 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.849
 I cook you know I'm right right 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.670
 really slowed down age on everyone what 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.560
 I'm always in Germany 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 yet in ibiza here is oversized 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.379
 cool I do not want to leave 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.179
 maybe I'll be back in the 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.459
 second week of julia I was white 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:00.739
 just not by heart when I am 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.739
 come back but I'm coming back to 

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:05.479
 splash age the mus must 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.000
 every case since years at the start 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.099
 even if it's not always what I am 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 just as I like to have it as well 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.400
 i like to have artista 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.620
 it always stays that way a bit 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.269
 specially 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.269
 I would definitely like to 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.060
 you know what festivals are like this 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.659
 summer where does one go what can you get in 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.340
 pull 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.580
 I've always used and hip hop 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.980
 open then given this thing in 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.140
 bonn this i think no more peaks 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.599
 there was this incident you 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.370
 you know, there are no longer funds 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.220
 that again this coupon thing you know 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.250
 yes is definitely in such a thing 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.379
 That's exactly when you have a roof 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.569
 fly the planes is further ahead 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.620
 In any case, the airport I have 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.230
 always a little something 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.000
 demolished a few contacts made 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
 you have to be cool on the go 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.379
 and blue and always pretend that I am 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.390
 I had to pretend that I am 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.940
 It's not that on festivals 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.159
 always little gangsta rap is supported 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.170
 or cream or say the streets rap 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.269
 and it's not that unfair 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.319
 because when i go to the splash 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:17.390
 example, there is no farid bang and 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.920
 Colleagues of the most successful when I am 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.410
 the most successful album made this way 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.160
 have and they have indeed fans it is 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:29.000
 wax wise warrant or what these 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.769
 big street representatives why are 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.629
 they are not there, why are they? 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.030
 it's too little at all is it that way 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.669
 the people think a street at the start 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.609
 then there's a direct brawl 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.319
 because that is so marine indeed the 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.879
 meat on the way okay that is now 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.220
 not the oversized streets 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.379
 human but that was there I have me 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.540
 already seen twice and two 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.970
 years in a row once a small tent 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.889
 smaller tent was also huge and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.129
 once on the giant stage so on 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.079
 the biggest and because I was at the start 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.000
 Personally , I will like more 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.849
 I'm so excited, I want to know 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.620
 not if that is the inventory so must 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:12.109
 yes without them, nothing works without a stage 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.669
 but then so marsimoto so the richest 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.920
 at the same time he makes it like this 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.570
 action jan delay and all that is required 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.880
 but then I also want to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.310
 See the other side too 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.720
 that one has that I do not know mine 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.190
 opinion too one-sided for mine 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.830
 taste that's why write me 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.080
 comments like that one for you 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.210
 That's how you could imagine it 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.900
 so brussel so the benefits of 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.020
 earlier that one says yes yes a street 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:47.370

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 transition was there automatic was there and it 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.320

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.030
