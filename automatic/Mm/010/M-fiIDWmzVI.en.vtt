00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.690 

do<00:00:14.260> a<00:00:14.290> quick<00:00:14.469> review<00:00:14.679> of<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.730> 116<00:00:16.570> slashes

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
do a quick review of the 116 slashes

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.190 
do a quick review of the 116 slashes
kids<00:00:18.700> been<00:00:18.910> bashing<00:00:19.150> them<00:00:19.450> for<00:00:19.660> a<00:00:19.720> few<00:00:19.900> months

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
kids been bashing them for a few months

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.679 
kids been bashing them for a few months
now<00:00:20.610> both<00:00:21.610> of<00:00:21.640> them<00:00:21.910> seem<00:00:22.180> to<00:00:22.210> break<00:00:22.450> down

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
now both of them seem to break down

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.190 
now both of them seem to break down
almost<00:00:22.990> exactly<00:00:23.800> at<00:00:24.009> the<00:00:24.160> same<00:00:24.310> time<00:00:24.640> and

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
almost exactly at the same time and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.050 
almost exactly at the same time and
seems<00:00:26.200> to<00:00:26.320> be<00:00:26.529> both<00:00:27.099> of<00:00:27.310> them<00:00:27.430> have<00:00:27.640> several

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
seems to be both of them have several

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.269 
seems to be both of them have several
problems<00:00:28.329> so<00:00:29.200> both<00:00:29.559> of<00:00:29.590> them<00:00:29.800> will<00:00:29.980> steer

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:30.279 
problems so both of them will steer

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.330 
problems so both of them will steer
really<00:00:30.880> good<00:00:31.029> one<00:00:31.239> way<00:00:31.649> will<00:00:32.649> not<00:00:32.680> steer<00:00:33.190> the

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
really good one way will not steer the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.760 
really good one way will not steer the
other<00:00:33.489> way<00:00:33.670> it'll<00:00:34.059> go<00:00:34.270> back<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.690> Center<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.290> it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
other way it'll go back to Center and it

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.470 
other way it'll go back to Center and it
just<00:00:35.980> grinds<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:36.940> can<00:00:37.059> just<00:00:37.239> hear<00:00:37.420> it

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
just grinds and you can just hear it

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.690 
just grinds and you can just hear it
going<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:37.989> going<00:00:38.260> going<00:00:38.500> not<00:00:39.100> actually<00:00:39.430> doing

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
going and going going not actually doing

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.889 
going and going going not actually doing
anything<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:41.050> one<00:00:41.260> here<00:00:41.500> also<00:00:41.739> back<00:00:42.340> tire

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
anything this one here also back tire

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.319 
anything this one here also back tire
doesn't<00:00:43.899> spend<00:00:44.500> rest<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.399> spin<00:00:45.699> this<00:00:46.149> one

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:46.329 
doesn't spend rest and spin this one

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.900 
doesn't spend rest and spin this one
doesn't<00:00:46.749> so<00:00:47.530> we're<00:00:48.010> gonna<00:00:48.100> do<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.489> quick<00:00:48.730> video

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
doesn't so we're gonna do a quick video

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.349 
doesn't so we're gonna do a quick video
and<00:00:49.420> take<00:00:50.109> a<00:00:50.140> peek<00:00:50.379> inside<00:00:50.909> see<00:00:51.909> what's<00:00:52.120> wrong

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
and take a peek inside see what's wrong

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.939 
and take a peek inside see what's wrong
with<00:00:52.420> it<00:00:54.510> well<00:00:55.510> taking<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.320> back<00:00:56.469> wheel<00:00:56.710> off

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
with it well taking the back wheel off

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.689 
with it well taking the back wheel off
we<00:00:57.519> might<00:00:57.819> have<00:00:57.969> found<00:00:58.120> the<00:00:58.239> culprit<00:00:59.489> good<00:01:00.489> old

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
we might have found the culprit good old

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.009 
we might have found the culprit good old
fishing<00:01:01.120> line<00:01:01.480> does<00:01:02.319> it<00:01:02.499> every<00:01:02.679> time<00:01:04.019> see

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
fishing line does it every time see

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.580 
fishing line does it every time see
didn't<00:01:05.500> actually<00:01:05.620> break<00:01:05.890> anything<00:01:07.350> well<00:01:08.350> as

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
didn't actually break anything well as

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.890 
didn't actually break anything well as
in<00:01:08.800> servos<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.790> sounds<00:01:10.120> like<00:01:10.270> it's<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.570> servo

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
in servos it sounds like it's a servo

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.380 
in servos it sounds like it's a servo
problem<00:01:11.260> all<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.470> way<00:01:11.590> around<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.250> just<00:01:13.000> a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
problem all the way around so just a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.200 
problem all the way around so just a
heads<00:01:13.570> up<00:01:13.780> ya<00:01:14.050> might<00:01:14.320> want<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.650> either<00:01:15.210> go

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
heads up ya might want to either go

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.770 
heads up ya might want to either go
right<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.659> dual<00:01:16.930> servo<00:01:17.530> or<00:01:18.329> maybe<00:01:19.329> upgrade

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
right to a dual servo or maybe upgrade

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.100 
right to a dual servo or maybe upgrade
it<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.960> two<00:01:20.200> different<00:01:20.409> servos<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:22.869> probably

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
it to two different servos I'm probably

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.420 
it to two different servos I'm probably
just<00:01:23.259> gonna<00:01:23.409> replace<00:01:23.770> them<00:01:23.950> with<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.189> same

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
just gonna replace them with the same

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.929 
just gonna replace them with the same
but<00:01:25.270> I'll<00:01:25.509> get<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:25.719> that<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:27.009> maybe<00:01:27.280> one<00:01:27.549> servo

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
but I'll get to that way maybe one servo

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.010 
but I'll get to that way maybe one servo
doesn't<00:01:28.240> have<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.479> do<00:01:28.630> so<00:01:28.840> much<00:01:28.990> work<00:01:29.289> I<00:01:31.020> think

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
doesn't have to do so much work I think

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.249 
doesn't have to do so much work I think
maybe<00:01:32.259> that's<00:01:32.469> the<00:01:32.740> problem<00:01:32.860> no<00:01:33.520> idea<00:01:34.259> maybe

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
maybe that's the problem no idea maybe

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.289 
maybe that's the problem no idea maybe
you<00:01:35.439> can<00:01:35.530> comment<00:01:35.770> rate<00:01:36.159> subscribe<00:01:36.270> let<00:01:37.270> me

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
you can comment rate subscribe let me

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.830 
you can comment rate subscribe let me
know<00:01:37.420> what<00:01:37.719> you<00:01:37.840> think<00:01:38.049> so<00:01:39.180> far<00:01:40.180> these<00:01:40.570> things

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
know what you think so far these things

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.219 
know what you think so far these things
are<00:01:41.079> full<00:01:41.649> stock<00:01:42.100> have<00:01:42.850> not<00:01:43.270> done<00:01:43.539> anything<00:01:43.990> to

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
are full stock have not done anything to

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.270 
are full stock have not done anything to
them<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.259> we're<00:01:47.530> just<00:01:47.560> gonna<00:01:47.829> take<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.130> quick

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
them so we're just gonna take a quick

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.090 
them so we're just gonna take a quick
peek<00:01:48.579> inside<00:01:48.939> the<00:01:49.180> servo<00:01:49.899> see<00:01:50.829> what<00:01:51.009> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
peek inside the servo see what the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.880 
peek inside the servo see what the
problem<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.549> so<00:01:52.049> poor<00:01:53.049> little<00:01:53.380> screws<00:01:53.649> on<00:01:53.799> the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
problem is so poor little screws on the

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.389 
problem is so poor little screws on the
bottom

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
bottom

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.999 
bottom
boom<00:01:54.640> boom<00:01:54.820> boom<00:01:55.090> pop<00:01:55.659> them<00:01:55.869> out<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.740> then

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
boom boom boom pop them out and then

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.130 
boom boom boom pop them out and then
crack<00:01:57.280> it<00:01:57.460> open<00:02:00.210> don't<00:02:01.210> think<00:02:01.659> that's<00:02:01.929> very

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
crack it open don't think that's very

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.730 
crack it open don't think that's very
helpful<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.939> we're<00:02:04.479> on<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.750> motor<00:02:04.960> side<00:02:05.289> we

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
helpful and we're on the motor side we

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.220 
helpful and we're on the motor side we
gotta<00:02:05.920> open<00:02:06.159> up<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:06.729> other<00:02:06.820> end<00:02:06.969> oh<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:10.230> check

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
gotta open up the other end oh and check

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.559 
gotta open up the other end oh and check
out<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> gearing

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.670 

yep<00:02:17.160> she's<00:02:18.160> oh<00:02:18.400> my<00:02:18.610> god<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:20.319> second<00:02:20.590> let

yep she's oh my god okay one second let

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.930 
yep she's oh my god okay one second let
me<00:02:20.740> see<00:02:20.860> if<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.130> get<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.459> turn<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
me see if I can get it to turn so you

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.540 
me see if I can get it to turn so you
can<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.890> or<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.920> can<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.220> pull<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.400> apart

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
can see that or I can just pull it apart

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:35.970 
can see that or I can just pull it apart
even<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:29.470> toast<00:02:34.350> sadly<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.709> gears

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
even it's toast sadly like the gears

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:45.750 
even it's toast sadly like the gears
have<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.459> stripped<00:02:36.850> on<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.360> side

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.240 

yeah<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:48.560> tiny<00:02:48.799> one
