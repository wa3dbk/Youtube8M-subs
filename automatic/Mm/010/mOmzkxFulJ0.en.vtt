three of our field right now but I felt

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.990 
three of our field right now but I felt
that<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:13.980> appropriate<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.519> have<00:00:14.610> its<00:00:14.910> own

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
that it was appropriate to have its own

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.550 
that it was appropriate to have its own

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
in your shadow point general it is

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.290 
in your shadow point general it is
located<00:00:21.119> southwest<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.740> new<00:00:23.400> ShadowClan<00:00:23.789> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
located southwest of new ShadowClan so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.050 
located southwest of new ShadowClan so
on<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:25.019> island<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.710> go<00:00:25.890> south<00:00:26.189> then<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> turn

center<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.790> come<00:01:12.000> closer<00:01:12.439> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.560> see

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
center and if we come closer you can see

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.969 
center and if we come closer you can see
these<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> signs<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.979> that

Center sorry research center and cancer

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.789 
Center sorry research center and cancer
center<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.360> our<00:01:39.570> elevators<00:01:40.110> using

center so these are our elevators using
a<00:01:40.860> plug-in<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.509> go<00:01:42.780> from<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.140> floor<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
a plug-in you can go from one floor to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:54.580 
a plug-in you can go from one floor to
the<00:01:43.649> next

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.560 

this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.830> clinic<00:01:56.159> floor<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.760> research

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this is the clinic floor or a research

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.609 
this is the clinic floor or a research
floor<00:01:58.400> if<00:01:59.400> we<00:01:59.520> going<00:01:59.880> through<00:02:00.060> this<00:02:00.180> door<00:02:00.619> see

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
floor if we going through this door see

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.170 
floor if we going through this door see
all<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.979> separate<00:02:02.340> labs<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.210> hoods

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
all the separate labs the hoods

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.750 
all the separate labs the hoods
everything<00:02:10.190> structures<00:02:11.190> all<00:02:11.400> around<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
everything structures all around the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.620 
everything structures all around the
building<00:02:13.850> that's<00:02:14.850> pretty<00:02:14.970> much<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.209> for<00:02:15.330> that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
building that's pretty much it for that

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.140 
building that's pretty much it for that
research<00:02:16.670> facility<00:02:17.750> if<00:02:18.750> we<00:02:18.930> go<00:02:19.050> down<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
research facility if we go down to the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.830 
research facility if we go down to the
basement<00:02:22.820> there's<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.910> tunnel<00:02:24.209> system<00:02:24.660> that

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
basement there's a tunnel system that

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.180 
basement there's a tunnel system that
connects<00:02:25.170> all<00:02:25.350> three<00:02:25.590> buildings<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.100> each

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
connects all three buildings to each

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490 
connects all three buildings to each
other<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.630> where<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.110> go<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> the

floors underground and then everything

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.420 
floors underground and then everything
above<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.900> clinic<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.890> again<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.310> has
