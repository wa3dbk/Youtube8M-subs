just<00:00:28.230> by<00:00:28.380> adding<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.710> few<00:00:29.010> little<00:00:29.310> marks<00:00:29.820> or

just by adding a few little marks or

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.190 
just by adding a few little marks or
words<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.309> further<00:00:32.309> refine<00:00:32.489> our<00:00:32.700> results<00:00:33.200> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
words to further refine our results so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.060 
words to further refine our results so
one<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> those<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:36.230> using<00:00:37.230> quotation<00:00:37.800> marks

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of Nazareth I can type it in and you can

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.610 
of Nazareth I can type it in and you can
see<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> little<00:00:42.809> over<00:00:43.230> three<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
see there's a little over three and a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.220 
see there's a little over three and a
half<00:00:43.649> million<00:00:44.010> search<00:00:44.940> results<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.960> i<00:00:46.050> add

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
half million search results if i add

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.639 
half million search results if i add
quotation<00:00:46.770> marks<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.340> ends<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:48.649> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
quotation marks and then two ends of the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.439 
quotation marks and then two ends of the
search<00:00:49.860> entry<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> number

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
search entry you can see the number

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
search entry you can see the number
decreases<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.350> bit<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.940> these<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.000> only

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
decreases a little bit so these are only

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
decreases a little bit so these are only
web<00:00:54.449> pages<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.260> words<00:00:55.440> jesus<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.100> a

web pages that have the words jesus of a
Nazareth<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.570> order<00:00:58.039> specifically<00:00:59.120> so

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
Nazareth in that order specifically so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
Nazareth in that order specifically so
that's<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> first<00:01:00.449> step<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> second<00:01:01.140> thing

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that's the first step the second thing

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's the first step the second thing
is<00:01:01.440> let's<00:01:01.859> say<00:01:01.949> I'm<00:01:02.309> making<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> search<00:01:03.180> but

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
is let's say I'm making this search but

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
is let's say I'm making this search but
I'm<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.690> interested<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> movie

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I'm not really interested in the movie

you can see the movie is very well

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.530 
you can see the movie is very well
represented<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.740> results<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.330> use

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
represented in the results if I just use

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.710 
represented in the results if I just use
a<00:01:09.570> minus<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.880> hyphen<00:01:12.380> movie<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.570> rid

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
a minus or hyphen movie it will get rid

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
a minus or hyphen movie it will get rid
of<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> results<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.299> had<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:19.680> Jesus<00:01:19.920> of

our<00:01:22.710> results<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.340> talked<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.670> Jesus

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
our results that just talked about Jesus

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.200 
our results that just talked about Jesus
of<00:01:24.360> Nazareth<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:25.979> using<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.310> minus<00:01:27.030> or<00:01:27.150> a

hyphen in the search entry another thing
you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:32.240> find<00:01:33.240> synonyms<00:01:33.689> for<00:01:33.960> words<00:01:34.290> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you can do is find synonyms for words so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.510 
you can do is find synonyms for words so
for<00:01:35.520> example<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.090> sacrament<00:01:36.570> of

for example the sacrament of

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
for example the sacrament of
reconciliation<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.380> known<00:01:43.799> as<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
confession so because the results for

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.069 
confession so because the results for
penance<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.570> Reconciliation<00:01:51.570> are<00:01:51.689> probably

penance and Reconciliation are probably

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
penance and Reconciliation are probably
very<00:01:52.140> similar<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> probably<00:01:54.180> both<00:01:54.360> very

Penance<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.640> word<00:02:05.790> reconciliation<00:02:06.540> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
Penance so the word reconciliation is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.290 
Penance so the word reconciliation is
being<00:02:07.500> substituted<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.369> with<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> word

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
penance and probably some other ones

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.770 
penance and probably some other ones
that<00:02:10.830> are<00:02:10.979> coming<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.340> in<00:02:11.550> some<00:02:12.239> search<00:02:12.450> entry
