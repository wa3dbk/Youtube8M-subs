ladies and gentlemen welcome back this
is<00:00:14.160> part<00:00:14.759> 2<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> animal<00:00:15.420> biology<00:00:15.599> we're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
is part 2 of animal biology we're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.900 
is part 2 of animal biology we're
looking<00:00:16.410> at<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> phylum<00:00:17.039> Cnidaria

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
looking at the phylum Cnidaria

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.599 
looking at the phylum Cnidaria
and<00:00:18.170> nor<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.740> see<00:00:19.980> there<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> doesn't

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and nor that little see there it doesn't

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
and nor that little see there it doesn't
really<00:00:20.789> make<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> sound<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.020> where

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
really make a sound so this is where

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.990 
really make a sound so this is where
we're<00:00:22.260> looking<00:00:22.470> at<00:00:22.590> jellyfish<00:00:23.340> cien<00:00:23.699> enemies

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
we're looking at jellyfish cien enemies

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.130 
we're looking at jellyfish cien enemies
and<00:00:24.210> corals<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.699> are<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.660> we<00:00:27.930> are

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and corals so what are they so we are

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.160 
and corals so what are they so we are
soft<00:00:28.769> bodied<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.330> they<00:00:30.510> also<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:30.990> these

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
soft bodied and they also have these

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
soft bodied and they also have these
things<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.619> are<00:00:31.830> distinguishing<00:00:32.369> called

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
things that are distinguishing called

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
things that are distinguishing called
Nomad<00:00:33.270> assists<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> stinging<00:00:34.260> tentacle

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
Nomad assists it's a stinging tentacle

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.860 
Nomad assists it's a stinging tentacle
so<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> works<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> like<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.149> harpoon<00:00:36.630> which

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so it works kind of like a harpoon which

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
so it works kind of like a harpoon which
you'll<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.350> video<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.430> second

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you'll see a little video at in a second

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
you'll see a little video at in a second
so<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.210> see<00:00:39.329> there's<00:00:39.750> hundreds<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.440> them

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
so you can see there's hundreds of them

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
so you can see there's hundreds of them
onion<00:00:40.950> arm<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.059> does<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.540> all

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
onion arm and what it does is it's all

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
onion arm and what it does is it's all
coiled<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> they're<00:00:43.829> pressure<00:00:44.070> released

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
coiled up and they're pressure released

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
coiled up and they're pressure released
as<00:00:44.940> soon<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.270> something<00:00:45.420> comes<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:45.960> contact

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
as soon as something comes into contact

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400 
as soon as something comes into contact
with<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:47.190> shoots<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.730> coils<00:00:48.410> inserts

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
with it it shoots it out coils inserts

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.160 
with it it shoots it out coils inserts
it<00:00:49.590> into<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.980> releases<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> toxin<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.170> then

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it into it and releases a toxin and then

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.439 
it into it and releases a toxin and then
also<00:00:52.320> they<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.190> opening

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
also they just have the one opening

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
also they just have the one opening
similar<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.649> sponges<00:00:56.070> okay<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> can

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
similar to the sponges okay you can

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.619 
similar to the sponges okay you can
write<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.629> down<00:00:59.300> in<00:01:00.300> order<00:01:00.539> to

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
write that down in order to

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.299 
write that down in order to
differentiate<00:01:01.199> from<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.559> sponges<00:01:02.100> which

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
differentiate from the sponges which

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.260 
differentiate from the sponges which
we're<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.730> doing<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.000> lot<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
we're going to be doing a lot is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.030 
we're going to be doing a lot is
differentiating<00:01:03.989> between<00:01:04.110> different<00:01:04.710> phyla

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
differentiating between different phyla

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.910 
differentiating between different phyla
whereas<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> fun<00:01:07.020> just<00:01:07.229> had<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.650> layers

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
whereas the fun just had two layers

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
whereas the fun just had two layers
these<00:01:08.310> ones<00:01:08.549> have<00:01:08.700> three<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
these ones have three and it is the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.760 
these ones have three and it is the
epidermis<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.549> missile<00:01:12.060> glare<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
epidermis the missile glare and the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.770 
epidermis the missile glare and the
gastro<00:01:13.770> derm<00:01:14.040> okay<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.689> are

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
gastro derm okay as you can see here are

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.520 
gastro derm okay as you can see here are
your<00:01:15.900> three<00:01:16.110> levels<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:18.080> epidermis<00:01:19.080> outside

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
your three levels here epidermis outside

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.280 
your three levels here epidermis outside
meso<00:01:19.950> glia<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> middle<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.290> gastrodermis

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
meso glia in the middle and gastrodermis

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.320 
meso glia in the middle and gastrodermis
on<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> inside

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
on the inside

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.130 
on the inside
I'm<00:01:24.330> sorry<00:01:24.600> guess<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.080> went<00:01:25.200> too<00:01:25.290> fast<00:01:27.080> okay<00:01:28.080> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I'm sorry guess I went too fast okay so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
I'm sorry guess I went too fast okay so
the<00:01:28.500> other<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:30.360> little<00:01:30.570> bit

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the other thing that is a little bit

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.710 
the other thing that is a little bit
different<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.759> there's<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.329> main

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
different here is that there's two main

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.260 
different here is that there's two main
life<00:01:34.229> cycles<00:01:34.740> here<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> polyp<00:01:35.729> which

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
life cycles here we have the polyp which

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.850 
life cycles here we have the polyp which
is<00:01:36.540> sessile<00:01:37.049> which<00:01:37.409> means<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.040> cannot<00:01:38.750> move

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.130 

and<00:01:44.509> then<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> Medusa<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
and then we have the Medusa which is the

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.510 
and then we have the Medusa which is the
motile<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:50.009> move<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:52.250> it's<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
motile or it can move and it's got that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
motile or it can move and it's got that
bell<00:01:53.759> shape<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> uses<00:01:54.540> jet<00:01:54.960> propulsion<00:01:55.290> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
bell shape and it uses jet propulsion in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.709 
bell shape and it uses jet propulsion in
order<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.009> go<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.579> weird<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.090> thing<00:01:57.570> about

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
order to go the weird the thing about

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.280 
order to go the weird the thing about
this<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.070> moving<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> then

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this one is that this is moving and then

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.690 
this one is that this is moving and then
this<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.770> stationary<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> more

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
this is stationary this is the more

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.290 
this is stationary this is the more
mature<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:07.099> that<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:09.140> juvenile

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.070 

I'm<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.450> sure<00:02:13.540> if<00:02:13.599> I<00:02:13.690> spelled<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.900> right

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I'm not sure if I spelled that right

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.199 
I'm not sure if I spelled that right
juvenile<00:02:14.950> where<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.459> sponges<00:02:15.849> is<00:02:16.030> that

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
juvenile where is in the sponges is that

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.220 
juvenile where is in the sponges is that
completely<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.720> opposite<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.680> more<00:02:18.280> mature

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
completely the opposite the more mature

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.480 
outside of the female or it can be
fertilized<00:05:29.810> inside<00:05:30.740> depending<00:05:31.160> on<00:05:31.250> what<00:05:31.400> the

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 
fertilized inside depending on what the

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.640 
fertilized inside depending on what the
species<00:05:31.880> is<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.360> then<00:05:33.110> once<00:05:33.289> they<00:05:33.440> come

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
species is and then once they come

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.469 
species is and then once they come
together<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:34.160> forms<00:05:34.340> what<00:05:34.669> we<00:05:34.700> call<00:05:34.789> a<00:05:34.970> zygote

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
together it forms what we call a zygote

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.330 
together it forms what we call a zygote
and<00:05:35.720> then<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.229> goes<00:05:36.590> into<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.979> swimming

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
and then it goes into the swimming

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.400 
and then it goes into the swimming
larvae<00:05:37.820> which<00:05:38.330> attach<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.900> substrate

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
larvae which attach to the substrate

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.210 
larvae which attach to the substrate
begin<00:05:40.220> to<00:05:40.370> grow<00:05:40.660> mature<00:05:41.660> they<00:05:42.350> bud<00:05:42.590> off<00:05:42.830> and

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
begin to grow mature they bud off and

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.210 
begin to grow mature they bud off and
form<00:05:43.669> these<00:05:43.820> Medusa<00:05:45.190> okay<00:05:48.010> here's<00:05:49.010> something

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
form these Medusa okay here's something

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:56.290 
form these Medusa okay here's something
new<00:05:50.260> this<00:05:52.270> Nigerian<00:05:53.270> phyla<00:05:54.080> has<00:05:54.440> a<00:05:54.910> very<00:05:55.910> very

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
new this Nigerian phyla has a very very

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.290 
new this Nigerian phyla has a very very
simplistic<00:05:56.800> nervous<00:05:57.800> system<00:05:58.310> so<00:05:58.820> we<00:05:58.940> call<00:05:59.150> it

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
simplistic nervous system so we call it

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.339 
simplistic nervous system so we call it
a<00:05:59.389> nerve<00:05:59.690> net<00:06:00.080> so<00:06:00.919> it's<00:06:01.070> not<00:06:01.870> localized<00:06:02.870> which

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
a nerve net so it's not localized which

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:06.129 
a nerve net so it's not localized which
means<00:06:03.620> it's<00:06:03.860> not<00:06:04.039> a<00:06:04.419> organized<00:06:05.419> area

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
means it's not a organized area

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:09.450 
means it's not a organized area
like<00:06:06.259> a<00:06:06.289> brain<00:06:06.729> that's<00:06:07.729> called<00:06:07.969> cephalization

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
like a brain that's called cephalization

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.209 
like a brain that's called cephalization
and<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.610> centered<00:06:10.969> around<00:06:11.259> the<00:06:12.259> mouth<00:06:12.439> so<00:06:12.770> if

00:06:13.209 --> 00:06:13.219 
and it's centered around the mouth so if

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:15.279 
and it's centered around the mouth so if
you<00:06:13.340> look<00:06:13.520> at<00:06:13.669> here<00:06:14.150> right<00:06:14.719> so<00:06:14.930> you<00:06:15.020> have<00:06:15.139> these

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
you look at here right so you have these

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.580 
you look at here right so you have these
nerve<00:06:15.650> nets<00:06:16.129> which<00:06:16.430> extend<00:06:17.060> down<00:06:17.300> and<00:06:17.599> nervous

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
nerve nets which extend down and nervous

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.159 
nerve nets which extend down and nervous
system<00:06:19.400> so<00:06:19.689> what<00:06:20.689> do<00:06:20.779> you<00:06:20.840> think<00:06:21.020> it<00:06:21.110> would

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
system so what do you think it would

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.080 
system so what do you think it would
centralize<00:06:21.620> around<00:06:21.949> the<00:06:22.400> mouth<00:06:22.610> well<00:06:22.909> it's

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
centralize around the mouth well it's

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.600 
centralize around the mouth well it's
just<00:06:23.150> because<00:06:24.129> that's<00:06:25.129> where<00:06:25.310> the<00:06:25.430> food's

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 
just because that's where the food's

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.899 
just because that's where the food's
gonna<00:06:25.789> be<00:06:25.879> going<00:06:27.430> sensory<00:06:28.430> cells<00:06:28.669> in<00:06:28.849> the

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
gonna be going sensory cells in the

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:29.679 
gonna be going sensory cells in the
epidermis

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
epidermis

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.670 
epidermis
so<00:06:30.400> epithelial<00:06:31.569> epithelial<00:06:32.569> or<00:06:32.840> epidermis<00:06:33.469> is

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
so epithelial epithelial or epidermis is

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.260 
so epithelial epithelial or epidermis is
where<00:06:33.919> do<00:06:34.129> we<00:06:34.219> have<00:06:34.340> those<00:06:34.490> skin<00:06:34.789> like<00:06:34.969> cells

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
where do we have those skin like cells

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.969 
where do we have those skin like cells
but<00:06:35.539> there's<00:06:35.779> specific<00:06:36.020> ones<00:06:36.439> that<00:06:36.650> can<00:06:36.770> sense

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
but there's specific ones that can sense

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.740 
but there's specific ones that can sense
and<00:06:39.979> then<00:06:40.580> the<00:06:40.639> last<00:06:40.849> few<00:06:41.210> things<00:06:41.389> here<00:06:41.659> is

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
and then the last few things here is

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.450 
and then the last few things here is
just<00:06:41.930> some<00:06:42.050> of<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.259> different<00:06:42.590> types<00:06:42.860> you

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
just some of the different types you

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.019 
just some of the different types you
don't<00:06:43.639> have<00:06:43.759> to<00:06:43.879> write<00:06:44.029> these<00:06:44.210> down<00:06:44.270> of

00:06:46.019 --> 00:06:46.029 
don't have to write these down of

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.769 
don't have to write these down of
cnidarians<00:06:47.029> so<00:06:47.240> there's<00:06:47.419> corals<00:06:47.900> and<00:06:48.319> enemies

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
cnidarians so there's corals and enemies

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.320 
cnidarians so there's corals and enemies
hydroids<00:06:50.860> jellyfish<00:06:51.860> so<00:06:52.490> really<00:06:52.819> as<00:06:52.909> long<00:06:52.939> as

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
hydroids jellyfish so really as long as

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.879 
hydroids jellyfish so really as long as
you<00:06:53.479> know<00:06:53.689> that<00:06:53.900> there's<00:06:54.110> more<00:06:54.650> than<00:06:54.710> one

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
you know that there's more than one

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:56.439 
you know that there's more than one
types<00:06:55.279> not<00:06:55.490> just<00:06:55.550> jellyfish<00:06:56.120> there's<00:06:56.360> an

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:56.449 
types not just jellyfish there's an

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:58.329 
types not just jellyfish there's an
enemy's<00:06:56.779> and<00:06:56.990> corals<00:06:57.469> you're<00:06:58.069> in<00:06:58.159> good<00:06:58.279> shape

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
enemy's and corals you're in good shape

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:59.499 
enemy's and corals you're in good shape
so<00:06:58.580> if<00:06:58.639> you<00:06:58.699> have<00:06:58.819> any<00:06:58.939> questions<00:06:59.270> feel<00:06:59.419> free
