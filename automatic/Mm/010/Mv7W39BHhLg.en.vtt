like um military stuff because there is
military<00:02:17.960> armor<00:02:18.960> as<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:20.790> to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
military armor as you see here going to

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.430 
military armor as you see here going to
f5<00:02:21.360> quickly<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:23.610> my<00:02:23.760> hand<00:02:24.030> I'm<00:02:24.300> holding

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
f5 quickly and in my hand I'm holding

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.980 
f5 quickly and in my hand I'm holding
binoculars<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.330> is<00:02:27.450> all<00:02:27.540> depending<00:02:27.930> on

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
binoculars so this is all depending on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.470 
binoculars so this is all depending on
your<00:02:28.140> render<00:02:28.440> distance<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.130> mindset<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.120> far

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
your render distance but mindset on far

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.530 
your render distance but mindset on far
and<00:02:31.190> say<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.310> example<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.790> just<00:02:32.850> quickly<00:02:33.270> made

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and say for example I just quickly made

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.630 
and say for example I just quickly made
a<00:02:33.570> target<00:02:33.990> over<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:34.320> so<00:02:35.100> as<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.340> zooming

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
a target over there so as to zooming

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.250 
a target over there so as to zooming
with<00:02:35.670> my<00:02:35.880> binoculars<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:37.910> could<00:02:38.910> see<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.540> lot

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
with my binoculars I could see it a lot

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.900 
with my binoculars I could see it a lot
easier<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.920> if<00:02:41.190> you're<00:02:41.370> trying<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.580> look<00:02:41.730> for

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
easier so if you're trying to look for

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
easier so if you're trying to look for
something<00:02:42.060> far<00:02:42.330> away<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.380> perfect

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
something far away it's the perfect

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.870 
something far away it's the perfect
thing<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:45.050> there's<00:02:46.050> also<00:02:46.290> guns<00:02:46.880> so

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
thing to have and there's also guns so

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.690 
thing to have and there's also guns so
let's<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.950> go<00:02:49.950> over<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.190> I<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.430> really

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
let's just go over here I don't really

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.770 
let's just go over here I don't really
see<00:02:50.880> any<00:02:51.030> mobs<00:02:51.300> around

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
see any mobs around

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.690

weapons<00:03:13.500> right<00:03:13.890> here<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.220> a<00:03:14.310> sniper

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.010 

reload<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.590> shoot<00:03:19.830> right<00:03:20.270> now<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.660> bunch

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
reload you can shoot right now a bunch

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.400 
reload you can shoot right now a bunch
of<00:03:22.200> other<00:03:22.410> snipers<00:03:22.920> are<00:03:23.190> extremely<00:03:24.060> buggy<00:03:24.410> but

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
of other snipers are extremely buggy but

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.250 
of other snipers are extremely buggy but
that<00:03:25.860> should<00:03:26.100> be<00:03:26.130> fixed<00:03:26.489> soon<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:28.080> there's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that should be fixed soon and there's

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.250 
that should be fixed soon and there's
also<00:03:28.410> ammo<00:03:28.860> down<00:03:29.070> here<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.780> one<00:03:30.780> thing<00:03:30.989> else<00:03:31.140> I

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
also ammo down here and one thing else I

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.790 
also ammo down here and one thing else I
noticed<00:03:31.590> was<00:03:32.100> grenades<00:03:32.989> so<00:03:33.989> we're<00:03:34.320> gonna<00:03:34.410> walk

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
noticed was grenades so we're gonna walk

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.790 
noticed was grenades so we're gonna walk
over<00:03:34.830> here<00:03:35.190> quickly<00:03:35.900> drop<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.930> grenade

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.339 

so<00:03:44.800> see<00:03:44.950> this<00:03:45.160> works<00:03:45.599> pretty<00:03:46.599> much<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:46.900> TNT

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
so see this works pretty much like TNT

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.250 
so see this works pretty much like TNT
except<00:03:47.950> there<00:03:48.160> throwable<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:50.080> that's

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
except there throwable so that's

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.619 
except there throwable so that's
actually<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:51.879> good<00:03:52.000> idea

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
actually a really good idea

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:55.860 
actually a really good idea
so<00:03:53.230> I'm<00:03:53.290> guessing<00:03:53.680> in<00:03:53.800> some<00:03:54.220> servers<00:03:54.610> now<00:03:54.910> it's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
so I'm guessing in some servers now it's

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.420 
so I'm guessing in some servers now it's
gonna<00:03:56.050> be<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.260> couple<00:03:56.470> like<00:03:56.800> war<00:03:57.519> or<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.989> like

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
gonna be a couple like war or so like

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.910 
gonna be a couple like war or so like
different<00:04:00.430> war<00:04:00.640> things<00:04:00.910> like<00:04:01.510> I<00:04:01.780> used<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.800> play

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
different war things like I used to play

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.949 
different war things like I used to play
on<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.130> Nazi<00:04:03.670> Zombies<00:04:04.030> server<00:04:04.209> actually<00:04:04.660> and

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
on a Nazi Zombies server actually and

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.520 
on a Nazi Zombies server actually and
I'm<00:04:05.709> guessing<00:04:06.130> they're<00:04:06.580> gonna<00:04:06.640> have<00:04:06.910> ideas

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
I'm guessing they're gonna have ideas

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.339 
I'm guessing they're gonna have ideas
like<00:04:08.530> that<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:09.760> let's<00:04:09.970> just<00:04:10.120> keep<00:04:10.299> that<00:04:10.510> for

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
like that so let's just keep that for

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.309 
like that so let's just keep that for
now<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.790> as<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.940> guys<00:04:13.090> see<00:04:13.299> here<00:04:13.599> there<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:13.930> so

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319
