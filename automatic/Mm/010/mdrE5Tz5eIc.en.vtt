00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:09.510
 this time we are going to talk about what to do 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 when they do not work in this case I'll leave 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.769
 to give some tips that you can get 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.680
 to serve to get out of step 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:23.509
 have to resort to a technical things 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:28.480
 to be able to check well first what 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:31.430
 let's do is check the usb cable 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.930
 surely your printers that is a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:40.130
 multifunction or a common person 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.150
 and in this type of cables as I have three 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.150
 types of qualities 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.250
 I hope you can do it 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.829
 get the pressure 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.780
 obviously the thickness of a cable is 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.899
 different from the others for example this 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.420
 black thicker zinc have this 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.350
 more finite and this that is something one 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.350
 intermediate 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.420
 Hello 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.470
 offering between these three cables with 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.470
 a name and he will buy it 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:15.799
 but it does not say anything out there depends on 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.600
 where we normally go most of 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.369
 the sellers in the big houses 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 computer science or supermarkets or large 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.130
 houses then have no idea 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.390
 between these cables for this is everything 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.850
 same and good here we will explain 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.610
 What a difference 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.070
 The issue of thicknesses is important 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.210
 because that means there are different 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:47.600
 and the cable is different today in the 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.049
 2012 we have three types of cable 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.640
 usb 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:57.049
 we have the ones that are 3.0 we have the ones that 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 are 2.0 and in terms that are 1.1 point 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.049
 number that are those who are giving 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 turns that happens sometimes one has a 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.800
 old computer has a printer 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 a multifunction and suddenly one changes 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.650
 Computer 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.930
 they have new computer plug in everything and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:23.409
 should continue to work but sometimes 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:25.720
 It does not work works because what good 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.180
 what normally happens with the 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.180
 new computers obviously have 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.510
 in new ones that are from generation 3.0 or 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.810
 2.0 then if you did not have a 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.590
 computer that had a port or sd 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.030
 some point 1 1.0 and you had the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.270
 old life printer 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.030
 everything worked perfect for me they are not 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.319
 changing but apparently at 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.360
 functional principle then stopped 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.980
 work what is what happens many 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.050
 times is that the most with the printers 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.260
 hewlett packard we have seen this in 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.900
 many examples 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.490
 they will do the functions we do and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.050
 when we go to see has the problem of 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.270
 the tablets and it's something as simple as 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.100
 to have the right cable good and 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.510
 if that happens what we first have to do 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.209
 see is on the back 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.209
 of the cable to see if you can get there 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.319
 to read but good in everything I know is 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.689
 to talk if most of the cables 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:45.540
 they say version cable version if it is 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:50.159
 2.0 or is 1.1 or 3.0 and all this good 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:53.610
 kind of things start then if the 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.500
 printer is hp as we said 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.819
 previously everything usually happens 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.769
 heap 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.709
 only by changing the cable 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.260
 solves the problem so here is 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.379
 one thing to keep in mind you prefer to 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.469
 when buying a tablet try to 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.780
 make it 2.0 3.0 that is a good cable 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:15.920
 thick that is preferably brand 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.570
 and leave the data because 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.480
 in trouble 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.100
 after 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:28.780
 another kind of things that we see very 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.370
 often those statues are riding the 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.040
 front in cartridge obviously its 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.420
 cartridges are paid to capture the 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.689
 contact and it 's in the bottom 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.959
 where are the injectors 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.029
 sometimes when you are impressed you have 

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:43.919
 a lot of time and has not been has not had 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.809
 no maintenance or anything 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.189
 style happens sometimes ink 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:52.110
 reaches the contacts and again at 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.379
 be in the contacts that is in this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.169
 part of forward does not work then 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:02.580
 what can you get to solve this 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:05.520
 quickly with a hyssop 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.520
 he made us sorry we cleaned with a cotton 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.990
 we gently clean the contacts 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.569
 we try and many times with this 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.509
 solves some kind of 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.879
 cartridge that runs out all that is more 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.360
 frequent yet because you have to think 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:23.939
 the new one that is wedding and good 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.849
 obviously all the 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.849
 connectors 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.520
 sometimes cleaning can sometimes follow 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.289
 working and at other times it is damaged 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.479
 directly the electronics because between 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.789
 short in the ink wets all 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.529
 the circuits and damage the circuits of 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.689
 the printer so you have to pay 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.920
 A lot of attention is that also when 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:51.240
 open the printer cover 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.640
 one has something that companies have 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.830
 to pay have something called 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.110
 Station village that is where they the 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.650
 head that is where it moves and leans 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.630
 in that and it would be like the cap of the 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.800
 pen a pencil 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:11.930
 and that has the cushion then it has 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.380
 of type like small cottons 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:19.130
 pads that where it sits there if 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:22.730
 it looks like it's losing free 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.650
 and all that is filled every so often 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.660
 you have to change it from this kind of 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.760
 cotton is just as secondary begins 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.870
 complete therefore also what keeps 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:36.260
 the head cleans good that 's it but that 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.900
 is everything and good this basic thing that can be 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.710
 get to do to be able to check if 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.240
 it's problems 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:49.800
 telepress organ is also a last 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.150
 tip is always disconnected dysfunction 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.310
 from the computer and make some 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.900
 photocopies and they can throw the photo that 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.030
 means the company the functions that 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.580
 it's a driver problem for the 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.560
 poverty computer that does not print 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.360
 so more things would be things 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.690
 basic to keep in mind mind of 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.690
 wear 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:12.499
 some service so good that's all 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.830
 for today if you like video click on 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:17.449
 I like it and up 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.490
 in subscribing 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.490
 updated of new videos we make 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.819
 weekly that's all for today and up 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.240
 soon 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.240
 Thank you
