00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
 ah 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 good today here we are with the teacher 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:16.350
 jorge hello 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:20.580
 mid-week very fast as a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.869
 express modeling well the silicone that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.790
 everyone wants to know how to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 they use the conventional is a modeling 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.140
 I express because that one working with the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.540
 mass on the mold we already get the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.680
 figure that he needed clear to model 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 with your hands is a fantastic solution 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 for the perfect magnets we hear you 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.130
 for what we're going to do, I'm going to 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.420
 present the molds if the camera wants 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.550
 go panning what is 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.500
 on the table 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.410
 we have molds here that are 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 simple are all these molds and then 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 we have some molds that are 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.070
 compound composite molds are the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.040
 molds where you are going to have in a 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.380
 same piece the nose the face for example 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.110
 a santa claus with a beard on his hat 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.479
 then we mold in the same piece with 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.350
 the different colors of porcelain and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.030
 then we put out 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.920
 of what the mold would be, I'm going to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.020
 basically teach how to work and how 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.729
 cure the molds once we 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.430
 we get the mold we take it out of its 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.390
 original packaging and we will work with 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.920
 glycerin or liquid petrolatum I'm going to 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.259
 put a little bit on the table so that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.610
 see how little this is needed that 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.240
 I'm going to do what you're going to do 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 only one time is not done I'm always going to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.430
 take this mold that this mold is the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.860
 mold with which I worked the average 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.130
 Moon 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.230
 if you want to see in the finished there are two 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.540
 half moons that are very good that 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.290
 they seem real I'm going to put with the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.600
 finger 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.880
 Vaseline and with an absorbent paper 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.159
 I'm going to remove all the surplus 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.049
 I'm going to do this for the only time and 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 whenever you have to mold, you are not going to 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.989
 be necessary to place this product 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.209
 so once I have this I want 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.590
 that you see the following I take mass of color 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.739
 brown and I'm always going to make a roll in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.250
 this case that has an approximation to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.620
 what would be the volume of the figure that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.140
 is in the mold then 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.540
 If I do not have it, I can continue adding 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 more what I 'm going to do is open the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.420
 mold that's why the silicone allows us 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:40.580
 work in this way I place the dough 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.910
 there and I'm doing this job 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.250
 until I get to the edge I need to put more 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.050
 mass I'm going to keep adding and the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.670
 union is not going to notice 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 because the mass in the silicone mold 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.570
 pressing the mold stretches 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.810
 allows the dough to melt with which 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.480
 is below you notice that I 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.720
 to mold I will stretch and carry the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.150
 mass below the edge and this 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.790
 way 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.590
 will allow me not to have a 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.900
 beard at the time of removing 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.550
 the piece of the mold once I have 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.400
 this 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.710
 I press in and what I'm going to 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.720
 do is 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:32.060
 withdraw and detach feel like the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.400
 mold goes working I do this job 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.310
 retirement 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.110
 and I get 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.620
 there 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.920
 I accommodate a little and I get the half moon 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.600
 that after in the finished one once 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.380
 it's dry we decorate it the 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.900
 we painted and I used to give him the 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.420
 appetizing shine that has the crescent 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.340
 bright balmis or the liquid of 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.820
 transparent sizing I want them 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.560
 show for example how are we going to mold 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.840
 now 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.300
 an oyster that has a lot of 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.790
 of shapes and where are you from 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.800
 it is convenient that the mass always 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.170
 have covered with plastic film because of 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.239
 this way will stay at the point 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.080
 that we 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.910
 we take a bit and we are going to mold 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.330
 the same way 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.720
 you will find in the market 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.590
 hundreds of models in silicone for 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.400
 work what you need I put 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.000
 there 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.760
 we mold we throw out and send 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.800
 the mass down 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.210
 there there 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.720
 Oh 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.120
 I close 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.570
 to give it the original shape and once 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.570
 that is already 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:04.370
 sack and there 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.840
 we have what the oyster would be for 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.160
 that has to do with designs that have 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.320
 what to do with the sea to decorate 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.830
 small squares for the bathroom what they have to 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.430
 see with the water I think it's coming 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.199
 rule 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.559
 desperate to come to mold that is 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.559
 so easy 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:28.360
 very good and it is very easy and fast 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.080
 a little bit we are here for you to see these 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.080
 designs that there are 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:41.760
 under pressure and a fish here is 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.750
 you see that we stretch 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.580
 we put there 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:49.930
 we take out and we get a flower design 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.780
 wifi this is to place in the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.500
 breakwater of the doll some things are 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.930
 bigger 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.510
 others are smaller so everything 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.460
 apparatus is practicing with all 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.470
 molds and with those that have such and 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.920
 doing things like we have very 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.920
 cute 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.540
 thanks Jorge 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.620
 until the week
