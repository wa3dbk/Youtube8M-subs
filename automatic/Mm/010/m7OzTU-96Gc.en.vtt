00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.050
 Martha 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.450
 my make-up version as you can see pretty 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.440
 saturated it seems more to me 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.599
 will go as evening 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 well it you need decides to repeat it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.470
 or not but if you are curious how it is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.080
 do look further what I put on 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.840
 the whole face is the basis of this 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 primer good fast fix tone 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.510
 Foundation and does not overload the makeup and does not give 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 fast t-zone shine not really like 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 then on top further I have already done 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.760
 such a very light tone foundation 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 there is no mineral makeup too 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.899
 cement is well fixed very light 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.210

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.129
 like and very very natural 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 I think it looks like this 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.680
 Spring Festival is the most but now I 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.420
