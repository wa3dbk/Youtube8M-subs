this<00:03:04.090> but<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.660> really<00:03:04.900> reminds<00:03:05.350> me<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.590> kpop

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
this but it really reminds me of kpop

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.880 
this but it really reminds me of kpop
for<00:03:06.610> some<00:03:06.790> reason<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.300> don't<00:03:07.989> know<00:03:08.080> why<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.620> don't

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
for some reason I don't know why I don't

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.270 
for some reason I don't know why I don't
even<00:03:09.010> listen<00:03:09.280> or<00:03:09.670> watch<00:03:09.700> kpop<00:03:10.510> -<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:12.040> would

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
even listen or watch kpop - it would

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.310 
even listen or watch kpop - it would
just<00:03:12.310> basically<00:03:12.700> go<00:03:13.239> well<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.720> their<00:03:13.930> style

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
just basically go well with their style

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.699 
just basically go well with their style
I<00:03:14.470> guess<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:16.030> set<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.630> another<00:03:17.260> video

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
I guess I have set this in another video

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.710 
I guess I have set this in another video
and<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.040> haven't<00:03:18.430> changed<00:03:18.550> my<00:03:18.760> mind<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.510> this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and I haven't changed my mind to this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.050 
and I haven't changed my mind to this
day<00:03:20.080> I<00:03:20.320> still<00:03:20.380> think<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.070> the<00:03:21.250> kt7<00:03:21.730> gold

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
day I still think that the kt7 gold

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.630 
day I still think that the kt7 gold
medal<00:03:22.420> is<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> really<00:03:23.050> great<00:03:23.320> colorway<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
medal is a really great colorway the

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.160 
medal is a really great colorway the
gold<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.120> what<00:03:25.150> really<00:03:25.510> makes<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.930> great

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
gold is what really makes it great

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.750 
gold is what really makes it great
because<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.650> makes<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.010> whole<00:03:27.040> shoe<00:03:27.459> look

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
because it makes the whole shoe look

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.910 
because it makes the whole shoe look
more<00:03:28.120> expensive<00:03:28.360> than<00:03:28.870> what<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.260> really<00:03:29.290> is

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
more expensive than what it really is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.400 
more expensive than what it really is
since<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.060> black<00:03:31.269> mostly<00:03:31.750> covers<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.200> rest

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
since the black mostly covers the rest

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.290 
since the black mostly covers the rest
of<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> shoe<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.310> will<00:03:33.400> have<00:03:33.640> no<00:03:33.820> problem

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
of the shoe you will have no problem

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.729 
of the shoe you will have no problem
matching<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.959> with<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.290> rest<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.620> your

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
matching this with the rest of your

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.310 
matching this with the rest of your
clothes<00:03:35.980> -<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.420> basically<00:03:37.600> wear<00:03:38.110> this

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
clothes - so you can basically wear this

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.410 
clothes - so you can basically wear this
every<00:03:38.800> day<00:03:38.980> if<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.430> would<00:03:39.610> want<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:39.940> look<00:03:40.150> rich

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
every day if you would want to look rich

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.880 
every day if you would want to look rich
every<00:03:40.930> day<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:42.280> number<00:03:43.180> two<00:03:43.420> is<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.959> kt7<00:03:44.470> pearl

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
every day at number two is the kt7 pearl

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.370 
every day at number two is the kt7 pearl
which<00:03:45.250> is<00:03:45.610> by<00:03:45.880> far<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.390> simplest<00:03:46.930> looking

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
which is by far the simplest looking

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.190 
which is by far the simplest looking
shoe<00:03:47.709> in<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.340> whole<00:03:48.580> list<00:03:48.940> now<00:03:49.750> you<00:03:49.810> might<00:03:50.170> be

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
shoe in this whole list now you might be
