00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.270
 but let me ask you a third question that you are going to put on tonight 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.700
 temporary set and to show you the festa of the freshly cast take out of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.580
 the washing-machine 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.700
 says the sr what I'm going to put it like if I do not see that you're going to wear 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.910
 very elegant tonight just luck 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.849
 I do not need it but you never know 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.079
 for amir veve that in this subject the dryer this list settled down better 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.769
 show up look at the design in this stainless steel place and this size 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.599
 standard the maximum load of cucho kilos catches my attention text of 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.360
 strike well this is the secret of the ediles dryer that distinguishes it from 

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:37.180
 other dryers and is that steam action because not only dry but that 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.469
 they also allow you to develop clothes and this is the deposit through 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.289
 which we are going to introduce the water that will allow us to emit that vapor look 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.140
 that have a filter so that if they have the impurities above and that the water 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.760
 put the system as pure as possible closes in this way 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.570
 we have a capacity of 2 liters and how these can be seen in each 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.420
 how much water we have left and if there is something left 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.190
 we could reuse it in next drying and another side 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.970
 you can open the dryer please do not see any kind of chair or something like that 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.750
 I understand what 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
 pressing 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.930
 they open effectively, notice that they are 180 degrees so that we can do the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.670
 loading and unloading in the simplest way 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
 and we find drum 1 is here the minados so that when 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.330
 We take off the clothes we do not leave any piece of clothing cast is stainless steel 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.560
 valerio remove very easy access what is the filter not 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.380
 indeed we can live honestly and look at peace 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 effectively 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.039
 then there is a system that is the river without in addition to the steam action 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.360
 system networks link that the drum rotates alternately sometimes to that the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.300
 right times to the left that cares much more clothes 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.620
 And faith that the work of the later ironing is practically nonexistent 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.400
 or of course a lot easier pak let's close the door simply that 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.640
 we push a little bit of activists, we're going to focus on the box 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.110
 controls that we have here that is really very sexy look at yourself what 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.050
 you can move 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.730
 1st appointment very easy to use and look at the lights that illuminate at the same time 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.830
 you are turning the wheel and we have the different tissues that we can put 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.340
 by delicate and synthetic fabrics in wool there is even a mixed program for 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.010
 can mix different materials and then we have 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.090
 the lcd class screen that lets us know how much time we have left for the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 drying and the anti-percent saffron development notice that 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.400
 we have anti-wrinkle station how can we press the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.269
 the end notice and then we have the option to delay 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.560
 the beginning of the dry season up to 24 hours thanks to these 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.730
 buttons to feel that the start button to use eventually if I see that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.470
 there is one thing that calls me attention that puts the good action because it looks no 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.740
 only dry and develop the clothes but when we bring dog so that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.739
 we were state 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.739
 in the street and comes loaded with some kind of pain 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.540
 Inject them with a lot of cold air and we can add to the clothes so that the 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.790
 let's leave it in perfect condition this is ideal if it comes out at night with the lame stole 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.790
 for example because always an hour exactly what monkey will be 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.050
 well in summary this in 20 minutes you can have your clothes 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:54.789
 and developed
