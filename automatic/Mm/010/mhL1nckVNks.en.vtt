00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.460
 continue the course of the young tourist 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.130
 and getting ready to just walk along with 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.670
 overnight stay in nature 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.910
 backpack need to love they 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.910
 here 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.329
 for this you need to do 3 things 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.340
 choose backpack pack backpack 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.390
 adjust suites today consider 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.000
 2 and 3 q 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 the weight of the backpack should not exceed 20 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.290
 percent of your weight 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.990
 now the most difficult to choose 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:30.880
 just what you really need 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.880
 let's take it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.710
 take it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.640
 whenever possible everything should be in 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.090
 inside the backpack so that nothing is outside 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.090
 chatted 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.960
 first you need to relax all the side 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.960
 screeds 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:14.319
 down we put light things that don't 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.319
 need to park for example bedroom 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.930
 heavy things like tent and up 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:27.370
 position closer to the body 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.370
 ideally at shoulder level 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.930
 should sort the clothes and not 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.930
 put in one package 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.829
 you 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 for this it is convenient to use packs with 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.880
 latch 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.320
 bag with things you need to put on a soft 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.560
 surface sit on top and close 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.560
 latch 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.670
 it turns out as vacuum packaging 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.700
 it's compact and things don't get wet i always 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.340
 I use this method 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.340
 goals interesting to find out if other details 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.010
 everything needs to be tamped tight 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.390
 we often use the top valve 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:55.459
 small things like a little bird flashlight 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.459
 rain cover cup slippers 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.840
 it is necessary to tighten all the side 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.840
 screeds 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.739
 also tighten the upper valve couplers and 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.739
 lower 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.450
 how to adjust the backpack it should be 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.880
 fully on a bit and tightly packed if 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.930
 in the registry office suspension system 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.970
 you first need to adjust it by yourself 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.950
 weight belt should be slightly 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.500
 above mid thighs 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:44.450
 with this shoulder harness mount 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.100
 should be between the shoulder blades 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.730
 you need to relax before putting on a backpack 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.730
 shoulder straps 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.060
 heavy backpack easier to wear 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:07.229
 first we fasten the cargo belt for 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.360
 it needs a little lean forward 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.509
 because it is called the cargo that takes 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.740
 over most of the weight 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.740
 then tighten the shoulder straps 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.990
 should also tighten 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:27.150
 the upper screed there is a chest screed 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.150
 well, is it a sport question 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.930
 you and the backpack should 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:54.870
 one whole 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:56.789
 and that way is ready that's all we hope 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.400
