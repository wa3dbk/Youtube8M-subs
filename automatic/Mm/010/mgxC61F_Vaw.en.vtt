iron I'm using it as a wand so I'm not

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.410 
iron I'm using it as a wand so I'm not
using<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.260> clamping<00:00:40.680> thing<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.239> then<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.360> just

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
using the clamping thing and then I just

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
using the clamping thing and then I just
hold<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.649> when<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.430> wrapped<00:00:44.820> around

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

hold I like it when it's wrapped around
because<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.840> think<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.110> looks<00:00:46.260> prettier<00:00:46.860> when

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

you<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.059> wrap<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.550> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.579> hold<00:00:50.850> it

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
you just wrap it up and you just hold it

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:00.600 
you just wrap it up and you just hold it
there<00:00:51.030> for<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.300> 20<00:00:52.199> seconds
