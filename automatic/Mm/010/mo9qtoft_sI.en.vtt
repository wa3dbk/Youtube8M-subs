attributes per se they use they had an

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
ability based system so they didn't use

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.340

that you know I don't need to go through

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
that you know I don't need to go through
the<00:00:52.440> whole<00:00:52.559> entire<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.309> know<00:00:53.460> whole<00:00:53.789> entire

the whole entire you know whole entire
aspects<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.230> basically<00:00:55.949> an

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
aspects of it but it was basically an

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
aspects of it but it was basically an
ability<00:00:56.489> based<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:57.539> where<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> had<00:00:58.590> your

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
ability based system where you had your

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
ability based system where you had your
generic<00:00:59.489> players<00:01:00.449> which<00:01:00.870> in<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.559> case<00:01:01.620> mom

generic players which in this case mom

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
generic players which in this case mom
was<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:04.040> mine<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> balance<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> offensive

was a mine was a balance of offensive

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
was a mine was a balance of offensive
line<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.710> they're<00:01:07.950> both<00:01:08.189> for<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> past<00:01:08.970> as

the<00:04:20.340> balls<00:04:20.609> thrown<00:04:21.150> at<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.510> point<00:04:21.840> paying

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the balls thrown at this point paying

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.750 
the balls thrown at this point paying
attention<00:04:22.830> looking<00:04:23.700> back<00:04:23.970> for<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.330> ball

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
attention looking back for the ball

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.950 
attention looking back for the ball
I<00:04:26.790> guess<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.000> catch<00:04:28.530> spin<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.560> around<00:04:29.770> here

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
I guess the catch spin it around here

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.650 
I guess the catch spin it around here
and<00:04:31.960> as<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.830> can<00:04:32.980> see<00:04:33.210> realistically<00:04:34.210> brings

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
and as you can see realistically brings

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.960 
and as you can see realistically brings
the<00:04:34.870> ball<00:04:35.050> in<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.560> go<00:04:36.070> ahead<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.460> hit<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.580> spin

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the ball in I go ahead and hit a spin

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.240 
the ball in I go ahead and hit a spin
move<00:04:37.000> so<00:04:37.870> I<00:04:37.930> shed<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.530> first<00:04:38.800> tackle<00:04:40.170> and<00:04:41.250> then

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
move so I shed the first tackle and then

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.550 
move so I shed the first tackle and then
the<00:04:42.610> second<00:04:43.180> tap<00:04:43.360> law<00:04:43.630> I'll<00:04:43.900> come<00:04:44.230> with<00:04:44.260> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
the second tap law I'll come with the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.310 
the second tap law I'll come with the
momentum<00:04:45.070> off<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.520> spin<00:04:45.880> and<00:04:46.210> I'm<00:04:46.870> able<00:04:47.050> to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
momentum off the spin and I'm able to

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.760 
momentum off the spin and I'm able to
wiggle<00:04:47.890> free<00:04:48.400> from<00:04:48.670> that<00:04:48.880> one<00:04:49.180> and<00:04:49.480> then<00:04:50.320> I<00:04:50.590> hit

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
wiggle free from that one and then I hit

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.280 
wiggle free from that one and then I hit
another<00:04:50.920> spin<00:04:51.550> move<00:04:51.820> so<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.300> was<00:04:52.660> able<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.960> shed

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
another spin move so I was able to shed

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.230 
another spin move so I was able to shed
that<00:04:53.500> tackle<00:04:54.040> right<00:04:54.220> there<00:04:54.250> allows<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.090> to

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
that tackle right there allows you to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.720 
that tackle right there allows you to
see<00:04:55.450> these<00:04:55.930> ones<00:04:56.200> are<00:04:56.380> all<00:04:56.530> realistic<00:04:57.040> here<00:04:57.550> in

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
see these ones are all realistic here in

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.030 
see these ones are all realistic here in
the<00:04:57.850> sense<00:04:58.150> of<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.540> had<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.140> get<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.560> feet<00:04:59.800> the

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
the sense of I had to get the feet the

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.340 
the sense of I had to get the feet the
feet<00:05:00.250> are<00:05:00.400> planted<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:01.300> feet<00:05:01.540> it's<00:05:01.990> going<00:05:02.200> to

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
feet are firmly planted they're coming

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.850 
feet are firmly planted they're coming
out<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.400> next<00:05:06.640> one<00:05:06.970> coming<00:05:07.960> into<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.500> next

out the next one coming into the next
into<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.550> next<00:05:09.910> moment<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:11.010> have<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.130> wiggle

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
into the next moment I have to wiggle

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.090 
into the next moment I have to wiggle
free<00:05:12.790> from<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.120> net<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.790> then<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:16.830> start<00:05:17.830> to

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
free from the net and then I start to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.130 
free from the net and then I start to
spin<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.790> then<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.060> animation<00:05:19.720> begins

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
spin and then the animation begins

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.260 
spin and then the animation begins
because<00:05:20.410> I<00:05:20.830> got<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.250> spin<00:05:21.550> move<00:05:21.730> I'll<00:05:21.940> timed

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
because I got the spin move I'll timed

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.750 
because I got the spin move I'll timed
it<00:05:22.420> accordingly<00:05:22.930> now<00:05:23.530> despite<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.370> fact<00:05:24.610> that

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
it accordingly now despite the fact that

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.020 
it accordingly now despite the fact that

him being a gold star back I still the
fact<00:05:39.580> of<00:05:39.730> the<00:05:39.820> matter<00:05:39.850> is<00:05:40.120> is<00:05:40.600> paying<00:05:41.200> respect

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
fact of the matter is is paying respect

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.760 
fact of the matter is is paying respect
to<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.220> actual<00:05:42.640> situation<00:05:43.570> it's<00:05:44.140> not<00:05:44.410> just

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
to the actual situation it's not just

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.650 
to the actual situation it's not just
the<00:05:44.950> fact<00:05:45.250> of<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.430> matter<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:46.030> dairy<00:05:46.360> it's

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
the fact of the matter that dairy it's

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.560 
the fact of the matter that dairy it's
not<00:05:46.810> disrespecting<00:05:47.740> them<00:05:47.920> but<00:05:48.160> the<00:05:48.700> realistic

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
not disrespecting them but the realistic

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.460 
not disrespecting them but the realistic
physics<00:05:50.880> the<00:05:51.880> realistic<00:05:52.420> situation<00:05:53.050> was<00:05:53.200> I

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
physics the realistic situation was I

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.410 
physics the realistic situation was I
started<00:05:53.920> to<00:05:54.010> spin<00:05:54.310> move<00:05:54.610> as<00:05:54.880> he<00:05:55.090> was<00:05:55.240> coming

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
started to spin move as he was coming

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.560 
started to spin move as he was coming
and<00:05:55.750> because<00:05:56.190> because<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.220> because<00:05:57.970> he<00:05:58.390> had

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
and because because of because he had

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.960 
and because because of because he had
too<00:05:58.840> much<00:05:58.870> momentum<00:05:59.470> coming<00:06:00.100> at<00:06:00.370> me<00:06:00.550> i<00:06:00.580> was

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
too much momentum coming at me i was

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.200 
too much momentum coming at me i was
able<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.270> throw<00:06:01.540> him<00:06:01.780> off<00:06:01.960> with<00:06:02.230> the<00:06:02.410> spin<00:06:03.210> and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
able to throw him off with the spin and

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.260 
able to throw him off with the spin and
then<00:06:04.240> i<00:06:04.960> go<00:06:05.380> ahead<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.800> then<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.150> i'm

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
then i go ahead and then you know i'm

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.510 
then i go ahead and then you know i'm
taking<00:06:07.720> down<00:06:07.900> really<00:06:08.620> i'm<00:06:08.920> taking<00:06:09.400> down

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
taking down really i'm taking down

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.320 
taking down really i'm taking down
accordingly<00:06:10.060> but<00:06:11.100> my<00:06:12.100> point<00:06:12.340> of<00:06:12.580> my<00:06:12.820> point<00:06:13.180> of

accordingly but my point of my point of
me<00:06:13.510> showing<00:06:13.780> that<00:06:14.140> showing<00:06:14.830> this<00:06:14.980> one<00:06:15.220> play

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
me showing that showing this one play

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.680 
me showing that showing this one play
here<00:06:15.790> is<00:06:16.000> just<00:06:16.270> let<00:06:16.570> you<00:06:16.720> can<00:06:16.900> understand<00:06:17.500> that

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
here is just let you can understand that

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.110 
here is just let you can understand that
that<00:06:19.690> this<00:06:20.260> technology<00:06:20.800> they're<00:06:21.340> using<00:06:21.370> is

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
that this technology they're using is

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.510 
that this technology they're using is
not<00:06:22.450> anything<00:06:22.870> special<00:06:23.290> local<00:06:24.220> motion

not anything special local motion

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.390 
not anything special local motion
technology<00:06:24.940> is<00:06:25.660> nothing<00:06:26.260> more<00:06:26.440> than<00:06:26.920> just<00:06:27.250> a

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
technology is nothing more than just a

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
gotten right the first they should have

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.900

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910 
gotten right a long time ago that's why

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.910 
gotten right a long time ago that's why
like<00:06:34.750> i<00:06:34.930> said<00:06:34.990> before<00:06:35.550> NFL<00:06:36.550> 2k5<00:06:37.060> is

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:37.920 
like i said before NFL 2k5 is

gayness ahead of his time all-pro 2k8 is

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.220 
gayness ahead of his time all-pro 2k8 is
is<00:06:43.410> just<00:06:43.800> enhancing<00:06:44.700> upon<00:06:45.270> just<00:06:45.780> building

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
is just enhancing upon just building

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.190 
is just enhancing upon just building
upon<00:06:46.590> what<00:06:46.830> they<00:06:46.980> did<00:06:47.250> in<00:06:47.400> 2k<00:06:47.820> five<00:06:48.120> and<00:06:48.480> just

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
upon what they did in 2k five and just

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.320 
upon what they did in 2k five and just
making<00:06:49.710> it<00:06:49.860> into<00:06:50.220> something<00:06:50.580> you<00:06:50.970> know<00:06:51.090> just

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
making it into something you know just

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:52.970 
making it into something you know just
making<00:06:51.570> trying<00:06:52.050> to<00:06:52.170> make<00:06:52.380> something<00:06:52.650> better

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
making trying to make something better

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.510 
making trying to make something better
but<00:06:53.340> it<00:06:53.970> the<00:06:54.540> effort<00:06:54.960> was<00:06:54.990> not<00:06:55.380> graded<00:06:55.920> it<00:06:56.340> was

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
but it the effort was not graded it was

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.820 
but it the effort was not graded it was
not<00:06:56.730> as<00:06:56.910> great<00:06:57.300> but<00:06:57.870> in<00:06:58.140> terms<00:06:58.500> of<00:06:58.680> the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
not as great but in terms of the

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.700 
not as great but in terms of the
gameplay<00:06:59.400> experience<00:07:00.150> gameplay<00:07:00.990> experience

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
gameplay experience gameplay experience

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.300 
gameplay experience gameplay experience
is<00:07:01.890> still<00:07:02.460> better<00:07:02.700> than<00:07:02.820> that<00:07:03.150> and<00:07:03.390> and<00:07:04.310> I

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
is still better than that and and I

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.640 
is still better than that and and I
believe<00:07:06.060> that<00:07:06.090> possibly<00:07:06.930> this<00:07:07.140> year<00:07:07.380> will<00:07:07.500> be

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
believe that possibly this year will be

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.680 
believe that possibly this year will be
better<00:07:07.680> too<00:07:08.100> and<00:07:08.250> also<00:07:08.910> the<00:07:09.210> other<00:07:09.330> thing<00:07:09.420> I

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
better too and also the other thing I

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.660 
better too and also the other thing I
didn't<00:07:10.020> say<00:07:10.260> in<00:07:10.500> the<00:07:10.590> first<00:07:10.830> video<00:07:11.010> was<00:07:11.400> that

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
didn't say in the first video was that

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.420 
didn't say in the first video was that
they<00:07:12.450> were<00:07:12.510> playing<00:07:12.990> on<00:07:13.440> the<00:07:13.830> varsity<00:07:14.100> level

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
they were playing on the varsity level

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.700 
they were playing on the varsity level
which<00:07:15.000> would<00:07:15.180> be<00:07:15.300> the<00:07:15.450> equivalent<00:07:16.020> of<00:07:16.410> playing

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
which would be the equivalent of playing

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.290 
which would be the equivalent of playing
on<00:07:16.890> pro<00:07:17.220> so<00:07:18.120> it's<00:07:19.020> still<00:07:19.470> the<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:20.400> jury<00:07:20.700> the

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
on pro so it's still the the jury the

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.370 
on pro so it's still the the jury the
jury<00:07:21.540> is<00:07:21.870> still<00:07:22.050> out<00:07:22.530> there<00:07:22.860> in<00:07:23.160> terms<00:07:23.430> of<00:07:24.380> what

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
jury is still out there in terms of what

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.350 
jury is still out there in terms of what
the<00:07:25.890> gameplay<00:07:26.460> is<00:07:26.670> going<00:07:26.880> to<00:07:26.940> be<00:07:27.120> like<00:07:27.300> when

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
the gameplay is going to be like when

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.640 
the gameplay is going to be like when
you<00:07:27.660> play<00:07:28.050> on<00:07:28.380> on<00:07:28.950> all<00:07:29.730> Americans<00:07:29.940> or<00:07:30.930> Heisman

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650

you play on the highest level is the

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.160
