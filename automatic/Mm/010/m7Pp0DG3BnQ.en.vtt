00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.760
 good is here and now word blood of 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:25.270
 dragon following with the guide 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.210
 mixed hunter's pandaria I'm going to show 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.830
 survival as you can see some 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.420
 first glance survival has not 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 changed practically nothing is more 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.320
 have reduced or cds 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.850
 if using focus the basic rotation 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.449
 would be to put the signal and then bite 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.460
 snake keep shooting cobra 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.579
 go down with white fire and it's disparate 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.519
 explosive black date multi shots 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:58.750
 added a new feature in which 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.750
 when we go shooting 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 jumps 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.630
 shoot the canon and multi shot 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.719
 Focus consumption is reduced 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.870
 basically to but we can be 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.300
 changing the desire to go out 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.720
 we can be punishing shooting won 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.990
 everything we want without what 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.020
 I know it consumes no kind of focus 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.360
 you see how the shot is now 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.930
 explosive launched 3 and the profit as 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.930
 to the top 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.220
 you see 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.230
 good by following the general overview in 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.320
 We're going to start this talent 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.380
 basically survival talent 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.900
 It would be tiger chimera that reduces the time 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.560
 of deterrence reuse and separate 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.440
 and separation firing binding since 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.260
 this silence would not be that it stuns us 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.030
 but an austere renews then difference 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.160
 muffler shot evident in 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.290
 dissent for three seconds or 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.980
 which is that in these two more more pulling 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.500
 from where and this for tv then link to 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.840
 spirit would be for her that regenerates 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.640
 both active and tubes with 2% each 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 two seconds that situation 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.150
 it's a cd that what it does is that it renews 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.510
 life here 30 percent that had 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.570
 limits and this is reinforces the aspect of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.020
 alcohol that what it does is that apart from 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.480
 adding 10% attack damage gives you a 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.739
 15 percent smith and damage 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.360
 this invokes a beast but from this 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.650
 restore 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 restores focus 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.750
 This and this can be changed if what 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.540
 happens that what he does is that each 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.620
 once I use an attack that I use 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.159
 approach or kill or would it be or beasts u 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.530
 another specialization what it does is that 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.560
 the cost of focus 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.930
 is reduced shoots the carmen multi 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.380
 shot that is what I said before 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.290
 that when I used something I use focus 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.450
 what it does is that I jump a dot 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.080
 now you see I think it makes the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.420
 next the next attacks I do not 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.950
 cost does not cost me the focus so 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.440
 so much can I do a rotation and a 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.209
 amount of damage quite enough 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.000
 big until I'm consumed all the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.900
 approach and then these three well as 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.150
 evidently they did not reach 90 because 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.910
 I can not comment on the only thing that is out 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.270
 two blades that spear 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.220
 that obviously will be vp 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.670
 then fired powerful what makes 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.620
 deals 200% weapon damage and then 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.200
 another tromba what it does is an attack 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.910
 sustained 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.010
 for two or three seconds that are 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.380
 you bust them good bust 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.950
 basically but I'll be commenting 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.040
 as I move forward I also 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.630
 go updating it day in glyphs 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.460
 survival is quite difficult to 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.330
 put because there is no kind of grip 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.220
 predefined and survival basically 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.380
 you rely on the traps what happens that 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.140
 the trap glyphs are practically 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:27.340
 all the goop for example os 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.020
 slippery than when you throw the trap 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.750
 with the ice trap what it does is 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.810
 that increases your trap speed of 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 snakes what it does is that the snakes 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:41.620
 90% die later trap 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.600
 freezing reduces the movement of the 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.040
 victim when busting and cheating 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.280
 ice what it does is that the area of the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.560
 Ice trap increases by 2% 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.139
 after possible explosive trap what 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.240
 does that what it does is that when 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.870
 Bust has back to all 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.870
 objectives therefore thus pulling for 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.490
 Peru who wants to use has 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.280
 cried snake trap since the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.190
 snake trap about enough lbs of 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.870
 survival deterrence 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.720
 that when we have to use what 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.520
 emits 20 percent more and trap 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.200
 ice for the pulses and quite large 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.890
 or distributed that increases the 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.050
 visual achievement achievements 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.840
 everyone your taste 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.520
 comment also on time that the 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.770
 trapped does not consume now 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.129
 approach but it becomes a buff 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.080
 as you can check here and we can 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:40.509
 throw balls 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:43.150
 the traps that consume focus and then 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:44.680
 following with the changes the pets 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.349
 can now be what they please 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.910
 to the hunter they become a mere 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.370
 skin 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.870
 in which we can choose by 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:59.700
 example that a 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:02.430
 what bonuses or cunning or ferocity 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.620
 and good last last point 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.770
 puntualización shoots mind with ante 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.889
 what is the glyph the chosen talent 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.520
 here 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.499
 I think what it does is that I put this 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.310
 arrow here that makes an area of ​​15 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:21.160
 meters power the damage if the enemy in 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:25.150
 issue leaves this area 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.270
 busting so he gets a bit for 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.760
 a hundred more damage 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.920
 apart from this the overview of what 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.710
 that would be rotation talents glyphs the 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.710
 survival hunter is finished
