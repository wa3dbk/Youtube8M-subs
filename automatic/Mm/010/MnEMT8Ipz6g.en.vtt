you know one more the outflow of it this
is<00:01:59.219> where<00:01:59.369> things<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.729> unique<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:01.020> goes<00:02:01.200> in

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
is where things are unique what goes in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.420 
is where things are unique what goes in
the<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> filter<00:02:03.390> comes<00:02:03.600> from<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> out<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
the to the filter comes from the out of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.130 
the to the filter comes from the out of
the<00:02:05.430> first<00:02:05.670> keg<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.479> know<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.110> of

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the first keg you know that's kind of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.130 
the first keg you know that's kind of
what<00:02:07.259> you'd<00:02:07.350> expect<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:09.090> outflow<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
what you'd expect the outflow of it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.790 
what you'd expect the outflow of it
actually<00:02:10.379> goes<00:02:10.800> into<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> co2

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
actually goes into the co2

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890 
actually goes into the co2
no<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.310> goes<00:02:13.430> into<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.910> output<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.660> other

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
no it goes into the output of the other

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.290 
no it goes into the output of the other
tank<00:02:15.290> so<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:15.980> filling<00:02:16.370> from<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.580> bottom<00:02:16.700> up

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
tank so it's filling from the bottom up

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.410 
tank so it's filling from the bottom up
and<00:02:17.600> this<00:02:18.590> is<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> pressure<00:02:19.250> relief<00:02:19.760> cap<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
and this is a pressure relief cap and

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.650 
and this is a pressure relief cap and
it's<00:02:20.600> adjustable<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.760> gonna<00:02:23.090> I'm<00:02:23.270> having

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
it's adjustable so I'm gonna I'm having

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.650 
it's adjustable so I'm gonna I'm having
I'm<00:02:23.870> using<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.350> right<00:02:24.380> now<00:02:24.880> quite<00:02:25.880> frankly<00:02:25.910> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
I'm using it right now quite frankly I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.200 
I'm using it right now quite frankly I
may<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.710> five<00:02:27.950> pounds<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.490> back<00:02:28.640> pressure<00:02:28.880> I

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
may have five pounds of back pressure I

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.300 
may have five pounds of back pressure I
don't<00:02:29.510> need<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> lot<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.290> just<00:02:30.590> need<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> relieve

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
don't need a lot I just need to relieve

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.700 
don't need a lot I just need to relieve
the<00:02:31.550> pressure<00:02:31.730> in<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> tank<00:02:32.510> what<00:02:33.440> I'm<00:02:33.530> gonna

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
the pressure in the tank what I'm gonna

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.530 
the pressure in the tank what I'm gonna
be<00:02:33.830> monitoring<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.670> how<00:02:34.850> much<00:02:35.030> pressure<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
be monitoring is how much pressure it

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.480 
be monitoring is how much pressure it
takes<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.930> get<00:02:36.110> it<00:02:36.230> through<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.380> filter<00:02:36.830> which

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
takes to get it through the filter which

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.220 
takes to get it through the filter which
is<00:02:37.550> going<00:02:37.850> to<00:02:37.910> show<00:02:38.120> up<00:02:38.420> on<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.840> low<00:02:38.960> pressure

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
is going to show up on the low pressure

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.300 
is going to show up on the low pressure
gage<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:40.160> my<00:02:41.000> my<00:02:41.570> stuff<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.990> tank<00:02:42.290> there<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.250> I'm

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
gage on my my stuff my tank there so I'm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.940 
gage on my my stuff my tank there so I'm
gonna<00:02:43.430> set<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.670> down<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.090> a<00:02:44.120> minute

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
gonna set this down for a minute

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090 
gonna set this down for a minute
look<00:02:45.950> at<00:02:46.010> that<00:02:46.400> that's<00:02:46.940> our<00:02:47.060> countertop<00:02:48.100> I

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
look at that that's our countertop I

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.300 
look at that that's our countertop I
hand<00:02:49.490> tightened<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.870> gonna<00:02:51.080> I'm<00:02:51.680> pressing

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
hand tightened it I'm gonna I'm pressing

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.980 
hand tightened it I'm gonna I'm pressing
the<00:02:52.340> red<00:02:52.580> button<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:53.000> little<00:02:53.150> bit<00:02:53.390> cuz<00:02:53.870> they

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
the red button a little bit cuz they

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.830 
the red button a little bit cuz they
tell<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.000> I'm<00:02:58.150> wait<00:02:59.150> wait

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
tell you to do that and I'm wait wait

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.910 
tell you to do that and I'm wait wait
there<00:03:00.380> we<00:03:00.470> go

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
there we go

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.160 
there we go
yeah<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.150> probably<00:03:02.360> need<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.570> buy<00:03:02.720> more<00:03:02.900> gas<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.490 

I'm<00:03:09.170> slowly<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.270> can<00:03:14.420> hear<00:03:14.600> it<00:03:14.630> but<00:03:15.380> you

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I'm slowly if you can hear it but you

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.449 
I'm slowly if you can hear it but you
can<00:03:15.620> probably<00:03:15.800> see<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.130> juice<00:03:16.340> running<00:03:16.640> by

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
can probably see the juice running by

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.070 
can probably see the juice running by
it's<00:03:19.459> flooding<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:22.390> any<00:03:23.390> gas<00:03:23.630> that's<00:03:23.930> in

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
it's flooding and any gas that's in

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.610 
it's flooding and any gas that's in
there<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:26.510> actually<00:03:26.660> hear<00:03:27.050> it<00:03:27.110> flooding

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
there I can actually hear it flooding

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.120 
there I can actually hear it flooding
into<00:03:27.770> the<00:03:27.890> next<00:03:28.190> tank<00:03:28.630> alright<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:33.130> don't

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
into the next tank alright so I don't

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.199 
into the next tank alright so I don't
really<00:03:34.190> hear<00:03:34.550> anything<00:03:34.730> on<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:34.970> pressure

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
really hear anything on the pressure

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.780 
really hear anything on the pressure
relief<00:03:35.540> but<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.050> see<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.890> see<00:03:37.100> it<00:03:37.220> happening

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
relief but I see the I see it happening

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.290 
relief but I see the I see it happening
which<00:03:38.720> makes<00:03:38.959> me<00:03:39.200> very<00:03:39.530> very<00:03:39.680> happy<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:41.239> is

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
which makes me very very happy this is

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.350 
which makes me very very happy this is
going<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.690> run<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.709> I'm<00:03:43.580> only<00:03:43.940> I'm<00:03:44.060> going<00:03:44.270> to

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
going to run and I'm only I'm going to

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.050 
going to run and I'm only I'm going to
put<00:03:44.510> up<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.600> ten<00:03:44.870> pounds<00:03:45.610> because<00:03:46.610> I<00:03:46.910> don't

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
put up the ten pounds because I don't

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.610 
put up the ten pounds because I don't
have<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.239> lifetime<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:51.230> starting<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
have a lifetime and it's starting to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.600 
have a lifetime and it's starting to
flow<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.420> when<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.440> see<00:03:54.680> air<00:03:54.890> come<00:03:55.160> or<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> see

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
flow and when I see air come or I see

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.360 
flow and when I see air come or I see
gas<00:03:55.880> coming<00:03:56.360> through<00:03:56.630> here<00:03:56.989> I'll<00:03:57.680> know<00:03:58.130> I've

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
gas coming through here I'll know I've

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.060 
gas coming through here I'll know I've
gotten<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.150> bitter<00:03:59.330> end<00:03:59.420> of<00:03:59.780> this<00:04:00.770> tank

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
gotten to the bitter end of this tank

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.850 
gotten to the bitter end of this tank
and<00:04:01.340> I'll<00:04:01.550> shut<00:04:01.730> off<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.000> pressure<00:04:02.530> I'm<00:04:03.530> over

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
and I'll shut off the pressure I'm over

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.809 
and I'll shut off the pressure I'm over
here

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.470 

I<00:04:10.340> don't<00:04:11.340> know<00:04:11.549> if<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:11.760> thing's<00:04:11.939> working<00:04:12.180> or

my<00:07:32.610> wife's<00:07:32.849> birthday<00:07:33.120> party<00:07:33.599> this<00:07:34.409> first<00:07:34.860> one

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190 
my wife's birthday party this first one

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.300 
my wife's birthday party this first one
has<00:07:35.580> no<00:07:36.210> treatment<00:07:36.780> other<00:07:36.900> than<00:07:36.990> sulfite<00:07:37.590> the

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
has no treatment other than sulfite the

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.719 
has no treatment other than sulfite the
other<00:07:38.460> ones<00:07:38.610> have<00:07:38.789> oak<00:07:39.000> chips<00:07:39.240> in<00:07:39.509> them<00:07:39.630> so

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:40.729 
other ones have oak chips in them so

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.189 
other ones have oak chips in them so
there's<00:07:41.729> always<00:07:41.880> the<00:07:42.030> possibility<00:07:42.199> coke

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 
there's always the possibility coke

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.779 
there's always the possibility coke
fragments<00:07:43.800> and<00:07:43.919> such<00:07:44.099> would<00:07:44.280> be<00:07:44.340> get<00:07:44.580> caught

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:44.789 
fragments and such would be get caught

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:47.960 
fragments and such would be get caught
by<00:07:44.940> the<00:07:44.970> filter<00:07:45.360> too<00:07:45.740> well<00:07:46.740> that's<00:07:47.130> it<00:07:47.460> that's

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:47.970 
by the filter too well that's it that's

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:51.800 
by the filter too well that's it that's
my<00:07:48.270> new<00:07:48.449> whiz-bang<00:07:48.990> I<00:07:49.259> just<00:07:49.650> decided<00:07:50.070> I<00:07:50.810> like

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:51.810 
my new whiz-bang I just decided I like

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.749 
my new whiz-bang I just decided I like
the<00:07:51.930> filter<00:07:52.320> I've<00:07:52.470> got<00:07:52.740> and<00:07:53.070> you've<00:07:53.400> seen<00:07:53.639> the

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 
the filter I've got and you've seen the

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:56.510 
the filter I've got and you've seen the
video<00:07:54.030> on<00:07:54.090> it<00:07:54.210> it's<00:07:54.449> a<00:07:54.570> great<00:07:54.930> filter<00:07:55.349> but<00:07:56.310> for

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 
video on it it's a great filter but for

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.820 
video on it it's a great filter but for
racking<00:07:56.940> under<00:07:57.180> pressure<00:07:57.479> not<00:07:58.080> so<00:07:58.380> good

00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:58.830 
racking under pressure not so good

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.350 
racking under pressure not so good
I'm<00:07:58.889> going<00:07:59.340> to<00:07:59.400> leave<00:07:59.580> it<00:07:59.699> strictly<00:08:00.060> for

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 
I'm going to leave it strictly for

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.050 
I'm going to leave it strictly for
coarse<00:08:00.630> filtering<00:08:01.250> because<00:08:02.250> when<00:08:02.909> it's

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060 
coarse filtering because when it's

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.820 
coarse filtering because when it's
clogged<00:08:03.449> man<00:08:03.870> you're<00:08:04.020> changing<00:08:04.349> pads<00:08:04.590> and
