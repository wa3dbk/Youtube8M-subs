00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
from our one concepts on I just want to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.749 
from our one concepts on I just want to
do<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:13.650> walk<00:00:13.889> around<00:00:14.219> show<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.519> guys

do a little walk around show you guys
the<00:00:15.570> setup<00:00:15.929> here<00:00:16.109> give<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> little<00:00:16.980> wide

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the setup here give you a little wide

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
keep the corrosion away for quite a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910 
keep the corrosion away for quite a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
done on the inside as well because rust

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.850 
done on the inside as well because rust
is<00:00:42.780> something<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.200> all<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.649> battle

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
is something that we all have to battle

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
is something that we all have to battle
with<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.879> anyways<00:00:45.120> looking<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.629> while

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
with then anyways looking in here while

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.200 
with then anyways looking in here while
I<00:00:45.809> was<00:00:45.930> out<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.200> swapping<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.800> wound<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.210> doing

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
I was out here swapping I wound up doing

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
I was out here swapping I wound up doing
the<00:00:48.300> calipers<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> red<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> caliper

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
the calipers in red with the caliper

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.270 
the calipers in red with the caliper
paint<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> painted<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> brake

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
paint and then also I painted the brake

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.010 
paint and then also I painted the brake
pads<00:00:53.520> themselves<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.329> they're<00:00:54.539> exposed

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
pads themselves because they're exposed

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
pads themselves because they're exposed
but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.800> paint<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> brake<00:00:56.399> pads<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> silver

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
but I paint the brake pads in a silver

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.670 
but I paint the brake pads in a silver
color<00:00:57.660> kind<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> give<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.320> bit<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
color kind of give it a little bit of a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
color kind of give it a little bit of a
flare<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> then<00:01:00.420> while<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> was<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> here

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
flare there and then while I was in here

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.039 
flare there and then while I was in here
I<00:01:01.199> also<00:01:01.440> looked<00:01:02.280> after<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.300> wheel<00:01:03.510> well<00:01:03.750> just

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I also looked after the wheel well just

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.590 
I also looked after the wheel well just
with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> semi-gloss<00:01:05.280> black<00:01:05.640> paint<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
with the a semi-gloss black paint and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.500 
with the a semi-gloss black paint and
just<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.590> did<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
just really did it over just to get

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
just really did it over just to get
everything<00:01:09.720> cleaned<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> know

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
everything cleaned up so I know

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
everything cleaned up so I know
corrosion<00:01:12.119> shows<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.630> any<00:01:12.750> other<00:01:12.900> business

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
corrosion shows or any other business

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.620 
corrosion shows or any other business
there<00:01:13.909> take<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> front<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:17.630> same

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
there take a look at the front here same

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.100 
there take a look at the front here same
thing<00:01:18.900> Forester<00:01:19.470> came<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> double

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
thing Forester came with the double

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
thing Forester came with the double
double<00:01:22.110> piston<00:01:22.560> calipers<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> front<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
double piston calipers in the front so I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.330 
double piston calipers in the front so I
painted<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.720> calipers<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.200> rat<00:01:25.500> again<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
painted the calipers and rat again and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.880 
painted the calipers and rat again and
then<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> brake<00:01:27.119> pads<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.720> done<00:01:28.350> silver<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
then the brake pads are done silver on

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.770 
then the brake pads are done silver on
the<00:01:28.979> outside<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.540> offset

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the outside just for that little offset

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.620 
the outside just for that little offset
look<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.220> look<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
look if you look in here you got the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
look if you look in here you got the
drilled<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:33.990> slotted<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.680> again<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.549> can

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
drilled and slotted and again you can

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310 
drilled and slotted and again you can
see<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> fins<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.420> in<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> top<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> there

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
see the fins up in the top of it there

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
see the fins up in the top of it there
and<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:38.040> painted<00:01:38.369> black<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and they're actually painted black so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.929 
and they're actually painted black so
that<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.259> has<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.350> nice<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.520> we

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that really has a nice look to it so we

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.280 
that really has a nice look to it so we
got<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> they're<00:01:42.420> gonna<00:01:42.509> stay<00:01:42.750> black<00:01:42.990> for<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
got that they're gonna stay black for a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.039 
got that they're gonna stay black for a
while<00:01:44.210> you've<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> inside<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> wheel

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
while you've got the inside the wheel
