00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.620
 super gary it's not we have now 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.140
 an arena built in now too 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.859
 works fine that is called off 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 four players arrive at arena and the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.990
 website from now on we will be up 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.320
 clock 22 clock tomorrow 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 that is, plays a lot and the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.729
 The best 24 will come in a final 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 arena and a sword I often had 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:26.220
 beaten and yes so what does that play 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.810
 keeps convicting 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.460
 with us now comes to the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.570
 the server apps again below in the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.280
 video description and the page for the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.759
 sets are also below in the video 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.409
 description linked and that was belief 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:48.210
 I pretty much everything here is one 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:50.659
 wooden sword your kayaks have here 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.659
 Boy 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.070
 so his ears kill third so the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.720
 range is not like heidi range 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.610
 is a bit wider and more spacious 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.280
 So you can do it well and with pleasure 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:16.370
 five blocks distance sometimes hit 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:18.530
 at least where would you it is a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 bravado you allowed here what 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:33.770
 Of course I've got a bit 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.450
 with a couple of fans driven so but since 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.310
 they just more than 20 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 No, I only have five people here 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.150
 all of them kick me except that they too 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.060
 no weapon i can not kill him 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:49.490
 so i should not do that 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.110
 slopes now gone before and the 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.880
 renowned her I can not help it 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.190
 July is so against the rules 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.660
 finally shake off or must I have to 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.530
 I am not forced to do so 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.790
 Of course that's what the rules say 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.100
 had to fight if you think so 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:15.080
 Losing you can act so clearly everything 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:16.910
 everything is a bit stressful 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.080
 been for us last few days and 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.790
 I'm still completely in the wind 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.180
 So somehow I do not get anything up 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.090
 the series 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.380
 but now it's going too far except live 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.150
 Unfortunately, the stream will be delayed 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.769
 Unfortunately, you may have to delay 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:37.190
 Tomorrow I hope I get the errors 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:38.660
 I still open because I have here 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.690
 I still get the trailer somehow 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.459
 in a row and why settles on that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.760
 Happens so you kill me now 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.760
 just 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.400
 while the others keep playing 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.050
 can you ever go to the server 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.480
 faithful and then we'll see each other soon 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.900
 someone worth it here on the server again 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.900
 all right
