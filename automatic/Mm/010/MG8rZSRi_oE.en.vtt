00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.380
 Hello 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 Today we will review this one here 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:16.219
 things is a cotton candy machine 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.219
 they sent us a brand 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.300
 means based on the instructions for 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.330
 operation before first use 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.869
 you need to rinse and dry all wipe 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.669
 then turn on for 35 minutes so he 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.360
 warmed up 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.790
 then turn off to sleep a spoonful of sugar 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.980
 turn on and how the first is pulled 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:45.350
 wind up the elevator on the wand 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:48.410
 turn in comes yes it's time again wand 66 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.520
 chopsticks spoon and knife instruction on 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.670
 operation 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.489
 Well, this is the removable part 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.470
 so this is part of a cup 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.430
 and top 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:07.610
 This, too, all my guarantees and guarantees then 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.420
 Now we will show how she does vatu 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 instructions said that after 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.660
 cooking 5 sugar watt dates device 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.480
 rest for five minutes do not overload 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.640
 sugar use only sugar 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.310
 you can add some food 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.550
 dyes more tank some powder 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:33.030
 powder budget i have no liquid no 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.400
 he puts it very comfortable here on the legs on 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.440
 Velcro pinned him down and he stands so 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.680
 to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.590
 not something to cook 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.920
 We have already tried several vatu 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.370
 Ways to show now the best is not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.660
 the included device we fill not heated 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:02:00.290
 included apparatus pour a spoonful of sugar 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:03.290
 turn on the function like this 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.290
 reel 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.569
 when then on the iphone fluffy 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:49.620
 quince that flies so no came out 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:54.960
 beautiful means vata turns out delicious 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.870
 lush at the end you need to disassemble the device 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.550
 have we turn the cone here it is 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.330
 removed cools the disc touch 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.460
 can't 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.250
 to cool down completely because it is very 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.470
 very hot then this is all washed in 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.360
 warm water rubbed everywhere everything washes 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.530
 wet cloth and listen and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.400
 device left before 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.400
 subsequent operation want to show 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.830
 how very easy it is to wash this thing 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.740
 the removable part is simply inserted and 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.630
 because sugar is clogged there all 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.830
 put it in warm water sugar 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.510
 otkisaem so you can twist and then 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.959
 the result is completely clean water 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.270
 washed completely clean nozzle when 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.560
 the washing up 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.209
 such an apparatus the hardest part 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.640
 wash this here this part 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.910
 from here it sticks like that 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.320
 crystals crystallize sugar and 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.570
 wet or this part is impossible 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.510
 because here the walls and everything is heating 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.370
 element that we came up with my husband and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.590
 now show in any family there 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.160
 technical cloth means we wet 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.690
 a rag like this from all sides have 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.590
 still here for example one and you have weight 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.480
 big right away and set off here 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.450
 I set now see how it will be 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.940
 that is, I have been standing for a very long time 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.729
 hour is the minimum now try it all 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.500
 Taurus now I show the results show 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.840
 what was I just him fit 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.160
 love to do and show here wipes 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.419
 daddy can it now 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.460
 rub means the result is 1 minute I 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.140
 everything has gone completely 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.610
 just wiped with a little cloth 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.000
 the only place left is this 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.650
 so much stuck here so you need 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.380
 a little longer to lose and so completely 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 neat apparatus therefore certainly not 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.729
 very convenient but still this method we 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.849
 found 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:54.709
 for cleaning this surface 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.709
 which can not be wetted here is the inside
