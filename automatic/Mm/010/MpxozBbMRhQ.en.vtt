00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:09.919
 I will play the lyric plays of Grieg 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.919
 called elf dance 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.960
 here 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:12.550
 crypt wrote lyrical plays here we see 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.800
 10 notebooks a lot here each 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.840
 tetra somewhere for 8 to 10 years each piece 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.290
 the world is very bright in my musical way 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.770
 these are such gnomes with wings that live 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:31.930
 in the woods and therefore this image is needed 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.229
 hear in the performance how to express 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.310
 and hear the most important music for 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 it needs to be done 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.970
 how to use such a gram which 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.520
 fits to this image further pace 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.760
 work nevertheless very quickly oleg 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.280
 on 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.770
 and the time of the glass that was either determines 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.390
 form work for beginners form 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.280
 significantly 2 private form ie 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.420
 Fully repeated the first part 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.420
 there is a conclusion a little code from here a 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:31.350
 everything else and itself divided into periods 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.930
 8 clocks each 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.770
 determine where the melody ends 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.770
 then 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.540
 every 4 build 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.690
 with 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:14.670
 Of course it is clear that you are your right hand 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.629
 education code on technically play 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.730
 quite complex you start the mission already 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.730
 master gamma etudes she is not very 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:31.519
 complicated just here quick switching 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:33.819
 chord finger like a finger 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.409
 playing scales and playing around different and 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:41.599
 here we need to quickly switch we 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:43.639
 see first play chords big 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.099
 labor represents when the cat left hand 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:50.799
 right about this is etudes 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.799
 study now change of register is difficult 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:07.730
 stand my hand so that I can make it through 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:10.719
 which goes further you need to have time for such 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.719
 nights 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:21.739
 g left-handedness will slow it down 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.070
 will sound and the right is usually his disciples 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:28.160
 hand worse than right should be the same 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.140
 or even vice versa any pace is achievable 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:45.020
 as if by the nature of the stage 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:48.490
 very simple you can put that dancing 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.490
 here is some kind of collapse in the mountains 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.970
 there 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.760
 why am I talking about this because such 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.660
 figurative pictures can we 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.040
 Do something improve your sound and 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.630
 it will be easier to play because if not 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.640
 understands that you play does not represent 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.540
 when it turns into an exercise 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.960
 everything is pretty fast here but 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:18.890
 start as here so that you can 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.890
 there will be no account 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.090
 and ordinary students begin to have such 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.710
 major activities very quickly not 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.710
 considering the smaller ones so i recommend 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:51.760
 it will then be easy to identify chords 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.590
 then of course such lyric plays 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.889
 Mushroom plays have a very bright musical 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.870
 question so you need this image 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.419
 express through your technique and technique 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.310
 produced with Greg to warm on a bed, 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.310
 what did i say for so far
