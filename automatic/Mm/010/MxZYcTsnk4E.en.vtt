00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.250
 Let's give sequence and then our lessons. 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.680
 leaves the sony vegas file folder 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.300
 a file called audio where you have the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.120
 fifth largest draft 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.520
 It's a saying that put you there only then 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.039
 We are going to work some effects and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.830
 plugins that have here in the ground in 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 vegas to work with audio here I 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.109
 I have the option of luxury tracking in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.939
 audio options here you can pick up a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
 video then I'll teach how to do it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 separate the audio from the video I want to see 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
 for what I had recorded there in the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.540
 cantagalo separated audio from video that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 show you 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 click on it it will open the options 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.410
 here in tech motion and I have three 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.960
 options that is crack but here is the building 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.030
 for equalization and a compressor here 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.570
 also for those already working with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.460
 edition of the herald that do not have much 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.989
 difficulty since already already knows 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.210
 the controls we will understand a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.640
 I'll show little about 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.530
 these controls here for you here in the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.970
 tracking snack I have option for 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.560
 tecnosinos, we have the option to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 increase or decrease here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:14.220
 the proportion of the audio but I do not 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.680
 I want to edit the cruel audio for now 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.090
 and which are the most appropriate options 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.710
 for this audio you are 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 working on the timeline then with 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.549
 sony vegas already makes a fit for you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 The interesting thing is you add 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.689
 province where he leaves the club is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.369
 I'm so sick and Bruno Tiago 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.119
 then click on that option that people 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:38.509
 to add some Portuguese here 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.880
 inside it show everyone cool and 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 select here in the blog called pitch 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.310
 this shift where I'm spending 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.270
 mouse and perfect touch then it goes it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.759
 will give us the options of this club and I will 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 stay again I'll select he has 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.909
 who add the club 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.799
 who is of faith that he should add this 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.200
 plugin our line and if you give what 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.170
 You 'll only confirm it but it will not. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.270
 can edit and I want to show the edit 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.880
 From this club to you. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.519
 after then added ok had 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.390
 kayak options in our club 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.200
 Perfect 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.830
 This is the first control they are to 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.090
 you can either slow down or 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.549
 the faster it is or it would be that the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.470
 thicker and thinner, but if it stays 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.120
 The thicker it gets, the slower it gets. 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.530
 becomes broader as well. 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.280
 So I'm going to put more or less 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:45.239
 10 let's make the test realize here in the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.790
 timeline does not get much faster 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.519
 than normal I'll leave it here then - 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 for example 6 and look at the difference is like 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:03:02.010
 that will be applied then changed 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.200
 quite alone that it is or has increased 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.470
 speed at which it was spoken or decreased 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.170
 have you control for example him 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.570
 leave thinner but keep the time that 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.000
 This option, which has been preserved, prays for 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.390
 you have a better quality of that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.790
 something here you can replace is you 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.209
 There are several options here to choose 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.579
 better quality here, this 07 asking 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.769
 then select it to get better is 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.140
 for now that she continues the voice goes 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.590
 stay slow but she will keep the same 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.590
 time 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.060
 so it was not slow the way it was 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.360
 the last time we put now fast 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:54.700
 here another five hours 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:58.270
 Let's see then the voice became more 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.570
 but she kept it there right 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.630
 the same duration was not even fast and 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.930
 or as slowly as it had been 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:13.450
 given again we have other options 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:18.989
 to control speed too. 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.989
 It's from the audio I can make with lacquer 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:35.140
 negative that there is a difference and 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.650
 few here what sends the most in this 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:42.310
 option is this same feature as the 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.740
 or thicken your voice when you 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.169
 preserves the duration these other two 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.030
 here is the speed is slow or 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.660
 fast they do not make much difference 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.690
 because you are preserving the duration of the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.880
 child then you have to work 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.820
 options without home and without 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.860
 preserve the video speed in the 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.990
 next class we observed another club 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.350
 interesting also has in here is a 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:10.210
 club a lot is not for me it would be one and we 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.580
 Let's work on it. 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.580
 teach also to separate the audio from the video
