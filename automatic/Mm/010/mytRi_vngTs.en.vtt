00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
successful hires would be higher so why

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.000 
successful hires would be higher so why

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
America don't use this science is really

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.000 
America don't use this science is really
an<00:05:28.000> enigma<00:05:28.390> it's<00:05:29.050> not<00:05:29.230> true<00:05:29.530> hasn't

an enigma it's not true hasn't

an enigma it's not true hasn't
traditionally<00:05:30.400> been<00:05:30.520> used<00:05:30.580> but<00:05:30.880> what's

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
traditionally been used but what's

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.290 
traditionally been used but what's
interesting<00:05:31.480> is<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.790> if<00:05:33.790> a<00:05:33.940> company<00:05:34.270> is

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
interesting is that if a company is

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.420 
interesting is that if a company is
hiring<00:05:34.510> a<00:05:34.810> higher<00:05:35.080> level<00:05:35.650> candidate<00:05:36.310> a

hiring a higher level candidate a
c-level<00:05:36.970> executive<00:05:37.570> very<00:05:37.840> important

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
c-level executive very important

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.550 
c-level executive very important
position<00:05:39.060> most<00:05:40.060> companies<00:05:40.450> will<00:05:40.600> have<00:05:40.960> that

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
position most companies will have that

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.760 
position most companies will have that

here<00:05:50.110> we<00:05:50.260> are<00:05:50.410> saying<00:05:50.710> well<00:05:51.220> we<00:05:51.430> don't<00:05:51.640> agree

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
here we are saying well we don't agree

here we are saying well we don't agree
with<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.300> science<00:05:52.720> so<00:05:52.810> we<00:05:52.900> don't<00:05:53.050> want<00:05:53.170> to<00:05:53.260> put

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
with the science so we don't want to put

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.970 
with the science so we don't want to put
