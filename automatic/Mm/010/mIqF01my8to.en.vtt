00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
forms that we have encountered that we

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.039 
forms that we have encountered that we
can't<00:01:44.610> fix<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> bucket<00:01:45.750> ordeal

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
can't fix because it's a bucket ordeal

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840

but hopefully they'll be fixed shortly
that<00:01:48.840> being<00:01:49.049> said<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.350> were<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.500> dev<00:01:49.710> build<00:01:49.890> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that being said we were on dev build so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.230 
that being said we were on dev build so
that's<00:01:50.220> kind<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.430> why<00:01:50.549> we've<00:01:50.729> been<00:01:50.820> waiting

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's kind of why we've been waiting

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's kind of why we've been waiting
but<00:01:51.600> looks<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:51.810> things<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.229> about<00:01:52.320> ready<00:01:52.409> to
