00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.600 
notice that there's still the stamina
meter<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.730> there's<00:00:54.329> also<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.840> new<00:00:55.610> costume

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
meter and there's also this new costume

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.819 
meter and there's also this new costume
functionality<00:00:57.420> which<00:00:57.570> basically<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.649> can

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
functionality which basically you can

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.580 
functionality which basically you can
put<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> different<00:00:59.899> suits<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.079> guess<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
put on different suits I guess and it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.930 
put on different suits I guess and it
gives<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> different<00:01:02.129> abilities<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.760> one

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
gives you different abilities so one

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.270 
gives you different abilities so one

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
gives you the spin attack this is the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.910 
gives you the spin attack this is the
lucky<00:01:05.700> lounge<00:01:05.909> where<00:01:06.330> which<00:01:06.450> apparently<00:01:06.920> will

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
lucky lounge where which apparently will

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.100 
lucky lounge where which apparently will
cause<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.640> take<00:01:09.090> damage<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.840> time

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
cause you to not take damage some time

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.609 
cause you to not take damage some time
and<00:01:10.439> then<00:01:11.250> here<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.630> big<00:01:13.200> ballin

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and then here we have the big ballin

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.810 
and then here we have the big ballin
outfit<00:01:13.950> which<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.159> guess<00:01:14.310> will<00:01:14.490> allow<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
outfit which I guess will allow you to

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.609 
outfit which I guess will allow you to
use<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.390> bigger<00:01:15.659> explosives<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.439> stuff

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
use like bigger explosives and stuff

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
use like bigger explosives and stuff
like<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.220> it'll<00:01:17.939> be<00:01:17.970> interesting<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.509> see

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like that so it'll be interesting to see

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.210 
like that so it'll be interesting to see
how<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.140> sort<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> plays<00:01:19.680> into<00:01:19.950> the
