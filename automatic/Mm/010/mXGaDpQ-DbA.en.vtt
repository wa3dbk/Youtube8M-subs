00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
video on my new droid let's see how this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.940 
video on my new droid let's see how this
works<00:00:23.300> cuz<00:00:23.630> I<00:00:23.660> was<00:00:23.840> like<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.050> front<00:00:24.380> camera<00:00:24.620> so

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950 
works cuz I was like the front camera so

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.310 
works cuz I was like the front camera so
I<00:00:24.980> can<00:00:25.010> see<00:00:25.340> what<00:00:25.490> I'm<00:00:25.580> doing<00:00:25.610> you<00:00:26.150> know<00:00:26.270> I<00:00:26.570> mean

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
I can see what I'm doing you know I mean

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.660 
I can see what I'm doing you know I mean
it's<00:00:27.470> not<00:00:27.620> as<00:00:27.710> good<00:00:27.830> qualities<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.580> other

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
it's not as good qualities the other

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.000 
it's not as good qualities the other
camera<00:00:29.180> but<00:00:29.480> it's<00:00:30.200> probably<00:00:30.410> better<00:00:30.650> than<00:00:30.860> my

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
camera but it's probably better than my

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.420 
camera but it's probably better than my
webcam<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:32.720> yeah<00:00:33.170> today<00:00:33.829> I'm<00:00:34.070> going<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.310> show

eyelashes<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.430> i'm<00:00:38.360> sure<00:00:38.840> you<00:00:38.989> guys<00:00:39.050> probably

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
eyelashes and i'm sure you guys probably

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.740 
eyelashes and i'm sure you guys probably
heard<00:00:40.040> this<00:00:40.220> trick<00:00:40.520> like<00:00:40.760> a<00:00:40.910> million<00:00:41.450> times

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
heard this trick like a million times

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.800 
heard this trick like a million times
and<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:43.160> don't<00:00:43.430> necessarily<00:00:43.610> think<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.450> this

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
and I don't necessarily think that this

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.690 
and I don't necessarily think that this
trick<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.170> make<00:00:45.470> eyelashes<00:00:46.100> technically

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
trick can make eyelashes technically

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.900 
trick can make eyelashes technically
grow<00:00:46.940> longer<00:00:47.290> be<00:00:48.290> thicker<00:00:48.770> or<00:00:48.980> anything<00:00:49.520> they

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
grow longer be thicker or anything they

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.799 
grow longer be thicker or anything they
just<00:00:50.149> make<00:00:50.329> them<00:00:50.510> look<00:00:50.540> better<00:00:50.930> because<00:00:52.809> this

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
just make them look better because this

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.750 
just make them look better because this
trick<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.200> guys<00:00:54.380> probably<00:00:54.620> know<00:00:54.860> it's

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
trick you guys probably know it's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.720 
trick you guys probably know it's
vaseline<00:00:56.510> or<00:00:56.930> showing<00:00:57.770> jelly<00:00:57.980> whatever<00:00:58.460> it's

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
vaseline or showing jelly whatever it's

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.420 
vaseline or showing jelly whatever it's
called<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.059> same<00:00:59.270> thing<00:00:59.680> mas<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.980> exact<00:01:01.250> same

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
called the same thing mas the exact same

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.600 
called the same thing mas the exact same
thing<00:01:01.640> vastly<00:01:02.180> just<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.600> name<00:01:02.930> Brent

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
thing vastly just the name Brent

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.590 
thing vastly just the name Brent
probably<00:01:04.610> get<00:01:04.729> cheaper<00:01:05.089> stuff<00:01:05.299> that<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.570> in

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.289 
probably get cheaper stuff that is in
Vaseline<00:01:06.170> bran<00:01:06.440> um<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:09.110> yeah<00:01:09.830> I<00:01:10.250> think<00:01:10.520> it's

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
Vaseline bran um so yeah I think it's

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.810 
Vaseline bran um so yeah I think it's
just<00:01:11.510> since<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:12.740> an<00:01:12.890> oil<00:01:13.130> you<00:01:13.610> know<00:01:13.729> you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.900 

long<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.830> is<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.600> audits<00:03:41.020> done

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
long so this is this is the audits done

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.730 
long so this is this is the audits done
yet<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.930> already<00:03:44.080> kind<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.530> see

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
yet it's not you can already kind of see

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.280 
yet it's not you can already kind of see
a<00:03:44.770> difference<00:03:45.510> because<00:03:46.510> someone<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.110> look

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
a difference because someone just look

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.470 
a difference because someone just look
fuller<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:48.430> if<00:03:48.550> you<00:03:48.670> can't<00:03:48.880> wear<00:03:49.030> mascara

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
fuller and if you can't wear mascara

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.390 
fuller and if you can't wear mascara
anything<00:03:50.080> or<00:03:50.230> you'd<00:03:50.440> rather<00:03:50.470> not<00:03:50.950> you<00:03:51.190> could

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
anything or you'd rather not you could

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.520 
anything or you'd rather not you could
probably<00:03:51.700> do<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.120> though<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.170> light<00:03:53.380> would

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
probably do this though the light would

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.890 
probably do this though the light would
reflect<00:03:53.860> it<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.400> tell<00:03:55.090> their<00:03:55.270> shiny<00:03:55.630> and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
reflect it you tell their shiny and

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.860 
reflect it you tell their shiny and
stuff<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:57.280> if<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:57.730> can<00:03:57.910> pull<00:03:58.180> it<00:03:58.300> off<00:03:58.420> you<00:03:58.750> know

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
stuff so if you can pull it off you know

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.190 
stuff so if you can pull it off you know
go<00:03:59.080> ahead<00:03:59.350> but<00:03:59.920> I<00:04:00.480> can't<00:04:01.480> since<00:04:01.780> I've<00:04:01.960> light
