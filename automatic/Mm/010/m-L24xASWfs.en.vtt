okay here's the jig setup

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.410 
okay here's the jig setup
I<00:01:32.180> guess<00:01:32.630> I'm<00:01:32.810> I'm<00:01:33.050> cutting<00:01:33.380> cherry<00:01:33.770> a<00:01:34.420> walnut

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
I guess I'm I'm cutting cherry a walnut

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.270 
I guess I'm I'm cutting cherry a walnut
maple<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:37.070> was<00:01:37.310> cherry<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:40.130> other

maple this was cherry and the other
thing<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.360> mention<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:42.940> I'm<00:01:43.940> using<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.450> corded

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
thing to mention is I'm using the corded

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.430 
thing to mention is I'm using the corded
drill<00:01:45.250> because<00:01:46.250> it's<00:01:46.610> got<00:01:47.020> some<00:01:48.020> serious

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
drill because it's got some serious

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.190 
drill because it's got some serious
speed<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> trick<00:01:50.810> here<00:01:51.020> is<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.260> high<00:01:52.190> speed

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
speed and the trick here is a high speed

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.460 
speed and the trick here is a high speed
slow<00:01:54.200> feet<00:01:54.580> so<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:58.130> try<00:01:58.370> to<00:01:58.430> keep<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.790> straight

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
slow feet so and try to keep it straight

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.950 
slow feet so and try to keep it straight
that's<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.770> trick

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:50.559 

and<00:02:06.290> here<00:02:07.190> we<00:02:07.520> go

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.460 

finishes<00:02:51.440> really<00:02:51.739> nice<00:02:53.680> high<00:02:54.680> speed<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.310> that

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
finishes really nice high speed for that

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.869 
finishes really nice high speed for that
and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.769> we<00:02:58.099> got<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.310> test<00:02:58.640> hole

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.820 

you<00:03:04.879> know<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.300> not<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.950> super<00:03:06.950> perfect<00:03:07.400> but

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
you know it's not like super perfect but

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.680 
you know it's not like super perfect but
pretty<00:03:09.830> close

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
pretty close

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:17.710 
pretty close
it's<00:03:11.690> good<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.989> makes<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.410> huge<00:03:16.720> mess

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
it's good but it makes a huge mess

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.080 
it's good but it makes a huge mess
you'll<00:03:18.080> find<00:03:19.180> ships<00:03:20.180> for<00:03:20.540> days<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:22.090> you

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
you'll find ships for days but you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.640 
you'll find ships for days but you
collect<00:03:23.390> what<00:03:23.599> you<00:03:23.630> can<00:03:24.370> see<00:03:25.370> you<00:03:25.459> later
