00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.950
 So 23 years ago , I'm here 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.390
 worked in vienna with the parliament 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.260
 when I'm early in the morning 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.900
 I went to the Volksgarten 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 and I sat down too we want 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:55.680
 do not let the roses affect nature 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.680
 and once disconnected log 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:11.080
 our facts need something 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.820
 funny as loud as I stood up report 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.220
 at the Burgtheater gang ever quieter 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.350
 become 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 So what's back is ours 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:28.320
 tree set loud again for that is the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.320
 us this tree are very loud 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.270
 We noticed after we 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.930
 some times such experiences had like 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.850
 just described that whole 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.369
 obviously a vibration in the 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.869
 nature is 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.340
 I 've seen it so with times 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:11.580
 mountain crystals with a mountain so 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.580
 just as loud and long 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.650
 so went there 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.320
 We know the drill also from the bible on 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.760
 In the beginning, the word of the logos was the first one 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:59.580
 the first creation, so to speak, is this 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.710
 ohm and rome is identical in india 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.160
 with the deity 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.790
 so it's the louder divine sound 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.130
 divine vibration in nature and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.110
 Now maybe ask if that 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.740
 swings in nature so why bother it 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.450
 because then sing and it seems to be so 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.530
 be that on a very high level 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.430
 level always vibrates but that is not 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.890
 always on these lower levels we 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.920
 inhabit and also trees as 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.920
 physical beings of town residents 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.329
 that means these disturbances that exist 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.939
 that are set by man the world 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.500
 they also disturb this one or the other 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:52.010
 Received the order on this 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.329
 three-dimensional level 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.019
 Therefore, nature would like to know 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.879
 that we humans sounded this one 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:05.299
 bring around loud 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.299
 in this dimension 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.240
 apart from that it is also there 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.050
 important that we just do something for 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.670
 that this is something we love 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.080
 want to do to nature 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:31.150
 We had a very long time back then 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.120
 such an atom network founded 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.100
 we have with our friends the 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.969
 seminar participants and students 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.519
 made a time until 14 o'clock 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.820
 where we all meet is called 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:48.510
 so to speak, no matter where you are 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.500
 and who meet us in rome and together 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.770
 for nature 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.089
 for the ufa honor 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.830
 and we had a very interesting one 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:59.629
 Experiences with it so the humans 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.210
 have told us the track 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.539
 partly really interesting what 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.009
 i do that in a self if 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.789
 you look at this high snow and 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:14.870
 connects and does that regularly 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.729
 some things with us and it was so 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.409
 that some people have said they 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.089
 want an evening because we 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.779
 just have more time in the kids 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:26.569
 places for example that were ten o'clock 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.939
 in the evening and then others said 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.409
 I'm going for a walk in the house 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.699
 in nature because I want it a lot 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:36.559
 so see that 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.389
 Those were the three dates I have 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:40.729
 that then still coordinated with nature 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.629
 essential if this is ok when times 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.389
 come on it 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.669
 we have an excellent bike like that 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:50.419
 one does not say all eight with us 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:53.240
 Hours will be sent around so we have 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.289
 So we made that change ourselves and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.289
 oh man send the nature 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.720
 chose people tells the the in the office 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.070
 they did that to rom 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.020
 were much quieter and also if 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.400
 she has annoyed something before that is 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.920
 then not so important anymore 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:38.120
 gain higher perspective and things 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.890
 not so on so were some 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.500
 beautiful events a woman has 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.170
 so if it's the nature only 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.690
 half as much as it is me then that is 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.390
 already nice 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:56.300
 yes that 's the invitation but it does 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.300
 with a network would be nice 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.100
 O
