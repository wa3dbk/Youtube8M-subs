00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.570
 in the new pcgh in danger video we want 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.429
 Find out how dangerous water is in the pc 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.230
 that's what we're doing with water cooling 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.369
 specialist is innovative next to me 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.830
 the markus huster is the 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.029
 Managing director of novatec and with him 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.320
 where together we want this now 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.599
 experiment 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.890
 now the first question from the 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.669
 past it is the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.439
 often worth experience already 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.440
 water cooling systems are quasi burst the 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.480
 that's how fortunately it came about 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.950
 The technology today is so far that this 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.390
 there is danger of zero going on 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.010
 actually no problems here 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.540
 the water cooling has come to an end 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.160
 just clearly evolving that 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.800
 means the systems are very very safe 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.990
 in the application in the installation and also in the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.150
 district of course that means here there is 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.380
 usually no problems in the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540
 past as the whole technology 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.460
 was new was for example one 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.230
 problem that the pump often forget 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.550
 was to start here too we have 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.320
 Although solutions developed but before ten 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.600
 years was rare so that is still the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.570
 230 volt pumps gave it stood the 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.070
 The technique was it is necessary to pump 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.810
 plug it into the outlet separately 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 you had the pc up and that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.760
 something would like to forget synonymous 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.920
 but since 56 years there are pumps 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.170
 directly with the pc turn on and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.520
 since that time, there are actually 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 also no more problems 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.580
 therefore danger recognized banned 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.740
 no at our experiment now 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.810
 conventional tap water in the pc 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.010
 but this means you can us here 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.800
 maybe just say what exactly 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.390
 is and where this is used 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.690
 innovatively protect ip so she calls this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.710
 Medium is an addition and a 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.300
 anticorrosive concentrate that in the 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 Water cooling is used that gives 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.750
 It is also available in different variations 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.920
 on the one hand as a concentrate to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.090
 mix with water yourself 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.549
 or distilled water 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.200
 or as a ready mix as 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.909
 application mixture that is undiluted 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.409
 completely as they are from the bottle 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.510
 comes filled in the water cooling 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.220
 the medium has the purpose 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.390
 to protect water cooling and the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.820
 to maintain proper operation 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890
 you can compare it like in the car too 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.630
 here is an appropriate addition needed 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.590
 to protect the engine just like that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.150
 also in a water cooling 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.279
 special protection can be used around 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 to ensure safe operation 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.120
 very important, however, you can 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.900
 although I pulled the comparison now 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.819
 have 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.470
 not the courage not the means from the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.209
 Therefore, car use completely to the 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.890
 You can play a role as a player 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.379
 Imagine being in the car with everyone 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.900
 Operation of the water heated and boiled 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.299
 about 70 degrees that is you drive route 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.920
 the engine will heat water and kill it 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.280
 Of course, all creatures are all 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.750
 microorganisms from what it always was 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.459
 a germ-free water cooling on the other hand 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.349
 I have completely different circumstances that is 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.950
 the water has about 40 45 degrees 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.170
 temperature in extreme cases that means that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.640
 nice temperature around biological life 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.230
 of any kind to allow so 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.760
 I need an addition of this 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.739
 stop what I do in the car 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 no need therefore is a protection 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.810
 for a water cooling very different 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.060
 compiled 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.609
 tuned differently and therefore has more 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.230
 afford as a protection from the car of 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.639
 therefore very important protection from the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.329
 Vehicle area you hear that again and again 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.829
 Do not use that extra extra 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.109
 but one is specifically meant for that 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.670
 use medium and innovate protect 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.019
 is just a special medium of 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.389
 especially for this area of â€‹â€‹application 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.400
 was developed and optimal protection 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.349
 guaranteed for water cooling 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 effect then I thank you for the information 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.760
 then let's start the experiment 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.060
 otherwise our experiment of 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.500
 Insurance of the circuit prematurely 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.930
 is finished after we liquid in 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.389
 after all, it takes the pc business to do it 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.810
 seven seconds to the 3d mark 06 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.920
 crashes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.980
 you should water cooling at home 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.720
 leakage is ensured by a protective mechanism 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.569
 usually for the pc 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.220
 immediately turns off we test but under 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.110
 the extreme conditions you have at home 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 Under no circumstances should the test be done 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.519
 shows that even a liquid the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.769
 electrically non-conductive is in pc 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.780
 it should be put out of action 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.370
 However, no short circuit arise so 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.560
 that the components are not damaged 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
 become 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.500
 in contrast to pure water arises 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.780
 no corrosion 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.930
 So these are good conditions 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.510
 our test pc is still working 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.610
 Restart of the pcs is not a problem 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.300
 but the monitor still remains 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.300
 black 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.720
 a short circuit or even burn marks 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.090
 you look in vain here 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.610
 during the subsequent drainage 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.470
 it is advisable to remove it cooler 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.020
 the components can dry better 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.180
 a battery open with a temperature of 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.870
 50 degrees Celsius can stop the process 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.870
 accelerate 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.530
 next month we will do that 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.630
 experiment continues and then test which 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.240
 components have survived the attempt 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.750
 until then, the components should be back 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.750
 be dry
