is<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.300> now<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.480> can<00:03:11.600> tweak<00:03:11.930> your

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
is that now you can tweak your

about which is the netcode first of all

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.300 
about which is the netcode first of all
I<00:03:38.420> find<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.900> whole<00:03:39.020> netcode<00:03:39.410> thing<00:03:39.680> hilarious

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
I find the whole netcode thing hilarious

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.800 
I find the whole netcode thing hilarious
all<00:03:40.490> right<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.820> term<00:03:41.000> itself<00:03:41.270> of<00:03:41.420> netcode

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
all right the term itself of netcode

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.330 
all right the term itself of netcode
really<00:03:42.140> doesn't<00:03:42.380> mean<00:03:42.500> anything<00:03:42.560> outside<00:03:43.280> of

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
really doesn't mean anything outside of

battlefield from a software point of

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.540 
battlefield from a software point of
view<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.260> there's<00:03:45.440> probably<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.770> dice<00:03:46.010> engineer

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550

tickrate<00:03:58.220> there<00:03:58.430> was<00:03:58.520> now<00:03:58.640> an<00:03:58.700> ability<00:03:58.940> to

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
tickrate there was now an ability to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.240 
tickrate there was now an ability to
change<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.660> high<00:03:59.870> frequency<00:04:00.440> Network<00:04:00.860> update

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.900 
between low medium and high now
personally<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.740> don't<00:04:04.100> like<00:04:04.310> setting<00:04:04.610> it<00:04:04.820> to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
personally I don't like setting it to

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.550 
personally I don't like setting it to
low<00:04:05.090> because<00:04:05.480> that<00:04:05.660> word<00:04:05.870> is<00:04:05.990> one<00:04:06.170> letter<00:04:06.350> away

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
low because that word is one letter away

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.500 
low because that word is one letter away
from<00:04:06.740> being<00:04:06.920> slow<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.640> got<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.910> go<00:04:08.000> fast<00:04:08.300> I

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
from being slow and I got to go fast I

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.120 
from being slow and I got to go fast I
also<00:04:08.750> really<00:04:09.350> don't<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.620> putting<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.040> on

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
also really don't like putting it on

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.680 
also really don't like putting it on
medium<00:04:10.550> because<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.970> only<00:04:11.090> thing<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:11.330> I

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
medium because the only thing that I

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.390 
medium because the only thing that I
really<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.380> medium<00:04:12.740> are<00:04:12.860> my<00:04:12.980> chips<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
really like medium are my chips and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.220 
really like medium are my chips and
queso<00:04:13.550> and<00:04:13.850> that's<00:04:13.970> not<00:04:14.120> extremely<00:04:14.600> extreme

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
queso and that's not extremely extreme

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.020 
queso and that's not extremely extreme
enough<00:04:15.530> it's<00:04:15.770> not<00:04:15.890> even<00:04:16.130> extreme<00:04:16.520> cheddar<00:04:16.820> so

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
enough it's not even extreme cheddar so

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.030 
enough it's not even extreme cheddar so
naturally<00:04:17.690> getting<00:04:18.260> high<00:04:18.530> is<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.920> only

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
naturally getting high is the only

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.950 
naturally getting high is the only
option<00:04:19.280> but<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:19.700> know<00:04:19.880> what<00:04:20.120> at<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.750> end<00:04:20.900> of

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
option but you know what at the end of

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.780 
option but you know what at the end of
the<00:04:21.020> day<00:04:21.140> me<00:04:21.770> telling<00:04:22.100> you<00:04:22.190> how<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.400> gunplay
