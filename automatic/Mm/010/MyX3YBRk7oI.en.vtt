pavement<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:12.210> slow<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.560> we've

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
pavement would slow it down but we've

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
pavement would slow it down but we've
got<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.220> bumpy<00:01:14.520> street<00:01:14.790> out<00:01:14.939> there<00:01:14.970> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
got kind of a bumpy street out there so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300 
got kind of a bumpy street out there so
I<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.200> take<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> into<00:01:16.650> consideration

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I got to take that into consideration

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
I got to take that into consideration
so<00:01:18.270> did<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.509> clear<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.110> snow<00:01:19.380> pretty<00:01:19.590> well

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
so did it clear the snow pretty well

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.840 
so did it clear the snow pretty well
like<00:01:19.890> first<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.220> how<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.430> snow<00:01:20.640> were<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
like first of all how much snow were you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.219 
like first of all how much snow were you
trying<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> clear<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.869> were<00:01:21.960> doing

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
trying to clear I think we were doing

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.910 
trying to clear I think we were doing
probably<00:01:22.790> about<00:01:23.790> 3<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> 4<00:01:24.420> inches<00:01:24.720> okay<00:01:25.200> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
probably about 3 to 4 inches okay little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.560 
probably about 3 to 4 inches okay little
bit<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> snow<00:01:26.189> yeah<00:01:26.640> but<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> took<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
bit of snow yeah but I took it right

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
bit of snow yeah but I took it right
down<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> ground<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:28.710> you'd<00:01:28.829> ever<00:01:28.920> do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
down to the ground so all you'd ever do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.530 
down to the ground so all you'd ever do
is<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> light<00:01:29.460> salting<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.180> after<00:01:30.299> that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
is a light salting I think after that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.730 
is a light salting I think after that
and<00:01:30.720> you'd<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.619> that's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and you'd be good yeah that's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.870 
and you'd be good yeah that's
interesting<00:01:31.890> cuz<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.579> I've<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
veins

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.010 
veins
it<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.060> doesn't<00:01:36.240> scrape<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> way

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it just doesn't scrape it all the way

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.480 
it just doesn't scrape it all the way
down<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.590> mean<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.920> resting

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
down but this is I mean this is resting

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.950 
down but this is I mean this is resting
right<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.240> pavement<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.810> that's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
right on the pavement and that's

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
right on the pavement and that's
probably<00:01:40.140> why<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> hit<00:01:41.280> those

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
probably why when you hit those

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880 
probably why when you hit those
expansion<00:01:42.329> joints<00:01:42.750> no<00:01:42.930> sidewalk<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
expansion joints no sidewalk it just

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
expansion joints no sidewalk it just
kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> bucks<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.329> stops<00:01:45.600> yeah<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it took it right down to the concrete so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.999 
it took it right down to the concrete so
cool<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.240> heavy<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.259> throw<00:01:52.470> around<00:01:52.770> or

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
pushing it to the side you'll be fine

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.870 
pushing it to the side you'll be fine
okay<00:02:19.840> yeah<00:02:20.500> well<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.100> then<00:02:21.280> let's<00:02:21.459> talk<00:02:21.670> about

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
okay yeah well so then let's talk about

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.479 
okay yeah well so then let's talk about
the<00:02:22.180> design<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.709> in<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.920> compressed<00:02:24.250> State

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
the design this is in a compressed State

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.890 
the design this is in a compressed State
obviously<00:02:24.640> right<00:02:25.030> here<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.300> we<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.510> see<00:02:25.780> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
obviously right here so we can see it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.690 
obviously right here so we can see it
all<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.770> what<00:02:26.950> about<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.310> way<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.580> it's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
all but what about the way that it's

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.030 
all but what about the way that it's
built<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.720> put<00:02:28.989> together<00:02:29.110> it's<00:02:29.680> small

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
built here put together it's small

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.800 
built here put together it's small
that's<00:02:30.790> one<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.060> nicest<00:02:31.300> parts<00:02:31.630> when

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
that's one of the nicest parts when

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's one of the nicest parts when
you're<00:02:32.020> storing<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:33.130> really<00:02:33.250> takes<00:02:33.520> up<00:02:33.700> no

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
you're storing it it really takes up no

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.729 
you're storing it it really takes up no
room<00:02:33.880> at<00:02:34.150> all<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.900> know<00:02:35.020> we<00:02:35.260> kept<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> in<00:02:35.620> our

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
room at all you know we kept it in our

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.860 
room at all you know we kept it in our
in<00:02:36.520> our<00:02:36.700> store<00:02:37.000> room<00:02:37.180> right<00:02:37.360> next<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.690> mop

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
in our store room right next to a mop

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.020 
in our store room right next to a mop
bucket<00:02:37.900> and<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.770> takes<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.220> less<00:02:39.670> room<00:02:39.790> than

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
bucket and this takes up less room than

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.080 
bucket and this takes up less room than
the<00:02:40.120> mop<00:02:40.269> bucket<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.650> that's<00:02:41.800> good<00:02:42.040> yeah<00:02:42.459> flips

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the mop bucket so that's good yeah flips

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.449 
the mop bucket so that's good yeah flips
up<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.569> couple<00:02:44.260> twists<00:02:44.650> here<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.190> got<00:02:45.340> your

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
up a couple twists here and you got your

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.850 
up a couple twists here and you got your
handle<00:02:46.050> handle<00:02:47.050> goes<00:02:47.170> down<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.590> can<00:02:47.709> pick<00:02:47.830> it

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
handle handle goes down you can pick it

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.160 
handle handle goes down you can pick it
up<00:02:48.010> by<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:48.550> here<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.060> yeah<00:02:49.450> this

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
up by this right here and this yeah this

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.780 
up by this right here and this yeah this
is<00:02:50.350> adjustable<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.920> see<00:02:51.130> four<00:02:51.310> height<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.760> is

something different I'd like to see a
little<00:03:26.500> bit<00:03:26.650> larger<00:03:27.310> wheels<00:03:27.850> on<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.209> those<00:03:28.959> got

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
little bit larger wheels on it those got

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.690 
little bit larger wheels on it those got
caught<00:03:29.380> up<00:03:29.530> a<00:03:29.620> couple<00:03:29.799> times<00:03:30.100> but<00:03:30.370> at<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.549> same

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
caught up a couple times but at the same

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.069 
caught up a couple times but at the same
time<00:03:30.940> you're<00:03:31.269> you're<00:03:31.630> gonna<00:03:31.720> add<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.900> lot<00:03:32.049> of

time you're you're gonna add a lot of

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.479 
time you're you're gonna add a lot of
weight<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.560> think<00:03:32.769> if<00:03:33.070> you<00:03:33.130> started<00:03:33.370> messing

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
weight I think if you started messing

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.830 
weight I think if you started messing
around<00:03:33.670> with<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.970> these<00:03:34.269> are<00:03:34.390> nice<00:03:34.570> they're

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
around with that these are nice they're

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.380 
around with that these are nice they're
light<00:03:35.019> they're<00:03:35.049> plastic<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.130> yeah<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:37.269> you

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
light they're plastic so yeah if you

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.360

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.569 
well you know what let's talk about the
quality<00:03:49.530> when<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.560> think<00:03:50.799> about<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.400> it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
quality when you think about it is it

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.180 
quality when you think about it is it
put<00:03:52.090> together<00:03:52.180> pretty<00:03:52.570> well<00:03:52.720> as<00:03:52.870> far<00:03:53.079> as

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
put together pretty well as far as

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.470 
put together pretty well as far as
materials<00:03:54.190> well<00:03:54.519> yeah<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:54.880> didn't<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.359> use

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
materials well yeah I didn't get to use

materials well yeah I didn't get to use
it<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.870> much<00:03:55.930> but<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:56.530> seems<00:03:56.769> to<00:03:56.950> be<00:03:56.980> pretty

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
it that much but it seems to be pretty

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.130 
it that much but it seems to be pretty
tough<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.820> mean<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.180> pretty<00:03:58.329> hard<00:03:58.510> plastic

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
tough I mean this is pretty hard plastic

tough I mean this is pretty hard plastic
it's<00:03:59.410> got<00:03:59.590> plastic<00:03:59.769> blades<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.459> guess<00:04:00.609> that<00:04:00.790> was

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
it's got plastic blades I guess that was

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.430 
it's got plastic blades I guess that was
the<00:04:00.940> only<00:04:01.030> thing<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.450> concerned<00:04:01.780> me<00:04:01.870> but

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the only thing that concerned me but

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.870 
the only thing that concerned me but
maybe<00:04:02.650> they're<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.459> know<00:04:03.489> maybe<00:04:03.700> they're

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
maybe they're you know maybe they're

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.069 
maybe they're you know maybe they're
tough<00:04:04.060> enough<00:04:04.150> to<00:04:04.359> take<00:04:04.420> care<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.900> don't

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
tough enough to take care of it I don't

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.090 
tough enough to take care of it I don't
know<00:04:05.140> well<00:04:05.380> then<00:04:05.500> let's<00:04:05.650> talk<00:04:05.769> about<00:04:05.829> the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100

with probably you know at about 45 50

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.569 
with probably you know at about 45 50
feet<00:04:11.109> worth<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:11.500> sidewalk<00:04:11.890> snow<00:04:12.040> or<00:04:12.519> a

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
feet worth of sidewalk snow or a

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.099 
feet worth of sidewalk snow or a
homeowner<00:04:13.180> with<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.359> sidewalk<00:04:13.780> what<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.049> you

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
homeowner with a sidewalk what do you

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.170 
homeowner with a sidewalk what do you
think<00:04:14.290> about<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.560> price<00:04:14.769> versus<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.549> reward

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
think about the price versus the reward

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.909 
think about the price versus the reward
I<00:04:16.329> mean<00:04:16.540> I<00:04:16.600> think<00:04:16.660> the<00:04:16.840> price<00:04:17.049> is<00:04:17.079> great<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.859> I

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
I mean I think the price is great it I

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.220 
I mean I think the price is great it I
think<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.639> enables<00:04:19.000> people<00:04:19.150> with<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> low

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
think it enables people with a low

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.750 
think it enables people with a low
our<00:04:20.290> income<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.860> be<00:04:20.980> able<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.190> buy<00:04:21.310> some<00:04:21.580> like

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
our income to be able to buy some like

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.880 
our income to be able to buy some like
this<00:04:21.970> opposed<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.600> buying<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:23.080> snow<00:04:23.410> blower<00:04:23.650> or

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
this opposed to buying a snow blower or

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.870 
this opposed to buying a snow blower or
something<00:04:24.160> like<00:04:24.250> that<00:04:24.310> so<00:04:24.640> you<00:04:24.700> get<00:04:24.760> the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
something like that so you get the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.060 
something like that so you get the
convenience<00:04:25.120> of<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.450> snow<00:04:25.660> blower<00:04:25.920> without<00:04:26.920> the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
convenience of a snow blower without the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.410 
convenience of a snow blower without the
price<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:27.700> you're<00:04:27.850> not<00:04:27.970> gonna<00:04:28.060> be<00:04:28.210> able<00:04:28.270> to

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
price but you're not gonna be able to

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.050 
price but you're not gonna be able to
take<00:04:28.570> on<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:29.080> same<00:04:29.230> size<00:04:29.470> job<00:04:29.740> so<00:04:30.310> okay<00:04:30.850> so
