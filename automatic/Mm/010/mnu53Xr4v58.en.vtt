00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.950
 using again fine teeth we 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.610
 do at the root 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.190
 These are progressive progressive 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.000
 motions here with the help of basal 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.000

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.060
 sprinkle varnish roots 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.430
 after laying for an hour, combing very 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.610
 easy the main thing is not to overdo it with 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.410
 varnish and comb that way 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.990
