00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:08.000
 hi friends today I want to invite you to 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:10.890
 do to take care of the planet and we are going to 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.170
 make a portal with recycled materials 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.570
 very very cheap cell phone and very practical 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.300
 and that does not decorate us badly 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 desk 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.550
 all right 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.960
 Our materials to use 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.830
 we have 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.830
 scalpel 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.450
 pencil 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.030
 and what comes to the front that is our 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.840
 smartphone 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.379
 what's left over from the paper roll 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.269
 cardboard and how they see the mouthpiece of a 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.040
 bottle in this case those of you 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.550
 they can use brads to give 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.940
 Balance 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.890
 but I used a mouthpiece from a bottle 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 recycled that I'm using to make 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.309
 a lamp then I cut the peak 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.309
 all right 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.360
 then I took the pencil and draw the 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.820
 rectangle that gives me the shape of the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.680
 mobile 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.980
 Thickness width 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.440
 and then with twitter what I did was 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.540
 cut good if you want to call 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.050
 scalpel whatever I did was 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.540
 cut and make the hole in the same way 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.479
 with our mouthpiece to give 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 Balance and support to our portal 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.800
 cellular then with the pencil again 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.510
 and the top of the mouthpiece or the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.510
 peak I drew the diameter 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.550
 and finally with the scalpel I did the 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.420
 circular cut 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.640
 well then 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 to give it balance then we take 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.790
 the mouthpiece 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.510
 and we introduce it from the inside 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.890
 to get it out here and we're ready 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.340
 account 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.240
 how it looks great 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:20.330
 and we have our cell portal ready 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:24.220
 with balance ready to use and for 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.170
 decorate our desk 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.960
 you can see for example I would 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.970
 I put a drawing you can put 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.500
 any drawing what they want to do 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.030
 can paint it can do everything 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 but because this was something quick that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.940
 I wanted to show you then I did that 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.300
 fast drawing and ready we finally have 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.210
