00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 today we are at the facility 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.069
 municipal water utility city 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.410
 novocheboksarska 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.660
 here is one of the unique 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.759
 our latest development is a joint 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.030
 energy use not only on 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.170
 burning supply well and heating 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.900
 installation is new literally that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.779
 launched into customer action already 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.699
 enjoy about two weeks bye 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.650
 only positive feedback vodokanal 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.330
 is far from all heating mains 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 hot water supply was not here 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.019
 therefore hot water is provided 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 so far it has been obtained using electric 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.030
 tennes but rates are constantly growing together 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.920
 utility costs grow with them 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.210
 Nizhny Novgorod experts have proposed 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.820
 energy saving project and installed on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 rooftop solar system us 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.940
 the situation with ours was read 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 equipment 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.879
 three points q on the suit of the order of five to six 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.199
 years on the project we had been planned 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.210
 about five cubes of hot water per day 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.680
 in fact, mice earn more than 9 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.690
 cubes 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.329
 hot water so in our penny 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.620
 even very high sales expectations 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.390
 collectors are located so that in any 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 weather any time of the year they 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.650
 maximally take solar energy into 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.060
 including infrared radiation from 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.140
 heated roof surface 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 The claimed data correctors 90-92 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.530
 percent this is officially proven 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.170
 passport registration of the past us 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.909
 Germany captured energy from the sun 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.369
 enters the building of the boiler room where 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.350
 there are water tanks with copper 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.700
 heat exchangers water in rich mane ita 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.770
 to the required temperature and 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 distributed across the building meanwhile 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 the sun continues to shine about the collectors 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
 generate energy surplus of this 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.979
 energy as possible to save on time 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.079
 then again 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.119
 use them as such 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.460
 energy piggy bank here stands 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.979
 paraffin tank what is it good given 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 heat accumulator justify the capacity of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 thermal energy is more than similar 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.460
 battery battery made of water 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.290
 at the same time he has his unique thousand 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.810
 paraffin as opposed to water 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.350
 gives up energy very slowly so he 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.450
 and selected 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.820
 exactly how safe at the same time as 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 energy fitting energy stored for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.479
 day profile bikes allows 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.220
 getting hot water around the clock even 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.530
 if all the hot water is consumed 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.539
 and the water tanks have cooled down 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.850
 give off heat like the second sun if 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.920
 aswad is very paraffin hot 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.989
 it is sufficient that its surplus energy 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.630
 which still remains if we are not with 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.239
 Costs go to saunas and sauna 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.010
 so by the way the excess is heated 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.390
 energy is directed not only to heat 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.850
 saunas but also for heating 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.110
 The main task of this system is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.750
 of course hot water 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.880
 to heat the whole house with the system 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.810
 very problematic to sew on our 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.900
 decanter latitude 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.640
 but if we produce hot water and us 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.080
 excess energy is not needed then we always 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.880
 we can direct it to heating and 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.480
 significantly reduce the cost of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.110
 traditional heating system by the way 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.150
 energy efficiency all systems 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.459
 It consists not only in heating but also in 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.350
 careful water consumption in showers 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.299
 installed infrared mixers 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.400
 which is included only when appearing 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.260
 man themselves off as soon as 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.209
 the man left the shower stall and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.370
 finally the work of numerous 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.350
 equipment track automatic 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.360
 blog control management system 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.030
 controllers themselves transfers the system from 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.230
 one mode of operation to another 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.799
 timely includes circulation 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.630
 pumps 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.850
 and if necessary, when not at all 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.190
 energy includes electrical heating elements for 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.230
 water heating and all this without participation 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.489
 human system is unique to those even before 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.579
 what is applicable several controllers 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.459
 control mode we use the system 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.870
 data transmissions which are directly 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.790
 tied to our internet mode 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.739
 real time can get data 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.660
 water production schedules 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.260
 energy how much we spend how much we 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.180
 consume 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 there are also graphics that shows 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.270
 how many businesses every day 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.820
 save after implementation 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.860
 solar collector systems 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.240
 that is, the system will say this at any point 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 can't watch go abroad 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.050
 they can all what happens 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.630
 now and in a private house can 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.100
 make it easy too in one word here 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.020
 all in the service of man 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.030
 solar installation works for our 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.370
 comfort and reasonable spending 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.790
 energy and therefore cash savings 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.790
 funds
