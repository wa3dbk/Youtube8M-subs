00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
the time it's not out in bloom like that

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.840 
the time it's not out in bloom like that
look<00:01:59.590> at<00:01:59.710> that<00:01:59.920> not<00:02:00.819> cool<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.979> project<00:02:03.490> today

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
look at that not cool the project today

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.380 
look at that not cool the project today
what<00:02:04.780> is<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.259> project<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.709> there<00:02:09.390> see

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
what is the project that right there see

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.660 
what is the project that right there see
that<00:02:10.420> brick<00:02:10.750> right<00:02:11.019> there<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:12.130> been<00:02:12.430> etched

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
that brick right there it's been etched

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.530 
that brick right there it's been etched
a<00:02:13.269> little<00:02:13.750> bit<00:02:13.870> with<00:02:14.110> concrete<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.940> joints<00:02:16.420> of

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
a little bit with concrete the joints of

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.520 
a little bit with concrete the joints of
the<00:02:16.780> mortar<00:02:17.769> joints<00:02:18.099> of<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.370> brick<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:20.410> was

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the mortar joints of the brick it was

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.650 
the mortar joints of the brick it was
concrete<00:02:21.040> mortar<00:02:21.489> and<00:02:21.730> it's<00:02:21.940> all<00:02:22.150> kind<00:02:22.540> of

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
concrete mortar and it's all kind of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.900 
concrete mortar and it's all kind of
rundown

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
rundown

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.569 
rundown
over<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.030> years<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.190> brick<00:02:27.459> itself<00:02:28.030> and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
over the years on the brick itself and

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.839 
over the years on the brick itself and
the<00:02:30.579> owner<00:02:30.730> was<00:02:31.200> wondering<00:02:32.549> what<00:02:33.549> could<00:02:33.700> be

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
the owner was wondering what could be

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.580 
the owner was wondering what could be
done<00:02:34.030> with<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.269> she<00:02:34.690> wanted<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.349> this

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
done with that she wanted to have this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.789 
done with that she wanted to have this
painted<00:02:36.160> all<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:37.030> brick<00:02:37.329> painted<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.739> I

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
painted all the brick painted and I

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.280 
painted all the brick painted and I
thought<00:02:39.010> why<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.180> let's<00:02:40.569> try<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.900> clean

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
thought why do that let's try to clean

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.759 
thought why do that let's try to clean
that<00:02:41.530> off<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:42.280> maybe<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.470> save<00:02:44.739> that

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
that off and maybe we can save that

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.289 
that off and maybe we can save that
brick<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.489> think<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.790> gives<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.120> house<00:02:46.269> a

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
brick I think it gives the house a

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.729 
brick I think it gives the house a
little<00:02:46.660> bit<00:02:46.780> of<00:02:46.870> character<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> front

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
little bit of character in the front

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.180 
little bit of character in the front
right<00:02:47.890> there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
right there

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.009 
right there
and<00:02:48.609> if<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.819> paint<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.180> brick<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.690> mean<00:02:49.870> what

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
and if you paint that brick I mean what

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.440 
and if you paint that brick I mean what
color<00:02:50.230> are<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.500> gonna<00:02:50.620> paint<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.420> what<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
color are you gonna paint it what a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.370 
color are you gonna paint it what a
white<00:02:52.870> or<00:02:53.170> same<00:02:54.010> color<00:02:54.280> as<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.549> house<00:02:55.260> no<00:02:56.260> the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
white or same color as the house no the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.780 
white or same color as the house no the
tan<00:02:56.620> color<00:02:59.370> you<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:02.290> thought<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.280> would

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
let's take a closer look now you see

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.140 
let's take a closer look now you see
here<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.819> see<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.299> was<00:03:22.359> talking<00:03:22.480> about

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.080 
here you see what I was talking about
all<00:03:24.420> these<00:03:24.959> lines<00:03:25.319> this<00:03:26.280> stuff<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.790> try

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
all these lines this stuff here you try

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.850 
all these lines this stuff here you try
to<00:03:27.150> clean<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.629> off<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.080> think<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.440> got<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
to clean it off and you think you got it

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.040 
to clean it off and you think you got it
when<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.489> wet<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.330> then<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.750> dries

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
when it's wet and it and then it dries

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.190 
when it's wet and it and then it dries
and<00:03:31.379> it<00:03:31.560> reappears<00:03:32.540> that's<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.840> from<00:03:34.050> the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
and it reappears that's just from the

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.160 
and it reappears that's just from the
mortar<00:03:34.910> running<00:03:35.910> down<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.870> bricks

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
mortar running down on to the bricks

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.509 
mortar running down on to the bricks
like<00:03:37.980> that

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
like that

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.600 
like that
and<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:41.640> over<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.180> brick<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:44.190> see<00:03:44.400> that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
and it's all over the brick you see that

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.830 
and it's all over the brick you see that
look<00:03:45.420> at<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:47.090> would<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.209> agree<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.569> if<00:03:48.750> we

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
look at that would you agree that if we

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.880 
look at that would you agree that if we
could<00:03:49.080> get<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.410> off<00:03:49.849> that<00:03:50.849> brick<00:03:51.299> would<00:03:51.540> look

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
could get that off that brick would look

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.430 
could get that off that brick would look
really<00:03:52.890> nice<00:03:53.390> there's<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.510> little<00:03:54.720> bit<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.959> mold

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
really nice there's a little bit of mold

how you get the film of the concrete on

how you get the film of the concrete on
there<00:05:58.350> after<00:05:58.500> a<00:05:58.710> few<00:05:58.920> days<00:05:59.100> you<00:05:59.370> want<00:05:59.580> to<00:05:59.670> get

there after a few days you want to get
that<00:05:59.910> off<00:06:00.150> use<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.840> product<00:06:01.170> like<00:06:01.380> this<00:06:01.650> put<00:06:02.340> it

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
that off use a product like this put it

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.670 
that off use a product like this put it
on<00:06:02.550> there<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:02.970> brush<00:06:03.900> it<00:06:04.110> on<00:06:04.230> with<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.410> broom

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
on there and brush it on with a broom

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.070 
on there and brush it on with a broom
let<00:06:04.980> it<00:06:05.130> sit<00:06:05.370> for<00:06:05.610> 5-10<00:06:05.820> minutes<00:06:06.060> rinse<00:06:06.810> it<00:06:06.960> off

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
let it sit for 5-10 minutes rinse it off

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.230 
let it sit for 5-10 minutes rinse it off
with<00:06:07.110> water<00:06:07.500> and<00:06:08.190> it<00:06:08.460> takes<00:06:08.670> all<00:06:08.850> that<00:06:09.030> off

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
with water and it takes all that off

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.120 
with water and it takes all that off
that's<00:06:09.960> why<00:06:10.230> I'm<00:06:10.440> thinking<00:06:10.830> it's<00:06:10.950> going<00:06:11.070> to

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
that's why I'm thinking it's going to

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.520 
that's why I'm thinking it's going to
take<00:06:11.370> this<00:06:11.550> off<00:06:11.790> right<00:06:12.090> over<00:06:12.120> here<00:06:12.600> okay

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
take this off right over here okay

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.090 
take this off right over here okay
because<00:06:13.740> that's<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.160> same<00:06:14.400> thing<00:06:14.700> and<00:06:16.100> there

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
because that's the same thing and there

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.040 
because that's the same thing and there
muriatic<00:06:17.520> acid<00:06:17.640> even<00:06:18.180> on<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.420> directions<00:06:18.870> it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
muriatic acid even on the directions it

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.950 
muriatic acid even on the directions it
says<00:06:19.350> that<00:06:20.310> will<00:06:20.490> clean<00:06:20.760> brick<00:06:21.060> clean<00:06:21.840> its

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
says that will clean brick clean its

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.220 
says that will clean brick clean its
concrete<00:06:22.380> and<00:06:22.650> they've<00:06:23.070> got<00:06:23.660> it<00:06:24.660> cracked<00:06:25.050> me

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
concrete and they've got it cracked me

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.170 
concrete and they've got it cracked me
