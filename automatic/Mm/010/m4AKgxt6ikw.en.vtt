00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
important for kids for everyone actually

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.960 
important for kids for everyone actually
to<00:02:44.530> understand<00:02:45.100> where<00:02:45.400> their<00:02:45.549> food<00:02:45.580> comes

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
to understand where their food comes

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.160 
to understand where their food comes
from

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
from

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.800 
from
and<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.890> understand<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.940> little<00:02:49.120> bit<00:02:49.330> about<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
and to understand a little bit about the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.229 
and to understand a little bit about the
process<00:02:50.049> that's<00:02:50.590> involved<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.340> making<00:02:51.850> food

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
understanding of what it takes to grow

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.870 
understanding of what it takes to grow
food<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.590> we<00:02:59.709> build<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.130> respect<00:03:00.580> and<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and three dogs and five cats at my house

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.400 
and three dogs and five cats at my house
we're<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> very<00:03:36.220> animal<00:03:36.730> oriented<00:03:37.180> family<00:03:37.630> and

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
we're a very animal oriented family and

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.590 
we're a very animal oriented family and
I<00:03:38.500> think<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.859> animals<00:03:39.280> teach<00:03:39.730> us<00:03:39.970> how<00:03:40.299> to<00:03:40.329> be

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
I think that animals teach us how to be

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.349 
I think that animals teach us how to be
good<00:03:40.780> caregivers<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:42.370> they<00:03:42.549> teach<00:03:42.790> us<00:03:43.060> how<00:03:43.299> to

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
good caregivers and they teach us how to

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.539 
good caregivers and they teach us how to
be<00:03:43.630> compassionate<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.859> as<00:03:45.010> good<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.519> are

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
be compassionate that as good as we are

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.670 
be compassionate that as good as we are
with<00:03:46.269> animal<00:03:46.660> care<00:03:46.840> we<00:03:47.109> can<00:03:47.260> always<00:03:47.500> get

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
with animal care we can always get

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.009 
with animal care we can always get
better<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.579> hopefully<00:03:48.790> five<00:03:49.359> years<00:03:49.660> from<00:03:49.870> now

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
better so hopefully five years from now

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.050 
better so hopefully five years from now
I'm<00:03:50.319> a<00:03:50.350> better<00:03:50.680> animal<00:03:51.130> caregiver<00:03:51.549> than<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.819> am

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
I'm a better animal caregiver than I am

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.150 
I'm a better animal caregiver than I am
today<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.480> can<00:03:52.959> certainly<00:03:53.140> promise<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> that
