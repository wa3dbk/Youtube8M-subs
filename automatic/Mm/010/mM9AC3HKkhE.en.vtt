00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.830
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.590
 di pietro and we are in a new news 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.350
 of our science and technology channel 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.260
 mystery that attention to these 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.830
 statements of a pretty physicist 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:21.270
 important and that therefore declares that in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.470
 2045 the main species will no longer be the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.650
 human being in 2045 the main species 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.619
 according to this physicist and author of the book the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.110
 artificial intelligence revolution 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.430
 no longer humans but machines 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.750
 and warns about the possible problem 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.590
 respect to these of the mount then good has 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 made a statement to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.700
 newspaper bussines insider their 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.960
 thoughts about intelligence 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.670
 artificial and the uniqueness that can 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 occur this in the future then good 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 immediate to say it in some way and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 is that for him the intelligence 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.489
 artificial will not only overcome its own 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.510
 intelligence but will also overcome 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.660
 the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.440
 human being as a whole the expert estimates that 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.530
 this could happen as late as 2045 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.230
 and says so in the statements of this 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.480
 sir are these today there is no 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.760
 no legislation on the amount of 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.220
 intelligence that a machine could 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.340
 have and how interconnected that could 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 be if this continues the trend well 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.510
 exponential we will achieve the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.880
 singularity within the framework of time 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.880
 that most experts predict 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 from there you will see that the species 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.070
 main will no longer be the beings 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.920
 human beings but the regular machines of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.040
 mount the process is not going to look like 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.950
 like the movie terminator not much 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.870
 less but in the following way in the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.510
 first part of the world after the 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.390
 singularity one of the scenarios that 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.430
 will occur will produce forgiveness is that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.369
 the machines will try to convert the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 humans in cyborgs human parts parties 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.590
 machines the machines will make great 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 advances in medical technology the 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.740
 most humans we will have more 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.840
 free time 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.500
 let's think we've never had it 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 better however according to the physical the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.370
 problem is that the machines 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.190
 they will see us as an unpredictable species 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.830
 and dangerous believes that the machines 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.280
 they will become self conscious cars 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.230
 and will have the ability to protect themselves 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.850
 they could see us in the same way in the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.520
 that we see insects 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.000
 harmful since we are a kind 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.460
 unstable that creates wars has weapons 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.640
 to take down the world and we can create 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.880
 computer viruses and good for the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.310
 machines because we will be a problem according to 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.190
 says Luis del Monte what do you think? 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.040
 this can happen 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.480
 can produce a war for 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.850
 say it some way between the machines 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.770
 and humans 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.510
 the intelligence revolution 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.580
 artificial 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.379
 I want your comments as always 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.400
 like and favorites and see you in the 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.400
 next chao
