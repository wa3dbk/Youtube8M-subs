the $45 one where they give you four to
five<00:01:46.500> pieces<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.149> amazing

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
five pieces which I think it's amazing

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.450 
five pieces which I think it's amazing
it's<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.500> basically<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> same<00:01:50.159> thing<00:01:50.310> it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it's just basically the same thing it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's just basically the same thing it's
just<00:01:50.549> only<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:51.060> getting<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
just only you're getting more when you

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.920 
just only you're getting more when you
pay<00:01:52.710> more<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.520> obviously<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> more<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> pay

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
pay more so obviously the more you pay

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.080 
pay more so obviously the more you pay
the<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.770> know<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.490> overall

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the more you get you know but overall

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.910 
the more you get you know but overall
the<00:01:57.270> same<00:01:57.570> quality<00:01:58.049> it's<00:01:58.259> not<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.770> get

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the same quality it's not like you get

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.319 
the same quality it's not like you get
something<00:01:59.280> much<00:01:59.430> cheaper<00:01:59.790> or<00:01:59.909> anything<00:02:00.090> no

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
something much cheaper or anything no

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
something much cheaper or anything no
it's<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.750> same<00:02:00.990> quality<00:02:01.500> even<00:02:02.040> though<00:02:02.250> you're

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
it's the same quality even though you're

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's the same quality even though you're
paying<00:02:02.909> for<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.149> twenty<00:02:03.390> five<00:02:03.509> dollar<00:02:03.570> one<00:02:03.990> so
