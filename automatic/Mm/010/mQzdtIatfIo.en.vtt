 deviating from the military forces of the order he 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.040
 went back to mask the city on 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.440
 the cliffs 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.160
 famous for its cave temples where and 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.129
 were 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.379
 priests of the most high omniknight challenged 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.170
 priests and demanded to show him 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.780
 almighty they were indignant such 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.480
 arrogance no one had ever dared to throw 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 a challenge to the creator of the world, even those who have it 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 did not believe in the depths of the soul they were afraid of him 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.370
 thunder carriages at first tried to quit 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.440
 cliff for sacrifices but how much 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.810
 people have not attacked him and what

 would not have spells cast on him 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.290
 never managed to budge 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:09.330
 all the time he seemed to be guarding someone 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.849
 after a while the enlightenment came to the monks and 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.310
 they realized that only the Almighty could 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.470
 give him such protection before 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.099
 thunder opened the door beyond the threshold 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.989
 who previously no one dared to step over 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.780
 having entered it he did not see a scroll in 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:27.870
 ancient wisdom not legendary relics 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.799

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.670
