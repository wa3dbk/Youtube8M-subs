00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.800 
on this side Sarah with one pump I
managed<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.230> this<00:03:06.470> bit<00:03:06.740> of<00:03:06.830> my<00:03:07.010> face<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
going to need quite a bit of this it's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:27.710 
going to need quite a bit of this it's
very<00:03:13.400> watery

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.830 

this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.840> nice<00:03:29.170> warm<00:03:29.590> shade<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.210> finished

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
this is a nice warm shade so I finished

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.350 
this is a nice warm shade so I finished
this<00:03:31.990> side<00:03:32.230> of<00:03:32.350> my<00:03:32.500> face<00:03:32.740> with<00:03:33.130> I'd<00:03:33.580> say<00:03:33.910> two

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
this side of my face with I'd say two

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.870 
this side of my face with I'd say two
and<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.600> half<00:03:34.780> pumps<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.400> medium

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and a half pumps and it is a medium

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.730 
and a half pumps and it is a medium
coverage<00:03:37.270> so<00:03:37.540> this<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.110> I've<00:03:38.230> managed<00:03:38.620> to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
coverage so this is what I've managed to

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.550 
coverage so this is what I've managed to
cover<00:03:39.100> I'd<00:03:39.880> say<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.300> has<00:03:40.380> evened<00:03:41.380> out<00:03:41.500> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
cover I'd say it has evened out the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.550 
cover I'd say it has evened out the
color<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:42.010> my<00:03:42.220> skin<00:03:42.250> Tonee<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.990> I<00:03:44.020> look<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
color of my skin Tonee so do I look a

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.320 
color of my skin Tonee so do I look a
little<00:03:45.040> bit<00:03:45.220> younger<00:03:45.250> on<00:03:45.700> this<00:03:45.880> side<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.210> my

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
little bit younger on this side of my

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.320 
little bit younger on this side of my
face<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:46.990> think<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.500> quite<00:03:47.680> chewy<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.520> it<00:03:49.090> has

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
face I think it's quite chewy and it has

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.400 
face I think it's quite chewy and it has
the<00:03:49.630> tiniest<00:03:51.150> sparkle<00:03:52.150> to<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.990> think<00:03:53.050> this

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
the tiniest sparkle to it I think this

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.410 
the tiniest sparkle to it I think this
is<00:03:53.590> this<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.220> maybe<00:03:54.400> their<00:03:54.640> technology<00:03:55.270> when

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
is this is maybe their technology when

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.630 
is this is maybe their technology when
they<00:03:55.570> say<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.990> it's<00:03:56.200> going<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.040> reflect<00:03:57.190> the

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
they say that it's going to reflect the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.330 
they say that it's going to reflect the
light<00:03:57.880> but<00:03:58.300> looking<00:03:58.780> closely<00:03:59.140> I<00:03:59.770> can<00:04:00.100> actually

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
light but looking closely I can actually

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.130 
light but looking closely I can actually
see<00:04:00.970> little<00:04:02.160> speckles<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.400> sparkle<00:04:04.060> it<00:04:04.780> feels

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
see little speckles of sparkle it feels

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.260 
see little speckles of sparkle it feels
very<00:04:05.650> moist<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.250> think<00:04:06.520> this<00:04:06.640> would<00:04:06.790> be<00:04:06.820> quite

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
very moist I think this would be quite

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.570 
very moist I think this would be quite
suited<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:08.020> those<00:04:08.170> who<00:04:08.440> have<00:04:08.560> normal<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.340> dry

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
suited to those who have normal to dry

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.940 
suited to those who have normal to dry
skin<00:04:09.750> but<00:04:10.750> as<00:04:10.900> I'm<00:04:11.020> gonna<00:04:11.170> finish<00:04:11.380> this<00:04:11.620> out<00:04:11.830> of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
skin but as I'm gonna finish this out of

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.039 
skin but as I'm gonna finish this out of
my<00:04:12.010> face<00:04:12.250> now<00:04:15.239> I'm<00:04:16.239> gonna<00:04:16.419> use<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.630> little<00:04:16.930> bit

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
my face now I'm gonna use a little bit

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.590 
my face now I'm gonna use a little bit
more<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:18.280> I'd<00:04:18.430> say<00:04:18.640> I'd<00:04:18.790> probably<00:04:19.030> use<00:04:19.209> about

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
more so I'd say I'd probably use about

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.960 
more so I'd say I'd probably use about
four<00:04:19.900> and<00:04:19.989> a<00:04:20.079> half<00:04:20.109> pumps<00:04:20.500> already<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:21.220> don't

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
four and a half pumps already I don't

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.240 
four and a half pumps already I don't
know<00:04:22.090> if<00:04:22.150> you<00:04:22.240> can<00:04:22.419> see<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:22.750> on<00:04:22.840> camera<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.320> my

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
know if you can see it on camera but my

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.880 
know if you can see it on camera but my
paws<00:04:24.550> do<00:04:24.940> look<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.540> little<00:04:25.990> bit<00:04:26.260> more<00:04:26.410> obvious

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
paws do look a little bit more obvious

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.670 
paws do look a little bit more obvious
than<00:04:27.250> usual<00:04:27.760> so<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:28.450> can<00:04:28.750> still<00:04:29.020> see<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.410> scars

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
than usual so I can still see the scars

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.320 
than usual so I can still see the scars
on<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:29.979> side<00:04:30.160> of<00:04:30.280> my<00:04:30.400> face<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:30.910> I'm<00:04:31.150> just

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
on this side of my face so I'm just

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.940 
on this side of my face so I'm just
gonna<00:04:31.450> see<00:04:31.870> if<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.260> foundation<00:04:32.830> is

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
gonna see if this foundation is

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.880 
gonna see if this foundation is
buildable<00:04:33.400> for<00:04:34.030> those<00:04:34.240> who<00:04:34.930> do<00:04:35.110> have<00:04:35.290> scars<00:04:35.680> or

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
buildable for those who do have scars or

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.460 
buildable for those who do have scars or
blemishes<00:04:36.340> so<00:04:36.580> this<00:04:36.850> would<00:04:37.060> be<00:04:37.300> 5<00:04:38.200> and<00:04:38.229> a<00:04:38.440> half

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
blemishes so this would be 5 and a half

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.680 
blemishes so this would be 5 and a half
pumps<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.340> total<00:04:45.090> one<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.300> features<00:04:46.660> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
pumps in total one of the features of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.260 
pumps in total one of the features of
this<00:04:46.930> foundation<00:04:47.169> obviously<00:04:47.950> it<00:04:48.190> says<00:04:48.490> that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
this foundation obviously it says that

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.860 
this foundation obviously it says that
is<00:04:49.390> smooth<00:04:49.960> and<00:04:50.470> what<00:04:51.370> was<00:04:51.520> it<00:04:51.729> it<00:04:52.479> helps

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
is smooth and what was it it helps

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.540 
is smooth and what was it it helps
smooth<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.560> diffuse<00:04:54.010> the<00:04:54.250> look<00:04:54.400> of

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
smooth and diffuse the look of

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.210 
smooth and diffuse the look of
imperfections<00:04:55.390> so<00:04:55.810> I'm<00:04:56.290> hoping<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:56.830> does<00:04:56.979> that

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
imperfections so I'm hoping it does that

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.980 
imperfections so I'm hoping it does that
to<00:04:57.430> my<00:04:57.580> imperfections<00:04:58.030> but<00:04:58.419> it's<00:04:58.600> proving

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
to my imperfections but it's proving

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.280 
to my imperfections but it's proving
quite<00:04:59.260> as<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.770> challenge<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:01.180> do<00:05:01.419> so<00:05:01.720> online

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
quite as a challenge to do so online

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.370 
quite as a challenge to do so online
however<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:03.610> feel<00:05:04.120> like<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.690> could<00:05:04.990> be<00:05:05.020> here

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
however I do feel like I could be here

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.030 
however I do feel like I could be here
for<00:05:05.620> ages<00:05:05.800> layering<00:05:06.430> up<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.760> foundation<00:05:07.540> and

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
for ages layering up the foundation and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.890 
for ages layering up the foundation and
my<00:05:09.040> scars<00:05:09.400> would<00:05:09.550> still<00:05:09.880> be<00:05:10.000> exposed<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:10.750> with

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
my scars would still be exposed so with

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.740 
my scars would still be exposed so with
this<00:05:11.080> one<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.380> definitely<00:05:11.979> would<00:05:12.280> say<00:05:12.310> that<00:05:12.750> I'd

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
this one I definitely would say that I'd

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.840 
this one I definitely would say that I'd
have<00:05:14.020> to<00:05:14.200> use<00:05:14.229> a<00:05:14.380> separate<00:05:14.800> concealer<00:05:15.190> to

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
have to use a separate concealer to

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.659 
have to use a separate concealer to
conceal<00:05:16.000> all<00:05:16.540> my<00:05:16.750> blemishes<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.919> with<00:05:18.160> 5<00:05:18.400> pumps

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.820 
conceal all my blemishes so with 5 pumps
this<00:05:18.970> is<00:05:19.090> what<00:05:19.270> I've<00:05:19.419> achieved<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:20.320> don't<00:05:20.740> know

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
this is what I've achieved I don't know

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.280 
this is what I've achieved I don't know
if<00:05:20.890> you<00:05:20.979> can<00:05:21.160> see<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.460> on<00:05:21.550> camera<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:22.210> my<00:05:22.960> paws

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
if you can see it on camera but my paws

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.950 
if you can see it on camera but my paws
do<00:05:23.650> look<00:05:24.010> a<00:05:24.250> little<00:05:24.729> bit<00:05:24.970> more<00:05:25.120> obvious<00:05:25.600> than

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
do look a little bit more obvious than

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
do look a little bit more obvious than
usual

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
I hope you enjoyed the demo hope it was

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.490 
I hope you enjoyed the demo hope it was
useful<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.970> my<00:05:36.180> my<00:05:36.570> thoughts<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.200> this

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
useful and so my my thoughts on this

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.400 
useful and so my my thoughts on this
foundation<00:05:37.980> I<00:05:38.990> think<00:05:39.990> this<00:05:40.170> would<00:05:40.380> be

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
foundation I think this would be

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.100 
foundation I think this would be
well-suited<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.340> those<00:05:41.700> with<00:05:42.120> normal<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.870> dry

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
well-suited to those with normal to dry

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.040 
well-suited to those with normal to dry

skin it is a very wet foundation I know
I<00:05:46.200> keep<00:05:46.440> saying<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:46.800> word<00:05:47.040> but<00:05:47.250> that's

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
I keep saying that word but that's

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.910

that's what came to me as I was using it

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.350 
that's what came to me as I was using it
was<00:05:50.040> very<00:05:50.600> wet<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:52.670> feel<00:05:53.670> like<00:05:53.880> it<00:05:54.060> wouldn't

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360

amazingly enough it doesn't look cakey
on<00:06:20.850> my<00:06:21.000> face<00:06:21.300> but<00:06:22.080> at<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.590> expensive<00:06:23.130> price<00:06:23.340> as
