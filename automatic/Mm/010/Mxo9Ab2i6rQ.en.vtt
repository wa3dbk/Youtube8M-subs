when<00:01:53.890> Halo<00:01:54.220> came<00:01:54.430> out<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:55.000> did<00:01:55.210> due<00:01:55.420> diligence

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
when Halo came out we did due diligence

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.600 
when Halo came out we did due diligence
on<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.110> number<00:01:56.410> of<00:01:56.500> partners<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.100> number<00:01:57.430> one

on a number of partners the number one

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.310 
on a number of partners the number one
requirement<00:01:57.970> was<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.690> didn't<00:01:58.990> impact

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
requirement was that it didn't impact

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.470 
requirement was that it didn't impact
and<00:01:59.590> play<00:01:59.830> at<00:02:00.220> all<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:00.670> have<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> classic<00:02:01.360> you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
and play at all you have a classic you

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.420 
and play at all you have a classic you
have<00:02:01.660> something<00:02:01.960> that's<00:02:02.140> just<00:02:02.380> magical<00:02:03.310> right

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
have something that's just magical right

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.010 
have something that's just magical right
if<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.700> go<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.030> tinker<00:02:04.330> with<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.630> you're

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
if you go and tinker with it you're

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.420 
if you go and tinker with it you're
gonna<00:02:05.140> lose<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.500> magic<00:02:05.830> what<00:02:06.010> we<00:02:06.130> really

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
gonna lose that magic what we really

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.100 
gonna lose that magic what we really
needed<00:02:06.610> was<00:02:06.730> someone<00:02:07.180> who<00:02:07.420> could<00:02:07.570> work<00:02:07.810> with

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
needed was someone who could work with

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.320 
needed was someone who could work with
our<00:02:08.320> existing<00:02:08.800> physics<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.460> gameplay<00:02:09.850> engine

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
our existing physics and gameplay engine

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.120 
our existing physics and gameplay engine
Sabre<00:02:10.570> popped<00:02:10.929> up<00:02:11.140> really<00:02:11.440> quickly<00:02:11.710> they're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
Sabre popped up really quickly they're

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.740 
Sabre popped up really quickly they're
like<00:02:12.310> yeah<00:02:12.490> we<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.790> do<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.480> make<00:02:13.600> the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
like yeah we can do this we can make the

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.080 
like yeah we can do this we can make the
game<00:02:13.900> look<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.890> current<00:02:15.280> generation<00:02:15.820> game

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
game look like a current generation game

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.690 
game look like a current generation game
and<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.840> can<00:02:17.020> do<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> by<00:02:17.470> using<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:18.280> original

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
and we can do it by using the original

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.000 
and we can do it by using the original
Halo<00:02:18.820> one<00:02:19.150> engine<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.630> gameplay<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.500> Halo<00:02:20.770> one

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
Halo one engine the gameplay in Halo one

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.680 
Halo one engine the gameplay in Halo one
is<00:02:21.250> what's<00:02:21.520> called<00:02:21.760> deterministic<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.570> other

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
is what's called deterministic in other

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.300 
is what's called deterministic in other
words<00:02:22.870> if<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.200> feed<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.770> engine<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.130> same

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
words if you feed the engine the same

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.710 
words if you feed the engine the same
input<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.850> game<00:02:25.000> will<00:02:25.120> behave<00:02:25.420> in<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> same

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
input the game will behave in the same

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.390 
input the game will behave in the same
way<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.380> if<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.830> apply<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.160> principle

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
way and if you can apply this principle

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.580 
way and if you can apply this principle
across<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.940> network<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.720> two<00:02:28.930> game

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
across a network you can have two game

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.840 
across a network you can have two game
worlds<00:02:29.980> completely<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.489> sync

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
worlds completely in sync

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.000 
worlds completely in sync
so<00:02:30.970> rather<00:02:31.209> than<00:02:31.330> simulate<00:02:32.050> halos<00:02:32.560> original

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so rather than simulate halos original

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.770 
so rather than simulate halos original
game<00:02:33.160> player<00:02:33.459> in<00:02:33.640> halos<00:02:33.970> original<00:02:34.390> physics

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
game player in halos original physics

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.330 
game player in halos original physics
we're<00:02:35.200> able<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.470> actually<00:02:35.650> use<00:02:36.160> them

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
we're able to actually use them

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.190 
we're able to actually use them
completely<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.300> car<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.510> master<00:02:37.930> trainer

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
completely so the car is master trainer

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.680 
completely so the car is master trainer
bugs<00:02:38.860> engine<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.370> fairly<00:02:39.910> old<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:40.390> so<00:02:40.570> we'll

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
bugs engine is fairly old but so we'll

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
bugs engine is fairly old but so we'll
have<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.959> make<00:02:41.110> sure<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.739> all<00:02:41.920> kind<00:02:42.100> of

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
have to make sure that it all kind of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.130 
have to make sure that it all kind of
fits<00:02:42.310> together<00:02:42.610> as<00:02:43.300> I'm<00:02:43.450> gonna<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.900> speed

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
fits together as I'm gonna have to speed

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.660 
fits together as I'm gonna have to speed
up<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.380> engine<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.709> make<00:02:44.830> sure<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.100> works<00:02:45.489> in

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
up the engine to make sure it works in

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.870 
up the engine to make sure it works in
two<00:02:45.790> therefore<00:02:47.220> we've<00:02:48.220> done<00:02:48.370> some<00:02:48.520> deliberate

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
two therefore we've done some deliberate

two therefore we've done some deliberate
things<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.270> library<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:50.110> easier<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.590> navigate

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
things the library is easier to navigate

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.680 
things the library is easier to navigate
now<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.250> use<00:02:51.459> lighting<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.000> textures<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.420> make

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
now we use lighting and textures to make

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.180 
now we use lighting and textures to make
it<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.840> little<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:53.170> simpler<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.650> pillars<00:02:53.980> are

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
it a little bit simpler the pillars are

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.190 
it a little bit simpler the pillars are

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
turned out better than we expected in

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.870 
turned out better than we expected in
3ds<00:06:00.900> probably<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.530> number<00:06:01.860> one<00:06:02.100> it<00:06:02.490> was<00:06:02.670> it

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
3ds probably the number one it was it

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.460 
3ds probably the number one it was it
was<00:06:03.000> unexpected<00:06:03.300> it<00:06:03.870> was<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:03.990> bonus

and<00:06:04.650> I<00:06:05.490> don't<00:06:05.820> see<00:06:06.450> 3d<00:06:06.750> very<00:06:07.110> well<00:06:07.350> but<00:06:07.590> it

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
and I don't see 3d very well but it

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.110 
and I don't see 3d very well but it
really<00:06:07.890> worked<00:06:08.070> for<00:06:08.190> me<00:06:08.310> so<00:06:08.610> for<00:06:08.970> some<00:06:09.090> reason

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
really worked for me so for some reason

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.730 
really worked for me so for some reason
it<00:06:09.420> just<00:06:09.450> pops<00:06:09.780> in<00:06:09.990> halo<00:06:10.260> in<00:06:10.320> a<00:06:10.410> way<00:06:10.500> that<00:06:10.680> it

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
it just pops in halo in a way that it

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.710 
it just pops in halo in a way that it
doesn't<00:06:11.070> in<00:06:11.250> other<00:06:11.700> games<00:06:12.000> or<00:06:12.180> even<00:06:12.210> movies

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
doesn't in other games or even movies

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.650 
doesn't in other games or even movies
yeah<00:06:13.560> I'd<00:06:13.740> say<00:06:13.920> the<00:06:14.100> feature<00:06:14.910> that<00:06:15.270> surprised

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
yeah I'd say the feature that surprised

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.570 
yeah I'd say the feature that surprised
me<00:06:15.870> the<00:06:15.990> most<00:06:16.020> was<00:06:16.530> Kinect<00:06:17.130> so<00:06:17.280> we've<00:06:17.400> got<00:06:17.550> a

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
me the most was Kinect so we've got a

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.860 
me the most was Kinect so we've got a

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.870 
things you've captured move the model
around<00:06:33.930> in<00:06:34.290> 3d<00:06:34.530> and<00:06:34.890> it<00:06:35.280> gives<00:06:35.430> you<00:06:35.550> a<00:06:35.580> bit<00:06:35.760> of<00:06:35.790> a

characters are for me when I think about
Halo<00:06:40.650> I<00:06:40.680> think<00:06:41.040> about<00:06:41.250> looking<00:06:41.880> around<00:06:42.240> and

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540

Halo I think about looking around and
just<00:06:42.690> scope<00:06:43.470> and<00:06:43.620> the<00:06:43.710> scale<00:06:43.740> of<00:06:44.190> everything

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
just scope and the scale of everything

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.310
