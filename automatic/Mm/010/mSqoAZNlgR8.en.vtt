I'm going to show you the actual map so

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.790 
I'm going to show you the actual map so
humans<00:00:51.220> they<00:00:51.970> will<00:00:52.180> fawn<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.809> that<00:00:52.989> room<00:00:53.350> click

humans they will fawn in that room click

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.990 
humans they will fawn in that room click
there<00:00:54.070> and<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.570> laboratory<00:00:58.920> exactly<00:00:59.920> yeah<00:01:00.790> up

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
there and the laboratory exactly yeah up

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
there and the laboratory exactly yeah up
there

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
there

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.210 
there
and<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:03.239> zombies<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.750> hope<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.799> had<00:01:04.920> three

and the zombies have hope they had three

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.210 
and the zombies have hope they had three
ways<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.600> have<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.320> power

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
ways to get in they have that power

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.790 
ways to get in they have that power
we<00:01:09.220> can<00:01:09.400> jump<00:01:09.580> up<00:01:09.790> over<00:01:10.180> here<00:01:11.140> this<00:01:11.440> way<00:01:11.650> is<00:01:11.710> a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
we can jump up over here this way is a

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.620 
we can jump up over here this way is a
pretty<00:01:12.010> good<00:01:12.190> entrance<00:01:12.520> but<00:01:12.850> there's<00:01:13.060> an

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
pretty good entrance but there's an

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.540 
pretty good entrance but there's an
auditory<00:01:14.380> bear<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.979> humans<00:01:15.310> connect

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
auditory bear that the humans connect

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.149 
auditory bear that the humans connect
they<00:01:15.820> initiated<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:17.530> easy<00:01:17.830> to<00:01:18.010> break

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
they initiated that's easy to break

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.070 
they initiated that's easy to break
through<00:01:18.400> also<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:21.690> then<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:25.090> here<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.869> show

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
through also and then up here to show

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.950 
through also and then up here to show
you<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.410> auditory<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.330> can<00:01:28.540> use<00:01:28.720> outer

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
you the auditory and you can use outer

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.499 
you the auditory and you can use outer
courts<00:01:29.350> in<00:01:29.470> anything<00:01:29.770> official<00:01:30.610> awesome<00:01:31.119> so
