00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:35.020
 If the material is processed with technology that can handle the material 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.950
 The simple principle that formative creation is a clear definition of what I do 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.470
 seams like 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:43.510
 So the logic that has a material interest in the subject material from the impression 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.660
 I was looking for 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:53.680
 This new work is a non-submerged series, 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.629
 It means a wave pattern in French . 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:04.000
 It means that when you overlap, a new pattern is formed. 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.560
 I do not treat wood as a material, but as a conceptual material. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.990
 I wanted to cover it. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.370
 So you can use this effect to make a new kind of wood and use it as a material. 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.140
 I wanted to see you. 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.070
 In order to make the effect, 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.330
 Overlapping effect similar to wood pattern 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.960
 When you look at it, it looks different depending on the point of view. 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.960
 As if it were moving like a wave 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 U 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:44.990
 I was concentrating mainly on expressing the formative work I was going to study in Korea. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.580
 At the time of studying in the Netherlands , I concentrated on research that rationally solved the problem logically. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.960
 I think I did. 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:58.220
 Since then, when I came back to Korea, 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:04.190
 Also, since it is one day, and I express the intangible ideas in the form of a type of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.550
 I can regulate it to the extent that it gives the form 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.550
 There is 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.980
 U 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:25.030
 There is a tendency to be obsessed with something that is very trivial or unremarkable. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:28.370
 It's a principle that you tend to be very obsessed with digging into these things. 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.160
 The process of discovering phenomena and principles 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.190
 I think it's a kind of water lily to me. 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:41.630
 Naturally in the process of digging 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.620
 Yiradeunji reminded of the uh following: Or the kids seemed to have an idea born 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.650
 Being 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650
 U 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:59.260
 Put everything on the variable to modify some presence out in the field 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.850
 I think it's important. 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:13.090
 I think I have to work a weapon I had to deal with one variable 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:18.200
 How flexible are you to manipulate variables while working in space ? 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:20.200
 Uh, and I think that the most important concern of my work 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
 U 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.080
 I want to be the most natural artist to work on 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.080
 U 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.650
 U
