00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
works very nicely for that it picks up

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.750 
works very nicely for that it picks up
the<00:00:58.620> littlest<00:00:58.949> amount<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> powder<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.730> can

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
the littlest amount of powder you can

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
the littlest amount of powder you can
build<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> up<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.750> pack<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.559> it

build it up and pack it on and then it
just<00:01:01.710> fits<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.340> nicely<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:02.940> i've<00:01:03.120> seen

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
just fits really nicely here i've seen

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.630 
just fits really nicely here i've seen
people<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.899> around<00:01:04.170> their<00:01:04.500> nose<00:01:04.799> for

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
people use it around their nose for

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
people use it around their nose for
putting<00:01:06.240> powder<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:06.780> concealer<00:01:06.990> i<00:01:07.380> haven't

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
putting powder or concealer i haven't

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.030 
putting powder or concealer i haven't
tried<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.520> liquid<00:01:09.650> products<00:01:10.650> i<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.890> use

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
tried it with liquid products i just use

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
tried it with liquid products i just use
it<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.189> powder<00:01:11.490> around<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.880> eyes<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
it for powder around my eyes but it is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.480 
it for powder around my eyes but it is
pretty<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:15.380> dense<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.830> would<00:01:17.130> say<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
pretty um dense I would say it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.609 
pretty um dense I would say it's
probably<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.390> most<00:01:18.570> dense<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> them

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
probably the most dense of all of them

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.080 
probably the most dense of all of them
and<00:01:19.799> that's<00:01:19.920> probably<00:01:20.220> due<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.790> fact<00:01:20.939> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
and that's probably due to the fact that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
and that's probably due to the fact that
it's<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.710> tapered<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:24.659> next

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it's so tapered but that's that one next

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.179 
it's so tapered but that's that one next
is<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.680> bronze<00:01:27.080> brush<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.740> tapered

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
is the bronze brush and it's tapered

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
is the bronze brush and it's tapered
kind<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.210> icon<00:01:30.570> looks<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.780> my

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
kind of like this icon looks like my

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
kind of like this icon looks like my
blush<00:01:31.290> brush<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.369> bit<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
blush brush but it's a little bit more

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.130 
blush brush but it's a little bit more
full<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.950> says<00:01:35.689> expertly<00:01:36.689> apply

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
full and this one says expertly apply

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.170 
full and this one says expertly apply
and<00:01:37.409> blend<00:01:37.530> bronzer<00:01:38.159> all<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.729> face<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and blend bronzer all over your face to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.319 
and blend bronzer all over your face to
create<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> natural<00:01:39.869> looking<00:01:40.470> glow<00:01:41.090> so<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> don't

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
create a natural looking glow so I don't

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.600 
create a natural looking glow so I don't
wear<00:01:42.420> bronzer<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.020> try<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.890> blush<00:01:44.220> once

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
wear bronzer I try this with blush once

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
wear bronzer I try this with blush once
and<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.750> think<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.380> might<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> fact<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and I think it might be the fact that I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.780 
and I think it might be the fact that I
use<00:01:47.250> mineral<00:01:47.579> blush<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.159> tips<00:01:50.520> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
use mineral blush but the the tips of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.240 
use mineral blush but the the tips of
the<00:01:51.030> bristles<00:01:51.720> are<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.140> even<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:53.070> even

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the bristles are not even like even

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.889 
the bristles are not even like even
though<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:53.939> short<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.750> these

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
though these are short and then these

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
though these are short and then these
are<00:01:54.960> taller<00:01:55.290> they're<00:01:55.680> not<00:01:55.890> even<00:01:56.280> throughout

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
are taller they're not even throughout

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
are taller they're not even throughout
so<00:01:57.329> when<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.659> applying<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.140> blush<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.770> would

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so when I was applying my blush it would

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.190 
so when I was applying my blush it would
apply<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.329> really<00:02:00.329> blotchy<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.899> there'd<00:02:01.200> be

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
apply it really blotchy and there'd be

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.609 
apply it really blotchy and there'd be
like<00:02:01.320> darker<00:02:02.149> pigment<00:02:03.149> spots<00:02:03.479> all<00:02:03.869> over<00:02:03.930> my

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
like darker pigment spots all over my

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.370 
like darker pigment spots all over my
face<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.299> I<00:02:06.299> decided<00:02:06.570> not<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.170> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
face so I decided not to use it for that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.949 
face so I decided not to use it for that
I<00:02:07.649> did<00:02:08.580> try<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:08.879> use<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.390> my<00:02:09.539> liquid

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
I did try to use it with my liquid

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.719 
I did try to use it with my liquid
foundation

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
foundation

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.479 
foundation
because<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.030> know<00:02:11.090> some<00:02:11.599> people<00:02:11.629> apply<00:02:12.489> there's

because I know some people apply there's

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.759 
because I know some people apply there's
like<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> similar<00:02:13.940> brush<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.540> Sigma<00:02:14.900> has<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:15.739> I

cheeks contoured domed brush I'll be

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.130

honest<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.730> actually<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:47.150> not<00:02:47.390> used<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:47.900> one

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
honest I actually have not used this one

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.589 
honest I actually have not used this one
I<00:02:48.319> don't<00:02:48.500> know<00:02:48.739> really<00:02:49.310> what<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.670> use<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.269> for

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
I don't know really what to use it for

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.839 
I don't know really what to use it for
it<00:02:51.440> kind<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:51.709> gets<00:02:51.829> bigger<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.370> the<00:02:52.489> sides<00:02:52.700> and

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
it kind of gets bigger on the sides and

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.940 
it kind of gets bigger on the sides and
then<00:02:53.000> gets<00:02:53.209> tapered<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.109> I<00:02:54.379> guess<00:02:54.769> you<00:02:54.890> could

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
then gets tapered in I guess you could

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.619 
then gets tapered in I guess you could
use<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.430> blush<00:02:55.700> brush<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.180> think<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.540> would

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
use it as a blush brush I think it would

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.900 
use it as a blush brush I think it would
work<00:02:56.660> better<00:02:56.989> for<00:02:57.349> bronzer<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.250> here<00:02:58.730> or

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
work better for bronzer like here or

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.819 
work better for bronzer like here or
maybe<00:02:59.299> like<00:02:59.510> an<00:02:59.690> upper<00:02:59.989> highlighter<00:03:00.500> like

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
maybe like an upper highlighter like

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.190 
maybe like an upper highlighter like
highlight<00:03:01.190> down<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> nose<00:03:01.700> or<00:03:02.200> something

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
highlight down the nose or something

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.949 
highlight down the nose or something
like<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.250> but<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.879> just<00:03:05.090> don't<00:03:05.329> have<00:03:05.599> a<00:03:05.629> use

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
like that but I just don't have a use

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.720 
like that but I just don't have a use
for<00:03:05.989> it<00:03:06.500> all<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.739> brushes<00:03:07.069> I<00:03:07.370> use<00:03:07.430> are

used it to put on powder so it's just

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.170 
used it to put on powder so it's just
flat<00:03:39.799> it's<00:03:40.069> like<00:03:40.220> this<00:03:40.400> I<00:03:40.549> was<00:03:40.700> really<00:03:40.849> excited

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
flat it's like this I was really excited

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.270 
flat it's like this I was really excited
about<00:03:41.389> this<00:03:41.599> one<00:03:41.810> because<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.680> know<00:03:42.739> physicians

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
about this one because I know physicians

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.190 
about this one because I know physicians
formula<00:03:43.579> has<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:43.940> flat<00:03:44.329> one<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.720> think<00:03:44.870> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
formula has a flat one I think the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.220 
formula has a flat one I think the
handles<00:03:45.859> like<00:03:46.040> probably<00:03:47.000> like<00:03:47.269> this<00:03:47.690> long<00:03:47.989> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
handles like probably like this long and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.569 
handles like probably like this long and
then<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.440> bristles<00:03:48.829> themselves<00:03:49.340> are<00:03:49.430> like

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
then the bristles themselves are like

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.150 
then the bristles themselves are like
this<00:03:50.169> so<00:03:51.169> I<00:03:51.200> wanted<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.500> try<00:03:51.709> that<00:03:51.739> one<00:03:52.040> but

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
this so I wanted to try that one but

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.530 
this so I wanted to try that one but
since<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.459> one<00:03:52.639> came<00:03:52.849> in<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.030> kit<00:03:53.209> I<00:03:53.239> just

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
since this one came in the kit I just

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.710 
since this one came in the kit I just
decided<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:54.019> go<00:03:54.109> with<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.379> one<00:03:54.440> um<00:03:54.739> I<00:03:55.720> don't

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
decided to go with this one um I don't

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.920 
decided to go with this one um I don't
know<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:57.680> I<00:03:57.950> can<00:03:58.010> compare<00:03:58.549> this<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:59.150> my<00:03:59.629> other

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
know if I can compare this to my other

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.080 
know if I can compare this to my other
powder<00:04:00.290> brushes<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:00.889> this<00:04:01.310> one<00:04:01.519> again<00:04:01.639> is

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
powder brushes because this one again is

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.659 
powder brushes because this one again is
not<00:04:02.720> dense<00:04:03.139> at<00:04:03.319> all<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.980> when<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.190> try<00:04:04.639> to

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
not dense at all like when you try to

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.759 
not dense at all like when you try to
apply<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.239> your<00:04:05.329> face<00:04:05.629> it<00:04:06.200> kind<00:04:06.500> of<00:04:06.560> just

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
apply it to your face it kind of just

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.890 
apply it to your face it kind of just
like<00:04:06.859> spurts<00:04:07.790> out<00:04:08.000> in<00:04:08.299> every<00:04:08.540> which<00:04:08.870> direction

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
like spurts out in every which direction

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.770 
like spurts out in every which direction
so<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.739> don't<00:04:10.099> exactly<00:04:10.459> know<00:04:10.940> how<00:04:11.239> much

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
so you don't exactly know how much

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.659 
so you don't exactly know how much
powder<00:04:12.049> you're<00:04:12.290> getting<00:04:12.560> on<00:04:12.650> your<00:04:12.769> face<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.280> I

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
powder you're getting on your face and I

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.810 
powder you're getting on your face and I
also<00:04:13.819> feel<00:04:14.180> like<00:04:14.209> it's<00:04:14.449> a<00:04:14.510> little<00:04:14.629> small<00:04:15.260> for<00:04:15.820> a

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
also feel like it's a little small for a

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.880 
also feel like it's a little small for a
powder<00:04:17.660> brush<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.199> maybe<00:04:18.349> it's<00:04:18.590> actually

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
powder brush so maybe it's actually

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.729 
powder brush so maybe it's actually
better<00:04:19.039> just<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.459> use<00:04:19.640> as<00:04:19.909> to<00:04:20.780> buff<00:04:21.019> powder<00:04:21.440> off

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
better just to use as to buff powder off

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.500 
better just to use as to buff powder off
of<00:04:22.010> your<00:04:22.159> face

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
of your face

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.720 
of your face
or<00:04:24.170> maybe<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.800> know<00:04:24.890> something<00:04:25.190> like<00:04:25.370> around

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
or maybe you know something like around

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.610 
or maybe you know something like around
here<00:04:26.270> or<00:04:26.510> I<00:04:26.570> don't<00:04:26.840> know<00:04:26.960> maybe<00:04:27.020> could<00:04:27.350> turn<00:04:27.500> it

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
here or I don't know maybe could turn it

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.610 
here or I don't know maybe could turn it
like<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:27.950> use<00:04:28.250> as<00:04:28.430> a<00:04:29.050> as<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.110> bronzer

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
like this and use as a as a bronzer

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.090 
like this and use as a as a bronzer
brush<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.280> um<00:04:32.350> so<00:04:33.350> in<00:04:33.470> terms<00:04:33.650> of<00:04:33.800> if<00:04:33.950> I

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
brush like that um so in terms of if I

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.310 
brush like that um so in terms of if I
recommend<00:04:34.550> this<00:04:34.910> set<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.420> actually<00:04:35.660> don't

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
recommend this set I actually don't

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.220 
recommend this set I actually don't
think<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.890> do<00:04:37.390> just<00:04:38.390> because<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.660> was<00:04:38.990> really

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
think I do just because I was really

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.390 
think I do just because I was really
expecting<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.650> brushes<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.130> be<00:04:40.220> a<00:04:40.250> lot<00:04:40.370> more

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
expecting the brushes to be a lot more

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.550 
expecting the brushes to be a lot more
dense<00:04:40.730> of<00:04:40.940> course<00:04:41.210> they're<00:04:41.420> very<00:04:41.750> very<00:04:42.080> very

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
dense of course they're very very very

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.850 
dense of course they're very very very
soft<00:04:43.040> um<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.450> really<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.720> only<00:04:44.840> brush<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.800> I

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
soft um but really the only brush that I

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.010 
soft um but really the only brush that I
use<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.610> get<00:04:46.820> good<00:04:47.000> use<00:04:47.210> out<00:04:47.330> of<00:04:47.390> is<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.810> one

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
use and get good use out of is this one

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.110 
use and get good use out of is this one
but<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.590> I<00:04:49.040> don't<00:04:49.520> think<00:04:49.580> they<00:04:49.790> sell<00:04:49.970> it

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
but this one I don't think they sell it

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.940 
but this one I don't think they sell it
separately<00:04:50.510> and<00:04:50.780> definitely<00:04:51.260> don't<00:04:51.470> buy<00:04:51.890> the

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
separately and definitely don't buy the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.190 
separately and definitely don't buy the
whole<00:04:52.220> set<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.820> 15-dollar<00:04:53.330> set<00:04:53.720> just<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.050> get

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
whole set the 15-dollar set just to get

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.850 
whole set the 15-dollar set just to get
this<00:04:54.350> brush<00:04:54.620> um<00:04:55.840> it<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:56.990> great<00:04:57.170> for<00:04:57.350> travel

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
this brush um it is great for travel

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
this brush um it is great for travel
though<00:04:58.010> if<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.280> don't<00:04:58.400> wanna<00:04:58.520> bring<00:04:58.670> a<00:04:58.730> lot<00:04:58.850> of

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
though if you don't wanna bring a lot of

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.770 
though if you don't wanna bring a lot of
brushes<00:04:59.210> you<00:04:59.330> just<00:04:59.480> want<00:04:59.600> to<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.750> throw

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
brushes you just want to like throw

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.020 
brushes you just want to like throw
these<00:05:00.050> in<00:05:00.200> a<00:05:00.260> plastic<00:05:00.470> bag<00:05:00.860> that's<00:05:01.580> um<00:05:01.790> that's

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
these in a plastic bag that's um that's

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.060 
these in a plastic bag that's um that's
what<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.510> was<00:05:02.630> excited<00:05:02.990> for<00:05:03.020> so<00:05:03.440> maybe<00:05:03.650> if<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:04.010> do

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
what I was excited for so maybe if I do

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.010 
what I was excited for so maybe if I do
need<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.490> use<00:05:04.850> them<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.660> would<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:05.870> nice

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
need to use them that would be nice

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.750 
need to use them that would be nice
because<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.650> lot<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:06.980> brushes<00:05:07.340> have<00:05:07.490> long

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
because a lot of brushes have long

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.980 
because a lot of brushes have long
handles<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.480> sometimes<00:05:08.840> that's

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
handles and sometimes that's

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.040 
handles and sometimes that's
inconvenient<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.950> fit<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.490> your<00:05:11.000> luggage<00:05:11.390> or

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
inconvenient to fit in your luggage or

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.100 
inconvenient to fit in your luggage or
whatever<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.820> think<00:05:14.180> it's<00:05:14.480> a<00:05:14.600> great<00:05:14.690> idea<00:05:14.780> I

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
whatever so I think it's a great idea I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.690 
whatever so I think it's a great idea I
just<00:05:15.380> wish<00:05:15.530> the<00:05:15.770> brushes<00:05:16.190> were<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> little<00:05:16.520> bit

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
just wish the brushes were a little bit
