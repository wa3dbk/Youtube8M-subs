for<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> biasing<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.020> tubes<00:01:07.289> also<00:01:08.160> we've

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
for the biasing of the tubes also we've

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.270 
for the biasing of the tubes also we've
got<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.670> Infinium<00:01:09.180> tube<00:01:09.630> life<00:01:10.380> multiplier

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
got the Infinium tube life multiplier

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.029 
got the Infinium tube life multiplier
technology<00:01:12.020> inside<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.320> what<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.590> means<00:01:13.800> is

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
technology inside and what that means is

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.650 
technology inside and what that means is
that<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.610> tubes<00:01:14.910> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> last<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.539> lot

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
that your tubes going to last a lot

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.150 
that your tubes going to last a lot
longer<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> what<00:01:16.440> all<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> us<00:01:16.800> guitar

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
longer which is what all of us guitar

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.130 
longer which is what all of us guitar
players<00:01:17.399> love<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:17.970> tubes<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> last<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.930> long

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
players love is tubes that last a long

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.139 
players love is tubes that last a long
time<00:01:19.470> there's<00:01:19.800> nothing<00:01:20.310> wrong<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.670> that

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
time there's nothing wrong with that

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.719 
time there's nothing wrong with that
so<00:01:21.660> it's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.289> way<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> keep<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.100> tone<00:01:23.460> going

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
so it's a way to keep the tone going

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.120 
so it's a way to keep the tone going
longer<00:01:24.090> okay<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.050> making<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.410> great<00:01:25.619> sound

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
longer okay and making a great sound

longer okay and making a great sound
happen<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.149> cage<00:01:27.390> style<00:01:27.750> amplifier<00:01:28.289> as

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
happen it's a cage style amplifier as

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.810 
happen it's a cage style amplifier as
you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.130> glorious<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you can see it's a glorious thing to

look at it's a very cool looking

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
look at it's a very cool looking
amplifier<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.460> got<00:01:32.640> tone<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> match

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
amplifier and it's got tone and match

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.179 
amplifier and it's got tone and match
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.990> hook<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.289> with<00:01:34.440> any<00:01:34.590> cabinet<00:01:35.100> that
