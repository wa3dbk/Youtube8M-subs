analyzed you lost lost to mardy fish and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.400 
analyzed you lost lost to mardy fish and
sort<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> gone<00:00:27.480> through<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.869> worked<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.260> what

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
sort of gone through it worked out what

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.720 
sort of gone through it worked out what
you<00:00:28.500> could<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.680> improved<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> now<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.550> need

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you could have improved and now you need

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.700 
you could have improved and now you need
to<00:00:29.760> get<00:00:29.939> better<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.269> week<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.529> think

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to get better this week I don't think

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.740 
to get better this week I don't think
it's<00:00:31.859> as<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> match<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.450> could<00:00:33.630> analyze

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it's as much of a match I could analyze

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
it's as much of a match I could analyze
very<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.710> had<00:00:34.829> bad<00:00:35.010> start<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> set

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
very much just had bad start to the set

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180 
very much just had bad start to the set
to<00:00:36.480> try<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> not<00:00:37.320> make<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> happen<00:00:37.829> next<00:00:37.980> time

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
to try to not make it happen next time

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.530 
to try to not make it happen next time
but<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.550> sounds<00:00:38.760> also<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.149> control<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
but it sounds also in the control of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
but it sounds also in the control of
your<00:00:39.840> opponent<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.579> happy<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
your opponent and I was happy to where I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.610 
your opponent and I was happy to where I
played<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.510> week<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> look<00:00:43.379> at<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

week<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.070> hole<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> good<00:00:45.239> week

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
week in a hole and that was a good week

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
week in a hole and that was a good week
so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.020> hope<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.559> back<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> up<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.190> again

that<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> Tommy<00:00:50.070> house<00:00:50.280> they<00:00:50.520> know<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
that the Tommy house they know that

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
that the Tommy house they know that
didn't<00:00:51.120> help<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.690> maybe<00:00:51.870> not<00:00:52.079> had

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
didn't help you need maybe not had

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.319 
didn't help you need maybe not had
enough<00:00:52.289> games<00:00:53.129> under<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.520> belt<00:00:53.730> matches<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
enough games under your belt matches and

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.970 
enough games under your belt matches and
about<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> year<00:00:55.020> sure<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> would

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
about this year sure I think it would

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.229 
about this year sure I think it would
have<00:00:56.010> been<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.550> both<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.730> us<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> know

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
have been good for both of us you know

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
have been good for both of us you know
to<00:00:57.300> play<00:00:57.539> against<00:00:57.780> each<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.289> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
to play against each other you can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
to play against each other you can
always<00:00:58.649> learn<00:00:59.129> from<00:00:59.190> playing<00:00:59.640> against<00:00:59.820> other

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
always learn from playing against other

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.209 
always learn from playing against other
top<00:01:00.270> players<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.870> maybe<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.070> needed

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
top players and maybe I really needed

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.950 
top players and maybe I really needed
that<00:01:02.340> match<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> was<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.930> know

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
that match in the time I was in you know

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
that match in the time I was in you know
and<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.350> maybe<00:01:04.530> sort<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.949> threw<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and that maybe sort of threw me off a

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
and that maybe sort of threw me off a
little<00:01:05.729> bit<00:01:05.850> no<00:01:06.720> excuses<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.470> played<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
little bit no excuses more you played a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
little bit no excuses more you played a
great<00:01:07.799> match<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.220> sentence<00:01:08.549> I'll<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.299> say
