sheets<00:00:40.220> now<00:00:41.089> you<00:00:41.150> may<00:00:41.360> have<00:00:41.480> not<00:00:41.600> seen<00:00:41.870> these

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
sheets now you may have not seen these

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.479 
sheets now you may have not seen these
plastic<00:00:42.410> sheets<00:00:42.620> before<00:00:42.949> but<00:00:43.100> they're<00:00:43.250> really

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
plastic sheets before but they're really

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.310 
plastic sheets before but they're really
easy<00:00:43.610> to<00:00:43.730> make<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.449> made<00:00:44.660> up<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.900> raw<00:00:45.110> plastic

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
easy to make the made up of raw plastic

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.649 
easy to make the made up of raw plastic
put<00:00:46.280> into<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:46.610> little<00:00:46.790> grid<00:00:47.089> pattern<00:00:47.449> here

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
put into this little grid pattern here

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.350 
put into this little grid pattern here
and<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.930> get<00:00:48.080> 4<00:00:48.320> plastic<00:00:48.860> sheets<00:00:49.129> per<00:00:49.460> set<00:00:50.239> of

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
and you get 4 plastic sheets per set of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.479 
and you get 4 plastic sheets per set of
this<00:00:50.479> raw<00:00:50.690> plastic<00:00:50.960> now<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.799> actually<00:00:52.100> get<00:00:52.339> the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
this raw plastic now to actually get the

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.950 
this raw plastic now to actually get the
raw<00:00:52.610> plastic<00:00:53.089> all<00:00:53.239> you<00:00:53.390> have<00:00:53.479> to<00:00:53.570> do<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.809> take

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
raw plastic all you have to do is take

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.930 
raw plastic all you have to do is take
normal<00:00:54.199> rubber<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.799> put<00:00:55.070> it<00:00:55.159> into<00:00:55.430> a<00:00:55.460> furnace

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
normal rubber and put it into a furnace

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.910 
normal rubber and put it into a furnace
and<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.239> will<00:00:56.360> turn<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.690> into<00:00:56.750> raw<00:00:57.080> plastic<00:00:57.589> you

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
and it will turn it into raw plastic you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.399 
and it will turn it into raw plastic you
just<00:00:58.129> smelt<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.580> like<00:00:58.729> anything<00:00:58.970> else<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.049> as

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
just smelt it like anything else so as

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:01.539 
just smelt it like anything else so as
you<00:01:00.710> can<00:01:00.830> see<00:01:00.890> here<00:01:01.189> there's<00:01:01.369> a<00:01:01.400> couple

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
you can see here there's a couple

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.130 
you can see here there's a couple
different<00:01:02.030> ways<00:01:02.119> that<00:01:02.299> you<00:01:02.390> can<00:01:02.540> do<00:01:02.689> this<00:01:02.869> it's

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
different ways that you can do this it's

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.830 
different ways that you can do this it's
extremely<00:01:03.799> easy<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:04.189> setup<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.840> it's

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
extremely easy to setup and it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.490 
extremely easy to setup and it's
actually<00:01:06.560> almost<00:01:07.040> an<00:01:07.580> unlimited<00:01:08.260> source<00:01:09.260> of

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually almost an unlimited source of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.100 
actually almost an unlimited source of
food<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.159> setup<00:01:10.490> itself<00:01:10.850> is<00:01:11.060> very<00:01:11.270> easy<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
food the setup itself is very easy the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.960 
food the setup itself is very easy the
idea<00:01:12.470> is<00:01:12.650> that<00:01:12.680> we<00:01:13.040> just<00:01:13.070> need<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:13.460> make<00:01:13.729> an

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
idea is that we just need to make an

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.789 
idea is that we just need to make an
infinite<00:01:14.330> pool<00:01:14.630> of<00:01:14.780> water<00:01:15.020> which<00:01:15.409> for<00:01:15.650> this

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
infinite pool of water which for this

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.180 
infinite pool of water which for this
particular<00:01:16.549> machine<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.360> actually<00:01:17.960> just<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.890> 3

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
particular machine is actually just a 3

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.460 
particular machine is actually just a 3
by<00:01:19.370> 3<00:01:19.400> setup<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.510> water<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.260> only

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
by 3 setup of water and you only

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.640 
by 3 setup of water and you only
actually<00:01:21.800> need<00:01:22.780> three<00:01:23.780> buckets<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.290> water<00:01:24.470> to

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
actually need three buckets of water to

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.410 
actually need three buckets of water to
get<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:25.220> work<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.730> we<00:01:25.850> take<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.090> bucket

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
get this to work so if we take a bucket

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.780 
get this to work so if we take a bucket
and<00:01:27.230> we<00:01:27.350> put<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.800> three<00:01:28.130> different<00:01:28.250> corners

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
and we put it in three different corners

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.570 
and we put it in three different corners
just<00:01:29.170> like<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.500> and<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.040> see<00:01:31.220> that<00:01:31.400> it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
just like this and you can see that it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.160 
just like this and you can see that it
flattens<00:01:32.090> everything<00:01:32.180> out<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.720> make<00:01:32.780> source

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
flattens everything out and make source

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.290 
flattens everything out and make source
blocks<00:01:33.470> for<00:01:33.830> all<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.010> water<00:01:34.220> now<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.909> found<00:01:35.120> the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
blocks for all the water now I found the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.850 
blocks for all the water now I found the
easiest<00:01:35.390> way<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.750> get<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.080> fissure<00:01:36.500> actually

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
easiest way to get this fissure actually

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.840 
easiest way to get this fissure actually
in<00:01:37.010> here<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.090> put<00:01:38.270> another<00:01:39.610> block<00:01:40.610> of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
in here is to put another block of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.430 
in here is to put another block of
marble<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.810> put<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> fissure

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
marble down and to put the fissure

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.620 
marble down and to put the fissure
directly<00:01:42.860> on<00:01:42.950> top<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:44.030> then<00:01:44.180> get<00:01:44.360> rid<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.510> the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
directly on top and then get rid of the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.240 
directly on top and then get rid of the
block<00:01:44.810> underneath<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.500> because<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.010> is<00:01:46.159> an

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
block underneath and because this is an

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.620 
block underneath and because this is an
infinite<00:01:46.640> pool<00:01:46.850> everything<00:01:47.270> should

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
infinite pool everything should

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.140 
infinite pool everything should
automatically<00:01:48.490> fill<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.909> create<00:01:50.090> a

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
automatically fill in and create a

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.920 
automatically fill in and create a
source<00:01:50.390> block<00:01:50.659> underneath<00:01:51.200> there<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:52.690> at<00:01:53.690> this

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
source block underneath there so at this

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.450 
source block underneath there so at this
point<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.409> thing<00:01:54.620> is<00:01:54.740> almost<00:01:55.010> ready<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.340> go

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
point this thing is almost ready to go

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980 
point this thing is almost ready to go
we<00:01:55.610> just<00:01:55.790> need<00:01:55.909> to<00:01:56.000> power<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:56.630> how<00:01:56.750> easy

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
we just need to power it that's how easy

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.990 
we just need to power it that's how easy
this<00:01:57.200> thing<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.590> now<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:58.490> have<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.700> couple

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
this thing is now we have a couple

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.250 
this thing is now we have a couple
different<00:01:59.090> power<00:01:59.450> options<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.020> get<00:02:00.140> these

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
different power options to get these

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.500 
different power options to get these
fisheries<00:02:00.680> working<00:02:01.100> at<00:02:01.220> max<00:02:01.430> capacity<00:02:01.670> the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
fisheries working at max capacity the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.330 
fisheries working at max capacity the
first<00:02:02.780> is<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> steam<00:02:03.380> engine<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:04.220> don't

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
first is a steam engine and I don't

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.800 
first is a steam engine and I don't
really<00:02:04.670> recommend<00:02:05.000> these<00:02:05.270> they're<00:02:05.510> not<00:02:05.540> very

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
really recommend these they're not very

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.810 
really recommend these they're not very
easy<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.229> maintain<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.860> they<00:02:07.310> tend<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.640> take

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
easy to maintain and they tend to take

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.089 
easy to maintain and they tend to take
up<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:08.030> lot<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.209> room<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.440> fisheries<00:02:09.799> can<00:02:09.979> also

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
up a lot of room the fisheries can also

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.800 
up a lot of room the fisheries can also

this<00:02:34.280> over<00:02:34.550> here<00:02:34.730> is<00:02:34.910> just<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.209> low-voltage

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
this over here is just a low-voltage

thing<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.819> want<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.030> figure<00:02:41.239> out<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.569> how<00:02:41.599> we're

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
thing we want to figure out is how we're

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.509 
thing we want to figure out is how we're
actually<00:02:41.989> going<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.380> take<00:02:42.800> advantage<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.400> the

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
actually going to take advantage of the

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:44.890 
actually going to take advantage of the
fish<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.910> are<00:02:44.000> being<00:02:44.150> produced<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:44.660> there's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
fish that are being produced now there's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.449 
fish that are being produced now there's
a<00:02:44.959> couple<00:02:45.140> different<00:02:45.230> ways<00:02:45.560> you<00:02:45.860> can<00:02:46.250> either

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
a couple different ways you can either

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.220 
a couple different ways you can either
put<00:02:46.730> just<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.180> straight<00:02:47.420> chest<00:02:47.660> on<00:02:47.870> top<00:02:48.080> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
put just a straight chest on top of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.870 
put just a straight chest on top of
there<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:48.500> then<00:02:48.650> any<00:02:48.800> fish<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.760> are

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
there and then any fish that are

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.460 
there and then any fish that are
produced<00:02:50.209> by<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.390> fishery<00:02:50.780> will<00:02:50.989> go<00:02:51.110> into<00:02:51.380> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
produced by the fishery will go into the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.650 
produced by the fishery will go into the
chest<00:02:51.709> above<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.130> or<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.150> do<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.300> setup

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
chest above it or you can do a setup

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.870 
chest above it or you can do a setup
like<00:02:53.780> this<00:02:54.140> where<00:02:54.830> you<00:02:54.920> actually<00:02:54.950> pipe<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
like this where you actually pipe the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.610 
like this where you actually pipe the
fish<00:02:56.120> out<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.599> top<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:56.810> into<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.230> furnace

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
fish out of the top and into a furnace

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.470 
fish out of the top and into a furnace
or<00:02:57.769> they'll<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:58.010> automatically<00:02:58.550> cooked<00:02:58.910> now

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
or they'll be automatically cooked now

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.940 
or they'll be automatically cooked now
you<00:02:59.540> don't<00:02:59.810> need<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.959> wooden<00:03:00.200> transport<00:03:00.769> pipe

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
you don't need a wooden transport pipe

actually pump straight into a pipe you

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.250 
actually pump straight into a pipe you
can<00:03:05.239> see<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> fish<00:03:05.750> going<00:03:05.989> in<00:03:06.140> there

can see a fish going in there
automatically<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.730> those<00:03:07.880> will<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.120> right

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
reason we use an ender chest is because

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.039 
reason we use an ender chest is because
our<00:03:19.940> ender<00:03:20.209> chest<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:20.599> tied<00:03:20.810> into<00:03:20.959> a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
centralized sorting system if you

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.350 
centralized sorting system if you
haven't<00:03:25.250> seen<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.700> any<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.090> our<00:03:26.180> other

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
haven't seen it in any of our other

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.910 
haven't seen it in any of our other
videos<00:03:26.780> you're<00:03:26.989> gonna<00:03:27.110> want<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.440> check<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.830> out

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
videos you're gonna want to check it out

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.070 
videos you're gonna want to check it out
but<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.370> will<00:03:28.459> take<00:03:28.730> those<00:03:28.970> fish<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.930> will

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
but it will take those fish it will

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.349 
but it will take those fish it will
automatically<00:03:30.709> pull<00:03:31.040> them<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.310> it'll<00:03:31.970> send

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
automatically pull them out it'll send

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.120 
automatically pull them out it'll send
them<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.870> the<00:03:32.959> furnace<00:03:33.320> to<00:03:33.470> get<00:03:33.650> cooked<00:03:33.920> and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
them to the furnace to get cooked and

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.949 
them to the furnace to get cooked and
then<00:03:34.760> those<00:03:34.970> things<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.390> have<00:03:35.540> been<00:03:35.660> cooked

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
then those things that have been cooked

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.720 
then those things that have been cooked
will<00:03:36.200> automatically<00:03:36.829> get<00:03:36.950> put<00:03:37.190> into<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.489> food

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
will automatically get put into the food

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.509 
will automatically get put into the food
chest<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:38.510> this<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.200> a<00:03:39.260> great<00:03:39.500> way<00:03:39.709> if<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.340> want

chest so this is a great way if you want

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.830 
chest so this is a great way if you want
a<00:03:40.579> bunch<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.940> Fisheries<00:03:41.420> or<00:03:41.570> if<00:03:41.660> you're<00:03:41.810> having

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
a bunch of Fisheries or if you're having

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.949

those other food types you're gonna want

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.440 
those other food types you're gonna want
every<00:03:51.530> one<00:03:51.650> of<00:03:51.709> these<00:03:51.859> machine<00:03:52.579> rigs<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:53.090> be<00:03:53.239> as

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
every one of these machine rigs to be as

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.840 
every one of these machine rigs to be as
simple<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.140> as<00:03:54.410> compact<00:03:54.980> as<00:03:55.160> possible<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850

simple and as compact as possible and
that's<00:03:55.940> what<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:56.239> have<00:03:56.540> achieved<00:03:56.720> by<00:03:57.139> using

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
that's what we have achieved by using

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.640 
that's what we have achieved by using
the<00:03:58.430> centralized<00:03:59.150> sorting<00:03:59.810> machine<00:04:00.230> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
the centralized sorting machine that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.129 
the centralized sorting machine that
takes<00:04:01.250> advantage<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.910> these<00:04:02.030> ender<00:04:02.299> chests<00:04:02.690> so

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
takes advantage of these ender chests so

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.629 
takes advantage of these ender chests so
at<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:03.380> point<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.709> should<00:04:03.739> be<00:04:03.920> all<00:04:04.160> set<00:04:04.459> you

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639
