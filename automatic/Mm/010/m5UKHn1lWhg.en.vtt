00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.859
 I made a very ugly network error 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.199

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.460
 And I'm going to enjoy it and I'll do it. 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.489
 to a point 4.490 version consult good 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 This time, it's not going to be voted on. 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.379
 here it is easier to download here and 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.030
 here you are going to download a point 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 4.404 said in the other video you can 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.579
 always be following new ones 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 new versions because type is it launched 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.620
 steps you may be correcting 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.510
 bugs increasing performance tam 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 so for now the youngest who has 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.589
 Maybe it's a mess here maybe 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.439
 have been downloading will have other 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.990
 so I came back to make another video of how 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.260
 is the Serbian book but it's all a lot 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.930
 simple to find downloading there and let's 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.689
 Let's go to that part of that talk is the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.150
 Server performer 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.090
 Good, we'll open here soon, you'll see. 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.000
 which has two operating systems that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.960
 are 1 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.510
 the newer 32 and 64 bits are and how 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.810
 Do you know which of these yours is yours? 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.180
 computer operates then very simple 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.540
 on your desktop 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.030
 You will click the flag that is 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.250
 just like the bottom page 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.800
 here only on the keyboard is this part 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.460
 alt function control space 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.170
 open it is more secure and it will click the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.740
 coffee break is on the boss's side 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.790
 z and w so close del knows a break and 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.720
 break 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:06.729
 I'll give you an email soon 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.310
 then it will open that control panel 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.899
 or else you can come here that is more 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.709
 easy to handle the right button on the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.810
 computer and properties that gives 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.920
 same 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.830
 so let's go here and here it's there 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.920
 speaking from his memory and below was a 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 system type semi operating system 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.730
 32 bit right then exactly that I 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.340
 I'll have to use the 32-bit beque 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.519
 who's 64 64 is logical and so I use 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.800
 32-bit will not go wrong or I do not know 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.840
 if I have or is some mistake but let's go 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.570
 It looks like you just downloaded here. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.570
 it rains here my downloads folder 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:07.720
 around like there is this easier to do this 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:11.410
 O attack here and play here and ready beauty 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.960
 Now let's play here and you. 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.090
 have to have a nesp process folder 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.820
 put your brain and now I'm going to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.620
 That simpler part is you come 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:29.230
 here in the right bet bet and dictate beauty 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:33.040
 What is the error that only here leaves? 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 show that is the mistake that is going to happen 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.480
 In your home, yes, no, no, he is not. 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.880
 getting access to the craft book 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.340
 to score will be infinitely 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.290
 doing this will not lower the price and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.780
 or anything but it gets expensive then 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.530
 party 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.380
 So we had it right here, and that's it. 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 we have this air and book 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.310
 ok what you want is here facebook is 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.980
 name of the file it will look for 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.040
 travel or this 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.020
 so let's paint it here 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.850
 on it only you can write also 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.020
 but I paint it here that is easier 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.560
 control you and in between 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.590
 or the name that is here is the same 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.660
 Your name is in here then. 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.440
 careful not to pay anything in here 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:30.190
 it only closes and you can run your 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.260
 Normal brain I 32 bits and it goes 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.960
 start generating the files, I'll go 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.040
 cut is fast does not change much 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.530
 extensive 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.800
 Ok folks gave this doniak can close 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.390
 normal, and your brain is ready 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.250
 You put the plugs here. 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.320
 I want you 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.850
 You want to watch my videos, I 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.700
 I'll be doing a lot of video lesson 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.470
 plug in tha is to show that I have the 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.240
 cool plugins here to do yet 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.640
 video then it's exploding does it's me already 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.140
 I made some videos about plug it and it's a 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.440
 server that will be totally different 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.300
 of mode, forget that the plugin I 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.550
 I think it's a lot easier because your 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.080
 friend will not need to install it 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.720
 will stay on the server and it will not 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.000
 add nothing block will only brings 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.990
 some new functions, right? 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.720
 if you want one of your world to use the world 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.630
 that you already have deletes these two these 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.740
 three here and put it there and then you come 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.540
 no server pro pits that this here I think 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.890
 that maybe his first time will do in 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:40.840
 brain right button and open with a 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.100
 notebook 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.170
 it's in the case here ready now you can 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.970
 change the name of the world to make others 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.370
 worlds and in the same folder 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.020
 or you can change the name here 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.840
 It has for what you want 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.590
 so do not forget to put the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.090
 ipc the ones you have in the branches that 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.300
 This is the march here. 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:07.900
 You put here steps ipi in there 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.940
 You must not forget to do it. 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.490
 This is saved and this is the Serbian 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.960
