00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I could believe talking to you today 10 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.550
 at risk goes to another world 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 good, the viola today is finding you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.889
 the bridge is releasing cache memory l2 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 from your computer 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.310
 Beauty, you ask me what it is. 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.230
 memory cache is one of the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.449
 small amount of memory is 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.340
 located inside the processor 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 it has the function of optimizing the system 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.989
 to leave faster 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.350
 She is a small memory even she is 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:46.050
 depending on the models in memory 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.750
 cache l1 l2 if I'm not mistaken it gets two 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.129
 deny being sure but it 's 2 megs 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 she has 1 2 megs is the amount of 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:07.350
 Memory 2014 but has more advanced 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.570
 cache memory l3 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 We're definitely going to have an exact 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.320
 Let's stop talking let's go 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.250
 first open the run of the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.250
 computer from you 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.130
 We're going to be together. 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:47.050
 I'll give it is still inside the goal 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.050
 owners of writing will reissue 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.170
 locate and locate in locate 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.060
 beauty I will not put because I 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.130
 I come here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.540
 after this he will find the opposite is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 so so 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.060
 this word only as level datacash 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.360
 colombia after cai zaragoza after the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.450
 world will get used to the world again 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.430
 both memory RAM memory 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.500
 cache that found your processor 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:34.040
 has in my case is a seller processor 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.260
 1 Celebrate the box of 128 very old 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.410
 same but I 'm only using it to 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.209
 make the video lesson for you 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.190
 So you're going to put so much 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.670
 memory cache that his contract is in 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.670
 my case is the work 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:55.820
 logical that you will start a test here 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.760
 restart your computer by noting 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.160
 another year of life the difference in 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.800
 speed that windows is the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.709
 following when you install windows 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.560
 xp it is my affp affair 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.910
 I do not know others less but when you 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.300
 it's on xp 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:20.090
 he comes off it there is the option he 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.350
 cache l2 it does not run with it two here 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.620
 I'm going to use a show to show 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.810
 you 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.140
 Take the cache 2 you can see 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.140
 here o 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.920
 take the two box 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.010
 here you are looking good in this one for you 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.290
 see box 2 of the 128 in the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.890
 Your computer will also be 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.080
 beauty people look is this is is from 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.569
 tutorials stays here today bete gets 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.569
 here's the next video lesson galley
