and almost float it over the ground and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.160 
and almost float it over the ground and
the<00:00:14.429> reason<00:00:14.790> that's<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.120> good<00:00:15.299> idea<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.900> you're

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the reason that's a good idea is you're

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.590 
the reason that's a good idea is you're
not<00:00:16.350> now<00:00:17.039> pushing<00:00:17.490> against<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.880> ground<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
not now pushing against the ground and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.550 
not now pushing against the ground and
you<00:00:18.660> don't<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> lot<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.289> resistance

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
you don't have a lot of resistance

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
you don't have a lot of resistance
you're<00:00:19.980> not<00:00:20.100> trying<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.369> roll<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.850> dirt<00:00:21.090> it's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you're not trying to roll the dirt it's

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.230 
you're not trying to roll the dirt it's
an<00:00:21.720> incredibly<00:00:22.289> efficient<00:00:22.890> machine<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> it

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
an incredibly efficient machine and it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.960 
an incredibly efficient machine and it
does<00:00:24.390> its<00:00:24.570> job<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.960> well<00:00:25.080> there<00:00:26.070> are<00:00:26.220> only<00:00:26.250> 45

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

production<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.360> our<00:00:39.420> mind<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.489> so

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
production on our mind so you can do so

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.000 
production on our mind so you can do so
much<00:00:41.910> more<00:00:42.120> work<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.140> basically<00:00:43.770> one

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
much more work with with basically one

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.529 
much more work with with basically one
Operator<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.059> makes<00:00:45.360> it

Operator and that's what makes it

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.590 
Operator and that's what makes it
feasible<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> machine<00:00:47.600> this

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
feasible to have the machine this

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840

it's<00:00:51.390> also<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.930> comfort<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.610> were

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it's also about comfort what we were

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.520 
it's also about comfort what we were
