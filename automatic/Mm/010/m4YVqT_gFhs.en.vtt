00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.630

pretty<00:00:34.920> long<00:00:35.100> one

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
pretty long one

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.560 
pretty long one
and<00:00:36.200> I<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:37.800> nervous<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.570> meeting

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
