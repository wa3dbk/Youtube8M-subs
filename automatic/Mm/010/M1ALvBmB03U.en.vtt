 fly and soar over the sea like a 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 young herring gull whose bears the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.130
 blackshape name little gem of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.800
 Made in Italy technology has pardoned 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.349
 agile full of energy passes slender up 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.670
 yellow and white green helmets and fly over 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.169
 the island in the middle of the sea from which it has 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.270
 took flight at the point where 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:27.029
 the Indian Ocean meets new waters 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.700
 towards the pole on a moving island 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.680
 a little over 240 meters long with his 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.809
 runway that ends in momentum in the 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.420
 blue on the horizon the aircraft carrier cavour 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.829
 at the head of the thirtieth naval group 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.809
 who has left behind the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.879
 mozambique and now sail to the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 South Africa along with its helicopters i 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.750
 his planes and his precious cargo 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.780
 made of quality professionalism 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.999
 beauty and solidarity is the system 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.829
 country in motion the campaign promoted 

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.079
 from the navy is entrusted to the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.519
 admiral of division paul iii who 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.679
 after touching the ports more 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.510
 prestigious of the Arabian peninsula is 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.339
 entered its second phase which 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.470
 provides for the circumnavigation of Africa 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.670
 until his return to Italian waters 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.770
 a marriage between the navy 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.960
 blackshape that brings together 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 the experience of naval aviation with 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.230
 entrepreneurial ability 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.660
 the technological innovation of a company 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.160
 of southern Italy with monopoly headquarters that 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.010
 represents a niche of excellence 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.770
 there is an aeronautical company we are 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.700
 a young company we have little more than 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.160
 three years of life 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.820
 we propose to be children of ours 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.980
 time we are confronted with 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.930
 of the institution with a relationship with the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.330
 institutions that that is extremely 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.369
 profitable company in strong expansion 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.470
 born from the initiative of a young person 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.040
 luciano belviso engineer and his 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.680
 partner 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.050
 angel petrosillo departed in 2011 with 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.550
 a regional fund of 25 thousand euros and that 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.220
 is enjoying great success 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.880
 international made of over 60 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.300
 aircraft sold in just over 24 months 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.659
 the expo was involved in this project 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.929
 this campaign 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.319
 and we immediately gave ours 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.479
 availability 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.989
 we're so glad we did 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.519
 let's say the whole operation was 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.840
 absolutely up to the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.470
 expectations we had that I found 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.510
 a rigor and an intelligence that I have 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.810
 also found a component of passion 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.910
 that is that that discriminating when it is 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.540
 choose to do something 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.989
 this is an airplane built with a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.280
 own criterion of larger airplanes 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.660
 its characteristic is that it is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.500
 entirely made on the subject of 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.670
 Composite materials are very materials 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.599
 very stiff the approach of the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.310
 of the composite is also reflected a lot 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:54.180
 in airplane design historically 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.060
 it is said that beautiful airplanes 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.950
 flying well this is indeed true a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.989
 flight other than those never performed a 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.910
 edge of the aircraft carrier that saw the 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.160
 collaboration of the technical staff of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.500
 blackshape and specialized personnel 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.389
 of the ship he witnessed during the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.000
 takeoff and the appontaggio 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.980
 captain of frigate giambattista molteni 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.079
 one of the first pilots of planes and the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.209
 patented navy pilot 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.819
 experimenter at the pilot school test 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.230
 of the us navy of crazy 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.750
 the adventure started with one 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.940
 call in the middle of the night because 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.440
 I was in the United States for work 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.269
 I first thought it was one 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.370
 I'm kidding when I woke up 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.830
 understood that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.510
 were I actually met the engineer 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.400
 belviso and there I realized that 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.019
 we could start talking about one 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 feasibility with a certain margin of 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.360
 success when an aircraft of this 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.799
 lightness meets the turbulence of the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.530
 relative wind on the bridge of a 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.780
 aircraft carrier suffers therefore it was 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.000
 important to understand how much maybe 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.280
 ability of the aircraft to react and 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.790
 keep the parameters of pure necessary 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.980
 for 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.080
 to pontani we had to after the scaffolding 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.520
 we also do not have to brake 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.209
 we have not understood stop hooks 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.819
 arrest 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.980
 the arrest should have taken place 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.510
 exclusively with braking so it is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.970
 experimentation was successful 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.160
 joint venture that saw take off a 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.290
 aim at the Italian aircraft carrier 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.269
 an ultralight aircraft of conception 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.919
 ultra-modern as a symbol of a 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.740
 synergy that manages to act as a flywheel 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.840
 to the excellence of made in Italy in 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.240
 course of the stop in abu dhabi we have 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.550
 We made our first off the 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.320
 performance gave us confidence that 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.169
 count lengths were sufficient 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.820
 on this second phase in South Africa 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.210
 we decided that there were conditions 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.580
 to do 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.030
 our attempts and set-up 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.770
 technically the maneuver was successful 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.340
 my role is to supervise 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.020
 the security of the operation being in 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.190
 radio contact with the driver and damage 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.919
 indications in case of deviations 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.440
 details about everyone on the profile of 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.480
 value of the contact point was a lot 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.120
 important because it was necessary to guarantee the 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.310
 a brake in the space of the rest 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.210
 obviously 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.630
 necessary the fact that it is 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.610
 all Italian in house without 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.410
 on the exteriors of another nation makes the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.870
 all the more interesting the project like 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.010
 this entirely Italian and gave me 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.900
 still a source of extra pride e 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.300
 the emotions of carrying around for the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.980
 world Italian excellence a flight to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.080
 delhi a flight that seems to want 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.000
 recall the ancient spirit of the pioneers 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.760
 area just in the year in which 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.180
 the second centenary begins 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.180
 of naval aviation
