00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:11.880
 good morning cooking video this time 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.179
 cook mom I'll show you one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.699
 Simple issima recipe for a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.400
 one of the many appetizers you can get 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.279
 could do either by Christmas nation or 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 for the New Year's Eve dinner it is very much 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.500
 simple there are no ingredients 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.349
 details however the effect is really 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 cute and the result is very good 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.730
 so I absolutely recommend it from 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.280
 try and then take advantage of all the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.110
 times that you have someone for dinner and you have to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.149
 do something even fast 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.570
 they are very easy ingredients to 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 find and therefore really good 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.809
 current we need slices of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.860
 baked bacon as many as there are 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.270
 invited some slices of bread 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.770
 this case I'll use this here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.570
 integral but the are also good 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.019
 quietly sandwich that much 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 we will cut fresh cheese into slices 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.650
 spreadable you can use philadelphia 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.340
 you can also use this here for example 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.900
 this conad is fine 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.920
 toothpick a baking pan is fine 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.930
 these almost aluminum a knife from 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.640
 cut a spreading knife example 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.860
 I will use this one of mine 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.210
 son to spread is fine e 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 this is all it is very much 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.990
 simple as a recipe 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.290
 let's see how it's done first 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.560
 we have to spread the cheese on 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.560
 our slice of bread quietly 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.020
 without absolutely no excess there is not 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 problem let's put as much as we want 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.380
 keep in mind that then everything will go into 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.229
 oven for 5 10 minutes the time it takes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.170
 above the pancetta then either 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:00.890
 excessive on that side ours 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.890
 We spread the cheese on the slice 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.459
 this is I will make you 6 you logically 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:23.750
 in fact, how many you want 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.750
 once we have it we pay it in four 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:33.480
 here then what we do we overturn them 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.769
 one on top of the other and then they come 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:45.079
 two small we say simple let's take back 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:52.620
 our bacon slice and the 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:03:01.439
 roll up this way you see is in 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:04.950
 this way it is rolled up we put one 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.599
 toothpick to hold the stitching e 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.700
 we are beautiful that has placed we put it in the 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.700
 ours in our pan 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.100
 this is the result of ours 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.050
 taietta this poor thing the slice was 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.120
 a little too thin there is a little too much 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.260
 short but does nothing 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.200
 this is the result of what 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.270
 we would put it in the oven 5 10 minutes 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.420
 it also depends on the intensity of what 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.920
 put in the oven 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.780
 as long as you have to see that it makes the money 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.260
 it begins to brown and those already to the point 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.060
 quite right 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.880
 once they are ready we pull them 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.900
 out and we eat 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:59.720
 this is the result that you will see one 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.270
 once they are cooked as you see the bread 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.300
 has become a little toasted and the 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.850
 bacon in a has become crunchy apple 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.459
 and inside we have the cheese 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.020
 creamy and that's all to the next one 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.260
 a bacione recipe 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.260
