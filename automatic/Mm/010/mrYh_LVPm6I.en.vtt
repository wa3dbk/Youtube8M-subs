00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
them in this particular instance I've

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.319 
them in this particular instance I've
opened<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.480> picture<00:00:30.810> here<00:00:30.990> for<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.380> editing

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
opened a picture here for some editing

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.670 
opened a picture here for some editing
the<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:33.540> basic<00:00:33.989> thing<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> might<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the most basic thing you might want to

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.190 
the most basic thing you might want to
do<00:00:36.380> excuse<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.760> is<00:00:38.760> change<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.450> levels

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
do excuse me is is change your levels

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.799 
do excuse me is is change your levels
now<00:00:40.980> there's<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.940> best<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.629> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
now there's the best way to do that is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
now there's the best way to do that is
to<00:00:42.899> go<00:00:43.050> into<00:00:43.290> image<00:00:44.030> adjustments<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> just

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to go into image adjustments and just

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.170 
to go into image adjustments and just
click<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.600> auto<00:00:48.840> levels<00:00:49.370> now<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> case<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
click on auto levels now in this case it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.610 
click on auto levels now in this case it
lightened<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> picture<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> little<00:00:52.199> bit<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lightened the picture a little bit and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
lightened the picture a little bit and
punched<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> contrast<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.940> tiny<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.360> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
punched up the contrast a tiny bit that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
punched up the contrast a tiny bit that
might<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.230> need<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.160> might

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
might be all you need to do that might

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.910 
might be all you need to do that might
do<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.539> picture<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.530> let's<00:00:58.680> say<00:00:58.859> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
do it for your picture but let's say you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
do it for your picture but let's say you
want<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.760> bit<00:00:59.940> further<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.390> say

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
want to go a little bit further you say

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.760 
want to go a little bit further you say
well<00:01:00.719> I'd<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> make<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> picture<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
well I'd like to make the picture a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.679 
well I'd like to make the picture a
little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.600> more<00:01:03.600> intense<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> let's<00:01:05.250> go<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
little bit more intense so let's go to

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.060 
little bit more intense so let's go to
let's<00:01:06.689> go<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> curves

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
let's go to a curves

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
let's go to a curves
now<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:08.970> curves<00:01:09.330> allows<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.990> by

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
now what curves allows you to do is by

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.249 
now what curves allows you to do is by
changing<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.490> shape<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.060> line<00:01:15.420> change

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
changing the shape of this line change

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.920 
changing the shape of this line change
the<00:01:16.710> brightness<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.640> contrast<00:01:17.700> levels<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the brightness and contrast levels of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.510 
the brightness and contrast levels of
your<00:01:19.140> picture<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:21.330> most<00:01:21.659> cases<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.650> gentle

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
your picture in most cases a very gentle

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
your picture in most cases a very gentle
s<00:01:24.030> curves<00:01:24.689> all<00:01:25.080> you're<00:01:25.290> ever<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> need

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
s curves all you're ever going to need

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.760 
s curves all you're ever going to need
but<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> best<00:01:27.270> way<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.869> adjust<00:01:28.650> your

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
but this is the best way to adjust your

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.490 
but this is the best way to adjust your
brightness<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.400> contrast<00:01:29.869> with<00:01:30.869> Photoshop

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
brightness and contrast with Photoshop

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.600 
brightness and contrast with Photoshop
because<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.250> doesn't<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:34.310> discard<00:01:35.310> any

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
because it doesn't actually discard any

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.539 
because it doesn't actually discard any
image<00:01:35.970> information<00:01:36.740> whereas<00:01:37.740> using<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
image information whereas using a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.539 
image information whereas using a
brightness<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.119> contrast<00:01:39.299> settings<00:01:40.549> which

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
brightness and contrast settings which

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
brightness and contrast settings which
I'll<00:01:41.759> show<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:45.049> now<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> is

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
I'll show you right now now this is

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
I'll show you right now now this is
probably<00:01:46.829> easier<00:01:47.570> adjust<00:01:48.570> your<00:01:48.750> brightness

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
probably easier adjust your brightness

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.149 
probably easier adjust your brightness
and<00:01:49.290> contrast<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.100> sliders<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.890> most

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and contrast with these sliders but most

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
and contrast with these sliders but most
professionals<00:01:53.850> prefer<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.720> use<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.079> curves

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
professionals prefer to use the curves

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.889 
professionals prefer to use the curves
adjustment<00:01:56.180> because<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.659> allows

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
adjustment because it actually allows

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.980 
adjustment because it actually allows
you<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.490> make<00:01:59.490> changes<00:01:59.520> without<00:02:00.329> discarding

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
you to make changes without discarding

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.319 
you to make changes without discarding
any<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.680> information<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> picture

any of the information in the picture

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.170 
any of the information in the picture

comfortable<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> brightness<00:02:07.500> and
