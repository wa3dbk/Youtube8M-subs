edge<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:09.130> really<00:01:09.759> nice<00:01:09.969> for<00:01:10.590> projects

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
edge that is really nice for projects

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.219 
edge that is really nice for projects
like<00:01:11.789> sock<00:01:12.789> cuffs<00:01:13.210> where<00:01:13.659> you're<00:01:13.929> going<00:01:14.140> to

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
like sock cuffs where you're going to

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.779 
like sock cuffs where you're going to
need<00:01:14.259> a<00:01:14.380> lot<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.619> wear<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.130> tear<00:01:15.399> on<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:17.789> cast

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:18.789 
need a lot of wear and tear on that cast

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.510 
need a lot of wear and tear on that cast
on<00:01:18.999> edge<00:01:19.240> so<00:01:20.109> let's<00:01:20.590> show<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.770> how<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.640> do<00:01:21.880> this

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
on edge so let's show you how we do this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.669 
on edge so let's show you how we do this
now<00:01:24.520> whenever<00:01:24.700> I'm<00:01:25.119> starting<00:01:25.569> a<00:01:25.780> long<00:01:26.409> tail

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
now whenever I'm starting a long tail

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.099 
now whenever I'm starting a long tail
style<00:01:27.009> cast<00:01:27.310> on<00:01:27.609> I<00:01:27.880> take<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.719> working<00:01:28.929> yarn

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
style cast on I take the working yarn

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.730 
style cast on I take the working yarn
and<00:01:29.499> I<00:01:29.829> wrap<00:01:30.219> it<00:01:30.249> around<00:01:30.460> my<00:01:31.079> needle<00:01:32.079> about

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
and I wrap it around my needle about

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.550 
and I wrap it around my needle about
five<00:01:33.130> times<00:01:33.369> and<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:34.329> allows<00:01:34.630> us<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.929> sort<00:01:35.499> of

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
five times and this allows us to sort of

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.069 
five times and this allows us to sort of
measure<00:01:35.799> out<00:01:36.069> the<00:01:36.999> number<00:01:37.389> of<00:01:37.539> stitches<00:01:37.780> that

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
measure out the number of stitches that

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.800 
measure out the number of stitches that
we're<00:01:38.229> going<00:01:38.319> to<00:01:38.380> need<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:39.039> five<00:01:39.369> loops<00:01:40.270> will

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
we're going to need the five loops will

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.379 
we're going to need the five loops will
be<00:01:40.840> equivalent<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.770> about<00:01:41.859> five<00:01:42.219> stitches<00:01:42.549> so

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389 
be equivalent to about five stitches so

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.419 
be equivalent to about five stitches so
then<00:01:43.539> we<00:01:43.630> can<00:01:43.810> measure<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.889> length<00:01:45.100> of<00:01:45.219> yarn

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
then we can measure the length of yarn

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:47.669 
then we can measure the length of yarn
against<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.329> this<00:01:46.509> would<00:01:46.689> be<00:01:46.840> about<00:01:47.109> ten

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
against that so this would be about ten

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.120 
against that so this would be about ten
stitches<00:01:47.979> and<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.780> length<00:01:50.079> here<00:01:50.619> when

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
stitches and this length here when

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.239 
stitches and this length here when
measured<00:01:51.429> against<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.969> bottom<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.679> about<00:01:53.679> 20

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
measured against the bottom is about 20

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.819 
measured against the bottom is about 20
stitches<00:01:54.509> okay<00:01:55.509> and<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.139> can<00:01:56.170> continue<00:01:56.679> doing

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
stitches okay and we can continue doing

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.949 
stitches okay and we can continue doing
this<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:57.700> until<00:01:58.209> we<00:01:58.450> have<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.719> number

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
this on and on until we have the number

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.230 
this on and on until we have the number
of<00:01:59.049> stitches<00:01:59.229> that<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.310> need<00:02:00.520> now<00:02:00.969> make<00:02:01.209> sure

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
of stitches that we need now make sure

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.019 
of stitches that we need now make sure
that<00:02:01.569> you<00:02:01.659> don't<00:02:01.810> run<00:02:02.079> out<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.490> yarn<00:02:03.490> on<00:02:03.819> the

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
that you don't run out of yarn on the

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:07.999 
that you don't run out of yarn on the
tail<00:02:04.270> which<00:02:04.630> would<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.139> big<00:02:05.439> bummer<00:02:06.359> so<00:02:07.359> now

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
tail which would be a big bummer so now

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.330 
tail which would be a big bummer so now
to<00:02:09.009> prep<00:02:09.970> usually<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.230> would<00:02:11.349> do<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> slipknot

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
to prep usually you would do a slipknot

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.140 
to prep usually you would do a slipknot
now<00:02:12.970> I'm<00:02:13.209> not<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.390> big<00:02:13.450> fan<00:02:13.870> of

so<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.500> we've<00:02:27.680> got<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.750> two<00:02:29.750> strands<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
so so we've got the two strands in the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.670 
so so we've got the two strands in the
bottom<00:02:31.549> three<00:02:31.790> fingers<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.420> your<00:02:33.079> hand<00:02:33.349> and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
bottom three fingers of your hand and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.679 
bottom three fingers of your hand and
then<00:02:34.310> I'm<00:02:34.519> going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.700> take<00:02:34.879> my<00:02:35.180> thumb<00:02:35.510> and

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
then I'm going to take my thumb and

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.539 
then I'm going to take my thumb and
forefinger<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.379> place<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.709> inside<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.310> loop

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
forefinger and place it inside that loop

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.039 
forefinger and place it inside that loop
and<00:02:37.760> then<00:02:38.000> we're<00:02:38.120> going<00:02:38.269> to<00:02:38.390> spread<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> out

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
and then we're going to spread it out

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.349 
and then we're going to spread it out
like<00:02:39.379> so<00:02:40.720> okay<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.489> tension<00:02:43.909> here

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
like so okay and the tension here

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.809 
like so okay and the tension here
between<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:45.530> thumb<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:45.950> forefinger<00:02:46.310> we're

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
between the thumb and forefinger we're

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.420 
between the thumb and forefinger we're
going<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.090> use<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.540> create<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:48.049> loop<00:02:48.709> around<00:02:48.920> our

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
going to use to create a loop around our

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.099 
going to use to create a loop around our
needle<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.000> I'm<00:02:50.090> just<00:02:50.209> going<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.450> press<00:02:51.079> down

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
needle so I'm just going to press down

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.970 
needle so I'm just going to press down
with<00:02:51.889> the<00:02:52.310> needle<00:02:52.639> and<00:02:52.970> I'm<00:02:53.599> going<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:54.049> pick<00:02:54.950> up

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
with the needle and I'm going to pick up

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.270 
with the needle and I'm going to pick up
the<00:02:55.310> bottom<00:02:55.700> edge<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.239> twist<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:56.870> around

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the bottom edge and twist that around

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.119 
the bottom edge and twist that around
okay<00:02:58.280> let's<00:02:59.060> do<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.209> again<00:02:59.329> real<00:02:59.569> quick<00:03:00.129> and

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
okay let's do that again real quick and

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.599 
okay let's do that again real quick and
come<00:03:01.370> down<00:03:02.260> twist<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.379> around<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:04.099> that's

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
come down twist this around and that's

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.520 
come down twist this around and that's
going<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.790> create<00:03:04.939> a<00:03:05.060> loop<00:03:05.359> on<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.659> needle

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
going to create a loop on the needle

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.559 
going to create a loop on the needle
okay<00:03:07.159> and<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.700> way<00:03:07.849> you're<00:03:08.239> not<00:03:08.269> going<00:03:08.510> to

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
okay and that way you're not going to

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:13.300 
okay and that way you're not going to
get<00:03:08.720> that<00:03:08.900> little<00:03:10.150> bulky<00:03:11.290> stitch<00:03:12.290> not<00:03:12.590> from

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
get that little bulky stitch not from

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.270 
get that little bulky stitch not from
the<00:03:13.459> slipknot<00:03:13.909> and<00:03:14.769> then<00:03:15.769> I'm<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:15.980> going<00:03:16.220> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the slipknot and then I'm just going to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.500 
the slipknot and then I'm just going to
shift<00:03:16.819> my<00:03:16.970> fingers<00:03:17.480> back<00:03:17.780> like<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.510> we're

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
shift my fingers back like so and we're

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.059 
shift my fingers back like so and we're
going<00:03:20.629> to<00:03:20.690> be<00:03:20.810> ready<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.049> start<00:03:21.410> our<00:03:21.590> cast<00:03:21.829> on

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
going to be ready to start our cast on

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.599 
going to be ready to start our cast on
this<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.489> going<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.879> be<00:03:23.060> very<00:03:23.870> similar<00:03:24.609> to

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
this is going to be very similar to

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.750 
this is going to be very similar to
looking<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.120> slingshot<00:03:26.560> okay<00:03:27.560> like<00:03:28.549> this

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
looking like a slingshot okay like this

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.539 
looking like a slingshot okay like this
and<00:03:29.269> we<00:03:29.540> can<00:03:29.659> see<00:03:29.900> we've<00:03:30.319> got<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.769> yarn<00:03:31.190> coming

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
and we can see we've got the yarn coming

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.569 
and we can see we've got the yarn coming
from<00:03:32.389> my<00:03:32.659> fingers<00:03:33.620> down<00:03:33.769> here<00:03:34.099> around<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
from my fingers down here around the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.059 
from my fingers down here around the
thumb<00:03:34.930> around<00:03:35.930> the<00:03:36.079> needle<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.620> then<00:03:36.859> back

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
thumb around the needle and then back

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.409 
thumb around the needle and then back
around<00:03:37.430> my<00:03:38.000> forefinger<00:03:38.739> okay<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.209> step

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
around my forefinger okay so for step

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.960 
around my forefinger okay so for step
one<00:03:41.720> we're<00:03:42.530> going<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.829> take<00:03:43.220> our<00:03:43.400> knitting

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
one we're going to take our knitting

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.939 
one we're going to take our knitting
needle<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.389> we're<00:03:44.510> going<00:03:44.659> to<00:03:44.720> pick<00:03:44.959> up<00:03:44.989> this

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
needle and we're going to pick up this

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:49.420 
needle and we're going to pick up this
bottom<00:03:46.669> loop<00:03:47.629> here<00:03:48.260> this<00:03:48.470> bottom<00:03:48.680> strand<00:03:49.190> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
bottom loop here this bottom strand and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.649 
bottom loop here this bottom strand and
we're<00:03:49.609> actually<00:03:49.940> going<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.269> come<00:03:50.479> through

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
we're actually going to come through

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.409 
we're actually going to come through
both<00:03:51.019> of<00:03:51.319> these<00:03:52.220> strands<00:03:52.819> we're<00:03:53.239> going<00:03:53.359> to

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
both of these strands we're going to

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.509 
both of these strands we're going to
come<00:03:53.599> underneath<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.379> strands<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.400> are

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
come underneath the strands that are

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.390 
come underneath the strands that are
going<00:03:55.819> around<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.239> loop<00:03:56.389> and<00:03:57.250> I'm<00:03:58.250> actually

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
going around the loop and I'm actually

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.689 
going around the loop and I'm actually
going<00:03:58.609> to<00:03:58.669> twist<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.299> the<00:03:59.810> other<00:03:59.989> way<00:04:00.699> for

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:01.699 
going to twist this the other way for

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:05.199 
going to twist this the other way for
this<00:04:01.849> one<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.650> loop<00:04:03.889> there<00:04:04.129> so<00:04:05.090> we're

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
this one for that loop there so we're

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.689 
this one for that loop there so we're
coming<00:04:05.449> underneath<00:04:06.019> for<00:04:06.290> step<00:04:06.500> one<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:07.459> step

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
coming underneath for step one for step

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.360 
coming underneath for step one for step
two<00:04:07.909> I'm<00:04:08.090> going<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.299> come<00:04:08.449> down<00:04:09.040> into<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.159> loop

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
two I'm going to come down into the loop

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.060 
two I'm going to come down into the loop
that's<00:04:10.609> on<00:04:10.729> my<00:04:10.879> thumb<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.859> this<00:04:13.359> okay<00:04:14.359> now

four we're going to come through this
little<00:04:39.040> triangle<00:04:40.040> at<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.970> base<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:43.160> loop

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
little triangle at the base or that loop

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.080 
little triangle at the base or that loop
is<00:04:44.680> alright<00:04:45.680> and<00:04:45.860> for<00:04:46.280> step<00:04:46.460> five<00:04:46.700> we're<00:04:46.940> going

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
is alright and for step five we're going

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.510 
is alright and for step five we're going
to<00:04:47.150> just<00:04:47.360> remove<00:04:47.510> our<00:04:47.870> thumb<00:04:48.170> and<00:04:48.520> tighten

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
to just remove our thumb and tighten

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.720 
to just remove our thumb and tighten
down<00:04:50.530> all<00:04:51.530> right<00:04:51.650> let's<00:04:51.860> do<00:04:51.980> that<00:04:52.010> again<00:04:52.280> so

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
down all right let's do that again so

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.610 
down all right let's do that again so
we're<00:04:52.910> going<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.120> come<00:04:53.330> step<00:04:53.870> one<00:04:54.140> underneath

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
we're going to come step one underneath

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.210 
we're going to come step one underneath
both<00:04:54.980> strands<00:04:55.640> like<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:56.810> for<00:04:57.590> step<00:04:57.800> two<00:04:58.010> we're

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
both strands like so for step two we're

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.640 
both strands like so for step two we're
going<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> come<00:04:58.580> into<00:04:59.150> this<00:04:59.750> loop<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.290> our

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
going to come into this loop on our

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.280 
going to come into this loop on our
thumb<00:05:01.480> then<00:05:02.480> we're<00:05:02.630> going<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:02.870> come<00:05:03.050> around

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
thumb then we're going to come around

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.380 
thumb then we're going to come around
and<00:05:04.480> over<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.600> top<00:05:05.870> of<00:05:06.550> this<00:05:07.550> strand<00:05:07.970> here

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
and over the top of this strand here

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.540 
and over the top of this strand here
that's<00:05:08.720> on<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> inside<00:05:09.380> of<00:05:09.410> our<00:05:09.800> index<00:05:10.220> finger

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
that's on the inside of our index finger

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.420 
that's on the inside of our index finger
or<00:05:11.140> forefinger<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.290> then<00:05:12.860> we're<00:05:13.220> going<00:05:13.340> to

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
or forefinger and then we're going to

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.930 
or forefinger and then we're going to
come<00:05:13.670> and<00:05:13.940> pull<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:15.050> loop<00:05:15.110> through<00:05:15.940> this

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
come and pull that loop through this

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.380 
come and pull that loop through this
little<00:05:17.330> triangle<00:05:18.640> that's<00:05:19.640> at<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.940> base<00:05:20.150> of

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.390 
little triangle that's at the base of

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.030 
little triangle that's at the base of
the<00:05:20.540> loop<00:05:20.720> on<00:05:20.870> our<00:05:20.900> thumb<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:21.470> then<00:05:21.890> we'll

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
the loop on our thumb and then we'll

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.080 
the loop on our thumb and then we'll
remove<00:05:22.220> our<00:05:22.490> thumb<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.020> tighten<00:05:24.020> down<00:05:25.090> okay

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
remove our thumb and tighten down okay

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.370 
remove our thumb and tighten down okay
let's<00:05:26.510> do<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.900> again

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
let's do that again

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.400 
let's do that again
come<00:05:27.650> underneath<00:05:28.130> both<00:05:28.430> in<00:05:29.140> through<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.260> loop

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
come underneath both in through the loop

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.560 
come underneath both in through the loop
on<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.740> thumb<00:05:30.980> over<00:05:31.880> and<00:05:32.450> around<00:05:32.810> and<00:05:33.190> then

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
on the thumb over and around and then

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.590 
on the thumb over and around and then
through<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:36.350> little<00:05:36.650> triangle<00:05:37.610> at<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.390> base

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
through the little triangle at the base

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.770 
through the little triangle at the base
then<00:05:39.350> we'll<00:05:39.560> remove<00:05:39.800> our<00:05:39.950> thumb<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.780> tighten

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
then we'll remove our thumb and tighten

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.220 
then we'll remove our thumb and tighten
down<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:44.330> it<00:05:44.450> seems<00:05:44.660> like<00:05:44.780> there's<00:05:44.930> a<00:05:44.990> lot<00:05:45.110> of

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.230 
down so it seems like there's a lot of

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.990 
down so it seems like there's a lot of
steps<00:05:45.500> but<00:05:45.800> it's<00:05:45.920> actually<00:05:46.190> pretty<00:05:46.400> easy<00:05:46.490> when

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
steps but it's actually pretty easy when

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.120 
steps but it's actually pretty easy when
you<00:05:47.120> start<00:05:47.440> doing<00:05:48.440> this<00:05:49.690> and<00:05:50.800> you<00:05:51.800> get<00:05:51.950> the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
you start doing this and you get the

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:58.330 
you start doing this and you get the
hang<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.840> it'll<00:05:53.840> go<00:05:54.050> pretty<00:05:54.410> quick<00:05:55.660> and<00:05:57.340> I

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
hang of it it'll go pretty quick and I

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.890 
hang of it it'll go pretty quick and I
found<00:05:58.670> that<00:05:59.120> when<00:05:59.420> I<00:05:59.480> am<00:06:00.140> working<00:06:01.810> around<00:06:02.810> the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
found that when I am working around the

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.600 
found that when I am working around the
thumb<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.170> can<00:06:03.440> actually<00:06:03.680> just<00:06:03.800> twist<00:06:04.160> that<00:06:04.280> a

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
thumb I can actually just twist that a

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.040 
thumb I can actually just twist that a
little<00:06:04.880> bit<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.090> makes<00:06:05.240> it<00:06:05.360> easier<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.780> come

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
little bit it makes it easier to come

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.470 
little bit it makes it easier to come
through<00:06:06.460> I'll<00:06:07.460> do<00:06:07.610> that<00:06:07.730> again<00:06:07.790> for<00:06:08.210> you<00:06:08.270> real

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
through I'll do that again for you real

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.710 
through I'll do that again for you real
quick

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
quick

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.180 
quick
so<00:06:09.500> instead<00:06:10.130> of<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.430> being<00:06:10.460> like<00:06:10.790> an<00:06:11.090> X<00:06:11.390> I<00:06:11.690> just

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
so instead of it being like an X I just

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.760 
so instead of it being like an X I just
bring<00:06:13.190> my<00:06:13.340> thumb<00:06:13.670> down<00:06:13.880> and<00:06:14.320> then<00:06:15.320> pull<00:06:15.620> it

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
bring my thumb down and then pull it

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.390 
bring my thumb down and then pull it
through<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:17.080> tighten<00:06:18.080> down<00:06:18.110> that<00:06:18.980> makes<00:06:19.130> it<00:06:19.340> a

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
through and tighten down that makes it a

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.640 
through and tighten down that makes it a
little<00:06:19.520> bit<00:06:19.670> easier<00:06:20.030> so<00:06:20.300> there<00:06:21.230> you<00:06:21.290> go<00:06:21.410> that's

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
little bit easier so there you go that's

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.350 
little bit easier so there you go that's
how<00:06:21.740> we<00:06:21.890> do<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.490> German<00:06:22.940> twisted<00:06:23.210> cast<00:06:23.570> on<00:06:25.360> hey

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360
