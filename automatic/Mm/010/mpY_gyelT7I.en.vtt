00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.820
 who I am 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.970
 very nice people welcome to a new 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.890
 The channel's review is not a review of the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.320
 which is part of the series of is 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.270
 character so as you see is a play 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.970
 expensive is a player called marko 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.640
 royce does not know anyone is a kid not 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.790
 It is very well known as I say the year 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.950
 past I think it was probably the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.260
 most used player of the game but of the 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.020
 most used together with ronaldinho and some 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.880
 more and this year good there you see while 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.829
 the statistics cost me 107 thousand ago 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.469
 a while ago and to the truth this review 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.149
 it's been recorded for a while and we're going to 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.969
 talk a little about him not last year 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.010
 I played as playmaker and it was much more 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.769
 cheap I do not know if this year I think that 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.329
 this year it will go down to 60 50 here I do not think 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.239
 that is going to lower more than there is 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.400
 working obviously it was worth 120 110 and 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.080
 now it's 90 and I think I do not know 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.060
 we'll see with the team of the year 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.370
 surely it will be cheaper and such 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.840
 if you want to do with the team 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.850
 year that will come out in February I imagine 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.189
 as they always do every year 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.049
 and good is a barbarity of player not 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.400
 I love two of the players that 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.530
 I have loved this year more but I have 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.869
 to say that I can not say I have to 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.690
 say I can not say anything bad nothing 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.979
 bad of the before anything good the series the 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.600
 question of the day or if you are liking the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.890
 series of characters interests me yours 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.140
 opinion because it is a series that has 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.780
 started very quickly and I'm seeing 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 that at least for visits and 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.670
 comments and that you're liking but 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.190
 I would really like to know if you want 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.869
 to continue with the series or focus on 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.700
 notice the review in career mode or what 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.170
 that is there is at least if you are 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.580
 liking and I'm discovering players 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.710
 that in other situations there would not be 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.640
 proven that they are cheap and so and so 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.710
 there you see a great goal of brutal revision not the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.950
 dribble that has also fix the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.390
 Vaseline with the left is really 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.399
 very much like I say do everything right not me 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.039
 whenever you play to do a review 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.899
 of these more in depth before 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.569
 character that are four or five goals 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.090
 that was a review that I played 10 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.760
 matches with him does not get to record as many 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.099
 clips as with other players 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.829
 because maybe the training was not the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.860
 ideal to play with rise up and such 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.689
 but well, it really seems like a 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.040
 barbarity is a player that surely 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.620
 if I redo a team from the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.170
 bundesliga not have it because it is a 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.629
 favorite improvement the bad the bad is that 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.470
 plays from left half then that 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:44.019
 perhaps having other means than means 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.709
 left forgiveness in the bundes more 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.599
 cheap because maybe it 's worse not in 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.030
 Any case I liked it 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.129
 quite as I say it does everything right the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.109
 shot is sensational the dribble is brutal 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.540
 has four dodge stars to 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.799
 you have seen a little bit more 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.989
 what can you do with the ball in 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.609
 the feet have good pass also center 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.829
 quite well the ball always arrives 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:08.170
 up to attack defines perfectly 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.940
 although you have seen a couple of sticks but 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.700
 really the ball will almost always go 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.099
 inside and not cup no cup to mark 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.019
 royce I hope you liked it already 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.670
 you know comment like the following review 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.739
 is going to be that of gÃ¼ndogan and from 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.739
 there we start in xbox by goodbye 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 in waziristan 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.660
 I got tired
