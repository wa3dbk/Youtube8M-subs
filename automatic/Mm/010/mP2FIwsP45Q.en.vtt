00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
for shaders this time around we're going

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.679 
for shaders this time around we're going
to<00:00:21.290> do<00:00:21.470> yet<00:00:21.890> another<00:00:22.369> dead<00:00:22.850> orbit<00:00:23.210> package

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
because I've decided that before I end

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.659 
because I've decided that before I end
