00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello to all in this video tutorial 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.839
 I want to explain to you what the steps are 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.589
 exact to better cover the dark circles 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.589
 let's see it together 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.060
 essential to better cover 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.919
 the eyewear is obviously the concealer the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.739
 concealer exists in several 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.960
 cream formulations for me 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.690
 beatrice I chose the corrector in 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.460
 number 100 lifting cream which 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.620
 in addition to perfectly covering the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.829
 discoloration will also create some beautiful ones 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.570
 light spots on the face I apply it with the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.360
 synthetic bristle brush number 06 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:57.530
 I focus mainly on the part 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:01.210
 internal where discoloration generally 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:09.470
 more evident even in the corner 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:14.479
 higher smaller quantity 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:20.270
 as we can in the most 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:22.270
 external we are still going to buffer a 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.410
 we give little pressure 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.450
 let's adhere perfectly to the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.659
 product so the result will be 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.079
 extremely natural as an alternative to 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.400
 finger we can also fade 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.799
 perfectly the concealer with one 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.100
 sponge with precision having these 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.110
 corners will allow us an application 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.700
 super precise po because we will arrive in 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.960
 all the most uncomfortable points here ad 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.299
 example here in the inner corner 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.770
 of the eye where always a little bit more 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.770
 complicated to arrive with your finger 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.740
 I don't want to put another little bit 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.340
 always the one and the inside 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.940
 let us remember that color is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 fundamental for the purpose of one of a 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 impeccable result a result 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.960
 perfect 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 let us remember that the darker and lighter it is 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.770
 plus the color of the concealer must have 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.550
 a warm shade is really important 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.930
 the choice of color 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.670
 we are ready for it for the application 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.800
 of the cipe to this is a step really is 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.360
 very important many women have the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.070
 fear of using it 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.660
 just for fear of weighing it down 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.190
 further the face actually is 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.650
 just the opposite 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.780
 the cream products should always be fixed 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.600
 for good otherwise we also risk of 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.700
 accentuate small signs of expression 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.010
 how to fix the foundation or the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 corrector in this case we use 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.570
 a powder powder that powdered 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.320
 the lightest and most impalpable the most 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.300
 professional 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
 in this case I use the powder of 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.310
 therefore rice containing rice starch 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.810
 it is indicated soothing red blush 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.360
 certainly for fair skin and 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 this powder is also delicate 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.370
 make the complexion bright the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.080
 I apply with a velvet duvet la 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.560
 quantity is minimal 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.660
 let us remember never to do this but 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.510
 to download the product well a little 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.090
 on the hand he looks up I go to give some 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.160
 slight pressure and important also 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.860
 this movement this movement 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.690
 determines the natural result in 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.250
 how much we push perfectly 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.350
 inside the product you hate in here 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.110
 this way there will be no sign 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.570
 of the previously applied concealer 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.570
 ok let's move on to the other eye 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.730
 this is the end result as you can 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.560
 note just apply the 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.480
 concealer to cover the glasses for 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.090
 have a look more immediately 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 fresh bright and rested to the next 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.750
