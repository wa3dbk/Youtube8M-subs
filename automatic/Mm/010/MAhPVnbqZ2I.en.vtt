rewards<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.510> would<00:04:07.630> go<00:04:07.780> for<00:04:07.930> more<00:04:07.990> of<00:04:08.230> an

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
rewards that would go for more of an

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.620

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
hour of studying and all I did was I

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.750 
hour of studying and all I did was I
took<00:04:10.720> your<00:04:10.900> mason<00:04:11.230> jar<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.650> some<00:04:12.130> washi<00:04:12.340> tape

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
took your mason jar and some washi tape

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.430 
took your mason jar and some washi tape
and<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.030> just<00:04:13.360> put<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> washi<00:04:13.900> tape<00:04:14.110> around<00:04:14.350> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
and I just put the washi tape around the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.750 
and I just put the washi tape around the
mason<00:04:14.770> jar<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.010> make<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.220> look<00:04:15.370> cuter<00:04:15.640> and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
mason jar to make it look cuter and

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.130 
mason jar to make it look cuter and
that's<00:04:15.880> optional<00:04:16.420> I<00:04:16.630> don't<00:04:16.989> know<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.079> really

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
that's optional I don't know I really

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.170 
that's optional I don't know I really
like<00:04:17.440> washi<00:04:17.650> tape<00:04:17.950> and<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.579> thought<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:19.030> made

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
like washi tape and I thought it made

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.690 
like washi tape and I thought it made
the<00:04:19.299> jar<00:04:19.510> CIPA<00:04:20.109> cute<00:04:20.290> so<00:04:20.739> then<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.370> just<00:04:21.400> did

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
the jar CIPA cute so then I just did

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.490 
the jar CIPA cute so then I just did
that<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.150> then<00:04:22.270> I<00:04:22.300> took<00:04:22.419> my<00:04:22.570> sticky<00:04:23.080> notes<00:04:23.290> and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
that and then I took my sticky notes and

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.950 
that and then I took my sticky notes and
I<00:04:23.830> wrote<00:04:24.010> on<00:04:24.130> things<00:04:24.550> I<00:04:24.730> could<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:25.060> like<00:04:25.540> go<00:04:25.900> on

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
I wrote on things I could do like go on

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.650 
I wrote on things I could do like go on
my<00:04:26.050> phone<00:04:26.230> for<00:04:26.380> 10<00:04:26.530> minutes<00:04:26.890> get<00:04:27.100> Starbucks<00:04:27.660> go

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
of studying then you get to reach in the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.490 
of studying then you get to reach in the
jar<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.790> do<00:04:37.120> one<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.630> those<00:04:37.750> things<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.290> it

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
jar and do one of those things so it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.650 
jar and do one of those things so it
keeps<00:04:38.680> you<00:04:38.830> motivated<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.400> study<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.600> don't

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
keeps you motivated to study and I don't

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.850 
keeps you motivated to study and I don't
know<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:41.020> think<00:04:41.110> it's<00:04:41.260> really<00:04:41.320> fun<00:04:41.620> and

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
know I just think it's really fun and

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.090 
know I just think it's really fun and
really<00:04:42.310> cool<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.810> now<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:43.990> do<00:04:44.230> is<00:04:44.500> fold<00:04:44.770> up<00:04:44.950> the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
really cool so now you do is fold up the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.700 
really cool so now you do is fold up the
pieces<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.760> put<00:04:45.820> them<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:47.110> jar<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.620> then

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
pieces and put them in the jar and then

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.810 
pieces and put them in the jar and then
pull<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.130> out<00:04:48.220> every<00:04:48.790> time<00:04:49.090> period<00:04:49.780> you<00:04:49.900> pick

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
pull it out every time period you pick

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.550 
pull it out every time period you pick
okay<00:04:51.820> so<00:04:51.880> another<00:04:52.180> way<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.390> stay<00:04:52.750> motivated<00:04:53.020> is

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
okay so another way to stay motivated is

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.650 
okay so another way to stay motivated is
when<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.950> are<00:04:54.070> reading<00:04:54.280> all<00:04:54.729> you<00:04:54.880> do<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.270> you
