started so first we're going to go over
the<00:00:20.670> sheath<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.439> inside

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the sheath so as you can see it's inside

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.849 
the sheath so as you can see it's inside
the<00:00:22.920> sheath<00:00:23.130> right<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.960> has<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> gerber<00:00:25.500> logo

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the sheath right now has the gerber logo

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.040 
the sheath right now has the gerber logo
right<00:00:26.070> here<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.730> pretty<00:00:27.090> nice<00:00:27.269> nylon<00:00:27.840> it's

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
right here that's pretty nice nylon it's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.089 
right here that's pretty nice nylon it's
a<00:00:28.140> little<00:00:28.349> bit<00:00:28.500> soft

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
a little bit soft

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.769 
a little bit soft
I<00:00:29.130> wish<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.580> bit<00:00:29.789> harder<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.630> has

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
I wish it was a little bit harder it has

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.229 
I wish it was a little bit harder it has
a<00:00:30.810> Velcro<00:00:31.230> closure<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.550> velcro<00:00:33.030> is

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
a Velcro closure and this velcro is

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.630 
a Velcro closure and this velcro is
really<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.960> light<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.829> won't<00:00:35.309> hold

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
really really light like it won't hold

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
really really light like it won't hold
it<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> knife<00:00:36.930> does<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> fall

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it at all but the knife does not fall

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.459 
it at all but the knife does not fall
out<00:00:38.100> surprisingly<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.809> that's<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> good<00:00:40.230> thing

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
out surprisingly so that's a good thing

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
out surprisingly so that's a good thing
it<00:00:40.620> fits<00:00:40.860> perfectly<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> back

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it fits perfectly if we look on the back

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.190 
it fits perfectly if we look on the back
here<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.800> have<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:44.430> belt<00:00:45.239> loop<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.989> put

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
here we have a belt loop and you can put

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049 
here we have a belt loop and you can put
this<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.469> both<00:00:46.800> ways<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.789> wouldn't

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
this on both ways but I wouldn't

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.380 
this on both ways but I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:48.210> putting<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> like<00:00:49.680> this

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
recommend putting it on like this

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
recommend putting it on like this
because<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.230> could<00:00:52.590> flap<00:00:52.860> open<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
because this could flap open and it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.880 
because this could flap open and it
could<00:00:53.760> fall<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.140> actually<00:00:55.469> pretty

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
could fall and it's actually pretty

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.770 
could fall and it's actually pretty
weighty<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> fell<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.390> foot<00:00:57.660> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
weighty and if you fell on your foot or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.360 
weighty and if you fell on your foot or
something<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.289> probably<00:00:58.680> hurt<00:00:58.949> quite<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
something would probably hurt quite a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.330 
something would probably hurt quite a
bit<00:00:59.670> but<00:01:00.570> yeah<00:01:01.320> don't<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> sheath

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bit but yeah don't get it for the sheath

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
bit but yeah don't get it for the sheath
but<00:01:02.850> anyways<00:01:03.719> what's<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> look<00:01:04.650> at

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
but anyways what's going to you look at

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.649 
but anyways what's going to you look at
the<00:01:05.280> actual<00:01:05.780> multi-tool<00:01:06.780> itself<00:01:08.420> just<00:01:09.420> kind

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

feeling um the paint just kind of feels

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.530 
feeling um the paint just kind of feels
a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.340> slick<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> wish<00:01:36.299> there<00:01:36.479> was

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
a little bit slick so I wish there was

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.609 
a little bit slick so I wish there was
more<00:01:36.600> grip<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.470> overall<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.380> bad

we<00:01:56.520> have<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> wire<00:01:57.000> stripper<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.750> cutter<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
we have a wire stripper and cutter and I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.530 
we have a wire stripper and cutter and I
guess<00:01:59.490> they<00:01:59.670> assume<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.299> enough

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
guess they assume you have enough

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.080 
guess they assume you have enough
control<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.170> be<00:02:01.290> able<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.710> cut<00:02:02.219> through<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
control to be able to cut through the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.389 
control to be able to cut through the
sheath<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:04.259> sheathing<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> wire<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
sheath the sheathing on the wire and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.889 
sheath the sheathing on the wire and
then<00:02:05.579> strip<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.479> still<00:02:06.719> pretty

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
then strip it but it's still pretty

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
then strip it but it's still pretty
difficult<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.160> it's<00:02:08.429> pretty<00:02:08.550> much<00:02:08.759> more<00:02:08.970> like

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
difficult so it's pretty much more like

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.070 
difficult so it's pretty much more like
a<00:02:09.209> wire<00:02:09.479> cutter<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.599> pretty

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
a wire cutter as you can see it's pretty

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.949 
a wire cutter as you can see it's pretty
big

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
big

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.069 
big
it's<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.709> basically<00:02:15.459> full-size<00:02:16.090> plot

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
it's a basically full-size plot

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's a basically full-size plot
basically<00:02:17.650> full-size<00:02:18.159> pliers<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.269> would

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
basically full-size pliers so this would

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
basically full-size pliers so this would
be<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> big<00:02:19.840> reason<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.829> this<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.609> as<00:02:21.700> you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
be a big reason to get this and as you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.729 
be a big reason to get this and as you
can<00:02:21.939> see<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.239> spring-loaded<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:23.019> the

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
can see it's spring-loaded and the

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.970 
can see it's spring-loaded and the
mechanism<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.849> pretty<00:02:25.239> smooth<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:26.079> close<00:02:26.709> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
mechanism is pretty smooth to close and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.420 
mechanism is pretty smooth to close and
open<00:02:27.189> it<00:02:27.519> so<00:02:28.510> that's<00:02:28.840> pretty<00:02:29.079> nice<00:02:29.310> now<00:02:30.310> we're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
open it so that's pretty nice now we're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.979 
open it so that's pretty nice now we're
going<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.579> go<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:30.879> go<00:02:31.000> over<00:02:31.180> all<00:02:31.389> these<00:02:31.719> tools

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
going to go and go over all these tools

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.970 
going to go and go over all these tools
and<00:02:32.349> these<00:02:32.739> locks<00:02:33.069> control<00:02:34.139> the<00:02:35.139> tool<00:02:35.409> on<00:02:35.650> each

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and these locks control the tool on each

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.660 
and these locks control the tool on each
side<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.530> also<00:02:38.530> these<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:40.000> block

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
side and also these have the block

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.990 
side and also these have the block
blocks<00:02:42.670> on<00:02:42.939> each<00:02:43.209> side<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:45.549> one<00:02:45.760> can<00:02:45.970> be

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
blocks on each side but this one can be

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.759 
blocks on each side but this one can be
used<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.329> control<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.139> these<00:02:47.260> tools<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.709> I

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
used to control all of these tools so I

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.020 
used to control all of these tools so I
don't<00:02:47.919> know<00:02:48.010> why<00:02:48.159> they<00:02:48.400> have<00:02:48.549> them<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.909> both

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
don't know why they have them on both

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.920 
don't know why they have them on both
sides<00:02:49.329> but<00:02:50.319> yeah<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.829> kind<00:02:51.010> of<00:02:51.040> weird<00:02:51.099> so

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
sides but yeah it's kind of weird so

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.539 
sides but yeah it's kind of weird so
here<00:02:52.930> we<00:02:53.079> have<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:56.200> plain<00:02:57.040> edge<00:02:57.370> knife<00:02:59.549> so

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
here we have the the plain edge knife so

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.459 
here we have the the plain edge knife so
as<00:03:00.609> you<00:03:00.819> can<00:03:00.939> see<00:03:01.000> it's<00:03:01.359> kind<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.689> beaten<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.349> a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:02.469 
as you can see it's kind of beaten up a

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.830 
as you can see it's kind of beaten up a
little<00:03:02.650> bit<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:03.400> finish<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:03.969> it<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.299> satin

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
little bit the finish on it is a satin

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.959 
little bit the finish on it is a satin
finish<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.439> I'm<00:03:06.310> not<00:03:06.459> sure<00:03:06.909> this<00:03:07.319> deal<00:03:08.319> I'm<00:03:09.010> not

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
finish I I'm not sure this deal I'm not

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.170 
finish I I'm not sure this deal I'm not
an<00:03:10.120> expert<00:03:10.450> on<00:03:10.569> knives<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.879> yeah<00:03:12.879> I<00:03:12.909> came

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
an expert on knives so yeah I came

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.220 
an expert on knives so yeah I came
pretty<00:03:13.419> sharp<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:14.590> bad<00:03:14.919> the<00:03:15.669> length<00:03:15.969> is<00:03:16.230> I

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
pretty sharp not bad the length is I

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.610 
pretty sharp not bad the length is I
believe<00:03:18.449> it<00:03:19.449> looks<00:03:19.629> about<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.139> little<00:03:20.349> more

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
believe it looks about a little more

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.849 
believe it looks about a little more
than<00:03:20.799> an<00:03:20.919> inch<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.690> I'll<00:03:23.290> put<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.590> up<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
than an inch so I'll put it up on the

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.670 
than an inch so I'll put it up on the
screen<00:03:23.979> later<00:03:24.540> but<00:03:25.540> anyways<00:03:26.019> and<00:03:26.260> it's<00:03:26.409> locked

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
screen later but anyways and it's locked

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.610 
screen later but anyways and it's locked
in<00:03:26.859> place<00:03:27.099> there's<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.669> little<00:03:28.150> bit<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.359> play<00:03:28.659> uh

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.170 

this<00:03:32.620> way<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:35.010> otherwise<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.430> don't<00:03:36.549> feel<00:03:37.030> like

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
this way and otherwise I don't feel like

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.020 
this way and otherwise I don't feel like
the<00:03:37.329> lock<00:03:37.479> would<00:03:37.689> fail<00:03:38.079> on<00:03:38.109> me<00:03:38.530> but<00:03:39.489> I<00:03:39.699> wouldn't

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the lock would fail on me but I wouldn't

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.659 
the lock would fail on me but I wouldn't
trust<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.599> to<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.379> know<00:03:41.500> baton<00:03:41.949> and<00:03:42.280> do<00:03:42.400> things

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
trust it to you know baton and do things

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:48.659 
trust it to you know baton and do things
it's<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.239> light<00:03:43.419> duty<00:03:43.629> knife<00:03:45.180> over<00:03:46.180> here<00:03:47.669> we

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
it's a light duty knife over here we

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.280 
it's a light duty knife over here we
have<00:03:48.939> the<00:03:50.099> serrated<00:03:51.099> edge<00:03:51.489> knife<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.139> is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
have the serrated edge knife so this is

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.860 
have the serrated edge knife so this is
not<00:03:53.439> a<00:03:53.470> combo<00:03:53.979> edge<00:03:54.189> this<00:03:54.519> is<00:03:54.579> separate<00:03:55.509> this

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
not a combo edge this is separate this

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170 
not a combo edge this is separate this
is<00:03:56.049> very<00:03:56.259> nice<00:03:56.470> for<00:03:56.500> cutting<00:03:56.949> rope<00:03:57.159> this<00:03:57.970> is

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
is very nice for cutting rope this is

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.509 
is very nice for cutting rope this is
surprisingly<00:03:58.840> good<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.379> that's<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
surprisingly good and that's the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.729 
surprisingly good and that's the
serrated<00:04:01.000> edge<00:04:01.120> also<00:04:01.720> all<00:04:01.959> these<00:04:02.259> have<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
serrated edge also all these have the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.699 
serrated edge also all these have the
thumb<00:04:03.329> thumb<00:04:04.329> things<00:04:04.659> so<00:04:05.019> that's<00:04:05.229> really<00:04:05.500> nice

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
thumb thumb things so that's really nice

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.589 
thumb thumb things so that's really nice
and<00:04:05.949> you<00:04:06.040> can<00:04:06.189> really<00:04:06.519> get<00:04:07.419> them<00:04:07.569> out<00:04:07.689> easily

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
and you can really get them out easily

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.969 
and you can really get them out easily
over<00:04:10.599> here<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.169> saw<00:04:11.439> this<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:11.889> you

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:11.979 
over here we have the saw this one you

actually have to put your fingernail in
here<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:15.400> pull<00:04:15.879> it<00:04:16.000> out<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:18.130> as<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.370> can<00:04:18.489> see

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
here and pull it out so as you can see

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.370 
here and pull it out so as you can see
it's<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.880> basic<00:04:19.269> saw<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.780> length<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.259> little

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
it's a basic saw the length is a little

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.070 
it's a basic saw the length is a little
bit<00:04:20.620> short<00:04:20.889> to<00:04:21.130> do<00:04:21.250> any<00:04:21.430> big<00:04:21.639> any<00:04:22.450> decent<00:04:22.900> work

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
bit short to do any big any decent work

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.519 
bit short to do any big any decent work
on<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.409> but<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:24.190> is<00:04:24.340> fine<00:04:24.550> for<00:04:24.610> cutting<00:04:25.529> twigs

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:26.529 
on it but this is fine for cutting twigs

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.600 
on it but this is fine for cutting twigs
or

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
or

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.820 
or
all<00:04:27.699> limbs<00:04:28.659> on<00:04:28.870> a<00:04:28.900> tree<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:31.439> another<00:04:32.439> thing<00:04:32.710> to

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
all limbs on a tree and another thing to

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.800 
all limbs on a tree and another thing to
notice<00:04:33.129> it's<00:04:33.310> kind<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.610> awkward<00:04:33.789> to<00:04:34.270> hold<00:04:34.539> it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
notice it's kind of awkward to hold it

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.249 
notice it's kind of awkward to hold it
while<00:04:35.560> you're<00:04:35.740> using<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.159> tools<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:36.729> I<00:04:37.259> guess

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
while you're using the tools but I guess

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.879 
while you're using the tools but I guess
it's<00:04:38.439> not<00:04:38.590> too<00:04:38.889> bad<00:04:40.020> so<00:04:41.020> let's<00:04:41.050> go<00:04:41.379> and<00:04:41.469> go<00:04:41.620> over

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
it's not too bad so let's go and go over

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.629 
it's not too bad so let's go and go over
all<00:04:42.069> the<00:04:42.310> other<00:04:42.580> tools<00:04:42.879> so<00:04:43.389> as<00:04:44.159> you<00:04:45.159> can<00:04:45.340> see

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
all the other tools so as you can see

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.249 
all the other tools so as you can see
over<00:04:46.449> here<00:04:46.689> on<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.169> side<00:04:47.409> we<00:04:47.590> have<00:04:48.330> oops<00:04:49.330> we

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
over here on this side we have oops we

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.439 
over here on this side we have oops we
have<00:04:50.439> a<00:04:51.509> flathead<00:04:52.509> screwdriver<00:04:53.039> with<00:04:54.039> a<00:04:54.449> wire

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
have a flathead screwdriver with a wire

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.149 
have a flathead screwdriver with a wire
stripper<00:04:55.900> kind<00:04:56.409> of<00:04:56.560> here<00:04:56.740> which<00:04:56.889> doesn't

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
stripper kind of here which doesn't

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:01.890 
stripper kind of here which doesn't
really<00:04:57.340> work<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:57.819> all<00:04:58.030> though<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:59.159> yeah<00:05:00.900> here

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
really work at all though so yeah here

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.679 
really work at all though so yeah here
we<00:05:01.930> have<00:05:02.259> a<00:05:05.069> Phillips<00:05:06.069> head<00:05:06.479> kind<00:05:07.479> of

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:07.689 
we have a Phillips head kind of

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.040 
we have a Phillips head kind of
screwdriver<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:08.560> by<00:05:09.159> kind<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.699> mean<00:05:09.729> as<00:05:10.090> you

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
screwdriver and by kind of I mean as you

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.070 
screwdriver and by kind of I mean as you
can<00:05:11.080> see<00:05:11.439> it's<00:05:11.680> flat<00:05:12.460> so<00:05:12.699> it<00:05:12.879> will<00:05:13.029> fit<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:13.930> it

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
can see it's flat so it will fit but it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.490 
can see it's flat so it will fit but it
basically<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.469> has<00:05:14.860> some<00:05:15.099> raised<00:05:15.430> edges<00:05:16.500> so

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
basically just has some raised edges so

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.679 
basically just has some raised edges so
that<00:05:17.529> it<00:05:17.949> fits<00:05:18.520> in<00:05:18.699> better<00:05:19.000> two<00:05:19.270> Phillips

00:05:19.679 --> 00:05:19.689 
that it fits in better two Phillips

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:27.929 
that it fits in better two Phillips
things<00:05:21.719> so<00:05:22.719> we'll<00:05:22.900> close<00:05:23.169> that<00:05:24.000> and<00:05:26.520> that's<00:05:27.520> it

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
things so we'll close that and that's it

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.550 
things so we'll close that and that's it
for<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.270> side<00:05:28.629> and<00:05:28.900> then<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.139> this<00:05:29.289> side<00:05:29.349> we

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
for that side and then on this side we

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.610 
for that side and then on this side we
have<00:05:31.979> kind<00:05:32.979> of<00:05:33.039> hard<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.339> get<00:05:33.520> these<00:05:33.699> tools<00:05:34.029> out

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620

and these all have a hardened tip the
screwdrivers<00:06:04.719> are<00:06:04.839> pretty<00:06:05.020> nice<00:06:05.229> on<00:06:05.439> this<00:06:05.620> and

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
screwdrivers are pretty nice on this and

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.559 
screwdrivers are pretty nice on this and
finally<00:06:07.330> we<00:06:07.629> have<00:06:07.779> some<00:06:08.400> scissors<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:10.210> these

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
finally we have some scissors so these

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.390 
finally we have some scissors so these
are<00:06:10.719> the<00:06:10.839> scissors<00:06:11.080> they're<00:06:11.529> really<00:06:12.219> really

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
are the scissors they're really really

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.700 
are the scissors they're really really
small<00:06:12.789> as<00:06:13.949> you<00:06:14.949> can<00:06:15.129> see<00:06:15.339> and<00:06:16.319> they're<00:06:17.319> awful

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
small as you can see and they're awful

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.439 
small as you can see and they're awful
and<00:06:17.889> they<00:06:18.129> broke<00:06:18.370> instantly<00:06:19.029> so<00:06:19.180> as<00:06:19.240> you<00:06:19.330> can

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
and they broke instantly so as you can

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.189 
and they broke instantly so as you can
see<00:06:19.509> when<00:06:19.839> I<00:06:19.870> try<00:06:20.110> to<00:06:20.139> push<00:06:20.409> on<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:21.029> it<00:06:22.199> slips

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
see when I try to push on it it slips

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.619 
see when I try to push on it it slips
it's<00:06:24.009> just<00:06:24.219> a<00:06:24.310> piece<00:06:24.490> of<00:06:24.520> wire<00:06:24.789> and<00:06:25.150> you<00:06:25.539> have

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
it's just a piece of wire and you have

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.290 
it's just a piece of wire and you have
to<00:06:25.750> do<00:06:25.870> this<00:06:25.990> every<00:06:26.259> time<00:06:26.400> so<00:06:27.400> it's<00:06:27.789> basically

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
to do this every time so it's basically

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.659 
to do this every time so it's basically
impossible<00:06:28.509> to<00:06:29.080> use<00:06:29.349> and<00:06:30.009> even<00:06:30.129> if<00:06:30.339> it<00:06:30.460> did

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
impossible to use and even if it did

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.309 
impossible to use and even if it did
it's<00:06:30.909> this<00:06:31.599> small<00:06:32.319> it's<00:06:32.680> just<00:06:33.069> tiny<00:06:33.490> so<00:06:34.319> it's

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
it's this small it's just tiny so it's

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.180 
it's this small it's just tiny so it's
also<00:06:35.680> really<00:06:35.979> dull<00:06:36.959> so<00:06:37.959> definitely<00:06:38.740> don't<00:06:38.979> get

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:39.190 
also really dull so definitely don't get

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.889 
also really dull so definitely don't get
it<00:06:39.339> for<00:06:39.520> the<00:06:39.610> scissors<00:06:40.029> I<00:06:40.270> would<00:06:40.479> recommend

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:40.899 
it for the scissors I would recommend

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:42.309 
it for the scissors I would recommend
getting<00:06:41.169> a

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:42.319 
getting a

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.140
