points<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.210> six<00:00:37.020> classes<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
points there are six classes of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.170 
points there are six classes of
nutrients<00:00:38.129> let's<00:00:38.340> start<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.149> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
nutrients let's start with that so you

nutrients let's start with that so you
have<00:00:39.540> your<00:00:39.780> carbohydrates<00:00:40.680> proteins<00:00:41.340> and

have your carbohydrates proteins and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
have your carbohydrates proteins and
fats<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.210> then<00:00:42.780> there's<00:00:42.989> vitamins<00:00:43.500> minerals

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.880 
whole-wheat toast and some juice those
foods<00:01:38.670> break<00:01:39.450> down<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:39.960> quickly<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.650> blood

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
foods break down very quickly to blood

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
foods break down very quickly to blood
glucose<00:01:41.490> or<00:01:41.670> blood<00:01:41.729> sugar<00:01:41.970> okay<00:01:42.659> they're

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
glucose or blood sugar okay they're

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.480 
glucose or blood sugar okay they're
gonna<00:01:42.899> break<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.350> into<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> sugar<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.369> your

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
gonna break down into a sugar in your

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.179 
gonna break down into a sugar in your
system<00:01:44.600> they're<00:01:45.600> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.140> raise<00:01:46.740> your<00:01:47.009> blood

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
system they're going to raise your blood

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.850 
system they're going to raise your blood
Sugar's<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.759> quickly<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.470> happens

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
Sugar's really quickly and what happens

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.280 
Sugar's really quickly and what happens
at<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.280> peak<00:01:50.850> point<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.869> body's

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
at that peak point is the body's

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
at that peak point is the body's
pancreas<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.850> release<00:01:54.119> insulin<00:01:54.540> now

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
pancreas is going to release insulin now

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.280 
pancreas is going to release insulin now
insulins<00:01:55.799> job<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.850> drive<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.780> energy

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
insulins job is to drive that energy

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620 
insulins job is to drive that energy
into<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> muscles<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.969> active<00:02:00.119> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
into the muscles so we can be active and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.499 
into the muscles so we can be active and
have<00:02:01.170> lots<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> energy<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:02.219> what's<00:02:02.820> happening

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
have lots of energy but what's happening

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.980 
have lots of energy but what's happening
now<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.799> getting<00:02:05.310> too<00:02:05.640> much<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.420> surge

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
now is we are getting too much a surge

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.130 
now is we are getting too much a surge
from<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> lot<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.039> refined<00:02:08.959> products<00:02:09.959> that

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
from a lot of our refined products that

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
from a lot of our refined products that
we're<00:02:10.259> eating<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> happens

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
we're eating when that happens

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.040 
we're eating when that happens
when<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> insulin<00:02:13.680> drives<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.030> blood<00:02:15.720> sugars

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
when the insulin drives the blood sugars

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.080 
when the insulin drives the blood sugars
down<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.380> fast<00:02:19.380> rise<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.340> fast

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
down you have this fast rise and a fast

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720 
down you have this fast rise and a fast
drop<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.200> bottomed<00:02:22.710> out<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.580> become

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
drop when you bottomed out you become

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
drop when you bottomed out you become
hypoglycemic<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.350> often<00:02:25.680> become<00:02:26.010> a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
hypoglycemic and you often become a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.400 
hypoglycemic and you often become a
little<00:02:26.460> bit<00:02:26.550> shaky<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.690> feel<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.140> good

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
little bit shaky you don't feel so good

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.990 
little bit shaky you don't feel so good
and<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:28.890> happens<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.310> start<00:02:29.610> craving

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and what happens you start craving

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
and what happens you start craving
carbohydrates<00:02:30.540> again<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.680> want<00:02:31.890> something

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
carbohydrates again you want something

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.130 
carbohydrates again you want something
sweet<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.700> sticky<00:02:33.120> bun<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.480> want<00:02:33.690> something

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
sweet a sticky bun you want something

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
sweet a sticky bun you want something
some<00:02:35.040> chocolate<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.300> want<00:02:36.390> another<00:02:36.630> cup<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
some chocolate you want another cup of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.230 
some chocolate you want another cup of
coffee<00:02:36.990> because<00:02:37.710> you're<00:02:37.980> feeling<00:02:38.520> low<00:02:38.850> your

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
coffee because you're feeling low your

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.720 
coffee because you're feeling low your
Energy's<00:02:39.630> down<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.560> what<00:02:40.890> happens<00:02:41.190> we<00:02:41.550> eat

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
Energy's down so what happens we eat

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.980 
Energy's down so what happens we eat
those<00:02:41.940> carbohydrates<00:02:43.010> back<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.460> up<00:02:44.640> and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
those carbohydrates back we go up and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.560 
those carbohydrates back we go up and
again<00:02:46.490> insulin<00:02:47.490> is<00:02:47.730> secreted<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
again insulin is secreted from the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.440 
again insulin is secreted from the
pancreas<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.470> if<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.700> too<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.120> of<00:02:51.180> this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
pancreas and if we have too much of this

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.260 
pancreas and if we have too much of this
insulin<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.290> is<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> fat<00:02:52.740> storage<00:02:53.250> hormone<00:02:53.280> so

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
insulin it is a fat storage hormone so

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.570 
insulin it is a fat storage hormone so
this<00:02:55.230> overabundance<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.130> insulin

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
this overabundance of insulin

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.000 
this overabundance of insulin
circulating<00:02:57.000> in<00:02:57.360> our<00:02:57.450> system<00:02:57.900> actually<00:02:58.470> puts

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
circulating in our system actually puts

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.390 
circulating in our system actually puts
us<00:02:59.370> into<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> weight<00:03:00.270> gain<00:03:00.600> mode<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.040> that's<00:03:02.250> not

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
us into a weight gain mode so that's not

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.790 
us into a weight gain mode so that's not
what<00:03:02.670> we<00:03:02.820> want<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.240> we<00:03:03.360> call<00:03:03.570> this<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.020> roller

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
what we want and we call this the roller

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.920 
what we want and we call this the roller
coaster<00:03:05.340> effect<00:03:05.730> we<00:03:05.970> eat<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> high<00:03:06.750> glycemic

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
coaster effect we eat a high glycemic

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.350 
coaster effect we eat a high glycemic
food<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:08.160> crash<00:03:08.490> we<00:03:08.520> eat<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> high<00:03:09.150> glycemic

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
food we crash we eat a high glycemic

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.780 
food we crash we eat a high glycemic
food<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.960> crash<00:03:10.230> what<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.160> want<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.490> do<00:03:11.610> is

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
food we crash what we want to do is

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.790 
food we crash what we want to do is
bring<00:03:11.970> our<00:03:12.150> blood<00:03:12.360> Sugar's<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.530> when<00:03:13.680> we

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
bring our blood Sugar's down so when we

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.740 
bring our blood Sugar's down so when we
eat<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> low<00:03:14.340> glycemic<00:03:14.520> breakfast<00:03:15.270> choice<00:03:15.480> so

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
eat a low glycemic breakfast choice so

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.840 
eat a low glycemic breakfast choice so
let's<00:03:15.960> just<00:03:16.170> say<00:03:16.290> we're<00:03:16.440> having<00:03:16.560> some<00:03:17.490> yogurt

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
let's just say we're having some yogurt

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.430 
let's just say we're having some yogurt
and<00:03:17.880> fruit<00:03:18.360> would<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> great<00:03:19.110> choice<00:03:19.380> and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and fruit would be a great choice and

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.650 
and fruit would be a great choice and
there's<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.340> many<00:03:20.430> other<00:03:20.670> wonderful<00:03:21.450> choices

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
there's so many other wonderful choices

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.840 
there's so many other wonderful choices
you<00:03:21.960> could<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:23.070> blood<00:03:23.310> Sugar's<00:03:23.580> just

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
you could have your blood Sugar's just

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.010 
you could have your blood Sugar's just
rise<00:03:24.720> slowly<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.650> they<00:03:26.610> come<00:03:26.820> down<00:03:27.000> slowly<00:03:27.360> we

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
rise slowly and they come down slowly we

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.870 
rise slowly and they come down slowly we
are<00:03:28.140> now<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.530> control<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.010> what<00:03:29.280> we're<00:03:29.400> eating

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
are now in control of what we're eating

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.350 
are now in control of what we're eating
our<00:03:30.210> energy<00:03:31.020> supply<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.800> more<00:03:31.860> constant<00:03:32.700> we're

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
our energy supply is more constant we're

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.290 
our energy supply is more constant we're
not<00:03:33.540> getting<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.930> huge<00:03:34.170> fluctuation<00:03:35.100> so

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
not getting that huge fluctuation so

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.390 
not getting that huge fluctuation so
we're<00:03:36.300> now<00:03:36.690> our<00:03:37.320> body<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.770> able<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.160> start

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
we're now our body is able to start

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.900 
we're now our body is able to start
releasing<00:03:39.090> body<00:03:39.720> fat<00:03:40.050> plus<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.790> have

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
releasing body fat plus we have

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.480 
releasing body fat plus we have
consistent<00:03:42.540> energy<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:43.830> quickly<00:03:44.190> going

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
consistent energy so I'm quickly going

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.300 
consistent energy so I'm quickly going
to<00:03:44.580> show<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:45.300> few<00:03:46.140> food<00:03:46.710> choices<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.160> you

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
to show you a few food choices that you

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.180 
to show you a few food choices that you
might<00:03:47.460> want<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.670> consider<00:03:48.920> click<00:03:49.920> cook

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
might want to consider click cook

might want to consider click cook
oatmeal<00:03:50.430> is<00:03:50.970> actually<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.600> high<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.960> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
oatmeal is actually really high on the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.910 
oatmeal is actually really high on the
glycemic<00:03:52.260> index<00:03:52.700> anything<00:03:53.700> can<00:03:53.880> over<00:03:54.630> 65<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.890> a

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
glycemic index anything can over 65 to a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.330 
glycemic index anything can over 65 to a
hundred<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.730> considered<00:03:57.270> high<00:03:57.420> glycemic

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
hundred is considered high glycemic

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.650 
hundred is considered high glycemic
whereas<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> slow<00:03:59.790> cook<00:04:00.000> oatmeal<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.510> only

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
whereas a slow cook oatmeal is only

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.550 
whereas a slow cook oatmeal is only
forty<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.320> sixty<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.950> much<00:04:02.130> better<00:04:02.340> choice

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
forty to sixty so much better choice

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.340 
forty to sixty so much better choice
pasta<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.010> can<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.400> pasta<00:04:05.970> but<00:04:06.150> we

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
pasta you can have pasta but we
