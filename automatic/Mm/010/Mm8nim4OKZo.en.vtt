open<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.160> know<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.840> things<00:00:53.020> are<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.170> little

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
open you know some things are a little

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.200 
open you know some things are a little
hard<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.620> get<00:00:53.710> speed<00:00:54.010> but<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.250> mean<00:00:54.520> it's<00:00:54.700> it's

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
hard to get speed but I mean it's it's

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.150 
hard to get speed but I mean it's it's
gonna<00:00:55.360> work<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.840> think<00:00:55.930> it's<00:00:56.200> benefit<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.070> me

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
gonna work I think it's benefit to me

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.650 
gonna work I think it's benefit to me
there's<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.370> lot<00:00:57.520> of<00:00:57.610> obstacles<00:00:58.059> I<00:00:58.180> like<00:00:58.420> myself

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
there's a lot of obstacles I like myself

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.650 
there's a lot of obstacles I like myself
so<00:00:59.110> it's<00:00:59.320> pretty<00:00:59.470> cool<00:00:59.879> he<00:01:00.879> does<00:01:01.150> do<00:01:01.390> hard

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
so it's pretty cool he does do hard

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.720 
so it's pretty cool he does do hard
tricks<00:01:01.989> but<00:01:02.199> he<00:01:02.260> also<00:01:02.650> flows<00:01:02.980> all<00:01:03.280> over<00:01:03.610> the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
tricks but he also flows all over the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.969 
tricks but he also flows all over the
course<00:01:03.970> keeps<00:01:04.360> his<00:01:04.570> feet<00:01:04.839> up<00:01:05.050> just<00:01:05.470> kind<00:01:05.680> of<00:01:05.740> he

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
course keeps his feet up just kind of he

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.330 
course keeps his feet up just kind of he
puts<00:01:06.220> together<00:01:06.369> a<00:01:06.640> real<00:01:06.970> run<00:01:07.560> he<00:01:08.560> just<00:01:08.590> has<00:01:08.979> so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
puts together a real run he just has so

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.670 
puts together a real run he just has so
many<00:01:09.610> tricks<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.600> I<00:01:10.630> think<00:01:10.930> it's<00:01:11.050> easier<00:01:11.619> for

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
many tricks that I think it's easier for

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.499 
many tricks that I think it's easier for
him<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.190> put<00:01:12.430> a<00:01:12.610> flowing<00:01:12.910> run<00:01:13.300> together

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
him to put a flowing run together

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.359 
him to put a flowing run together
because<00:01:13.990> no<00:01:14.140> matter<00:01:14.320> what's<00:01:14.710> in<00:01:14.890> front<00:01:15.130> of<00:01:15.310> him

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
because no matter what's in front of him

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.430 
because no matter what's in front of him
he<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:16.000> deal<00:01:16.210> with<00:01:16.240> it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
he can deal with it

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.679 
he can deal with it
