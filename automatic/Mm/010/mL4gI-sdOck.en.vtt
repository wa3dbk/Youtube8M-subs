00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 on television more atmosphere will not be seen 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.779
 known everything is ready for the great 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 final has been spoken much and for more than 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.610
 is spoken and said and predicted the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
 endings always have something special and I 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.900
 it seems that in this case it seems to me maybe 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 I was wrong that I had predicted a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.580
 green end it seems to me that the green 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.900
 will continue to prevail at this time in 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:28.349
 a final where maybe the factor 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.900
 differential is the advantage of knowing 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.880
 champions of the team already passed there already 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 you know what the meeting is about and I 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.780
 It seems that you will be more cold because 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 pachuca certainly has great 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.160
 veterans but also has many 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 twinks it's true that the final looks 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460
 very close two teams that did not have 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.079
 a good tournament but I mentioned when 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.149
 we started the program because they have arrived 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.399
 some of his best games in the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.260
 final straight of the championship and also in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.699
 this league I would stay with lion 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.110
 because I think the experience is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.210
 important that you mention to be seen 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 champions and pachuca has a team of 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.120
 young people that I think I was 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 weighing very much the turn already in 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 tower and lion 'instead it was solid 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 in the round with the advantage against 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.950
 toluca and I think that also what 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.840
 here came out in a final so even and a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.820
 tournament that has been so close to the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.230
 low level but very even pablo has 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.420
 marked difference teams that have 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.980
 known to take that advantage in its stadium 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.330
 normally in this group they have 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370
 maintained the advantage in the return and by 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.810
 that I'm staying with Jon is not that I remove 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.610
 possible that so that what you have with 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930
 that has a good front but I see 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.540
 more complete to the lion I think a team 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 that attacks well and defends well and 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.350
 pachuca is a team that attacks well and 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 back leaves me some doubts why I think 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.530
 that the equipment and still is could 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.030
 become or would become according to a 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.340
 computer in the second bicampeonato 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.100

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.680
