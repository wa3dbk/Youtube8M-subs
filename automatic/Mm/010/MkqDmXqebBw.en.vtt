years ago is often you know the best way
to<00:05:21.760> go<00:05:21.970> because<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.570> person<00:05:22.780> probably<00:05:23.020> went

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
to go because that person probably went

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.870

through<00:05:23.770> all<00:05:23.919> those<00:05:24.130> decisions<00:05:24.699> they

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
through all those decisions they

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.490 
through all those decisions they
replaced<00:05:25.270> everything<00:05:25.690> they<00:05:26.080> did<00:05:26.139> a<00:05:26.260> lot<00:05:26.470> of

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
replaced everything they did a lot of

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.800 
replaced everything they did a lot of
the<00:05:26.650> work<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.729> you<00:05:27.789> get<00:05:27.970> the<00:05:28.120> benefit<00:05:28.539> of<00:05:28.570> that

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
the work so you get the benefit of that

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.719 
the work so you get the benefit of that
and<00:05:29.050> probably<00:05:29.229> for<00:05:29.500> not<00:05:29.800> all<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.100> money<00:05:30.280> but

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
and probably for not all the money but

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.710
