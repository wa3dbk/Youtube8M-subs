00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
of these cards for Christmas and I like

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.320 
of these cards for Christmas and I like
thought<00:04:25.040> it<00:04:25.130> was<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.340> coolest<00:04:25.370> thing<00:04:25.820> ever<00:04:25.970> I

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
thought it was the coolest thing ever I

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.140 
thought it was the coolest thing ever I
hope<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.080> can<00:04:27.230> see<00:04:27.500> them<00:04:27.710> they're<00:04:28.610> very<00:04:28.790> faint
