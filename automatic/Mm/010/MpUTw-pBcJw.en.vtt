00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
batteries at once it actually has an

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.370 
batteries at once it actually has an
integrated<00:02:28.070> 200<00:02:28.880> watt<00:02:29.000> power<00:02:29.240> supply<00:02:29.390> so<00:02:30.350> you

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
integrated 200 watt power supply so you

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.550 
integrated 200 watt power supply so you
won't<00:02:30.650> need<00:02:30.830> any<00:02:31.160> external<00:02:31.670> power<00:02:32.000> supplies

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
won't need any external power supplies

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.900 
won't need any external power supplies
that<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.740> one<00:02:33.890> of<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.040> main<00:02:34.220> reasons<00:02:34.700> actually

you<00:04:29.120> press<00:04:29.270> plus<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.810> minus<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.590> goes<00:04:30.830> by

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
you press plus and minus it goes by

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.340 
you press plus and minus it goes by
fifty<00:04:31.760> million<00:04:32.210> which<00:04:32.419> is<00:04:32.570> really<00:04:32.900> nice

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
fifty million which is really nice

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.550 
fifty million which is really nice
charged<00:04:34.160> current<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.060> six<00:04:35.390> amps<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
charged current is it six amps the

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.430 
charged current is it six amps the
maximum<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.220> at<00:04:37.430> 10<00:04:37.729> amps<00:04:38.090> the<00:04:38.600> minimum<00:04:38.990> is<00:04:39.169> at

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
maximum is at 10 amps the minimum is at

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.159 
maximum is at 10 amps the minimum is at
point<00:04:39.770> one<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.669> discharge<00:04:41.479> current<00:04:41.750> I<00:04:41.960> have

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
point one and discharge current I have

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.659 
point one and discharge current I have
it<00:04:42.289> set<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.530> one<00:04:42.800> amp<00:04:43.070> I'm<00:04:43.160> just<00:04:43.340> gonna<00:04:43.520> leave

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
it set to one amp I'm just gonna leave

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.930 
it set to one amp I'm just gonna leave
that<00:04:43.700> there<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:45.100> once<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.250> guys<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:46.669> all

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
that there so once you guys have all

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.909 
that there so once you guys have all
that<00:04:47.090> set<00:04:47.479> you're<00:04:48.229> going<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.440> want<00:04:48.620> you're

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
that set you're going to want you're

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.440 
that set you're going to want you're
going<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.370> want<00:04:49.729> to<00:04:49.789> double<00:04:50.120> check<00:04:50.150> everything

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
going to want to double check everything

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.070 
going to want to double check everything
so<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.140> type<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.560> lipo<00:04:51.950> number<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.430> cells<00:04:52.700> to

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
so the type is lipo number of cells to

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.420 
so the type is lipo number of cells to
capacity<00:04:54.080> six<00:04:54.350> thousand<00:04:54.680> milliamp<00:04:54.979> charge

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
on for this charger I'm not sure if you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.279 
on for this charger I'm not sure if you
guys<00:05:51.729> heard<00:05:52.029> that<00:05:52.089> or<00:05:52.330> not<00:05:52.509> but<00:05:52.809> they're<00:05:52.990> very

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
guys heard that or not but they're very

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.559 
guys heard that or not but they're very
quiet<00:05:53.589> well<00:05:54.400> we<00:05:54.490> can<00:05:54.639> also<00:05:54.759> discharge<00:05:55.180> the

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569 
quiet well we can also discharge the

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.499 
quiet well we can also discharge the
battery<00:05:55.599> we<00:05:56.259> can<00:05:56.439> balance<00:05:56.680> it<00:05:57.039> so<00:05:57.249> bounce<00:05:58.210> it

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
battery we can balance it so bounce it

battery we can balance it so bounce it
is<00:05:58.659> not<00:05:58.870> balanced<00:05:59.259> charged<00:05:59.740> it's<00:06:00.009> just

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:00.279 
is not balanced charged it's just

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.989 
is not balanced charged it's just
balancing<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.939> two<00:06:00.969> cells<00:06:02.309> start<00:06:03.309> over<00:06:03.879> the

we<00:06:07.180> can<00:06:07.300> do<00:06:07.389> a<00:06:07.419> storage<00:06:07.930> charge<00:06:08.969> cycle<00:06:09.969> is

00:06:10.049 --> 00:06:10.059 
we can do a storage charge cycle is

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:11.909 
we can do a storage charge cycle is
actually<00:06:10.389> pretty<00:06:10.599> cool<00:06:10.870> taking<00:06:11.680> it<00:06:11.770> up<00:06:11.889> to

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
actually pretty cool taking it up to

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.779 
actually pretty cool taking it up to
five<00:06:12.430> cycles<00:06:13.349> and<00:06:14.349> your<00:06:14.710> options<00:06:14.889> for<00:06:15.309> cycling

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
five cycles and your options for cycling

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.719 
five cycles and your options for cycling
is<00:06:15.999> charge<00:06:16.479> discharge<00:06:16.930> discharge<00:06:17.919> to<00:06:18.399> charge

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
is charge discharge discharge to charge

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.469 
is charge discharge discharge to charge

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
and discharge charge and discharge so a

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:24.600 
and discharge charge and discharge so a
lot<00:06:22.960> of<00:06:22.990> options<00:06:23.199> for<00:06:23.499> cycling<00:06:24.069> your<00:06:24.189> battery
