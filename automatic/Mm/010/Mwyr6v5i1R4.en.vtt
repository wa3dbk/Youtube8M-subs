I just driving around town and even
trying<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.859> save<00:01:50.099> on<00:01:50.310> fuel<00:01:50.459> economy<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.939> little

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.029 
trying to save on fuel economy a little

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.030 
trying to save on fuel economy a little
bit<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.389> does<00:01:51.749> really<00:01:52.079> well

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
bit it does really well

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.240 
bit it does really well
with<00:01:54.550> feeling<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.390> has<00:01:55.510> enough<00:01:55.540> power<00:01:56.250> it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
with feeling like it has enough power it

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.620 
with feeling like it has enough power it
doesn't<00:01:57.670> really<00:01:57.760> do<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.000> great<00:01:58.240> on<00:01:58.390> fuel

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
doesn't really do that great on fuel
