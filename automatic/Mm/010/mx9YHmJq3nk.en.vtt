so next what we're going to do is

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.530 
so next what we're going to do is
depending<00:03:03.070> on<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.790> thickness<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.450> your

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
depending on the thickness of your

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.009 
depending on the thickness of your
fabric<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:07.090> really<00:03:07.299> needs<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.690> use<00:03:07.900> your

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
fabric it really needs to use your

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.039 
fabric it really needs to use your
common<00:03:08.350> sense<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:08.980> one<00:03:09.190> as<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:10.120> how<00:03:10.600> thick

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
common sense on this one as to how thick

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.840 
common sense on this one as to how thick
of<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.380> little<00:03:11.680> snip<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.070> we're<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.609> to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
of a little snip that we're going to

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.670 
of a little snip that we're going to
make<00:03:13.030> um<00:03:13.420> because<00:03:13.450> basically<00:03:14.079> what<00:03:14.530> we're

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
make um because basically what we're

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.430 
make um because basically what we're
going<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.920> be<00:03:14.950> doing<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.959> cutting<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.170> little

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
going to be doing is cutting a little

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.949 
going to be doing is cutting a little
slip<00:03:17.769> right<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.310> middle<00:03:18.519> right<00:03:18.790> here<00:03:18.959> and

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
slip right in the middle right here and

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.960 
slip right in the middle right here and
that's<00:03:20.440> what's<00:03:20.530> gonna<00:03:20.829> connect<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.579> bottom

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
that's what's gonna connect the bottom

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.099 
that's what's gonna connect the bottom
skirt<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.120> inside<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:25.810> is<00:03:25.900> we're

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
skirt to the inside here is we're

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.599 
skirt to the inside here is we're
eventually<00:03:26.500> going<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.769> tie<00:03:27.040> it<00:03:27.100> in<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.579> that

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
eventually going to tie it in like that

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.670 
eventually going to tie it in like that
and<00:03:28.150> that's<00:03:28.720> kind<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.019> how<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.200> style<00:03:29.530> is

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
and that's kind of how the style is

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.890 
and that's kind of how the style is
gonna<00:03:29.859> look<00:03:30.100> right<00:03:30.340> now<00:03:31.209> this<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.570> really

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
gonna look right now this is a really

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.960 
gonna look right now this is a really
really<00:03:31.930> thin<00:03:32.350> material<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.250> I'm<00:03:33.519> only<00:03:33.760> gonna

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
really thin material so I'm only gonna

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.569 
really thin material so I'm only gonna
do<00:03:34.239> or<00:03:34.480> probably<00:03:34.840> about<00:03:35.109> like<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.650> inch<00:03:36.130> or<00:03:36.370> two

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
do or probably about like I inch or two

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.900 
do or probably about like I inch or two
little<00:03:36.940> will<00:03:37.570> cut<00:03:37.810> their<00:03:38.109> little<00:03:38.560> slit<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
little will cut their little slit and

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.030 
little will cut their little slit and
like<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.390> said<00:03:40.450> use<00:03:41.049> your<00:03:41.170> best<00:03:41.319> judgment<00:03:41.859> with

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
like I said use your best judgment with

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.220 
like I said use your best judgment with
whatever<00:03:42.250> thickness<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:42.970> have<00:03:43.239> okay<00:03:44.049> because

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
whatever thickness you have okay because

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.809 
whatever thickness you have okay because
it's<00:03:44.380> going<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.560> top<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.890> tie<00:03:45.069> together<00:03:45.340> but

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
it's going to top to tie together but

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.000 
it's going to top to tie together but
you'll<00:03:46.329> see<00:03:46.540> what<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.690> mean<00:03:46.780> once<00:03:47.260> everything

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
you'll see what I mean once everything

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.309 
you'll see what I mean once everything
starts<00:03:48.100> falling<00:03:48.579> together<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.049> do<00:03:50.200> want

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
starts falling together and you do want

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.039 
starts falling together and you do want
it<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.590> go<00:03:50.739> through<00:03:51.069> both<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.209> front<00:03:52.540> part<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
it to go through both the front part and

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.949 
it to go through both the front part and
the<00:03:53.200> back<00:03:53.350> part<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.739> shirt<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.910> then<00:03:55.720> just

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the back part of the shirt and then just

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.900 
the back part of the shirt and then just
make<00:03:56.079> sure<00:03:56.109> do<00:03:57.100> your<00:03:57.250> best<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.489> can<00:03:57.670> and<00:03:57.790> get

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.959

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
in mind remember it also has to do with

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.210 
in mind remember it also has to do with
the<00:04:33.840> judgment<00:04:34.320> of<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.620> thickness<00:04:35.009> of<00:04:35.160> your

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220

the judgment of the thickness of your
material<00:04:35.880> okay<00:04:41.330> might<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:42.479> it<00:04:42.570> a<00:04:42.630> little<00:04:42.780> bit

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.810 

like<00:04:51.560> so<00:04:52.560> too<00:04:53.070> okay<00:04:55.340> now<00:04:56.340> let's<00:04:56.580> put<00:04:56.759> the
