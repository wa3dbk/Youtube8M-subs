00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.630
 the loaded widths shows a good expectation for this year's harvest and 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.430
 this large amount of coffee comes at a good time because balance between 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.030
 demand for coffee for both domestic and 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.890
 The expectation is that the 2010 coffee harvest surpasses 35% more than the year 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.520
 previous 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.110
 Brazilian coffee production is expected to reach US $ 45 million this year. 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.920
 This is the second biggest jump of the last ten years, 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.030
 of the historical production of the circus 2002 2003 the expectation is good because 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.930
 because you do not have a certain 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.040
 diddy reasonable for good this we are important because the world is passing 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.080
 of coffee 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.730
 when the decision has coffee can cater to world supply brazil 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.820
 It has to be made of a lot of power. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
 it has a larger share of that market than the expectation about the big 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.539
 amount of coffee 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.699
 hope is also of increasing quality of the product and it is in this 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.609
 that the producers have been engaged even with the difficulties encountered in the 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.610
 day-to-day we call attention and especially our responsibility 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.050
 of the cooperative that wants account with the good of the business begins in the producer 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.840
 is that it makes a perfect race to be able to have quality products that 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.200
 we import 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.880
 they are coming up very personal defensive solutions from vicente because 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.130
 many of them selling Brazilian oil are receiving little 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.240
 by our coffee I say that the producer the man who works the earth is a man 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.830
 of hope and he has got a lot of hope that things going there will kamia 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.600
 for the coffee grower joão batista who has already started harvesting 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.880
 the thinking is positive and the expectation is that this year's harvest will be better 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.790
 than in 2007 but what it does not use was better than last year 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.020
 but I already notice that both have helped the medina theme with the joints of now with the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.730
 Sun 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.610
 at the time of harvest so our expectation is that it be 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.160
 for this year and like the other producers in the region 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.570
 joão batista has also felt the difficulties of raising costs 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.070
 even so, and to the importance of investing and modernizing 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.539
 the greatest difficulties that existed in the high cost of 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.729
 mainly of inputs 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.969
 projects increase near end 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.809
 discreet dollarized 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.250
 in the case of the side downloaded automatically 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.690
 the costs remain high the next game the person has to invest 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.569
 I'm looking for a good drink. 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.399
 look for the idea of ​​a derby 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.809
 because I think if you continue with the old system or automatically 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:42.499
 it will not be convenient we are not preparing the terreiros prepares new 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:42.989
 north 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:49.040
 we play put dryer also markram dn chat in the future the dodo has a 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.429
 greater production 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:54.409
 on the other hand, the profitability better despite the difficulties 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.840
 the workers involved in harvesting the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.500
 coffee 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.700
 for them this year's crop is much better than last year's and he soon 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.330
 a lot of things are coffee 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.450
 gave much more né tato more like mode in the recall 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.300
 production was almost double 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.099
 the network more wins more transparent everything that is good for us 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.760
 after the results of the 2008 harvest 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.980
 the producer expects the industry to also 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.159
 next years 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.439
 we expect first a process that does not win those who feel better about the government 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.089
 decided annual but we won 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.039
 and improving with the price 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.709
 of the cafes
