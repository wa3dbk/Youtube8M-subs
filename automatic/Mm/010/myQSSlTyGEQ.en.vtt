for<00:01:06.780> telephoto<00:01:07.500> work<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> newest

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
for telephoto work this is the newest

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.300 
for telephoto work this is the newest
version<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> lens<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.920> image

version of the lens with image

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
version of the lens with image
stabilization<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.270> improved<00:01:12.990> optics<00:01:13.619> image

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
stabilization and improved optics image

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.050 
stabilization and improved optics image
stabilization<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> great<00:01:17.070> help<00:01:17.369> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
stabilization or is is a great help but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
stabilization or is is a great help but
it<00:01:18.210> makes<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> lens<00:01:18.750> much<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.380> expensive

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it makes the lens much more expensive

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
it makes the lens much more expensive
than<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> original<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> reviewed<00:01:21.659> last

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
than the original which I reviewed last

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
than the original which I reviewed last
year<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.950> comes<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.640> about<00:01:23.909> 800<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.750> 900

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
year it comes in at about 800 to 900

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.070 
year it comes in at about 800 to 900
pounds<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.890> huge<00:01:26.640> amount<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.060> money<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
pounds a huge amount of money for that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.020 
pounds a huge amount of money for that
price<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.710> n<00:01:28.890> better<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.369> something<00:01:29.790> special

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
price it n better be something special

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
price it n better be something special
the<00:01:30.900> build<00:01:31.110> quality<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.770> lens<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the build quality of this lens is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.280 
the build quality of this lens is
absolutely<00:01:32.939> wonderful<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.900> made<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.259> metal

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
absolutely wonderful it's made of metal

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.100 
absolutely wonderful it's made of metal
so<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.890> feels<00:01:35.100> super<00:01:35.460> tough<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.720> not<00:01:36.900> too

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so it feels super tough but it's not too

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.620 
so it feels super tough but it's not too
heavy<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> balances<00:01:38.549> well<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.060> nearly<00:01:39.360> any

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
heavy so it balances well on nearly any

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
Canon camera to be honest I'd much

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.210 
Canon camera to be honest I'd much

live in Wales like I do then that's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.100 
live in Wales like I do then that's
particularly<00:02:32.670> useful<00:02:32.850> as<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.270> never<00:02:33.780> stops

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110

so<00:02:37.530> having<00:02:37.740> image<00:02:38.100> stabilization<00:02:38.520> is

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so having image stabilization is

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.810 
so having image stabilization is
incredibly<00:02:39.870> useful<00:02:40.280> here's<00:02:41.280> some<00:02:41.490> video

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
is turned on the image stabilization is

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.610 
is turned on the image stabilization is
very<00:02:47.850> effective<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.570> well<00:02:48.870> behaved<00:02:49.230> on<00:02:49.440> this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
very effective and well behaved on this

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.250 
very effective and well behaved on this
lens<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:51.030> jump<00:02:51.270> or<00:02:51.510> jerk<00:02:51.750> around<00:02:52.080> as

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
lens it doesn't jump or jerk around as

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.710 
lens it doesn't jump or jerk around as
you<00:02:52.380> get<00:02:52.560> video<00:02:52.739> footage<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.090> only<00:02:54.300> problem

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
you get video footage the only problem

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.229 
you get video footage the only problem
is<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.470> bit<00:02:55.650> noisy<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:56.280> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.970> hear

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
is that it's a bit noisy as you can hear

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.920 
is that it's a bit noisy as you can hear
here<00:02:58.400> so<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.820> are<00:02:59.850> video<00:03:00.270> making<00:03:00.660> you

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
here so if you are video making you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.900 
here so if you are video making you
might<00:03:01.110> want<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.410> use<00:03:01.620> an<00:03:01.830> external<00:03:02.459> microphone

down to F 5.6 we see a nice improvement
this<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> really<00:03:39.480> great<00:03:39.600> performance<00:03:40.230> right

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
this is a really great performance right

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.610 
this is a really great performance right
from<00:03:41.040> f/4<00:03:41.570> let's<00:03:42.570> zoom<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.870> lens<00:03:42.900> in<00:03:43.320> halfway

down<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:30.990> F<00:04:31.230> 5.6<00:04:32.040> so<00:04:32.880> we<00:04:33.270> can<00:04:33.420> say<00:04:33.600> that<00:04:33.780> this<00:04:33.900> is

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
down to F 5.6 so we can say that this is

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.500 
down to F 5.6 so we can say that this is
one<00:04:34.260> of<00:04:34.350> those<00:04:34.470> rare<00:04:34.800> wonderful<00:04:35.760> lenses<00:04:36.270> which

a<00:05:26.220> look<00:05:26.430> at<00:05:26.550> some<00:05:26.700> other<00:05:26.850> optical<00:05:27.420> issues<00:05:27.780> I

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
a look at some other optical issues I

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.920 
a look at some other optical issues I
already<00:05:29.070> mentioned<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.850> even<00:05:30.330> on<00:05:30.630> a<00:05:30.660> full

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
already mentioned that even on a full

there's<00:05:34.260> also<00:05:34.470> very<00:05:34.890> little<00:05:35.100> distortion

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
there's also very little distortion

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.020 
there's also very little distortion
