00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 if he does not express himself to take turns he is pulsars 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.689
 mooing 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 so many more Felix in the lack 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.669
 The sun has been a very good year 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.280
 everton the type of ad program 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:17.220
 but hey, I think he discusses a good 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.609
 experience and very happy about 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.220
 I suppose that with that is very good 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.789
 to barça b and illusion start the 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.480
 project luis enrique and you will have the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.350
 No luck, no debt, a split 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.900
 content and good very happy and in 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.120
 work hard up to mold illusion 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.790
 here the competition is strong messi 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.140
 neymar alexis and surely go to the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.800
 front is always very difficult to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.080
 barça scares you the competition did not know 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.290
 from the first moment and I think that 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.380
 are in competition and well, I know 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.290
 football that team will try as they were 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.940
 impossible and help him here the last 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.110
 machine waiting for this season that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.540
 started 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.880
 especially at the level of groups with 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.700
 requests that is very important in the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:17.500
 personal but very impossible to contribute to 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.290
 team the most important thing I think it will be 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.360
 a great challenge 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.220
 Rafa already debutante with the first team 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.960
 but this loan goes on I suppose that very 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.540
 happy excited to dress again 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.730
 this shirt if I formed here the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.280
 Barça has taught me 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.930
 as a player and will come back here after 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.940
 being seven years in this club is a 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.250
 very large division when one marches 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.960
 even if it is donated, he thinks that maybe 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.270
 come back in your case was your main 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.610
 option to return to FC Barcelona yes 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.770
 logically belongs to the club and that's 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
 a challenge I did not know I had a 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 opportunity to play at first 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.690
 division of being able to have minutes 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.370
 and someday be able to return the presence of 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.710
 Luis Enrique has surely been key 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.940
 I'm excited to continue in your case working 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.410
 with luis enrique coach who is 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.200
 Celtic having made you debut in 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.580
 barça b I think that the Celtic we have 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.130
 made a very good year we have 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.300
 passed very well as in football and I think 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.390
 that the club has hit full 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.580
 bringing people to the barça you 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.820
 you know him well how is he like 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.580
 coach like that is grab is is 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.530
 give everything is to give everything to do 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.910
 things well what do you expect what is it 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.120
 you're more excited about this season than 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.730
 start to see that one month 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.860
 I hope to learn from these great 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.170
 players that I have the opportunity to 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.349
 be able to play alongside the best 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.349
 world
