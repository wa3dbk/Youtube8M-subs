00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
into the wild allows them to more

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
into the wild allows them to more
effectively<00:00:59.160> teach<00:00:59.640> kids<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.449> there's<00:01:00.629> an

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
effectively teach kids so there's an

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.990 
effectively teach kids so there's an
exponential<00:01:01.320> effect<00:01:01.590> by<00:01:02.039> investing<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.820> a
