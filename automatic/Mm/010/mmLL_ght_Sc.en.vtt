 go on par with varnishes opi oh

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.049
 health for nails and will not bring 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.939
 no harm i think is important 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.900
 fact and just so international 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.970
 organizations 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 no security certificate 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.560
 to any of the products it does not say 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.750
 about the fact that the product quality and on him 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.509
 should pay attention and so now I 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.030
 I talk about the advantages of this lotta talk 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.990
 only about the pros because cons I do not 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.960
 I saw so 1 plus of this varnish is his 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.320
 durability varnish is very durable and keeps 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.729
 on the nails it is from 5 to 7 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:50.270
 which is good he is not 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.910
 crack does not break off does not slazit he 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.010
 behaves well on the nails while 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.750
 I did not use any protective 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.110
 cover the top analog this varnish a little bit 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.270
 liquid 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.030
 more liquid than all my other likes 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.340
 but this pretty quickly possible 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.790
 get used to it and immediately adjusted 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.850
 apply this varnish and no problems 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.690
 I was not with this despite the fact that 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.600
 they are such 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.810
 more fluid consistency it does not strip 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.300
 you fit well on your nails and 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.430
 and another very important advantage of this 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.310
 to lap up that he is pretty fast 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.200
 dries if you apply this varnish in two layers 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.850
 it will dry in literally 7-10 minutes I 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 I think it 's pretty fast 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.360
 I usually have varnishes that I put on 2 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.959
 layer 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.480
 dry much longer and I bed on 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.600
 one of the nails 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.900
 erasing or something imprinted on not 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.709
 until the end in dried varnishes with this varnish 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.560
 no problem 10 minutes and can 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.079
 quietly sit nothing doing you on 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.510
 10 minutes I have enough patience also 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.360
 Ritlock half as much as normal varnish 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.060
 it is 15 milliliters and and standard 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.709
 a regular medium sized brush is not 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.870
 small and small 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.420
 she is comfortable painting nails no problems 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.980
 with this days also lucky dude and two 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.180
 metal balls 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.970
 which allows you to make good flag 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.780
 body is the most unusual these to me so 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.780
 like this varnish is what it changes 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.570
 your color depending on the lighting here 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.709
 many might think that a seven days 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:46.239
 itâ€™s boring to walk in one kind of varnish 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.370
 code diversity want something new 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.720
 somehow change 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:56.040
 nasa change nail color during the week 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.129
 this lacquer is not there because he 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.250
 changes its color depending on the lighting 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:06.340
 premises with artificial light he 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.769
 looks so exactly as in a bottle and 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 bring the sun with ultraviolet 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.549
 this lacquer changes its color and here 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.769
 my hue is so beige 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.479
 beige pink 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.579
 turns into golden very beautiful 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.940
 golden color with insanely beautiful 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.550
 looks with tanned skin and my 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.770
 delight there is no limit I have more through 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.510
 two weeks using this flag with 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.430
 great pleasure he is not 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.800
 bothers to the same chose this 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.289
 shade that is universal and fit 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.830
 under and all 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:44.320
 does not cause special attention does not pay 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.810
 to the power at the same time he is very 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.940
 beautiful he is versatile and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.590
 what I noticed here in this shade 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.419
 in my shades of lacquer 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.430
 they know others because others 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.340
 shades I have not tried this shade he 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.030
 as if absorbing surrounding colors 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.840
 if I'm in some dark clothes blue 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.450
 Gray 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.229
 then he goes to hell and with some gray 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.990
 low tide 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:12.190
 more so cold if we are not 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.389
 some bright clothes 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.539
 pink orange yellow red he gives 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:22.750
 more for a freezing and it is very 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.750
 interesting at the same time when 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.270
 go out in the sun she streets he 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.230
 turns into such a beautiful golden 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:36.090
 the color is very beautiful I will insert a video photo 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.190
 What does nails look like with this nail polish? 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.470
 sunny light and what it looks like when 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.250
 artificial lighting is very 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.670
 nice and 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.370
 the difference is visible and noticeable and I am very 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.790
 interesting i like it playing colors 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:55.140
 she amuses me very much 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.140
 use this varnish 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:25.520
 I think that this varnish is perfect 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.949
 do not you manicure me gazelles what you need 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.669
 for the summer such a variety 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.830
 here is this company del sol she 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:37.160
 specializes only in the legs of this 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.710
 there is no firm under the lacquer base 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.680
 cover 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.370
 only varnishes and color palette they 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.430
 somewhere in the 15-20 colors but it is pretty 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.050
 varied can be chosen for any 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.720
 mood for every taste 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.870
 these colors are also not modified 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.780
 I like it there very still and pink 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.110
 shades i know that on this one varnish i 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.470
 I will not stop, I'll take myself a couple more 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:09.710
 shades and I will be happy with them 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.430
 use about the density of this varnish 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:17.539
 and 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:18.650
 you are in two layers this varnish be so sure 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:21.650
 look at the nails 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:25.180
 as in the bottle two layers will be 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:29.030
 enough if you use some 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:33.169
 some kind of milky lacquer base 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:36.650
 or matte or opaque then but 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:39.340
 one coat of varnish is enough and she 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.460
 the piece will look as good as 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.150
 nails 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.789
 but it's their time to say that one layer 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.389
 this varnish looks somehow ugly on 

00:07:46.789 --> 00:07:50.840
 nails 

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:53.690
 it looks too pretty 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.840
 interesting but I still like it more 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.660
 apply it in 2 layers 

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:03.229
 I hope that my videos were for you 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:06.410
 I hope I told you interesting 

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:09.020
