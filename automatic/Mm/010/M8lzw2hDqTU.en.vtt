00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
the driver remember I use this for radio

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.270 
the driver remember I use this for radio
I<00:03:24.660> use<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.109> for<00:03:25.290> climate<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.889> everything

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
I use this for climate and everything

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.849 
I use this for climate and everything
else<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.609> done<00:03:26.790> here<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.329> looking<00:03:28.019> here<00:03:28.349> in

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
else is done here and looking here in

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.800 
else is done here and looking here in
the<00:03:29.069> MDX<00:03:29.519> that's<00:03:29.790> not<00:03:30.030> necessarily<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.720> case

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the MDX that's not necessarily the case

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.479 
the MDX that's not necessarily the case
and<00:03:31.290> so<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.519> find<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.060> RDX<00:03:33.599> is<00:03:33.810> setup<00:03:34.099> much<00:03:35.099> more

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and so I find the RDX is setup much more

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.180 
and so I find the RDX is setup much more
user-friendly<00:03:35.849> much<00:03:36.540> more<00:03:36.840> intuitive<00:03:37.319> much

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
user-friendly much more intuitive much

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.780 
user-friendly much more intuitive much
easier<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.849> use

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
easier to use

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.610 
easier to use
so<00:03:41.390> now<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.599> we've<00:03:41.780> discussed<00:03:41.900> a<00:03:42.290> few<00:03:42.319> of<00:03:42.530> my
