00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.350
 and 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:20.669
 this wheel is his very 2101 vase the thing is 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:26.000
 that she let me down there the camera 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:27.599
 sigh my camera wheels like u 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.599
 correct kid 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.950
 let's say so but that's not the point 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.360
 what was the question 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.350
 To buy tires in the fall for a penny I 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.079
 honestly wanted to buy 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 Belotserkovsky but in Kiev we find 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.820
 Belotserkovskaya was almost unreal and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.260
 although I haven't been looking for a long time in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 mostly some chinese 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.590
 which is nothing but normal nothing 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 no means this is now we have rubber 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:08.100
 I took the wheel and already winter here proezdil 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:11.340
 She has the top of this maiden belarus 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.399
 against a little bit more to face just not 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.409
 set himself on the back 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.069
 so I decided to make a video general I'm on 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:24.079
 this tires travel through the autumn and winter 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:28.740
 Now we prove what I want to say 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.829
 rubber is really great but i 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.579
 I bought it here 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.729
 175 70 r13 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:41.609
 I bought the truth of it official 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.490
 Dealer here in our auto shop 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.770
 the rink cost 400 hryvnia in my opinion but I 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.429
 I think the official she would be a little 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.649
 cheaper but that's not the point 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.289
 Chinese some rubber on the station 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.909
 there is nothing normal here 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:04.590
 tires behaves perfectly in the snow 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.590
 there were such cases on ice that it was wet 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.479
 in the street, then growth was taken the next morning there 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.280
 where even walking was difficult to 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.930
 no slipping quietly could 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.129
 drive a car 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:23.329
 rubber she is soft she does not dubeet on 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:27.180
 frost i mean i have a finger and and 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.819
 Well, that is, on a soft and because she 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.879
 I spent the whole day lying in the car 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.700
 put the wheel will be back that is it 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:41.310
 not dubeet and unfortunately a lot 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.430
 such opinions are bad now if this 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.099
 there is Russian and Zina or Belarusian then this 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.530
 bad tires guys aren't really 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.840
 tires are fine on my sable 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.389
 Russian rubber was a reward I already for 10 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.159
 years, I rolled the minutes, I want Belarusian 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.959
 great both on the road and on 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.299
 wet asphalt and even a motorcycle 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.819
 snow buff in the winter 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.669
 dissect before traveled then there are no 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.229
 never had problems and most 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:57.620
 opinions that are related to the fact that 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.419
 Belarusian there is equal to Russian tires 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.340
 bad well, in principle, nothing is justified 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.530
 so say people who favor 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.759
 guided by stereotypes that no 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.109
 foreign good is our all bad 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:11.519
 really untrue and say so 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.340
 people that is that never in principle 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.400
 did not come across this rubber or on 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.900
 some fake got well or 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.109
 interested in having something 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.789
 to sell 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.949
 the whole range of rubber which 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:27.460
 sold in the CIS countries 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:30.490
 Here are different Michelin Anton lag cho such 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.300
 no, there is some production 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.639
 varied unfortunately the whole thing 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.069
 Well, that is, if you take some brand 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.080
 the same Michelin tires is good yes 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.159
 really but firmino gum us 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.710
 nothing so proprietary normal 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.199
 principle does not fall and even winter 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:52.779
 vaunted studded tires which cost 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.210
 a bunch of money from beautiful stickers on 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:58.479
 in fact, it is not even worth half 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.409
 the money that they ask for it 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:04.479
 Belarusian tires that is what I want 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.439
 express special thanks to comrade 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.439

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.360
 normal rubber 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.610
 great skating rinks so i'm with confidence 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.819

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.120
