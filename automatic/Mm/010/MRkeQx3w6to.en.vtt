after<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.560> left<00:02:24.239> Lancaster<00:02:25.239> was<00:02:25.269> sixth<00:02:25.659> overall

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
after I left Lancaster was sixth overall

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.569 
after I left Lancaster was sixth overall
I<00:02:26.260> think<00:02:26.409> it<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.650> like<00:02:26.799> 10<00:02:27.010> from<00:02:27.219> computer

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
I think it was like 10 from computer

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.679 
I think it was like 10 from computer
science<00:02:27.609> or<00:02:27.909> something<00:02:28.209> like<00:02:28.299> that<00:02:28.359> but<00:02:28.569> i'm

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
science or something like that but i'm

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.780 
science or something like that but i'm
not<00:02:28.810> sure<00:02:29.019> but<00:02:29.230> soon<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.069> they're<00:02:30.189> about<00:02:30.400> 100

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
not sure but soon as they're about 100

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.459 
not sure but soon as they're about 100
universities<00:02:30.969> in<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> UK<00:02:31.689> that<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> pretty

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
universities in the UK that is a pretty

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.190 
universities in the UK that is a pretty
nice<00:02:32.739> number<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.489> think<00:02:34.359> it's<00:02:34.480> only<00:02:34.569> University

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
nice number I think it's only University

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.229 
nice number I think it's only University
that<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.469> can<00:02:35.680> go<00:02:35.919> to<00:02:35.980> because<00:02:36.849> I<00:02:36.939> don't<00:02:37.120> do

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
that I can go to because I don't do

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.000 
that I can go to because I don't do
miles<00:02:37.540> no<00:02:37.900> more<00:02:38.019> physics<00:02:38.379> because<00:02:38.650> most

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
miles no more physics because most

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.619 
miles no more physics because most
universities<00:02:39.430> require<00:02:39.669> you<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.180> do

universities require you to actually do

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.330 
universities require you to actually do
mods<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.169> physics<00:02:41.889> for<00:02:44.129> computing<00:02:45.129> and

computer science and stuff like that

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.599 
computer science and stuff like that
required<00:02:48.489> girlfriend<00:02:48.909> a<00:02:49.419> lot<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.930> them<00:02:50.139> don't

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
required girlfriend a lot of them don't

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.149 
required girlfriend a lot of them don't
and<00:02:51.609> they<00:02:51.699> help<00:02:51.909> specific<00:02:52.389> they<00:02:52.780> have<00:02:53.159> easily

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
and they help specific they have easily

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.099 
and they help specific they have easily
have<00:02:54.400> lower<00:02:54.609> grade<00:02:55.239> boundaries<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:55.930> one

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
have lower grade boundaries but this one

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.490 
have lower grade boundaries but this one
I<00:02:56.319> need<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.859> get<00:02:57.299> 300<00:02:58.299> points<00:02:58.510> was<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.019> 3<00:02:59.290> b's

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
I need to get 300 points was just 3 b's

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.089 
I need to get 300 points was just 3 b's
they<00:03:00.489> get<00:03:00.609> into<00:03:01.139> so<00:03:02.139> this<00:03:02.469> is<00:03:02.590> probably<00:03:02.829> this

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
they get into so this is probably this

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:04.679 
they get into so this is probably this
is<00:03:03.159> probably<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.639> best<00:03:03.909> to<00:03:04.090> teach<00:03:04.269> and<00:03:04.449> i<00:03:04.540> can

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:04.689 
is probably the best to teach and i can

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.599 
is probably the best to teach and i can
be<00:03:04.810> in<00:03:04.900> right<00:03:05.049> now<00:03:05.199> with<00:03:05.230> her<00:03:05.469> digging<00:03:06.219> a<00:03:06.400> year

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
be in right now with her digging a year

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.670 
be in right now with her digging a year
to<00:03:06.699> go<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:06.969> get<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.090> levels<00:03:07.540> again<00:03:07.659> with<00:03:08.109> miles

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
to go and get a levels again with miles

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280 
to go and get a levels again with miles
and<00:03:08.799> physics<00:03:09.159> i<00:03:09.370> wanna<00:03:10.329> auntie<00:03:11.109> one<00:03:11.169> day

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and physics i wanna auntie one day

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.599 
and physics i wanna auntie one day
because<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:11.680> don't<00:03:11.949> know<00:03:12.010> i<00:03:12.069> just<00:03:12.159> means

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
because i don't know i just means

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
moving down the cupboard I know it

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.159 
moving down the cupboard I know it
sounds<00:03:26.349> very<00:03:26.620> very<00:03:27.400> freakish<00:03:27.729> I'm<00:03:28.169> not

sounds very very freakish I'm not

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.629 
sounds very very freakish I'm not
entirely<00:03:29.470> but<00:03:29.680> i'm<00:03:29.949> just<00:03:30.069> gonna<00:03:30.189> be<00:03:30.280> moving<00:03:30.549> my

hibernating there for my free time and

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.539 
hibernating there for my free time and
then<00:03:42.669> it's<00:03:42.819> gonna<00:03:42.939> be<00:03:43.060> sleeping<00:03:43.329> in<00:03:43.419> my<00:03:43.509> room

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
then it's gonna be sleeping in my room

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.119 
then it's gonna be sleeping in my room
but<00:03:45.549> yeah<00:03:45.639> I<00:03:45.669> worked<00:03:45.909> on<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.150> computer<00:03:46.479> science

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
but yeah I worked on a computer science

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.319 
but yeah I worked on a computer science
I've<00:03:48.129> just<00:03:48.280> been<00:03:48.370> really<00:03:48.519> interested<00:03:49.060> in<00:03:49.150> that

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
I've just been really interested in that

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.420 
I've just been really interested in that
I<00:03:49.389> don't<00:03:49.720> know<00:03:49.780> why<00:03:49.959> I'm<00:03:50.949> just<00:03:51.189> one<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.310> those

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
I don't know why I'm just one of those
