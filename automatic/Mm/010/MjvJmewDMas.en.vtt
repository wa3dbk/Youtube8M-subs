00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
the writer Oddie's himself

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.600 
the writer Oddie's himself
so<00:03:52.420> think<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.900> as<00:03:52.960> kind<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.580> a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
so think of this as kind of like a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.010 
so think of this as kind of like a
comment<00:03:55.540> read<00:03:55.750> right<00:03:56.110> of<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.920> entire<00:03:57.220> series

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
comment read right of the entire series

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.430 
comment read right of the entire series
so<00:03:59.020> it's<00:03:59.290> pretty<00:03:59.500> fun<00:03:59.950> like<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:01.210> look<00:04:01.360> at<00:04:01.570> say

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
so it's pretty fun like to look at say

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.690 
so it's pretty fun like to look at say

not<00:04:12.220> have<00:04:12.310> realized<00:04:13.620> right<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.100> really

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
not have realized right so that really

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.530 
not have realized right so that really
adds<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:19.299> read<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:20.020> guess

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
adds to the we read I guess
