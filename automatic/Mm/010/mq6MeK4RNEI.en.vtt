00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
follow up until after I left university

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.229 
follow up until after I left university
but<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> was<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.459> there<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.910> something<00:02:09.149> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
but it was it was there or something I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.969 
but it was it was there or something I

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.890 
thought was quite exciting and that I
maybe<00:02:11.520> would<00:02:11.760> return<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.270> at<00:02:12.360> some<00:02:12.510> point<00:02:12.570> in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
