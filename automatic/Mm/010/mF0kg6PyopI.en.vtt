00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello friends of the viewer 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:13.080
 I will separately remove video but as a part of one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.780
 large video on the waist skin 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.630
 it's hard I don't know see here 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:25.830
 it will be seen that he is so bitten 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.490
 mileage is not big like that you can see yes norun 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.580
 rubbed 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 here it is normal here where basically 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.000
 hold on 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:39.270
 Makar's so on top of the steering wheel rubbed 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 I want to sheathe the skin for a better look let's say 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.340
 so for this you need to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.789
 remove the wheel naturally need to remove 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.640
 sheathe later in order to remove need 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.230
 To begin, all of the item will tell it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.800
 then separate video shoot her role i 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.510
 lay out well and in the general video too 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.539
 remove the terminal from the battery at the fore 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.760
 it's a little difficult to crawl there already 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.320
 plus closer but still shoot 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.780
 wait for five minutes to 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.420
 airbag to more precisely 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 airbag capacitor 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 discharged and she didn't shot at in person 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 but still somewhere below 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 then what we do next will need to be removed 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.909
 module i already climate connect the tray under 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.020
 open sky I will disconnect further 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.840
 need to remove the airbag module 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.630
 He is completely removed this thing 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.720
 in a house in four places are attached such 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.759
 Rear snaps need to remove the first 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 bottom then while you and 2 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 but on the reverse side, respectively, here 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.049
 here she can hardly show all this 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.320
 in general you will find the latest and the top 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.380
 module it will come out all here picking 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.390
 I will not shoot my own at first 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.730
 remove the plastic protective piece just 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.970
 pulling 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.070
 just pulling on continue sides 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.450
 raise the sides you can see here and here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.250
 so well actually this part 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.830
 removed on snaps and such here they are for 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.400
 account here latch here such 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.200
 guide rails here at the expense of the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.880
 the same thing is a latch that's headed 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 I put it aside we get access 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:32.130
 we put our hands upside down so here 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.280
 getting access to the top latch 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.710
 here it is here you are actually like me 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.690
 spoke lower more precisely due to lower 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.210
 then two side then top 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.180
 then removing the module picking remove not 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.850
 I will show you later how the module is removed so what 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.570
 continue the module is shot like this 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.980
 It looks like he's on a module 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.980
 Rank attached to white 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.030
 jumped on when removing here, then the bunk 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:08.330
 unscrew the bolt head for 24 such 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.330
 like 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.890
 short mark the location of the role 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.890
 it turns on the signal accordingly 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.020
 pillow itself 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.170
 click here on the legs and take out 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.080
 pin me all we unscrew god we shoot 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.920
 rub for respectively memory like him 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.740
 stood so that the probable place of the wheel is exactly 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.440
 Russ we remove further I will show 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:44.090
 Bardon same manipulations do the mark shaft 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 we take a marker so suitable better 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:57.230
 water resistant, what then robot 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:59.930
 worth doing a tag like this so somewhere 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.209
 here it is memory only later 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.209
 put what we are looking removed 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.630
 all brands of ruby 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:16.190
 remove neatly nowhere slowly 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:24.740
 take out wires for a long time and how 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:28.510
 uncomfortable of course all the steering wheel hands let's go 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.600
 ladies otshivat on this removal of the steering all 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.490
 reverse sequence setting
