00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.200 

and<00:03:41.200> here<00:03:41.980> there's<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.280> bunch<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.670> scientific

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
and here there's a bunch of scientific

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.480 
and here there's a bunch of scientific
atlanta<00:03:43.600> codes<00:03:43.840> so<00:03:44.470> again<00:03:44.740> because<00:03:45.310> i<00:03:45.430> know

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
atlanta codes so again because i know

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.240 
atlanta codes so again because i know
this<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:45.940> one<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:46.360> narrow<00:03:46.630> newer<00:03:46.960> HD<00:03:47.620> DVR

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
this is one of the narrow newer HD DVR

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.370 
this is one of the narrow newer HD DVR
sets<00:03:48.790> i'm<00:03:49.330> going<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.570> start<00:03:49.750> towards<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.230> end

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
sets i'm going to start towards the end

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.820 
sets i'm going to start towards the end
and<00:03:51.070> i'm<00:03:51.190> going<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.370> hit<00:03:51.460> test<00:03:51.730> power<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:53.620> i'm

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
and i'm going to hit test power and i'm

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.440 
and i'm going to hit test power and i'm
going<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.220> which<00:03:54.460> one<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.760> these<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.060> the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
going to see which one of these is the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.360 
going to see which one of these is the
one<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:55.780> turns<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.230> power<00:03:56.440> on<00:03:56.740> now<00:03:57.220> there

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
one that turns the power on now there

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.970 
one that turns the power on now there
might<00:03:57.520> be<00:03:57.580> multiple<00:03:57.970> sets<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.560> turn<00:03:59.800> the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
might be multiple sets that turn the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.850 
might be multiple sets that turn the
power<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.050> certain<00:04:02.050> ones<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.410> these<00:04:02.530> might

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
power on and certain ones of these might

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.950 
power on and certain ones of these might
contain<00:04:03.250> more<00:04:03.520> codes<00:04:03.850> than<00:04:04.120> others<00:04:04.420> so<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
contain more codes than others so you

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.450 
contain more codes than others so you
want<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.350> play<00:04:05.380> with<00:04:05.680> this<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:05.920> see<00:04:06.100> which<00:04:06.250> one

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
want to play with this to see which one

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.760 
want to play with this to see which one
has<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.000> maximum<00:04:07.390> number<00:04:07.720> of<00:04:07.960> codes<00:04:08.290> for<00:04:08.590> your

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
has the maximum number of codes for your

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.150 
has the maximum number of codes for your
remote<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:09.940> once<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.270> find<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.900> had<00:04:11.590> done<00:04:11.830> and

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
remote so once I find one I had done and

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.370 
remote so once I find one I had done and
now<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:12.820> have<00:04:13.060> two<00:04:13.300> remotes<00:04:13.660> here<00:04:13.870> now<00:04:14.080> I<00:04:14.110> have

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
now I have two remotes here now I have

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.460 
now I have two remotes here now I have
my<00:04:14.590> TV<00:04:14.950> remote<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.940> cable<00:04:16.299> remote<00:04:16.440> when<00:04:17.440> I

happens to control my denon AVR receiver

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.990 
happens to control my denon AVR receiver
so<00:04:54.820> again<00:04:55.090> i'm<00:04:55.210> going<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.419> select<00:04:55.570> done<00:04:55.930> and

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
so again i'm going to select done and

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.690 
so again i'm going to select done and
now<00:04:58.000> i<00:04:58.030> have<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.660> code<00:04:58.930> two<00:04:59.320> pages<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.950> commands

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
now i have to code two pages of commands

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.050 
now i have to code two pages of commands
from<00:05:00.880> my<00:05:01.060> denon<00:05:01.360> receiver<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:03.190> now<00:05:03.370> that's<00:05:03.730> the

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
from my denon receiver so now that's the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.780 
from my denon receiver so now that's the
basic<00:05:04.780> home<00:05:05.350> theater<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:06.070> have<00:05:06.340> right<00:05:06.580> now

i also have a DVD player so i can

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.820 
i also have a DVD player so i can
actually<00:05:09.730> add<00:05:09.850> in<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.090> DVD<00:05:10.510> player<00:05:10.780> which<00:05:11.680> is

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830

going<00:05:24.779> to<00:05:24.869> start<00:05:25.110> testing<00:05:25.559> codes<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.189> see

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
going to start testing codes and see

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:29.929 
going to start testing codes and see
