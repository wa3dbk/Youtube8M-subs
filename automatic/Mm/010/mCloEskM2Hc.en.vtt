 ultra is a smartphone by the screen 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.199
 of such dimension is very important

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.320
 you have a weight of only 212 grams 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.780
 then you can really manage with 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.790
 One with one hand is light is portable 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.440
 you have so many innovative things 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 clearly the first one we will see 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.810
 well is the optimization of the platform 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.310
 Android and six icons can be put in 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.650
 the scream we will see here

 the theme of the interface is that they are all 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.080
 the interfaces the little apps that 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.170
 we have developed then the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.260
 possibility to use to record notes 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.019
 or to use any more 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 here as a pop-up on the screen of the 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:07.409
 of the product in the product kings 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.299
 always talking about interfaces 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.329
 user we talk about applications it 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.579
 insert into the walkman world that is 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.560
 fully integrated with the world of 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.100
 sony music unlimited here for example 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.079
 we can see how the sony channels 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.329
 music unlimited are integrated 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.390
 directly in the applications of 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:30.979
 world where special money and with very 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.979
 personal channels 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.460
 the same in movies where you can 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.280
 directly integrate the world of video 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.860
 food let's talk about the screen 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.490
 is a trail screen a minus a new 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.800

 directly on the screen 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.539
 experience 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.850

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.830
 very broad and we can also make a 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.110
 demo 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.530
 that will not explain how technology 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.290
 luminous tri that is the technology 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.260
 seville hardware is getting together 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.580
 the ix reality software technology we 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 allow for example stop let's see 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.000
 a color contrast experience 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.580
 really good is that it 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.070
 let's give especially as we put 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.810
 six reality let's see how the colors 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.060
 especially the definition also of 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.060
 the picture image is much better 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.010
 technology software pixel qi together to the 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.610
 extra and luminous hardware technology 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.090
 display 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.460
 the screen is full hd then this is 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.180
 the first smartphone with the screen 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.120
 6 inch full hd first ones 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:11.680
 smartphones the market 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.299
 the processor is the wacom s80 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.580
 This is also the first product that 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.220
 has that his processor is at 200 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.879
 Qualcomm is a processor that has is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.430
 a club of 2.2 gigahertz and with a 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.010
 will make 2 gigs and we can say that 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.260
 this qualcomm processor have it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.730
 developed together directly to 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.040
 development of these products then 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.690
 the chip the product is really 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.440
 connected 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.440
 the tree 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.580
 good another very important feature 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.850
 of this product we can record notes 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.890
 you can write notes with any pen 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.000
 any pencil any styles 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.600
 then you do not need to have the shots 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.600
 specific to the product 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.129
 ok but also create 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.630
 with images I like and put it 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:17.220
 example like this 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.720
 and change a more artistic effect and 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.120
 put 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 with the same goal with respect to that of the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.720
 the photo is worth 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.890
 then any money any pencil 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.440
 to record and write we have 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.780
 two applications two in two weeks per 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.970
 this for this sense 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.460
 and wounds can also be used 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.120
 clearly as an e-reader we can 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.139
 modify the light of the light of the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:54.590
 screen put a stronger light if 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:58.010
 we want a more relaxing light and you have 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:01.419
 an effect very very much like the effect 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.419
 of the wound
