00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.090 
would be my dream squad thing to go to
but<00:01:57.600> ultimately<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.530> would<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> point<00:01:58.979> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
but ultimately it would be the point in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
but ultimately it would be the point in
NFL<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> mean<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.299> can<00:02:00.540> always<00:02:00.689> happen<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
NFL but I mean that can always happen so

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080 
NFL but I mean that can always happen so
I<00:02:01.229> want<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> get<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.619> college<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> then<00:02:02.250> get<00:02:02.969> my
