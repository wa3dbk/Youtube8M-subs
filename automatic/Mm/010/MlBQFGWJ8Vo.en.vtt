00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
farm in this fight over and over and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.850 
farm in this fight over and over and
over<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> chance<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.990> spawn<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.590> time

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
over and it has a chance to spawn a time

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.270 
over and it has a chance to spawn a time
patroller<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.060> meet<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.830> conditions<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
patroller if you meet the conditions the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.090 
patroller if you meet the conditions the
only<00:01:26.310> condition<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:28.530> freeze<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
only condition really is be freeze or a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.460 
only condition really is be freeze or a
three<00:01:29.400> minutes<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.840> easy<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.259> do

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
three minutes which is really easy to do

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.830 
three minutes which is really easy to do
if<00:01:31.740> you've<00:01:32.340> got<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.759> strong<00:01:33.150> characters

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
if you've got really strong characters

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.280 
if you've got really strong characters
from<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.619> campaign<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.540> you've<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.110> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
from the campaign so if you've got up to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.850 
from the campaign so if you've got up to
sell<00:01:37.590> cells<00:01:38.070> quite<00:01:38.520> good<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> though<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.680> up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
sell cells quite good and though one up

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.969 
sell cells quite good and though one up
so<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.329> need<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.780> keep<00:01:43.110> farming<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.710> fight

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so you need to keep farming this fight

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.800 
so you need to keep farming this fight
repeatedly<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> then<00:01:45.180> you'll<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> chance

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
repeatedly and then you'll have a chance

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.899 
repeatedly and then you'll have a chance
to<00:01:46.079> spawn<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.829> patroller<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> on

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
to spawn a time patroller like this on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.490 
to spawn a time patroller like this on
screen<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:49.310> then<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.970> guy<00:01:51.210> has<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> chance<00:01:51.780> to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
screen now then this guy has a chance to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.560 
screen now then this guy has a chance to
drop<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.950> Dragonball<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> guaranteed

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
drop the Dragonball not a guaranteed

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.230 
drop the Dragonball not a guaranteed
chance<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.770> he<00:01:55.860> does<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.310> chance<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:57.060> drop

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
chance but he does have a chance to drop

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929 
chance but he does have a chance to drop
a<00:01:57.299> Dragonball<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.860> drop<00:01:59.100> rate<00:01:59.340> seems<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
a Dragonball but the drop rate seems to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.649 
a Dragonball but the drop rate seems to
be<00:02:00.030> fairly<00:02:00.710> decent<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.549> fight<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.299> done

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
be fairly decent and this fight if done

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.609 
be fairly decent and this fight if done
properly<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.439> can<00:02:04.740> farm<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.909> say<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.810> minute

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
properly you can farm it in say a minute

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.150 
properly you can farm it in say a minute
so<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> minute<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.530> minutes<00:02:10.890> per

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so you you on a minute two minutes per
