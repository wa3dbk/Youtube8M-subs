00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.290
 differential

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.050
 We're going to find out where the heck is in the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.050
 air 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.119
 we're here coming to where the ground 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.640
 It's here, it's a closed bush where he 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.550
 Yes, it's a private reserve. 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.960
 where we take care of him and he 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.220
 it is very dependent on us then the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.740
 people have to be always feeding 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.660
 he can not though he understood 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.790

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.380

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.780
 very good time for him may seem 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 that the feeding schedule itself 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.460
 so let's see if it gets to us 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.490
 Can you see her sitting in the corner? 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.080
 only by observing the people who are 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.030
 little scared 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.700
 Let's see if it gets to us, let's go. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.700

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:23.480
 fear barked where he came to here 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 banana had banana comes to the ground 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.350
 I think he'll come to us and 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.860
 get down in the tree and if there are people this is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.340

 pretty little docile talk to people 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.370
 makes a gentle caress 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.660
 I think he's well accustomed to walking a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.140
 A little bit, but you do not see much good anymore. 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.110
