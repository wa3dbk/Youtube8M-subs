00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
 our company is a company that deals with problems that just 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.410
 allergy 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.339
 in essence we do am 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.139
 lol we are looking in Italy 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.349
 The most important causes are 100 allergic kitty 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.390
 causes that can be drugs can be cosmetic 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 they can be the most varied causes 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.650
 is made up of several CEs on TV 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.570
 around 30 euros there is whole and distributed throughout the territory 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.200
 national level of these centers 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 we have both a hey diagnostic and an activity as well as a research activity 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.680
 scientific 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 for example 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 and us for mind and mind 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.850
 and we evaluate how prevalence is behaving 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.399
 of allergies after several substances is present 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.950
 in environments with commonly used products 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.390
 society also is an educational task in respect to the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.480
 consumers 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 in fact we have a site 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.180
 outcome yes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.900
 call www 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 . siddharta montorgueil 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280
 and at the level of this site 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.210
 and there is a lot of information material 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.200
 It is one of the most interesting things, for example, and this product handbook 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.510
 cosmetics that allows a person who is allergic to an ingredient is a 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.700
 cosmetic 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.580
 to identify 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.800
 which cosmetic does not contain the active ingredient and to which it is the 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.440
 allergic patient 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.180
 this is very important because you think 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.280
 that some ingredients such as preservatives or essences can be 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.270
 present in emilia ryan 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.150
 and the products therefore sometimes very difficult 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.900
 for a person who has identified what is the cause of his problem, to avoid that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.910
 the problem occurs again due to lack of product information 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.440
 available 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.530
 we consider that today the problem of allergies is present throughout 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.410
 world 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.010
 en allergens 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.010
 and are increasingly widespread in the mind, think for example 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.019
 and to all the new drugs that are introduced to the market every year 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.500
 pecchÃ¨ very often now you can not cause allergic reaction 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.159
 many of which affect the puta 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.569
 so i think that emmy our company gold record at the very 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.919
 important not only in the in the treatment of diseases but own 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.169
 in prevention and in this sense we are very busy also at the level 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:44.479
 the environment for this reason the company is also called environmental dermatology 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.030
 because the environment too 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.760
 we are changing and new mint-related pathologies are present, ours 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.949
 task is to identify and early diagnose centers 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.259
 every year we do not organize a national congress 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.509
 to which participated in only dharma walls but also occupational physicians 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.680
 and therefore all who are walking contact 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.490
 I'm dealing with allergological problems 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.069
 that may interest the population 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.599
 this year we also organize a course for nurses precisely for 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.219
 allow health professionals to be closer to this 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.799
 problem
