the phone before I started so i could
give<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.959> an<00:02:18.140> idea<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.530> how<00:02:18.769> fast<00:02:19.129> it<00:02:19.430> really

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
give you an idea of how fast it really

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.080 
give you an idea of how fast it really
was<00:02:20.799> without<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.859> bunch<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.250> programs<00:02:22.489> loaded

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
was without a bunch of programs loaded

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:40.309 
was without a bunch of programs loaded
up

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.449 

it's<00:02:40.799> going<00:02:41.159> through<00:02:41.430> some<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.849> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
it's going through some of the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.509 
it's going through some of the
applications<00:02:44.629> let's<00:02:45.629> show<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.200> camera

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.349 

camera<00:02:50.519> works<00:02:50.879> in<00:02:51.090> landscape<00:02:52.939> and<00:02:53.939> it<00:02:54.150> does

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
camera works in landscape and it does

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.530 
camera works in landscape and it does
make<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.629> noise<00:02:54.930> makes<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.889> shutter<00:02:56.189> noise

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.129 

and<00:03:00.540> when<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:00.810> zoom<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:03.269> makes<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.719> zooming

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
and when you zoom it makes a zooming

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.789 
and when you zoom it makes a zooming
noise<00:03:04.349> which<00:03:05.000> I'm<00:03:06.000> hoping<00:03:06.239> often<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.109> can<00:03:07.590> get

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
noise which I'm hoping often I can get

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.789 
noise which I'm hoping often I can get
rid<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.129> through<00:03:08.549> a<00:03:08.579> registry<00:03:09.209> hack<00:03:09.450> so

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.059 

other<00:03:16.799> than<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:19.560> gives<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.919> an<00:03:20.010> idea

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
other than that that gives you an idea

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:29.119 
other than that that gives you an idea
of<00:03:20.430> how<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.699> phone<00:03:21.060> works<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:28.260> buttons<00:03:28.620> are<00:03:28.769> I

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
of how the phone works the buttons are I

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.280 
of how the phone works the buttons are I
like<00:03:29.939> the<00:03:30.060> feel<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.569> buttons<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
like the feel of the buttons and the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.610 
like the feel of the buttons and the
soft<00:03:32.250> reset<00:03:32.819> hole<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.239> right<00:03:33.419> there<00:03:33.750> instead

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
soft reset hole is right there instead

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.129 
soft reset hole is right there instead
of<00:03:34.769> on<00:03:34.919> the<00:03:34.949> bottom<00:03:35.459> where<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.269> is<00:03:36.569> on<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.750> lot<00:03:36.989> of

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
of on the bottom where it is on a lot of

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.179 
of on the bottom where it is on a lot of
devices<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.959> there<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.319> there's<00:03:40.919> the
