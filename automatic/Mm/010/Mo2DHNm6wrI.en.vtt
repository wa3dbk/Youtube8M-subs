alright<00:00:15.929> Ollie<00:00:16.410> impossible<00:00:17.100> well<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.609> one

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
alright Ollie impossible well it's one

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.070 
alright Ollie impossible well it's one
of<00:00:17.789> those<00:00:17.850> tricks<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.660> people<00:00:18.810> like

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
of those tricks that I think people like

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.990 
of those tricks that I think people like
the<00:00:19.230> name<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.250> they<00:00:20.369> are<00:00:20.609> curious

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the name a lot and so they are curious

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.790 
the name a lot and so they are curious
about<00:00:21.240> what<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.630> really<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.289> probably

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
about what it really is and probably

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.290 
about what it really is and probably
when<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.220> invented<00:00:23.430> people<00:00:23.760> thought<00:00:23.910> it's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
when it was invented people thought it's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.660 
when it was invented people thought it's
that<00:00:25.109> looks<00:00:25.289> impossible<00:00:25.529> because<00:00:26.099> during

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that looks impossible because during

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
that looks impossible because during
impossible<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> board<00:00:27.510> wraps<00:00:27.869> around<00:00:28.080> your

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
impossible the board wraps around your

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.200 
impossible the board wraps around your
back<00:00:28.500> foot<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.010> do<00:00:29.580> an<00:00:29.699> ollie<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.150> it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
back foot so you do an ollie and it

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.350 
back foot so you do an ollie and it
actually<00:00:30.330> goes<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> way<00:00:31.500> over<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.360> that

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
actually goes all the way over and that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.799 
actually goes all the way over and that
comes<00:00:33.660> back<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> where<00:00:34.110> was<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.780> well<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
comes back to where was and and well I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470 
comes back to where was and and well I
start<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.700> want<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.239> sort<00:00:39.450> of

these size 13 boats and i got to keep my
feet<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> way<00:00:45.570> when<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> thing

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
feet out of the way when the thing

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
feet out of the way when the thing
actually<00:00:46.289> comes<00:00:46.590> around<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.969> keep<00:00:48.180> my

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
actually comes around and I keep my

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
actually comes around and I keep my
front<00:00:48.600> foot<00:00:48.629> time<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.200> high<00:00:49.289> position<00:00:49.680> but

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
front foot time in all high position but

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.470 
front foot time in all high position but
also<00:00:49.980> off<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> side<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
also off to the side just get out of the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.680 
also off to the side just get out of the
way<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.340> there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.430> lot<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.640> scooping<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
way and there's a lot of scooping to it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
way and there's a lot of scooping to it
so<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.710> like<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:56.010> ollie<00:00:56.309> it's

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so it's not really like an ollie it's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240 
so it's not really like an ollie it's
sort<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.590> start<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.070> an<00:00:59.129> ollie

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
sort of like it's at start of an ollie

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
sort of like it's at start of an ollie
and<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> push<00:01:00.030> your<00:01:00.270> front<00:01:00.539> foot<00:01:00.600> forward<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and you push your front foot forward and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.340 
and you push your front foot forward and
that<00:01:02.010> gets<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> board<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> roll<00:01:03.690> around<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that gets the board of roll around so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
that gets the board of roll around so
it's<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> sort<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> sweeping<00:01:06.060> motion

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it's like the sort of sweeping motion

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.370 
it's like the sort of sweeping motion
your<00:01:06.510> foot<00:01:06.720> does<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.140> sort<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
your foot does and you're sort of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
your foot does and you're sort of
pushing<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.890> ahead<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.100> yourself<00:01:08.490> it's<00:01:08.909> hard

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
pushing it ahead of yourself it's hard

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
pushing it ahead of yourself it's hard
to<00:01:09.240> learn<00:01:09.420> sometimes<00:01:10.049> it'll<00:01:10.260> come<00:01:10.439> into<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> 360

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to learn sometimes it'll come into a 360

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
to learn sometimes it'll come into a 360
shove-it<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> won't<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.330> roll

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
shove-it you know it won't really roll

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.270 
shove-it you know it won't really roll
but<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.140> least<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> get<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.680> feel<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> it

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
but but at least you get the feel of it

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.280 
but but at least you get the feel of it
so<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:15.450> work<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.869> motion<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.259> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so just work on that motion you can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
so just work on that motion you can
actually<00:01:16.619> try<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.860> work<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.970> your

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
actually try to work on and take your

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
actually try to work on and take your
foot<00:01:18.240> off<00:01:18.299> step<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.619> but

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
foot off step off it if you have to but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.380 
foot off step off it if you have to but
uh<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.780> know<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.560> keep<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.390> kick

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
uh you know just just keep at it kick

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.210 
uh you know just just keep at it kick
down<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.930> forward<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.530> back<00:01:25.740> foot<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
front foot back and out of the way

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
as the board comes around and lean

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.580 
as the board comes around and lean
forward<00:01:38.750> readjust<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:40.020> foot<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
which is a perfectly acceptable landing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:52.610
