00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.280 
side and it's got holes for her ears and
it's<00:04:17.340> kind<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:17.760> plasticky<00:04:18.450> feel<00:04:18.690> little

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
it's kind of a plasticky feel little

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.020 
it's kind of a plasticky feel little
rubbery<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:21.350> um<00:04:22.350> I'm<00:04:23.190> gonna<00:04:23.310> put<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.640> on<00:04:23.760> her

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
rubbery and um I'm gonna put it on her

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.530 
rubbery and um I'm gonna put it on her
but<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.140> will<00:04:25.500> really<00:04:25.950> push<00:04:26.880> down<00:04:27.150> her

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
but I think it will really push down her

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.950 
but I think it will really push down her
bangs<00:04:27.990> her<00:04:28.350> hair<00:04:29.240> might<00:04:30.240> make<00:04:30.450> her<00:04:30.600> look<00:04:30.750> a

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
bangs her hair might make her look a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.500 
bangs her hair might make her look a
little<00:04:31.610> not<00:04:32.610> so<00:04:32.790> good<00:04:32.970> with<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.150> hat<00:04:33.300> on<00:04:33.330> i

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
little not so good with the hat on i

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.670 
little not so good with the hat on i
think<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.990> probably<00:04:34.020> will<00:04:34.320> look<00:04:34.500> better

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
think it probably will look better

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:41.420 
think it probably will look better
without<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.070> but<00:04:36.200> trying<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.260> try<00:04:37.530> here<00:04:40.430> yeah
