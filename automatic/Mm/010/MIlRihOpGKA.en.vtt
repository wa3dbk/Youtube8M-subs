00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
beautiful it just kind of cascades down

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.380 
beautiful it just kind of cascades down
from<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.930> spiral<00:01:28.350> slicer<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> will

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
from the spiral slicer and what I will

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.230 
from the spiral slicer and what I will
do<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.950> soften<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.549> up<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> bit<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
do with this now to soften it up a bit I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.469 
do with this now to soften it up a bit I
will<00:01:33.659> toss<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:35.100> drizzling<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.880> olive<00:01:36.329> oil

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
will toss it in a drizzling of olive oil

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
will toss it in a drizzling of olive oil
and<00:01:36.720> salt<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.290> pepper<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.680> let<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and salt and pepper and let that just

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.789 
and salt and pepper and let that just
sit<00:01:38.880> while<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.600> make<00:01:40.020> all<00:01:40.170> put<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> other

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
sit while I make all put all the other

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.310 
sit while I make all put all the other
ingredients<00:01:40.979> together<00:01:41.610> probably<00:01:42.180> 15<00:01:42.930> minutes

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
ingredients together probably 15 minutes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.830 
ingredients together probably 15 minutes
I<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.680> think<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.729> have<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> dehydrator

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I would think if you have a dehydrator

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
I would think if you have a dehydrator
that<00:01:46.229> works<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.740> well<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> warm<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
that works really well you can warm it

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.749 
that works really well you can warm it
up<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> bit<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.329> way<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.630> you'd<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.990> but

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
up a bit that way if you'd like but

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.920 
up a bit that way if you'd like but
probably<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.180> sake<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:51.689> I

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
probably just for the sake of time I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810 
probably just for the sake of time I
won't<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.380> I'll<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:52.979> have<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.610> raw<00:01:53.790> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
won't do that I'll just have it raw but

could use a mini prep you could

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
could use a mini prep you could
certainly<00:02:03.659> use<00:02:03.810> your<00:02:04.290> blender<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.369> make<00:02:05.549> this

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
certainly use your blender to make this

certainly use your blender to make this
sage<00:02:06.329> pesto<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.649> thing<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.920> wanted<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> say<00:02:08.399> on

have used spinach and then added just a
little<00:02:18.870> bit<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.470> sage<00:02:20.129> but<00:02:20.819> what<00:02:20.970> we're

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
little bit of sage but what we're

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
little bit of sage but what we're
wanting<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.569> try<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.409> get<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
wanting to try to do is to get the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
wanting to try to do is to get the
flavor<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.310> sage<00:02:23.730> somehow<00:02:24.299> infused<00:02:24.810> into<00:02:24.989> this

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
flavor of sage somehow infused into this

I also have this is the pesto that I
have<00:02:53.849> made<00:02:54.060> that's<00:02:54.299> going<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.690> actually<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.290> on

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
have made that's going to actually go on

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.830 
have made that's going to actually go on
the<00:02:55.950> butternut<00:02:56.280> squash<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.030> finished

the butternut squash as a finished

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.349 
the butternut squash as a finished
product<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.400> know<00:02:59.519> just<00:02:59.700> allowing<00:03:00.090> it

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
product but at you know just allowing it

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.789 
product but at you know just allowing it
to<00:03:00.390> sit<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> little<00:03:01.109> bit<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.500> let<00:03:01.650> those

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
to sit for a little bit and let those

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.190 
to sit for a little bit and let those
fake<00:03:02.160> flavors<00:03:02.700> marry<00:03:03.000> together<00:03:03.299> is<00:03:03.750> probably

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
fake flavors marry together is probably

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.349 
fake flavors marry together is probably
the<00:03:04.769> best<00:03:04.980> thing<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.459> do<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.329> a

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
the best thing that you can do this is a

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.080 
the best thing that you can do this is a
thicker<00:03:06.870> pesto<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.920> can<00:03:08.069> certainly<00:03:08.370> add<00:03:08.700> more

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
thicker pesto you can certainly add more

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.869 
thicker pesto you can certainly add more
olive<00:03:09.510> oil<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:10.349> make<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.709> looser<00:03:11.010> if<00:03:11.519> that's

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
olive oil to make it looser if that's

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.210 
olive oil to make it looser if that's
the<00:03:12.060> way<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> this<00:03:13.769> recipe

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
the way that you like it and this recipe

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.300 
the way that you like it and this recipe
also<00:03:14.430> does<00:03:14.849> not<00:03:15.090> call<00:03:15.329> for<00:03:15.359> salt<00:03:15.959> or<00:03:16.310> lemon

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
also does not call for salt or lemon

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.000 
also does not call for salt or lemon
juice<00:03:17.569> which<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.690> lot<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.870> pesto<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.349> call<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.620> I

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
juice which a lot of pesto is call for I

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.909 
juice which a lot of pesto is call for I
went<00:03:20.609> ahead<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.970> added<00:03:21.120> about<00:03:21.510> two<00:03:22.500> teaspoons

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
went ahead and added about two teaspoons

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.099 
went ahead and added about two teaspoons
of<00:03:23.370> freshly<00:03:23.849> squeezed<00:03:24.269> lemon<00:03:24.599> juice<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.959> that

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
of freshly squeezed lemon juice to that

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.409 
of freshly squeezed lemon juice to that
just<00:03:25.319> because<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:25.889> that<00:03:26.040> flavor<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.730> then

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
just because I like that flavor and then

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.069 
just because I like that flavor and then
and<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.500> enough<00:03:28.889> salt<00:03:29.459> in<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.540> pasta

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
and there is enough salt in the pasta

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.960 
and there is enough salt in the pasta
because<00:03:31.650> it's<00:03:31.889> softening<00:03:32.099> up<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.579> pasta<00:03:32.760> is

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
because it's softening up the pasta is

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.909 
because it's softening up the pasta is
causing<00:03:33.359> its<00:03:33.480> drawing<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.930> moisture<00:03:34.349> out<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
causing its drawing the moisture out and

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:38.330 
causing its drawing the moisture out and
so<00:03:35.819> I<00:03:36.349> really<00:03:37.349> don't<00:03:37.530> feel<00:03:37.680> like<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:38.040> recipe

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.330 
so I really don't feel like this recipe
needs<00:03:39.269> any<00:03:39.840> more<00:03:40.079> salt<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.859> that's<00:03:41.099> going<00:03:41.250> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
needs any more salt but that's going to
