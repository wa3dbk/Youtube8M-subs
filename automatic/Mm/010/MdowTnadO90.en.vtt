I'll<00:03:42.910> go<00:03:43.060> ahead<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.329> open<00:03:43.540> my<00:03:43.780> computer

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.760 

okay<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.840> being<00:03:47.990> a<00:03:48.080> little<00:03:48.110> slow<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:48.530> now

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
okay it's being a little slow right now

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.830 
okay it's being a little slow right now
for<00:03:49.040> some<00:03:49.190> reason<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:50.210> um<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.810> was

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
for some reason but um that was

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.430 
for some reason but um that was
relatively<00:03:51.500> fast<00:03:52.960> yeah<00:03:53.960> go<00:03:54.200> ahead<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.350> open

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
relatively fast yeah go ahead and open

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.430 
relatively fast yeah go ahead and open
another<00:03:54.770> program<00:03:55.160> here<00:03:55.370> ccleaner<00:03:56.230> boom<00:03:57.230> there

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
another program here ccleaner boom there

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.480 
another program here ccleaner boom there
it<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.400> it's<00:03:58.610> pretty<00:03:58.820> quick<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.680> yeah<00:04:01.310> let

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
it is so it's pretty quick so yeah let

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.420 
it is so it's pretty quick so yeah let
me<00:04:01.550> go<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.670> show<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> specs<00:04:03.430> properties

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
me go and show you the specs properties

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.220 
me go and show you the specs properties
ooh<00:04:04.640> I<00:04:04.880> have<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.030> do<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.210> BIOS<00:04:05.540> update<00:04:05.840> on<00:04:05.960> this<00:04:06.080> I

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
ooh I have to do a BIOS update on this I

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.740 
ooh I have to do a BIOS update on this I
just<00:04:06.350> remembered<00:04:06.800> but<00:04:07.460> um<00:04:07.670> Dell<00:04:08.390> computer

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
just remembered but um Dell computer

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.590 
just remembered but um Dell computer
corporation<00:04:08.930> latitude<00:04:09.620> d600

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
corporation latitude d600

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.950 
corporation latitude d600
the<00:04:11.600> Dell<00:04:12.440> om<00:04:12.950> system<00:04:13.730> information<00:04:13.910> thing<00:04:14.450> so

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
the Dell om system information thing so

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.300 
the Dell om system information thing so
that's<00:04:15.110> why<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.320> has<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.590> Dell<00:04:15.770> logo<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.250> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
that's why it has the Dell logo and the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.300 
that's why it has the Dell logo and the
support<00:04:16.730> button<00:04:17.239> it's<00:04:18.110> alive<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.500> d600<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
support button it's alive to d600 the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.340 
support button it's alive to d600 the
Intel<00:04:19.580> Pentium<00:04:19.700> M<00:04:19.940> processor<00:04:20.390> it<00:04:20.630> says<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:21.200> is

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
Intel Pentium M processor it says it is

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.620 
Intel Pentium M processor it says it is
a<00:04:21.470> 1.8<00:04:22.100> gigahertz<00:04:22.870> Pentium<00:04:23.870> M<00:04:24.080> dolphin<00:04:25.630> 7:45

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
a 1.8 gigahertz Pentium M dolphin 7:45

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
a 1.8 gigahertz Pentium M dolphin 7:45
so<00:04:27.110> that's<00:04:27.290> like<00:04:28.250> almost<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.420> best<00:04:29.750> CPU<00:04:30.470> they

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
so that's like almost the best CPU they

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.400 
so that's like almost the best CPU they
got<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.340> 760<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.240> best<00:04:32.450> which<00:04:33.110> my<00:04:33.260> old

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
got the 760 is the best which my old

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.500 
got the 760 is the best which my old
d810<00:04:33.860> used<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.070> have<00:04:34.160> but<00:04:34.340> 1.8<00:04:34.940> gigahertz<00:04:34.970> is

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
d810 used to have but 1.8 gigahertz is

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.650 
d810 used to have but 1.8 gigahertz is
good<00:04:35.720> enough<00:04:35.900> it's<00:04:36.440> got<00:04:36.590> 1<00:04:36.770> gig<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:37.100> ram<00:04:37.660> and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
good enough it's got 1 gig of ram and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.250 
good enough it's got 1 gig of ram and
yeah<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:41.180> can<00:04:41.660> go<00:04:41.810> ahead<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.050> run<00:04:42.170> a<00:04:42.200> program

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
yeah so I can go ahead and run a program

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.450 
yeah so I can go ahead and run a program
on<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.920> just<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.280> show<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.600> know<00:04:45.370> how<00:04:46.370> it

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
on it just to show you you know how it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.280 
on it just to show you you know how it
works<00:04:46.670> as<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.720> can<00:04:47.840> see<00:04:47.990> that<00:04:48.140> nice

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
works as you can see that nice

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.110 
works as you can see that nice
resolution<00:04:48.920> certainly<00:04:49.460> does<00:04:49.730> help<00:04:49.910> when

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
resolution certainly does help when

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.310 
resolution certainly does help when
you're<00:04:50.240> doing<00:04:50.720> webpages

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
you're doing webpages

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.880 
you're doing webpages
so<00:04:51.920> there's<00:04:52.070> Google<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.660> yeah<00:04:54.530> we<00:04:54.680> can<00:04:54.710> go

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
so there's Google and yeah we can go

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:01.000 
so there's Google and yeah we can go
ahead<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.040> load<00:04:55.630> YouTube

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.020 

and<00:05:01.700> boom<00:05:01.970> there<00:05:02.240> it<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.470> so<00:05:03.470> this<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.430> really

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
and boom there it is so this is a really

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.690 
and boom there it is so this is a really
really<00:05:05.210> good<00:05:05.420> computer<00:05:06.100> $60<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.280> mean<00:05:07.430> come<00:05:07.580> on

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
really good computer $60 I mean come on

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.190 
really good computer $60 I mean come on
all<00:05:07.850> I<00:05:07.970> had<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.150> do<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.420> put<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.630> hard<00:05:08.840> drive<00:05:09.020> in

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
all I had to do is put a hard drive in

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320 
all I had to do is put a hard drive in
it<00:05:09.320> but<00:05:09.950> I've<00:05:10.070> already<00:05:10.340> done<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.640> it's<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:11.000> 40

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
it but I've already done that it's a 40

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.250 
it but I've already done that it's a 40
gigabyte<00:05:12.520> yeah<00:05:13.520> it's<00:05:14.030> also<00:05:14.150> got<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.420> 32

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
gigabyte yeah it's also got a 32

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.610 
gigabyte yeah it's also got a 32
megabyte<00:05:15.860> graphics<00:05:16.280> card<00:05:16.490> ATI<00:05:16.940> Radeon<00:05:17.410> but<00:05:18.410> it

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
megabyte graphics card ATI Radeon but it

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.380 
megabyte graphics card ATI Radeon but it
is<00:05:18.770> still<00:05:19.010> pretty<00:05:19.340> good<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.580> think<00:05:19.970> it<00:05:20.030> has<00:05:20.150> some

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
sort of shared memory I'm not entirely

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.730 
sort of shared memory I'm not entirely
sure<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:25.010> yeah<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.180> um<00:05:26.510> that's<00:05:26.870> pretty<00:05:27.170> much<00:05:27.410> it
