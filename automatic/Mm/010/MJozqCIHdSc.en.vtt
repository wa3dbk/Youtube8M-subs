00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 at the sports complex the future in Amsterdam 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.589
 played young psv against ajax yesterday 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.590
 and of course those are always fun 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 competitions and psv do it normally 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.950
 always spoken well in Amsterdam 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 the last four games 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.670
 won and that faith is something for 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 tonight here gianluca maria 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 sharks the striker flanked by elvio 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.310
 van overbeek and giraldo alberto antonio 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.119
 way of overbeek in the pursuit 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.119
 we mats zipper 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 breasts with frost and then one 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.690
 unfortunate moment after one and a half 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 minute play 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.000
 maria collides with a spork carriage 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000
 and that doesn't look good 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.940
 the players on the field but the to the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.890
 side 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.410
 sent physio's into the field because 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 this was a big blow 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.530
 watch how that defend from ajax to the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.530
 ground goes totally croky 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.649
 and trainer tick off the promise of ajax 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 indicates change 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.040
 that applies to both these sports members 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 as well as john books maria 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.820
 they both could not compete 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 continue animals eyes training van 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.150
 menno koch 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.439
 referee lindhout gives a free pass 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.020
 pedaling that becomes incredibly fast 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.220
 taken out of the picture it is s series that 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.220
 kicking the ball and praying once 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.110
 smiling faces at ajax because this is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 an ingenious piece 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.159
 football from lesbian so deep everything up 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.630
 socket ever against lille and he is 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.630
 inside the animals stab young psv 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.560
 no chance of benjamin of leather 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.360
 psv then with menno koch long ball on 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.800
 he had to come for asana in the teams 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
 maria di tutti stars and where is the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.600
 equalizer 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.290
 elvio van overbeek and for dessert this 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.820
 somersault and so young psv de 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.860
 all the way back in the competition 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.560
 in the back at ajax it didn't look good 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.770
 from miscommunication between van rijn and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.770
 cillessen and solo is the smiling third 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.399
 and for van overbeek it is all one 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.399
 very cold trick 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.010
 and these are beautiful pictures 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.140
 many of the boys from young psv played 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.090
 also against Ajax on Saturday 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.060
 that was then with the a1 and then ajax won 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.300
 with a zero now images from the 2nd 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.300
 half 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.180
 Ajax is building an attack through this 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.020
 number 8 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.610
 yener arica serero back on africa 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.130
 and that pressure off so ricardo van rhijn 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.870
 the stationing but there is always 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 farmers who takes care of the two one 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.480
 animal shot from van rhine like that farmers 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.370
 therefore completely free and no offside 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.750
 so back on the promise from Amsterdam 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.780
 head Start 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.720
 zippers with lots of room for farmers 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 serero zipper this looks like one 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.180
 beautiful attack magog can get rid of that ball 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.180
 this then the rest 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:24.030
 antonio bush but psv does not get the ball 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.340
 gone and that's a serero in it 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.519
 only still falling off and three and 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.519
 for young ajax and so it goes quickly 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.989
 well played this ospitalieri comes to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.340
 makes learning there is still allowed to can 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.310
 the ball does not go and it says so 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.110
 three one and what can psv then 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.000
 van overbeek heading the header 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.000
 from antonio handsome rescue cillessen 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.500
 excellent attack good headers too 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.510
 what and ditto rescue 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.510
 africa on farmers 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.970
 how we get back to africa 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.860
 these are chances to say but that will be the 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:10.030
 ajax midfielder also know of 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.440
 Rhine 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.030
 oh i get your ball happy with this 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.120
 ricardo van rhijn you do this then 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.970
 handsome on my career my van hold 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.680
 he okay 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.580
 the that twenty minutes play seems the 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.380
 game decided here and one 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.360
 piece of art say from ricardo van rhijn 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.520
 here he has completely lost the ball 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.170
 gets the ball with luck from farmers 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.690
 what bond that is along or already offers you 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.000
 it remains very calm 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.180
 he makes Ajax fourth goal of the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.180
 evening 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.770
 lukoki is not coming out 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.740
 still gets the ball back lukoki with 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.230
 the ball verbally ends up on the post 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.120
 ajax but it wins with four of a young 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.200
 psv 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.030
 that's a damper for the team at 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.190
 make how loose it will sink some spots 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.260
 on the rankings 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.780
 these are the other results az wins from 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.760
 the county fc groningen of ado and 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.220
 then challenge the surprise Heerenveen bucket 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.500
 beat FC Twente and that's the first one 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.020
 loss for FC Twente this season 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.350
 continue booking heracles fc utrecht and 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.270
 vitesse big wins the score 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.940
 delicious the barrel will crawl a little closer 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.220
 with fc twente and psv that could have been possible 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.020
 do had won the ajax 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.820
 happens there is no ajax climbs to place 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.110
 9 and now has 19 points out of 13 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.300
 competitions and here completely changed 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.450
 nothing you renault kadjar always top score 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.710
 of young psv elvio van overbeek 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.479
 his first 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.530
 but will have to make up a bit more 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.530
 these cards appear
