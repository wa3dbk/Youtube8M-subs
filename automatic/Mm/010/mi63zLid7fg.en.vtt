00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.360
 hi all the players say tv 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.540
 in this video he tries to teach you maccaroni pages for his paper 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.229
 player 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:08.749
 which you represent for 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:11.749
 let's start 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.189
 let's start from the background select images column some occupy a little bit of 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.279
 space 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 I elect to cover everything 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.939
 since there is no word we should color com dark orange for example 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.539
 this 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.840
 at the next level 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.370
 let's go to page 1 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.130
 to select the bowl 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.130
 we color it beautifully 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
 and we bring it this way 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.530
 now the bike viticella 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 and we bring it to this position 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.780
 we duplicate level 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 and we bring the new bocciato so that it is a mirror image of the other 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.690
 in this way 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.380
 how to form a sort 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.220
 of ray ban glasses 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 now I always have page 1 we select the circle 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.980
 we color it free 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.700
 we position it in the center 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 I foresee a drop as if it were born 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.220
 now let's go make the mouth 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.020
 let's go to page 19 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.020
 and select the middle oval 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 for the pc we have and we color it of what 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.100
 we bring it under the other levels 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.420
 done 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 and now let's go create the eyes 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 therefore always with the circle page 1 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.720
 we position at the top 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.520
 compact 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 small pools 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 and here is made pedobear tweezers levels 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.420
 but now we have three levels to add some details 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.129
 for those who have availability of 3-level bikes we can ok the contours of the 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.129
 areas of the nose and mouth to make it Reggio Emilia 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:18.789
 let's go to the level 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:20.209
 we publish 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.619
 and color the new black level 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:28.009
 lu free we bring it under the previous level we expect slightly 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.879
 how to read 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.599
 the edge of the bag I passed over the other thing and therefore we remain to carry 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 once again place the one below 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.059
 now we see another drop we publish the new help we color by 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.799
 black 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.859
 so let's do the same procedure as before 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.859
 and with this motor bike the edge of the nose 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.779
 now let's send it better than we do the same thing 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.139
 duplicate 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.969
 we color black low number 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:03.209
 bassano proportions 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.819
 we resume the day 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.099
 here is done pedobear finished 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.480
