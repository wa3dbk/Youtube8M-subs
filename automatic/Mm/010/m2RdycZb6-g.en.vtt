00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.299
 dvd criticism with another 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.230
 documentation for recommendation or better 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.679
 said to a film of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.240
 semi-documentary story of the fight 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.040
 lit against the terror from the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.199
 view of some victims who actually 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.580
 so happened and that's it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.580
 now to road to guantanamo 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.119
 October 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:45.000
 she is with american forces and the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 world tour 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.030
 the crowded 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.520
 people from the unpacking 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 luca toni 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.680
 11 19 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.690
 Roth from the year 2006 goes 95 minutes 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.010
 is the twelve years released told 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.160
 the story of three or respectively 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.110
 Four friends typing in england 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.910
 live and around the year 2001 to pakistan 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.160
 Leave because one of these friends 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.440
 wants to marry and the others want to marry them 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.180
 want to accompany as they briefly and 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.760
 decide to arrive as in pakistan 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260
 are in neighboring afghanistan 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.640
 to provide humanitarian aid and is there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.230
 the documentation in a little bit the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.880
 explanation why they are on the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.770
 idea come there is no special 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.270
 occasion also the human level 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.800
 which one accepted then but so 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 somehow that stays if you have this docu 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.060
 Look at the question mark 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.310
 it comes to the attack on Afghanistan 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.840
 capture these same men one 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.850
 disappears completely and is also in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.290
 Reality never found again 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.820
 so you have to assume 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.440
 that he attacks during one of these attacks 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.030
 is born a convoy bombarded 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.500
 died and then the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.490
 history just the other three 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.800
 friends told in captivity 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.690
 are often interrogated and 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.320
 finally in guantanamo in cuba 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.330
 land 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.910
 and how many stations are there 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.190
 full of folk haas imprisonment and 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.320
 many captivity and many many 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.450
 to go through prejudices and that is 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.920
 very very concise and very very 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.170
 intense if you look at these 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.760
 Documentation road to guantanamo looks on 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.620
 So you just get the story the 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.510
 actually happened here for 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.130
 most part after being shot with 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.110
 we act very much the whole 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.180
 peppered with archive material as 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 recordings and that is very intense 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.700
 and very interesting and in all views 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.110
 you often suspect and then all the more 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.790
 closer to him when you look at yourself 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.070
 the intensity of this documentation times 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.330
 really is true 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.370
 this documentation after on the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.410
 2006 berlinale with the silver bear 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.880
 been awarded for the best direction 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.560
 and all the actors or three 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.180
 main actors are then on the return flight 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 to england also at the airport directly 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.000
 arrested and interrogated 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.190
 For now, because I think so very much 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.769
 brave and good that one too 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.670
 documentation already in 2004 2005 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.040
 was filmed 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.900
 than all actuality in the ground 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.400
 terrorism much more in the media 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.070
 was just set up 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.140
 due to the proximity of the eleventh of september 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.850
 2000 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.190
 1 and the events in Afghanistan 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.470
 In Iraq, I have to say that I have to keep my hat off 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.299
 a very well done documentation the 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.890
 also on youtube in full , among others 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.510
 length on any channels 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.650
 find who is uploaded is now 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.030
 now has lust may be the 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.070
 Of course , I lose sight of it 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.900
 for that you prefer to buy them 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.280
 should be there documentation with me 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.470
 no evaluation but especially one 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.120
 Such a theme I find always had 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.830
 she would be special in 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.540
 is contemporary and because it is the same 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.130
 maybe one or two eyes 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.110
 opens and above all to discussions 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.910
 not only stimulates over human dignity 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.070
 but also the question of how to get religion 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.690
 constantly before adjusts to the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.070
 to fight terror and also on 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.840
 often not on the western side 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.520
 differentiated and enemy images shield where 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.350
 they should not be 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.830
 and again and again walls build bridges 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.930
 belong all this is among other things 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.950
 thematized in this documentation ok 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.650
 I hope I have the one or 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.180
 others have some interest now 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.860
 breathe in this movie is worth it 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.220
 In any case, otherwise it was 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.320
 now from me to road to guantanamo 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.210
