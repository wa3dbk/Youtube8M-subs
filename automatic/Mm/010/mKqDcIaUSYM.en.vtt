lens it's all metal even the focus ring
that<00:00:24.330> I'm<00:00:24.420> turning<00:00:24.600> at<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.900> moment<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> metal

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that I'm turning at the moment is metal

that I'm turning at the moment is metal
you<00:00:26.510> can<00:00:27.510> see<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> barrel<00:00:27.990> does<00:00:28.830> extend<00:00:29.580> quite

you can see the barrel does extend quite

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.280 
you can see the barrel does extend quite
a<00:00:30.000> bit<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.309> focused<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> macro<00:00:32.940> mode

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
a bit when it's focused in macro mode

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.660 
a bit when it's focused in macro mode
but<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.410> will<00:00:34.530> retreat<00:00:34.950> back<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.460> body

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
but it will retreat back into the body

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
but it will retreat back into the body
as<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.570> focus<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> infinity<00:00:39.469> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
as I focus to infinity this is the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.869 
as I focus to infinity this is the
aperture<00:00:41.219> blades<00:00:42.020> it's<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.879> hexagonal

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
aperture blades it's kind of a hexagonal

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
aperture blades it's kind of a hexagonal
Baca<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.320> smooth<00:00:47.809> circular<00:00:48.809> blur<00:00:49.379> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Baca it's not smooth circular blur so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:58.610 
Baca it's not smooth circular blur so
that's<00:00:50.309> F<00:00:50.579> 2.4<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.920> f-22<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> here's<00:00:58.469> some

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
that's F 2.4 to f-22 so here's some

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.729 
that's F 2.4 to f-22 so here's some
examples<00:00:59.000> it's<00:01:00.000> not<00:01:00.149> scientific<00:01:00.870> but<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
very soft at the edges so it's a bit of

then just a pull focus down the line and

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.240 
then just a pull focus down the line and
this<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.720> what<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.959> finished<00:03:38.109> piece<00:03:38.410> of<00:03:38.680> work

this is what the finished piece of work
looks<00:03:39.579> like

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.410
