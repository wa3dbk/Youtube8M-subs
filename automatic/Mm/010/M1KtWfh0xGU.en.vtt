full strain reliefs and the sensors and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.460 
full strain reliefs and the sensors and
then<00:00:23.320> there's<00:00:24.570> actually<00:00:25.570> an<00:00:25.720> exposed<00:00:26.140> tip

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
then there's actually an exposed tip

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.620 
then there's actually an exposed tip
thermocouple<00:00:26.980> here<00:00:27.369> so<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.210> can<00:00:28.360> get<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
thermocouple here so you can get the

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.360 
thermocouple here so you can get the
camera<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.050> focus<00:00:29.260> on<00:00:29.560> this<00:00:32.010> these<00:00:33.010> exposed

camera to focus on this these exposed
tip<00:00:33.730> thermocouples<00:00:34.510> are<00:00:34.989> made<00:00:35.770> so<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.190> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
tip thermocouples are made so that the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.840 
tip thermocouples are made so that the
stainless<00:00:37.780> /<00:00:37.900> braiding<00:00:38.380> is<00:00:38.530> grounded<00:00:39.160> or

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
stainless / braiding is grounded or

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.670 
stainless / braiding is grounded or
should<00:00:40.060> be<00:00:40.090> grounded<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.900> the<00:00:41.020> car<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:41.560> it's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
should be grounded to the car so it's

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680 
should be grounded to the car so it's
okay<00:00:41.950> if<00:00:41.980> it<00:00:42.190> touches<00:00:42.399> things<00:00:42.850> it's<00:00:43.270> not<00:00:43.480> going

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
okay if it touches things it's not going

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.860 
okay if it touches things it's not going
to<00:00:43.870> cause<00:00:44.050> any<00:00:44.320> problems<00:00:44.739> with<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.010> sensor

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
to cause any problems with the sensor

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.290 
to cause any problems with the sensor
there's<00:00:46.870> an<00:00:47.050> exhaust<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.890> intake<00:00:48.129> the<00:00:48.969> intake

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
there's an exhaust and intake the intake

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.110 
there's an exhaust and intake the intake
probe<00:00:49.660> is<00:00:49.840> much<00:00:50.019> smaller<00:00:50.350> it's<00:00:51.100> time<00:00:51.430> constant

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120

second actually sampling off of this at
the<00:01:02.050> maximum<00:01:02.559> so<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.250> sensor<00:01:03.579> is<00:01:03.699> better<00:01:04.030> than

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
the maximum so the sensor is better than

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.000 
the maximum so the sensor is better than
actually<00:01:04.750> sampling<00:01:05.260> rate<00:01:05.470> on<00:01:05.620> the<00:01:05.710> device

which is good the exhaust side has a

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.340 
which is good the exhaust side has a
little<00:01:09.280> bit<00:01:09.520> lower<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.330> time<00:01:10.570> constant<00:01:10.900> but

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
little bit lower of a time constant but

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.840 
little bit lower of a time constant but
it's<00:01:11.470> still<00:01:11.650> much<00:01:11.890> faster<00:01:12.520> than<00:01:12.670> any

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
it's still much faster than any

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.149 
it's still much faster than any
available<00:01:13.450> sensor<00:01:13.840> now<00:01:14.380> keep<00:01:14.650> in<00:01:14.770> mind<00:01:14.830> that

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
available sensor now keep in mind that

the<00:01:15.460> nusselt<00:01:16.150> number<00:01:16.659> everything<00:01:17.440> changed

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
the nusselt number everything changed

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.640 
the nusselt number everything changed
when<00:01:18.330> exhaust<00:01:19.330> is<00:01:19.540> flowing<00:01:19.840> fast<00:01:20.110> around<00:01:20.500> this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
when exhaust is flowing fast around this

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.500 
when exhaust is flowing fast around this
this<00:01:20.920> becomes<00:01:21.400> a<00:01:21.520> very<00:01:21.700> fast<00:01:21.910> sensor<00:01:22.300> in<00:01:22.420> the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
this becomes a very fast sensor in the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.610 
this becomes a very fast sensor in the

standard<00:01:43.870> thermocouple<00:01:44.170> connectors<00:01:44.890> these

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
standard thermocouple connectors these

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.270 
standard thermocouple connectors these
are<00:01:45.370> rugged<00:01:46.150> connectors<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.930> they<00:01:47.770> plug<00:01:48.070> in

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
are rugged connectors and they plug in

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.700 
are rugged connectors and they plug in
so<00:01:48.610> let's<00:01:48.880> plug<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.990> these<00:01:50.110> right<00:01:50.410> into

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
so let's plug one of these right into

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.380 
so let's plug one of these right into
the<00:01:50.860> controller<00:01:51.220> here<00:01:51.520> okay<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:51.940> that's<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
the controller here okay so that's the

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.780 
the controller here okay so that's the
thermocouple<00:01:52.990> probes<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.800> far<00:01:54.190> as<00:01:54.220> the

thermocouple probes as far as the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.460 
thermocouple probes as far as the
pressure<00:01:55.690> goes<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.410> pressure<00:01:58.260> zoom<00:01:59.260> in<00:01:59.380> on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
pressure goes the pressure zoom in on

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.960 
pressure goes the pressure zoom in on
this<00:02:01.020> pressure<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.320> connects<00:02:02.710> two<00:02:03.070> hoses

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
this pressure just connects two hoses

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.230 
this pressure just connects two hoses
the<00:02:04.540> sensors<00:02:04.900> are<00:02:05.200> actually<00:02:05.650> inside<00:02:06.240> so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the sensors are actually inside so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.729 
the sensors are actually inside so
they're<00:02:07.390> inside<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.870> unit<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.319> comes<00:02:08.619> with

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
they're inside the unit this comes with

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.580 
they're inside the unit this comes with
pressure<00:02:09.099> sensors<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:11.140> nice<00:02:11.260> part<00:02:11.530> about

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
pressure sensors the nice part about

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.140 
pressure sensors the nice part about
that<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.980> that<00:02:12.160> all<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.730> do<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:12.970> put
