what's up guys origin here and I am
testing<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.210> mig-15<00:00:20.660> versus<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.650> dh100

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
testing the mig-15 versus the dh100

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.179 
testing the mig-15 versus the dh100
vampires<00:00:22.880> climb<00:00:23.330> rates<00:00:23.570> and<00:00:23.810> speeds<00:00:24.189> they

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
vampires climb rates and speeds they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.589 
vampires climb rates and speeds they
originally<00:00:25.519> had<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.699> same<00:00:25.849> flight<00:00:26.119> model<00:00:26.330> and

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
originally had the same flight model and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.599 
originally had the same flight model and
things<00:00:26.960> have<00:00:27.080> recently<00:00:27.380> changes<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:27.949> I<00:00:28.070> wanted

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
things have recently changes so I wanted

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.310 
things have recently changes so I wanted
to<00:00:28.759> test<00:00:29.150> them<00:00:29.359> to<00:00:29.630> see<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.199> big

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
to test them to see what the big

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.259 
to test them to see what the big
differences<00:00:30.740> were<00:00:30.920> I<00:00:31.160> got<00:00:31.849> to<00:00:32.000> each<00:00:32.089> aircraft

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
differences were I got to each aircraft

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.020 
differences were I got to each aircraft
up<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:32.689> 200<00:00:33.019> kilometers<00:00:33.440> an<00:00:33.589> hour<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.010> put<00:00:34.940> it

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
up to 200 kilometers an hour and put it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.660 
up to 200 kilometers an hour and put it
into<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.360> 20<00:00:35.900> degree<00:00:35.989> incline<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:36.920> started

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
into a 20 degree incline and started

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.119 
into a 20 degree incline and started
climbing<00:00:38.080> you'll<00:00:39.080> see<00:00:39.229> here<00:00:39.500> both<00:00:39.799> aircraft

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
climbing you'll see here both aircraft

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.270 
climbing you'll see here both aircraft
still<00:00:40.699> have<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.210> same<00:00:42.170> cards<00:00:42.769> they<00:00:42.949> state

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
still have the same cards they state

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
they have the exact same attributes

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.149 
they have the exact same attributes

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:50.869 
here in game right now we're

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.259 
here in game right now we're
fast-forwarding<00:00:51.769> to<00:00:52.159> get<00:00:52.879> to<00:00:53.030> the<00:00:53.119> point

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
fast-forwarding to get to the point

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.719 
fast-forwarding to get to the point
where<00:00:53.479> the<00:00:53.600> MiG<00:00:53.869> reaches<00:00:54.589> 5,000<00:00:55.280> meters<00:00:55.519> which

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
where the MiG reaches 5,000 meters which

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:57.189 
where the MiG reaches 5,000 meters which
is<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.000> altitude<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.420> was<00:00:56.540> climbing<00:00:56.750> out<00:00:56.989> for

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
is the altitude I was climbing out for

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.460 
is the altitude I was climbing out for
this<00:00:57.320> test<00:00:58.659> you'll<00:00:59.659> see<00:00:59.869> here<00:01:00.110> in<00:01:00.229> a<00:01:00.290> few

anymore

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
anymore

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.840 
anymore
so<00:01:49.759> after<00:01:50.329> this<00:01:50.689> one<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.250> did<00:01:52.250> another<00:01:52.430> one<00:01:52.549> and

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
so after this one I did another one and

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.600 
so after this one I did another one and
tested<00:01:53.299> it<00:01:53.420> completely<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.350> you'll<00:01:55.039> see<00:01:55.219> here

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
tested it completely and you'll see here

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.950 
tested it completely and you'll see here
how<00:01:56.539> ridiculous<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:59.000> amount<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.360> time<00:01:59.539> is<00:01:59.780> for

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
how ridiculous the amount of time is for

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.440 
how ridiculous the amount of time is for
this<00:02:00.049> thing<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.350> climb<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.890> was<00:02:01.130> 10<00:02:02.119> minutes

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
this thing to climb it was 10 minutes

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.899 
this thing to climb it was 10 minutes
and<00:02:02.630> 28<00:02:03.140> seconds<00:02:03.590> before<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:03.979> reached<00:02:04.159> 5,000

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
and 28 seconds before it reached 5,000
