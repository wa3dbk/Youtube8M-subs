00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.980
 I did this using a net that could be committed, but it really is 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.009
 Light and 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.879
 Made a country 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:15.019
 I sent 18270mm for the charger so far 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.590
 The lens under investigation: This Tamron 15x zoom lens 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 Phase is also new 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.720
 Pokka is bad 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.200
 It also comes with a trading turmoil 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.380
 Lightened 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.090
 I think it's getting lighter and it's just before your eyes 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.090
 But it's shorter and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.050
 Guerilla 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.690
 It's so smooth and smooth Here's a medium sized Honen software 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.780
 I wanted to go to the middle in the future, but if the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.880
 But I'm short cameraman who always uses me 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.380
 However, it is a true lens but it is a bi0035 issue but yes 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.310
 It's not, anyway, with bags or cases tocca day 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.450
 An economically compact lens 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 Gentle and overwhelmed 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.780
 It's a natural b-003 Galaxy 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.460
 It feels like I'm passing through naturally and not stopping. 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.009
 It would be useful to say it would be a horse if it was after this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.690
 Disliked light weight 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.690
 I want to do detailed planning 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.010
 I want to come to play with this first 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.730
 I'm glad I want to go play 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.010
 Tamron 60th Anniversary Model- 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.060
