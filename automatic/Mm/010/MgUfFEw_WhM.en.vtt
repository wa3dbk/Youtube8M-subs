getting<00:01:18.180> points<00:01:18.479> from<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> hardpoint<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
getting points from the hardpoint this

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.620 
getting points from the hardpoint this
is<00:01:19.619> my<00:01:19.770> favorite<00:01:20.100> time<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.180> too<00:01:21.299> easy<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
is my favorite time it's not too easy to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.370 
is my favorite time it's not too easy to
say<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.380> know<00:01:22.880> c4<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:25.140> worst

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
say that but you know c4 is my worst

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.280 
say that but you know c4 is my worst
enemy<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> game<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.750> in<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> other

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
enemy in this game it was in the other

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
enemy in this game it was in the other
one<00:01:28.470> slightly<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:29.970> type<00:01:30.689> 95

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
one slightly actually I think type 95

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.060 
one slightly actually I think type 95
was<00:01:31.409> kimbos<00:01:32.360> but<00:01:33.360> c4<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.350> probably<00:01:34.920> number

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
was kimbos but c4 is probably number

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
was kimbos but c4 is probably number
three<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.750> easy<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.590> to

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
three just because of how easy it is to

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.789 
three just because of how easy it is to
use<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.460> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.840> double<00:01:40.229> X<00:01:40.409> or

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
use and if you don't know double X or

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.510 
use and if you don't know double X or
double<00:01:41.430> uh<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:43.439> don't<00:01:43.799> know<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
double uh I don't know what it is on the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120 
double uh I don't know what it is on the
ps3<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.360> guess<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> shape

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
ps3 so I guess it's some kind of shape

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
ps3 so I guess it's some kind of shape
whatever<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.509> know<00:01:48.630> whatever<00:01:49.140> X<00:01:49.409> would

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
whatever it is you know whatever X would

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.010 
whatever it is you know whatever X would
be<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> ps3<00:01:51.259> detonates<00:01:52.259> it

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
be on the ps3 detonates it

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.779 
be on the ps3 detonates it
need<00:01:53.320> to<00:01:53.350> hold<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.710> trigger<00:01:53.920> so<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.520> didn't<00:01:54.729> is

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
need to hold the trigger so it didn't is

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.990 
need to hold the trigger so it didn't is
it<00:01:54.969> quicker<00:01:56.130> unless<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.250> I<00:01:57.399> think<00:01:57.789> if<00:01:57.909> you

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
it quicker unless you I think if you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.980 
it quicker unless you I think if you
have<00:01:58.090> fast<00:01:58.329> hands<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.719> could<00:01:58.840> probably

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
have fast hands you could probably

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.859 
have fast hands you could probably
detonate<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.530> same<00:01:59.679> amount<00:01:59.740> of<00:02:00.039> time<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.750> you

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
detonate the same amount of time but you

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.340 
detonate the same amount of time but you

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
for that moment okay back on topic with

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.089 
for that moment okay back on topic with
the<00:04:24.979> PDW<00:04:25.550> PDW<00:04:26.470> might<00:04:27.470> be<00:04:27.650> one<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.949> best

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
the PDW PDW might be one of the best

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.999 
the PDW PDW might be one of the best
subs<00:04:28.370> like<00:04:28.940> msmc<00:04:29.840> in<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:29.990> ppw<00:04:30.530> are<00:04:30.590> definitely

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
subs like msmc in the ppw are definitely

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.150 
subs like msmc in the ppw are definitely
neck<00:04:31.910> and<00:04:32.090> neck<00:04:32.470> especially<00:04:33.470> I<00:04:33.740> won't<00:04:33.919> be<00:04:34.009> one

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
neck and neck especially I won't be one

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.249 
neck and neck especially I won't be one
I<00:04:34.310> think<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.580> Pete<00:04:34.759> msmc<00:04:35.570> would<00:04:35.780> beat<00:04:35.990> it<00:04:36.110> out

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
I think the Pete msmc would beat it out

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.260 
I think the Pete msmc would beat it out
just<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.710> examine<00:04:37.099> embassy<00:04:37.430> has<00:04:37.610> more<00:04:37.849> damage

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the same firing I swear the MSM sees

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.450 
the same firing I swear the MSM sees
faster<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.060> just<00:04:44.240> seems<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:46.220> way<00:04:46.340> in<00:04:46.400> the

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
faster it just seems it the way in the

faster it just seems it the way in the
PDW<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.210> way<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.330> see<00:04:47.539> it<00:04:47.570> overall<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.289> PDW<00:04:48.830> is

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
PDW the way I see it overall the PDW is

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.770 
PDW the way I see it overall the PDW is
better<00:04:49.210> PDW<00:04:50.530> almost<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.650> same<00:04:51.830> staff<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.780> mean
