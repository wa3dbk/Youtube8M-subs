00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
 Tokyo subway is two business of Tokyo Metro and Toei subway 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.980
 Body routes are intricate 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.730
 There is no understanding and you go out and enter the ticket gate 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.730
 There may be many people who have the experience of 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.339
 In Tokyo Do 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.270
 Deriving these two more than eight months in the non-payment Japan Sea 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.890
 became 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.979
 I pointed out the subway that Mitsui Shipbuilding can protect 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.460
 This mural Tokyo Metro Toei Subway is also considered 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.169
 It has a symbolic structure 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.450
 It is the flag leader of the unification of the subway 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 Ayase Deputy Governor visited Kudanshita Station today 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 Because I can give an example 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.500
 Ever bought 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 Wear glasses 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.060
 Where I actually walked 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
 It took more than 2 minutes to cross one wall 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.010
 I think this home run batter will not be 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.890
 Talked while 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.200
 Kanagawa 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 Documents such as subway 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.150
 Tokyo Metro shares shares between the country and the capital 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.580
 Ayase Deputy Governor has already been listed after the consolidation of management 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.580
 The direction that you 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.960
 And it was rescued by the customer 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 But the window with the government party is also 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.180
 After this Vice Governor 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.840
 Having a visionary home at Shinbashi Station on the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.130
 confirmed 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.570
 A book hit because the two companies were integrated in the early days of the subway 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.210
 I came to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.060
 To negotiate with the country which will start from now on with the symbol of the bank 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.840
 I made up my mind
