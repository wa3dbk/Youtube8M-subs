all<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.110> in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.469> video<00:00:01.770> we're<00:00:01.920> gonna<00:00:01.979> do

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
all right in this video we're gonna do

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.400 
all right in this video we're gonna do
another<00:00:02.490> application<00:00:03.060> involving<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> law<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
another application involving the law of

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.010 
another application involving the law of
sines<00:00:04.799> so<00:00:05.210> suppose<00:00:06.210> you're<00:00:06.359> on<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> hill<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
sines so suppose you're on a hill and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.179 
sines so suppose you're on a hill and
you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.290> see<00:00:07.410> two<00:00:07.620> buildings<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.130> the

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
you can see two buildings in the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.310 
you can see two buildings in the
distance<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.540> know<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.870> buildings<00:00:10.200> are

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
distance and we know the buildings are

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.400 
distance and we know the buildings are
six<00:00:10.530> miles<00:00:10.769> apart<00:00:11.160> if<00:00:12.000> you're<00:00:12.240> 3.2<00:00:12.870> miles<00:00:13.080> from

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
six miles apart if you're 3.2 miles from

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.589 
six miles apart if you're 3.2 miles from
one<00:00:13.650> building<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.580> angle<00:00:15.030> between<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
one building and the angle between the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.660 
one building and the angle between the
two<00:00:15.809> lines<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.320> sight<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.800> these<00:00:16.980> buildings<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
two lines of sight to these buildings is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
two lines of sight to these buildings is
30<00:00:18.449> degrees<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.080> 30<00:00:19.350> minutes<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:20.400> want<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.640> know

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
30 degrees in 30 minutes we want to know

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.150 
30 degrees in 30 minutes we want to know
how<00:00:20.910> far<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.630> are<00:00:21.660> from<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.199> second<00:00:22.680> building

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
how far you are from the second building

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.910 
how far you are from the second building
so<00:00:23.550> made<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> little<00:00:24.810> rough<00:00:25.260> sketch<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
so made a little rough sketch here of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200 
so made a little rough sketch here of
kind<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.340> what's<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.119> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
kind of what's going on in this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.230 
kind of what's going on in this
situation<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.670> again<00:00:29.670> we've<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:29.849> our<00:00:30.060> two

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
situation so again we've got our two

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.290 
situation so again we've got our two
buildings<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:31.050> six<00:00:31.380> miles<00:00:31.619> apart<00:00:32.120> to<00:00:33.120> one

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
buildings there's six miles apart to one

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
buildings there's six miles apart to one
of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.480> buildings<00:00:33.660> you're<00:00:34.110> 3.2<00:00:34.980> miles<00:00:35.190> away

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
of the buildings you're 3.2 miles away

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.380 
of the buildings you're 3.2 miles away
and<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> angle<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.090> angle

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and we know that the angle the the angle

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.229 
and we know that the angle the the angle
between<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.170> two<00:00:40.379> lines<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> sight<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.340> 30<00:00:41.640> 30

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
between the two lines of sight is 30 30

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.650 
between the two lines of sight is 30 30
degrees<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.930> 30<00:00:43.379> minutes<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.270> again<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.539> just

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
degrees in 30 minutes so again we just

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.139 
degrees in 30 minutes so again we just
want<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> find<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.340> distance<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
want to find the the distance to the

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.920 
want to find the the distance to the
second<00:00:48.510> building<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:50.160> gonna<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.930> this

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
second building so I'm gonna make this

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
second building so I'm gonna make this
kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> read<00:00:52.379> you're<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:52.829> my<00:00:53.309> triangle

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
kind of read you're all my my triangle

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.160 
kind of read you're all my my triangle
here<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.480> bit

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.770 

okay<00:01:00.860> so<00:01:00.920> you're<00:01:01.399> at<00:01:01.520> six<00:01:01.790> miles<00:01:02.059> we're<00:01:02.570> trying

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
okay so you're at six miles we're trying

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.760 
okay so you're at six miles we're trying
to<00:01:02.899> figure<00:01:03.079> out<00:01:03.320> this<00:01:03.500> distance<00:01:03.559> D<00:01:04.630> this<00:01:05.630> is

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
to figure out this distance D this is

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.910 
to figure out this distance D this is
3.2<00:01:06.770> miles<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:08.390> we<00:01:08.479> know<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.290> again

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
3.2 miles and we know that this is again

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.420 
3.2 miles and we know that this is again
30<00:01:10.760> degrees<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.670> 30<00:01:13.670> minutes<00:01:14.420> okay<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:16.220> use

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
30 degrees and 30 minutes okay so to use

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.550 
30 degrees and 30 minutes okay so to use
the<00:01:17.240> law<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.450> sines<00:01:17.600> we're<00:01:18.140> gonna<00:01:18.229> have<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.470> do

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
the law of sines we're gonna have to do

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.950 
the law of sines we're gonna have to do
a<00:01:18.590> couple<00:01:18.979> things<00:01:19.009> here

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.620 

first<00:01:22.410> off<00:01:22.680> we're<00:01:23.130> giving<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.940> angle<00:01:24.480> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
first off we're giving this angle in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
first off we're giving this angle in
this<00:01:24.750> side<00:01:25.020> length<00:01:25.320> we're<00:01:25.740> given<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.250> side

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this side length we're given this side

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
this side length we're given this side
length<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.060> means<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.110> deduce<00:01:28.260> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
length which means we can deduce this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
length which means we can deduce this
angle<00:01:29.370> over<00:01:29.520> here<00:01:29.670> maybe<00:01:30.060> I'll<00:01:30.270> call<00:01:30.480> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
angle over here maybe I'll call that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.920 
angle over here maybe I'll call that
angle<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.370> once<00:01:32.370> we<00:01:32.520> figure<00:01:32.790> out<00:01:32.820> angle<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.600> we

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
angle a once we figure out angle a we

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.540 
angle a once we figure out angle a we
can<00:01:34.080> then<00:01:34.110> figure<00:01:34.470> out<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> other<00:01:35.100> angle

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
can then figure out this other angle

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.980 
can then figure out this other angle
that's<00:01:35.850> missing<00:01:36.240> maybe<00:01:36.450> I'll<00:01:36.630> call<00:01:36.810> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that's missing maybe I'll call it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.800 
that's missing maybe I'll call it
capital<00:01:37.620> D<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.880> from<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.450> use

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
capital D and then from that we can use

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.080 
capital D and then from that we can use
again<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:40.170> law<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.470> sines<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.130> figure<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
again the law of sines to figure out the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.750 
again the law of sines to figure out the
side<00:01:42.840> length<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.830> D<00:01:44.010> which<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
side length for little D which is the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.830 
side length for little D which is the
distance<00:01:45.150> which<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.600> we're<00:01:45.720> interested

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
distance which is what we're interested

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.609 
distance which is what we're interested
in<00:01:47.660> one<00:01:48.660> thing<00:01:48.869> -<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:50.330> okay<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:51.510> let's<00:01:52.290> see<00:01:52.440> so

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
in one thing - so okay so let's see so

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.410 
in one thing - so okay so let's see so
let's<00:01:52.860> first<00:01:53.070> figure<00:01:53.340> out<00:01:53.690> angle<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:56.060> so<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
let's first figure out angle a so a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.730 
let's first figure out angle a so a
couple<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> things<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.440> we<00:01:58.680> could<00:01:58.860> do<00:02:00.740> so

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
couple of things here so we could do so

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.350 
couple of things here so we could do so
sine<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> angle<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:03.380> over<00:02:04.460> its<00:02:05.460> opposite<00:02:06.300> side

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
sine of angle a over its opposite side

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.449 
sine of angle a over its opposite side
length<00:02:07.320> which<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.770> three<00:02:08.009> point<00:02:08.250> two

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
length which would be three point two

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.130 
length which would be three point two
that's<00:02:09.390> gonna<00:02:09.570> equal<00:02:09.840> sine<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.410> 30<00:02:11.400> degrees

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
that's gonna equal sine of 30 degrees

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.449 
that's gonna equal sine of 30 degrees
but<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.709> do<00:02:13.860> we've<00:02:14.070> got<00:02:14.220> 30

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
but what we have to do we've got 30

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.820 
but what we have to do we've got 30
degrees<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.000> 30<00:02:15.209> minutes<00:02:15.630> remember<00:02:16.470> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
degrees in 30 minutes remember that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.170 
degrees in 30 minutes remember that
there's<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.150> 60<00:02:18.150> Minutes<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.200> 60<00:02:19.620> minutes

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
there's a 60 Minutes so 60 minutes

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.070 
there's a 60 Minutes so 60 minutes
equals<00:02:21.180> 1<00:02:21.989> degree<00:02:22.610> well<00:02:23.610> we've<00:02:24.150> got<00:02:24.420> 30

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
equals 1 degree well we've got 30

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.560 
equals 1 degree well we've got 30
minutes<00:02:25.530> out<00:02:25.739> of<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.920> total<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.489> 60<00:02:27.090> minutes

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
minutes out of a total of 60 minutes

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.479 
minutes out of a total of 60 minutes
so<00:02:28.049> actually<00:02:28.410> what<00:02:28.560> that's<00:02:28.739> gonna<00:02:28.920> give<00:02:29.160> us<00:02:29.190> is

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
so actually what that's gonna give us is

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.740 
so actually what that's gonna give us is
1/2<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.390> degree<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.290> 0.5<00:02:32.070> degrees<00:02:32.750> so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
1/2 of a degree for 0.5 degrees so

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.789 
1/2 of a degree for 0.5 degrees so
really<00:02:34.049> we<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.380> write<00:02:34.590> 30<00:02:35.040> degrees<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:36.180> should

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
really we can write 30 degrees I should

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.229 
really we can write 30 degrees I should
not<00:02:37.799> even<00:02:37.920> put<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> degree<00:02:38.519> there<00:02:38.700> yet<00:02:38.910> we<00:02:39.090> can

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
not even put the degree there yet we can

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.500 
not even put the degree there yet we can
write<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.540> as<00:02:39.690> 30<00:02:40.019> point<00:02:40.410> five<00:02:40.769> degrees<00:02:41.640> so

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
write that as 30 point five degrees so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.900 
write that as 30 point five degrees so
30<00:02:43.110> degrees<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.799> 30<00:02:44.010> minutes<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.700> same

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
30 degrees and 30 minutes is the same

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.600 
30 degrees and 30 minutes is the same
thing<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.299> 30<00:02:45.630> point<00:02:45.989> five<00:02:46.320> degrees

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
thing as 30 point five degrees

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.600 
thing as 30 point five degrees
all<00:02:49.510> over<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.170> length<00:02:50.410> opposite<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.250> which

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
all over the length opposite that which

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.270 
all over the length opposite that which
is<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.120> be<00:02:52.240> six<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.890> now<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.190> I'm

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
is just going to be six so now what I'm

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.920 
is just going to be six so now what I'm
going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.460> do<00:02:54.610> is<00:02:54.730> just<00:02:54.910> multiply<00:02:55.090> both<00:02:55.600> sides

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
going to do is just multiply both sides

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.200 
going to do is just multiply both sides
by<00:02:56.110> three<00:02:56.500> point<00:02:56.770> two<00:02:57.150> by<00:02:58.150> three<00:02:58.540> point<00:02:58.840> two<00:03:00.210> so

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
by three point two by three point two so

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.970 
by three point two by three point two so
we'll<00:03:01.330> get<00:03:01.510> sine<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.290> equals<00:03:03.250> sine<00:03:04.030> of

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
we'll get sine of a equals sine of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.790 
we'll get sine of a equals sine of
thirty<00:03:05.980> point<00:03:06.520> five<00:03:06.820> degrees<00:03:08.400> over<00:03:09.400> six

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
thirty point five degrees over six

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.690 
thirty point five degrees over six
multiplied<00:03:11.800> by<00:03:12.070> three<00:03:12.610> point<00:03:12.880> two<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.510> let's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
multiplied by three point two so let's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.110 
multiplied by three point two so let's
calculate<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:16.209> here<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:18.459> let's<00:03:18.610> see<00:03:18.760> thirty

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
calculate this here so let's see thirty

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.920 
calculate this here so let's see thirty
point<00:03:19.690> five<00:03:19.990> if<00:03:20.740> we<00:03:20.920> do<00:03:21.070> sine<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.000> thirty<00:03:22.600> point

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
point five if we do sine of thirty point

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.320 
point five if we do sine of thirty point
five<00:03:23.020> I'm<00:03:24.010> getting<00:03:24.520> that<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.790> be<00:03:24.910> roughly

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
five I'm getting that to be roughly

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.699 
five I'm getting that to be roughly
point<00:03:25.930> five<00:03:26.410> zero<00:03:26.880> eight<00:03:28.170> after<00:03:29.170> rounding

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
point five zero eight after rounding

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.250 
point five zero eight after rounding
again<00:03:30.640> over<00:03:31.030> six<00:03:31.739> x<00:03:32.739> three<00:03:33.580> point<00:03:33.850> two<00:03:34.260> so

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
again over six x three point two so

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.320 
again over six x three point two so
point<00:03:35.590> five<00:03:35.890> zero<00:03:35.920> eight<00:03:36.989> divided<00:03:37.989> by<00:03:38.140> 6

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
point five zero eight divided by 6

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.449 
point five zero eight divided by 6
multiplied<00:03:40.330> by<00:03:40.630> three<00:03:41.050> point<00:03:41.530> two

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
multiplied by three point two

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.120 
multiplied by three point two
I'm<00:03:42.790> getting<00:03:43.360> this<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.720> equal<00:03:43.900> roughly<00:03:44.800> point

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
I'm getting this to equal roughly point

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:52.310 
I'm getting this to equal roughly point
two<00:03:45.610> seven<00:03:46.239> one<00:03:47.280> so<00:03:48.280> now<00:03:48.430> we<00:03:48.489> have<00:03:48.670> sine<00:03:48.910> of<00:03:48.970> a

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.750 

sign<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.620> equals<00:03:55.500> 0.271<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:57.490> we'll<00:03:57.610> just

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
sign of a equals 0.271 so we'll just

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.110 
sign of a equals 0.271 so we'll just
take<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.060> inverse<00:03:58.420> sine<00:03:58.480> of<00:03:59.080> both<00:03:59.410> sides<00:04:00.120> and

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
take the inverse sine of both sides and

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.460 
take the inverse sine of both sides and
if<00:04:01.210> we<00:04:01.300> take<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.600> inverse<00:04:01.750> sine<00:04:01.960> of<00:04:02.200> both

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
if we take the inverse sine of both

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.230 
if we take the inverse sine of both
sides<00:04:05.220> we'll<00:04:06.220> just<00:04:06.430> simply<00:04:06.580> get<00:04:06.910> that<00:04:06.940> a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
sides we'll just simply get that a

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.920 
sides we'll just simply get that a
equals<00:04:08.170> well<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.730> inverse<00:04:10.180> sine<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:11.670> 0.271<00:04:12.930> so

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
equals well the inverse sine of 0.271 so

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.810 
equals well the inverse sine of 0.271 so
again<00:04:14.170> let<00:04:14.350> me<00:04:14.380> throw<00:04:15.310> this<00:04:15.520> in<00:04:15.730> the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
again let me throw this in the

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:23.580 
again let me throw this in the
calculator<00:04:16.330> so<00:04:17.250> 0.271<00:04:19.260> inverse<00:04:20.260> sine<00:04:22.590> I'm

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
calculator so 0.271 inverse sine I'm

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.370 
calculator so 0.271 inverse sine I'm
getting<00:04:23.950> a<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.250> be<00:04:24.550> roughly<00:04:24.910> equal<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.600> fifteen

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
getting a to be roughly equal to fifteen

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.330 
getting a to be roughly equal to fifteen
point<00:04:27.010> seven<00:04:27.780> degrees<00:04:28.780> after<00:04:29.380> rounding<00:04:30.130> here

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
point seven degrees after rounding here

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.100 
point seven degrees after rounding here
a<00:04:30.370> little<00:04:30.550> bit

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
a little bit

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.630 
a little bit
okay<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.170> let's<00:04:32.800> kind<00:04:33.010> of<00:04:33.040> update<00:04:33.490> our

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
okay so let's kind of update our

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.350 
okay so let's kind of update our
triangle<00:04:34.210> here<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.420> little<00:04:34.630> bit

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.409 

so<00:04:39.960> again<00:04:40.139> this<00:04:40.289> was<00:04:40.470> length<00:04:40.740> six<00:04:41.220> we<00:04:42.030> now<00:04:42.210> know

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
so again this was length six we now know

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.059 
so again this was length six we now know
that<00:04:42.629> this<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:42.810> fifteen<00:04:43.439> point<00:04:43.470> seven<00:04:44.159> degrees

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:46.069 
that this is fifteen point seven degrees

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.219 
that this is fifteen point seven degrees
this<00:04:47.069> was<00:04:47.280> thirty<00:04:47.669> point<00:04:48.060> five<00:04:48.180> degrees<00:04:48.990> we

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
this was thirty point five degrees we

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.490 
this was thirty point five degrees we
said<00:04:50.000> we<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.509> this<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> length<00:04:52.409> of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
said we know that this is a length of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.369 
said we know that this is a length of
three<00:04:53.250> point<00:04:53.550> two<00:04:53.879> and<00:04:54.719> again<00:04:54.840> we're<00:04:55.289> getting

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
three point two and again we're getting

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.830 
three point two and again we're getting
closer<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:56.430> now<00:04:56.789> what<00:04:57.060> we<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.330> do<00:04:57.479> again

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
closer because now what we can do again

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.179 
closer because now what we can do again
we're<00:04:57.960> interested<00:04:58.139> in<00:04:58.590> figuring<00:04:58.800> out<00:04:59.039> this

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
we're interested in figuring out this

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.850 
we're interested in figuring out this
length<00:04:59.460> D<00:04:59.789> well<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.960> know<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.379> angles

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
length D well we know that the angles

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.850 
length D well we know that the angles
inside<00:05:02.250> of<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> triangle<00:05:02.969> add<00:05:03.120> up<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.300> 180<00:05:03.860> so

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
inside of the triangle add up to 180 so

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.119 
inside of the triangle add up to 180 so
if<00:05:04.979> we<00:05:05.099> do<00:05:05.280> thirty<00:05:06.120> point<00:05:06.659> five<00:05:06.870> I<00:05:07.650> think<00:05:07.889> we

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:08.129 
if we do thirty point five I think we

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.249 
if we do thirty point five I think we
were<00:05:08.250> calling<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.639> capital<00:05:09.150> D<00:05:09.300> so<00:05:09.330> thirty

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
were calling this capital D so thirty

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.969 
were calling this capital D so thirty
point<00:05:10.590> five<00:05:11.599> plus<00:05:12.599> fifteen<00:05:13.229> point<00:05:13.620> seven

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
point five plus fifteen point seven

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.939 
point five plus fifteen point seven
degrees<00:05:14.759> if<00:05:15.000> we<00:05:15.090> add<00:05:15.270> those<00:05:15.539> together<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:16.289> guess

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
degrees if we add those together I guess

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.469 
degrees if we add those together I guess
that's<00:05:17.159> gonna<00:05:17.340> give<00:05:17.550> us<00:05:17.580> let's<00:05:18.000> see<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.270> we'd

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
that's gonna give us let's see so we'd

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.540 
that's gonna give us let's see so we'd
get<00:05:18.569> forty<00:05:18.960> five<00:05:19.169> and<00:05:19.590> another<00:05:19.800> one<00:05:20.009> point<00:05:20.280> two

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
get forty five and another one point two

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.490 
get forty five and another one point two
so<00:05:20.789> that'll<00:05:21.030> give<00:05:21.180> us<00:05:21.300> forty<00:05:21.690> six<00:05:21.930> point<00:05:22.169> two

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
so that'll give us forty six point two

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.219 
so that'll give us forty six point two
degrees<00:05:23.060> well<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:24.449> take<00:05:24.599> a<00:05:24.659> hundred<00:05:25.080> and

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
degrees well if we take a hundred and

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.680 
degrees well if we take a hundred and
eighty<00:05:25.469> degrees<00:05:25.800> and<00:05:26.580> subtract<00:05:27.000> away<00:05:27.120> forty

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
eighty degrees and subtract away forty

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.129 
eighty degrees and subtract away forty
six<00:05:28.050> point<00:05:28.949> two<00:05:29.490> degrees<00:05:29.909> I<00:05:30.330> believe<00:05:30.960> that

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
six point two degrees I believe that

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.619 
six point two degrees I believe that
should<00:05:31.319> give<00:05:31.500> us<00:05:31.650> one<00:05:31.949> thirty<00:05:32.370> three<00:05:32.629> point

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
should give us one thirty three point

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.820 
should give us one thirty three point
eight<00:05:35.060> okay<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.180> looks<00:05:36.360> okay<00:05:36.629> to<00:05:36.659> me<00:05:36.779> so<00:05:37.620> let's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
eight okay it looks okay to me so let's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.940 
eight okay it looks okay to me so let's
see<00:05:38.009> so<00:05:38.189> this<00:05:38.310> angle<00:05:38.610> capital<00:05:39.360> D

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
see so this angle capital D

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:46.310 
see so this angle capital D
that's<00:05:41.580> gonna<00:05:41.760> have<00:05:42.000> measure<00:05:43.400> 133<00:05:45.320> 0.8

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
that's gonna have measure 133 0.8

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.010 
that's gonna have measure 133 0.8
degrees<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:47.610> again<00:05:47.820> now<00:05:48.000> we<00:05:48.060> can<00:05:48.360> just<00:05:48.510> simply

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
degrees and again now we can just simply

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.040 
degrees and again now we can just simply
use<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.380> law<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.590> sines<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:51.690> figure<00:05:51.870> out

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
use the law of sines to to figure out

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.460 
use the law of sines to to figure out
our<00:05:52.170> missing<00:05:52.740> length<00:05:52.920> D<00:05:53.390> so<00:05:54.390> okay<00:05:54.990> so<00:05:55.020> it<00:05:55.290> says

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
our missing length D so okay so it says

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.290 
our missing length D so okay so it says
little<00:05:56.220> D<00:05:56.430> over<00:05:57.270> sine<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.410> one<00:05:59.280> three<00:05:59.820> three

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
little D over sine of one three three

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.050 
little D over sine of one three three
point<00:06:00.720> eight<00:06:00.930> degrees<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:02.520> now<00:06:02.640> it<00:06:02.760> doesn't

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
point eight degrees and now it doesn't

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.800 
point eight degrees and now it doesn't
matter<00:06:03.210> what<00:06:03.690> side<00:06:03.960> we<00:06:04.230> related<00:06:04.710> to<00:06:05.570> I'm<00:06:06.570> gonna

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
matter what side we related to I'm gonna

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.220 
matter what side we related to I'm gonna
relate<00:06:07.110> it<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.800> original<00:06:08.040> the<00:06:08.840> first<00:06:09.840> two

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
relate it to the original the first two

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.420 
relate it to the original the first two
sides<00:06:10.440> we<00:06:10.590> were<00:06:10.680> given<00:06:10.980> so<00:06:11.190> six<00:06:11.520> over<00:06:13.040> sine<00:06:14.040> of

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
sides we were given so six over sine of

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.610 
sides we were given so six over sine of
thirty<00:06:15.270> point<00:06:15.750> five<00:06:16.200> degrees<00:06:18.110> so<00:06:19.110> all<00:06:19.380> we<00:06:19.530> have

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
thirty point five degrees so all we have

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.260 
thirty point five degrees so all we have
to<00:06:19.710> do<00:06:19.830> now<00:06:20.010> is<00:06:20.340> we<00:06:20.670> could<00:06:20.790> multiply<00:06:21.090> both

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
to do now is we could multiply both

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.240 
to do now is we could multiply both
sides<00:06:21.780> by<00:06:22.020> sine<00:06:22.380> of<00:06:22.440> one<00:06:23.270> 33.8<00:06:24.270> degrees<00:06:25.250> we'll

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
sides by sine of one 33.8 degrees we'll

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.700 
sides by sine of one 33.8 degrees we'll
multiply<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.700> right<00:06:27.660> side<00:06:27.690> by<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.380> as<00:06:28.530> well

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
multiply the right side by that as well

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.050 
multiply the right side by that as well
so<00:06:31.710> on<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.890> left<00:06:32.100> side<00:06:32.190> we'll<00:06:32.610> just<00:06:32.760> be<00:06:32.880> left

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
so on the left side we'll just be left

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.260 
so on the left side we'll just be left
with<00:06:33.180> our<00:06:33.300> value<00:06:33.720> for<00:06:33.930> D<00:06:34.220> we'll<00:06:35.220> have<00:06:35.340> six<00:06:35.700> over

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
with our value for D we'll have six over

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.580 
with our value for D we'll have six over
sine<00:06:36.810> of<00:06:37.200> thirteen<00:06:38.130> point<00:06:38.490> five<00:06:38.880> degrees

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
sine of thirteen point five degrees

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:46.909 
sine of thirteen point five degrees
times<00:06:40.590> sine<00:06:41.400> of<00:06:41.690> one<00:06:43.520> 33.8<00:06:44.660> degrees

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 
times sine of one 33.8 degrees

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.050 
times sine of one 33.8 degrees
and<00:06:47.430> let's<00:06:47.580> see<00:06:47.699> I<00:06:47.729> think<00:06:47.789> we<00:06:48.060> said<00:06:48.270> sign<00:06:48.569> of

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
and let's see I think we said sign of

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.610 
and let's see I think we said sign of
let's<00:06:51.060> see<00:06:51.210> we<00:06:51.300> said<00:06:51.479> sign<00:06:51.780> of<00:06:51.990> thirty<00:06:52.289> point

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
let's see we said sign of thirty point

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.989 
let's see we said sign of thirty point
five<00:06:52.740> degrees<00:06:53.669> that<00:06:53.999> was<00:06:54.120> 0.5<00:06:54.689> 0<00:06:55.110> 8<00:06:55.789> so<00:06:56.789> we<00:06:56.879> have

00:06:56.989 --> 00:06:56.999 
five degrees that was 0.5 0 8 so we have

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:02.589 
five degrees that was 0.5 0 8 so we have
6<00:06:57.389> over<00:06:57.889> 0.5<00:06:58.889> 0<00:06:59.789> 8<00:07:00.409> I'll<00:07:01.409> plug<00:07:01.710> in<00:07:01.860> the<00:07:01.979> value

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
6 over 0.5 0 8 I'll plug in the value

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:07.269 
6 over 0.5 0 8 I'll plug in the value
we'll<00:07:03.599> get<00:07:03.719> the<00:07:03.840> value<00:07:03.960> for<00:07:04.319> sine<00:07:04.529> of<00:07:04.590> a<00:07:04.979> 1<00:07:06.139> 33.8

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 
we'll get the value for sine of a 1 33.8

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:12.260 
we'll get the value for sine of a 1 33.8
so<00:07:08.810> sine<00:07:09.810> of<00:07:09.840> 130<00:07:10.560> 3.8<00:07:11.460> I'm<00:07:11.729> getting<00:07:11.999> that<00:07:12.120> to

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
so sine of 130 3.8 I'm getting that to

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:20.209 
so sine of 130 3.8 I'm getting that to
be<00:07:13.099> 0.72<00:07:15.229> 2<00:07:16.229> after<00:07:16.620> rounding<00:07:18.919> alright<00:07:19.919> so<00:07:20.069> now

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:20.219 
be 0.72 2 after rounding alright so now

00:07:20.219 --> 00:07:22.820 
be 0.72 2 after rounding alright so now
we<00:07:20.279> just<00:07:20.370> simplify<00:07:20.939> a<00:07:21.090> little<00:07:21.300> bit<00:07:21.539> more<00:07:21.779> so<00:07:22.500> 6

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
we just simplify a little bit more so 6

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.290 
we just simplify a little bit more so 6
times<00:07:24.110> 0.72<00:07:25.110> 2<00:07:25.439> and<00:07:25.830> then<00:07:26.520> we<00:07:26.639> can<00:07:26.789> divide<00:07:27.090> all

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 
times 0.72 2 and then we can divide all

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.610 
times 0.72 2 and then we can divide all
of<00:07:27.330> that<00:07:27.479> by<00:07:27.949> 0.5<00:07:28.949> 0<00:07:29.639> 8<00:07:30.050> I'm<00:07:31.050> getting<00:07:31.379> that<00:07:31.469> to

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
of that by 0.5 0 8 I'm getting that to

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.869 
of that by 0.5 0 8 I'm getting that to
be<00:07:31.740> eight<00:07:32.039> point<00:07:32.789> five<00:07:33.650> three<00:07:34.650> after<00:07:35.370> rounding

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:35.879 
be eight point five three after rounding

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.360 
be eight point five three after rounding
so<00:07:36.210> I<00:07:36.509> think<00:07:37.080> everything<00:07:37.620> originally<00:07:38.069> was<00:07:38.219> in

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:38.370 
so I think everything originally was in

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.689 
so I think everything originally was in
miles<00:07:38.669> so<00:07:39.629> it<00:07:39.810> looks<00:07:39.990> like<00:07:40.159> based<00:07:41.159> on<00:07:41.370> all<00:07:41.490> the

00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:41.699 
miles so it looks like based on all the

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.420 
miles so it looks like based on all the
original<00:07:42.539> given<00:07:42.839> information<00:07:43.339> you<00:07:44.339> know

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.430 
original given information you know

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.999 
original given information you know
where<00:07:44.699> it's<00:07:44.789> at<00:07:44.939> now<00:07:45.289> we<00:07:46.289> can<00:07:46.409> use<00:07:46.560> our<00:07:46.680> picture

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:47.009 
where it's at now we can use our picture

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:50.629 
where it's at now we can use our picture
here<00:07:47.219> so<00:07:47.400> again<00:07:47.610> the<00:07:47.849> buildings<00:07:48.240> were<00:07:48.389> here<00:07:49.639> it

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 
here so again the buildings were here it

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:52.369 
here so again the buildings were here it
says<00:07:50.879> this<00:07:51.089> distance<00:07:51.599> that<00:07:51.689> we've<00:07:51.900> now<00:07:52.110> found

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:52.379 
says this distance that we've now found

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:55.040 
says this distance that we've now found
is<00:07:52.740> going<00:07:52.919> to<00:07:52.979> be<00:07:53.099> eight<00:07:53.460> point<00:07:54.180> five<00:07:54.569> three

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.050 
is going to be eight point five three

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.740 
is going to be eight point five three
miles
