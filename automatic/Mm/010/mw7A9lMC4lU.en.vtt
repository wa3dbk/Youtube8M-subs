00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
stronghold level 13 so shouldn't be a

stronghold level 13 so shouldn't be a
problem<00:01:15.549> for<00:01:15.789> me<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.570> have<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.409> potential<00:01:17.860> of

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
problem for me I have a potential of

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.910 
problem for me I have a potential of
gaining<00:01:18.280> three<00:01:18.670> honor<00:01:18.970> if<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:19.539> win<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.200> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
gaining three honor if I win and the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.710 
gaining three honor if I win and the
potential<00:01:21.399> of<00:01:21.460> losing<00:01:21.520> twenty-six<00:01:22.330> honor<00:01:22.509> if

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
potential of losing twenty-six honor if

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.760 
potential of losing twenty-six honor if
I<00:01:22.869> lose<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.420> this<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.689> a<00:01:25.720> pretty<00:01:26.020> safe<00:01:26.259> bet<00:01:26.530> and

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
I lose but this is a pretty safe bet and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.730 
I lose but this is a pretty safe bet and
for<00:01:26.920> me<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:28.119> cost<00:01:28.360> for<00:01:28.600> battle<00:01:28.990> stones<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.590> it's

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
for me it cost for battle stones so it's

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.490 
for me it cost for battle stones so it's
somewhat<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.520> a<00:01:30.670> pricey<00:01:30.909> cost<00:01:31.299> so<00:01:31.899> let's<00:01:32.079> check

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
somewhat of a pricey cost so let's check

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
somewhat of a pricey cost so let's check
out<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.770> medium<00:01:33.100> base

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

this<00:01:37.200> medium<00:01:37.409> bass<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.009> slightly<00:01:38.310> harder<00:01:38.789> it's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this medium bass is slightly harder it's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.660 
this medium bass is slightly harder it's
also<00:01:39.719> a<00:01:39.899> level<00:01:40.229> 13<00:01:40.680> stronghold<00:01:41.159> pile<00:01:41.460> where

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
also a level 13 stronghold pile where

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429 
also a level 13 stronghold pile where
the<00:01:41.820> defense's<00:01:42.509> look<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:43.079> bit<00:01:43.289> more

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the defense's look a little bit more

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.889 
the defense's look a little bit more
upgraded<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> potential<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.630> winning

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
upgraded I have a potential of winning

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.980 
upgraded I have a potential of winning
14<00:01:46.200> honor<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> base<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.119> win<00:01:48.360> or<00:01:48.930> a

14 honor in this base if I win or a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
14 honor in this base if I win or a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
potential of losing 15 if I lose I think

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
potential of losing 15 if I lose I think
this<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> probably<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.110> likely<00:01:55.679> choice

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this is probably the more likely choice

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.669 
this is probably the more likely choice
for<00:01:56.250> me<00:01:56.539> compared<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> easy<00:01:57.990> battle<00:01:58.409> but

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
for me compared to the easy battle but

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.139 
for me compared to the easy battle but
let's<00:01:58.829> take<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.039> look<00:01:59.250> at<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> hard<00:01:59.789> battle

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
let's take a look at the hard battle

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.240 
let's take a look at the hard battle
before<00:02:00.600> making<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> decision<00:02:03.920> here<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
before making a decision here in the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.740 
before making a decision here in the
hard<00:02:05.490> battle<00:02:05.819> you<00:02:05.970> can<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.539> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
hard battle you can see that the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.800 
hard battle you can see that the
defenses<00:02:07.439> are<00:02:07.619> far<00:02:08.069> more<00:02:08.099> upgraded<00:02:08.880> this<00:02:09.630> is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
defenses are far more upgraded this is

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.940 
defenses are far more upgraded this is
also<00:02:10.049> a<00:02:10.200> level<00:02:10.380> stronghold<00:02:10.920> 15<00:02:11.840> which<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.950> much

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
also a level stronghold 15 which is much

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.539 
also a level stronghold 15 which is much
harder<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.610> previous<00:02:14.640> two<00:02:15.269> battles<00:02:15.630> I

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
harder than the previous two battles I

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.979 
harder than the previous two battles I
have<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.610> potential<00:02:17.910> of<00:02:18.120> winning<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.480> whopping

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
have a potential of winning a whopping

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.430 
have a potential of winning a whopping
20<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.530> honor<00:02:19.799> if<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.160> win<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.489> battle<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
20 for honor if I win this battle and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
20 for honor if I win this battle and
only<00:02:22.440> lose<00:02:22.650> 5<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.310> lose<00:02:25.430> this<00:02:26.430> battle<00:02:26.670> only

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
only lose 5 if I lose this battle only

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.699 
only lose 5 if I lose this battle only
cost<00:02:27.299> me<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.720> battle<00:02:27.930> stones<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.500> it's<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
cost me to battle stones so it's the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.220 
cost me to battle stones so it's the
cheapest<00:02:29.130> option<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.880> 3<00:02:30.180> however<00:02:30.930> I

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
cheapest option of the 3 however I

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.170 
cheapest option of the 3 however I
probably<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> least<00:02:32.340> likelihood<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
probably have the least likelihood of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.589 
probably have the least likelihood of
winning

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.080 

I<00:02:36.629> think<00:02:37.349> I'll<00:02:37.469> decide<00:02:37.829> to<00:02:38.010> go<00:02:38.159> with<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
I think I'll decide to go with the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
I think I'll decide to go with the
medium<00:02:39.269> battle<00:02:39.780> as<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.269> but<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> strong

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
medium battle as I have but the strong

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.009 
medium battle as I have but the strong
likelihood<00:02:43.859> of<00:02:44.219> winning<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.969> also<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:45.659> huge

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
likelihood of winning and also a huge

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:52.009 
likelihood of winning and also a huge
payout<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.709> do<00:02:46.769> win<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:51.599> go<00:02:51.780> we'll

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
payout if I do win here we go we'll

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:06.720 
payout if I do win here we go we'll
right<00:02:52.290> into<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.739> attack

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.910 

so<00:03:07.270> it<00:03:07.360> looks<00:03:07.540> like<00:03:07.629> my<00:03:07.840> gamble<00:03:08.170> paid<00:03:08.440> off<00:03:08.650> I

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
so it looks like my gamble paid off I

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.150 
so it looks like my gamble paid off I
won<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.730> medium<00:03:10.060> battle<00:03:10.420> which<00:03:11.050> gained<00:03:11.410> 14

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
