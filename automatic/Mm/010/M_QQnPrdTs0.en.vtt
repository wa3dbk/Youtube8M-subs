00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 again to the intuition of this story 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.220
 with those with those cat food cans 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.600
 easy surreptitious advertising gives others 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.769
 Companies have you manufacture 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 but this corrugated iron is indeed too 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.420
 to buy 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:36.750
 you can because this looks then here 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.180
 that's why he's looking for something else 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.460
 times this cat food presses namely 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.039
 the paper does that are these 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 middle section of his reports star 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.329
 comes to light where then 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
 accordingly cut off here in the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.030
 position while you are in the field 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 stratmann then such a beautiful helbig 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 makes it then comes out 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 is a bit colder the blackboard soon 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:22.320
 therefore, we have here the problem that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:27.210
 the natural is practically the metal 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.009
 from otto so you can do it all in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.890
 the harbor 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.549
 So who a fireplace and pure or pack 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.650
 It's going to be fire outside then it will 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.140
 whole ingenious then stands approximately 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.040
 this color sheet metal color and if that is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.759
 then knock off a bit 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.790
 sister and the rain is then 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:02:08.250
 arise such magnificent 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:10.890
 color effects rust spots on it as I said 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.110
 only times a few days to rain down 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 and you can do it that way 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:22.790
 of course, lets stay out longer, despite that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.790
 whole a pretty view 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.080
 looks like it's rusted out then 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.590
 By the way, something not designed before 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.880
 has been 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.060
 otherwise that would be natural now 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.480
 look fantastic the whole then 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.100
 according to the new variant you move 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.990
 you have to pay attention there are the cans 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.709
 an inner side that is one 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.840
 coated side of the can inside is 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.030
 the feed is in terms accordingly 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 my hobbies top was the statement 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.700
 that rusted the rust someday 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.739
 also but it takes quite a while 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.870
 have fun while tinkering please do not 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.660
 cut the occupational safety teachings 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.150
 keep it up because that's pretty sharp 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.150
 all this stuff you have now times
