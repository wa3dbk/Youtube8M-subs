00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
I'm pretty sure I remember it's like a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.130 
I'm pretty sure I remember it's like a
whole<00:03:23.220> new<00:03:23.489> character<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.450> or<00:03:24.630> something<00:03:24.959> but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
whole new character now or something but

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.320 
whole new character now or something but
if<00:03:25.530> anyone<00:03:25.830> still<00:03:26.010> remembers<00:03:26.430> that<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.940> you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
if anyone still remembers that and you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.300 
if anyone still remembers that and you
