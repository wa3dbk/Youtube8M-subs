00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.570
 way at stake the match Moscow Spartak 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.059
 not a lot of leadership was played out 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.099
 in the championship for the citizens of virtual 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 Spartak Lost Points for Real 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539
 by recruited and surprising in this was 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.730
 what teams could forget when they 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.400
 last time won for reference 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.430
 The Fedotov collective did similar on May 6 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.170
 On April 22, the townspeople are the favorite in the race for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.119
 leadership was determined rather quickly 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
 Simok already in the fifth minute printed 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.480
 pletikosa 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.989
 but from the goalkeeper pour her good to slept 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 the performance of boris hit on played 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.820
 well worn by the rebound from him seduced 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 horn miss the first for Spartacus already 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
 tradition and do it twice in the course 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.480
 first half fashion novelty change her 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.730
 red and white possible like but before 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 tempted yet resisted themselves from 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.140
 advantageous positions smeared a gulu adam 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.140
 contributed by all means from the gift 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.449
 the forward of Moscow did not refuse us 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.550
 besides just two points in abundance 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.449
 but scored from our worst mistakes 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.439
 what is the last time 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.840
 very very often we do therefore 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.060
 I would like them not to be but alas I can not 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.329
 answer for the whole team 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.280
 today I was a little bad guys all 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:24.490
 played not like they should play at all 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.219
 our game today before from the edge 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.380
 right therefore say nothing 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.299
 the reason for the self-criticism of Spartak players 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 if they had more fortune for them 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.590
 favorably the result could be different 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.659
 between the first and second goal of the townspeople 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.149
 Spartacus had moments but a flash 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.009
 ended rather quickly successive 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.840
 search Fedot you with the attraction of the attack 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.610
 Quincy exit Bazhenov on the right flank 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.289
 and trying to take a speck 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.770
 dispatch functions to nothing 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.899
 led 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.060
 already in the first half went to his right 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.250
 flank fast in the second holiday left 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.349
 habitually became boyarintsev but effect 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.409
 instead, it turned out rather the reverse after 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:01.659
 break Spartak began to play much worse 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.579
 why do we have injured patients too 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.979
 quick all in my one rules us 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.110
 training in the general group 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.690
 I thought that she was not enough for you 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.609
 so played bazhenov there saw out 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.239
 pension today cross stood us again 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.239
 do not even and 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.720
 Spartak fans ask this question 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.730
 his team 3 that address in a row 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.860
 rather a football player than a coach but how 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.050
 It is known to replace the coach is easier than the whole 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.510
 Spartak team behind the leader of all 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.640
 at one point well, the question of the resignation of Fedotov 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.590
 already standing edge and protect your 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.560
 coach red and white is not really not on 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.570
 Words are in no hurry for such matches of course 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.630
 on your up mentor but games 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.970
 footballer so remove all not 11 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.459
 you can not and the longer course will play 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.510
 mentor but thatâ€™s the fate but i'm not 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.700
 I think that now there will be such a change 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.190
 I hope that all the same will give 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.280
 on running on fedot until the end of it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.270
 circle and then I will see the game 1 hour for 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.000
 myself and for the team and for the coach but played 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.370
 For romance played until Soviet but this 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.120
 does not change the essence of the game, then we donâ€™t 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.220
 losing this of course is terribly possible 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.340
 it was a weak Spartak who saved the townspeople 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.280
 from the post match spotlight and joy was 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.770
 satisfaction and 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.530
 and Moscow was also not perfect mistakes 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.620
 enough and this citizens probably recognize 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.090
 if we still like a series extended to how 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.890
 season 3 first 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.280
 but will not lose then it will be possible 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.620
 talk about the crisis that came out so 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.570
 at the moment I think that one game 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.480
 not an indicator of us yet 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.340
 injured many shots loss 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.330
 so talk about what came out all 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:00.959
 Equally let's say we watched carefully 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:04.280
 for the game of Spartacus this season and a lot 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.260
 matches and commented discussed and 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.230
 never disappointed me here in 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.000
 last game sorry it happened 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.970
 we usually expect from coming to the second 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.890
 half the best games in this match they are second 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.630
 time failed showed that 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.250
 and functional teams ready and 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.560
 psychological teams are ready 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.070
 I will not say that they lost completely 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.919
 well there would be a lot of luck on the side 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.900
 football club players moscow but 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.810
 no less than these gaps in the defense 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.930
 very clearly visible the game in the attack is not 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.030
 it turns out therefore this time Spartacus 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.530
 regret disappointed me 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.710
 it seems that the main problem 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.240
 Spartacus now this problem here this 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.240
 pressure pressure from outside 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.830
 pressure hospital pressure 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.650
 this will cope young players are not very 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.260
 copes for them the whole problem 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.150
 big here is wet psychologically 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.180
 come up and the second myth of psychology necessary 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.300
 for the coach if not starting from not wearing 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.710
 this age is given to players 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.840
 dota owners superbly behaves he 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.520
 behaves with dignity but 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.610
 I imagine what works well it 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.320
 of course he will have to spend 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.050
 any conclusions drawn from that with whom of 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.690
 these players on the way further who helps 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.240
 who to whom is the shirt Spartacus in the world of someone 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.630
 every player has rights when our ready 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.449
 input 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.180
 this happens to the goalkeepers i understand that 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:35.430
 at the beginning of the season Vladimir Fedotov 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.250
 did you have you for moments in relation to 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.080
 novel bumps well yes and now he's through 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.550
 some time reappeared in 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.990
 own composition suddenly such 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.220
 ridiculous friend such a children's mistake 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.440
 lack of concentration of course something 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.330
 need to do but in no case 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.630
 become a cross on this players each 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.880
 player happen such moments without knowing 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.479
 guys don't know and make recommendations 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.680
 the main thing is that we see the potential 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.680
 big he has to play
