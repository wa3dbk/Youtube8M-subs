think its point is i mean our voices

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.320 
think its point is i mean our voices
that<00:02:38.230> loud<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.280> goes<00:02:39.790> through<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.090> ship

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330

that loud that it goes through to ship
outside<00:02:40.600> space<00:02:41.260> where<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.680> ship<00:02:41.920> is<00:02:42.040> flying

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
outside space where the ship is flying

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.140 
outside space where the ship is flying

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
you also get this groovy am stand clear

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.410 
you also get this groovy am stand clear
plastic<00:02:46.420> stand<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:48.430> forms<00:02:48.940> in<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> shape

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
plastic stand and it forms in the shape

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.949 
plastic stand and it forms in the shape
of<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:50.350> star<00:02:51.250> trac<00:02:51.489> LM<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:52.180> great<00:02:52.780> thing<00:02:52.930> to

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
of the star trac LM here great thing to

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.160 
of the star trac LM here great thing to
understand<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.890> lets<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.750> move<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.989> ship

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
understand is it lets you move the ship

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.530 
understand is it lets you move the ship
around<00:02:56.320> in<00:02:56.709> two<00:02:56.830> different<00:02:56.980> poses<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.420> can

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
around in two different poses so you can

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.160 
around in two different poses so you can
move<00:02:58.630> back<00:02:58.930> or<00:02:59.290> forward<00:03:00.100> back<00:03:00.989> around<00:03:01.989> the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
move back or forward back around the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.570 
move back or forward back around the
sides<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.730> it<00:03:04.269> does<00:03:04.590> tend<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.709> pop<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.280> from

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
sides but it does tend to pop out from

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.520 
sides but it does tend to pop out from
time<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.940> time<00:03:06.970> if<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.360> move<00:03:07.570> around<00:03:07.810> like<00:03:08.260> so

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
time to time if you move around like so

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.560 
time to time if you move around like so
but<00:03:09.489> for<00:03:09.640> most<00:03:09.730> part<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.300> an<00:03:10.570> awesome<00:03:10.989> stand

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
but for most part it's an awesome stand

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.250 
but for most part it's an awesome stand
