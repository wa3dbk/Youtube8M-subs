 representative the dragon genius 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.109
 ball z budokai tenkaichi tous no hay 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 place to doubt that dragon ball z is one 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 of the most loved animes at the level 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 global and the appearance of a videogame 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.239
 new is always something that excites the 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.520
 fans however for more than now the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 Saga Budokai has fallen a bit in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.960
 quality the appearance of Teneris and 2 for 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.149
 Playstation 2 was the kid's dream 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 taking the cartoons to our 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.940
 control with his fantastic designs the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.090
 he already led a great squad of players 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.220
 insurmountable the bass 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.740
 maybe akira is the most anime 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.660
 recognized of all times even more 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.089
 that its version as it was original without 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.280
 However, its adaptation to the video game for 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.800
 for me, ccoo is one of the most 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 sad that they can get to play the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.240
 game is a kind of graphic adventure 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 in 8 bits where all the violence and the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.979
 Akira action is reduced to the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 few actions that we can perform but 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.420
 that you close up or choose options 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.130
 text nothing more every now and then there is 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 some action scenes but always 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.910
 are repeated with the same enemies if a 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.740
 this we add that everything was in 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.920
 Japanese we are before one of the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.090
 most abused licenses in history 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.770
 what misano i sos saw adventure more 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.050
 there the name comes to the hair for 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.780
 the section the title of fights of 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.330
 bizarre adventure of them or is it a 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.789
 rarity itself because due to frenetism 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.160
 of the cartoon nobody would expect 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.950
 the aesthetic nor dimensional to the marvel 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.440
 vs capcom could also seat him 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.630
 game is an art of '98 but luckily 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.940
 at this time you get versions 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.600
 hd both in the playstation market 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.990
 as in him 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.140
 and not definitive captain tsubasa all 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.729
 super swinger nobody ever reaches 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.310
 with a video game of the supercampeones 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.319
 to write our fantasy did not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.510
 a lot of technology is missing but the 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.140
 very family game took care of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.489
 do it with super fly care 2 an rpg 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.590
 sports that not only told us the 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.600
 history of the complete saga but that 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.000
 had micro events within each 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.069
 party which could change the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.050
 result of it provided that two 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.590
 characters with stories will cross 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.220
 something that even 20 years later could not be 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.540
 emulated this was the report of the day in 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.540
 fucking nerds
