 Diego

 It takes months once you speak to me 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 also known as the 8 may that 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.340
 we are in a new video but this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.619
 video is different from what we or 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.080
 good that I bring them in the channel of x 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.600
 a gameplay of gears of war the skin of 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.820
 wii and good because I'm uploading a 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.340
 video of that style so good here 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.470
 come the news super wow good I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 I know many youtubers and in this series 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.170
 which is called just world challenges that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 3 - good different types of gears 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.110
 of war truth, well, he is thinking and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.020
 after seeing the challenges how are they going 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.760
 good youtubers as they suffer as 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.310
 they make people laugh like I laugh 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.860
 when I see them I say very interesting 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.020
 try to see how it would feel to do 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.540
 that I do that kind of challenge, I say no 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.120
 would be ciu super pro or nothing for the 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.180
 style made six super no but good of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.460
 all the way, he wanted to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 even I think that since we could 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.820
 laugh at how I laugh because it's so weird 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.060
 Once you hear me deny or deny 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.980
 to get angry so very much much to leave 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.720
 by itself I already know that I but that yes as 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.720
 that you wanted to play better 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.679
 I do not know why people usually do it 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.939
 I say nothing of uneasy knives but in 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:32.190
 I 'm not really game if I know that a 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.550
 times the coldest 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.070
 without internet bing and this pink and that other 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.750
 pink and the whole roll the children of his 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.460
 Christmas all the phrases that I always 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 I use and that sometimes in lighting 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.740
 they listen to pink and christmas chijos because 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.810
 that sort of thing is that as well 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.970
 some laughs others do not and sometimes 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 things is so witty that I get 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.780
 happen to me and good things that 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 it's also sure they're going to happen to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.980
 you because I'm almost sure it's 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 a great imagination and that really 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.090
 sounds like the super parent challenges but 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 well I'm explaining what it was 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.140
 good 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 personally I am that many 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 youtubers make videos as well as 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.190
 food recipes that make mixtures with 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.030
 a stream of things and they take it or 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.849
 who eat the raw onion or who 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.950
 garlic bite while because death 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.269
 thing to say but personally I 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.370
 study think about that kind of thing 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.620
 after the choripÃ¡n and I think that 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.460
 agreement was a challenge that I made that time 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.300
 I personally do not like this 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.490
 already 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.680
 after that kind of experiences and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.810
 good is father is fun to the 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.120
 People like him equally 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.820
 way not because because to me in what 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.640
 staff was half funny but already 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.470
 when I saw the video I said I do not know no no 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.330
 Are you not so comfortable? 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.520
 obviously it's not about communities 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.070
 with which you suffer true but the 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.610
 situation is that who tells you that 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.890
 simply 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.670
 I would not like to do for my channel in what 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.620
 North staff is not very apt good to me 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.050
 it's not pleasant for me to see how almost 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 I throw up for taking something that you have 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.280
 it happened until the know in china ma jin 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.350
 so another thing about iu with milk I do not know 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.810
 and I'm thinking that kind of thing and for 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.270
 so if they are going to ask for a challenge 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.830
 I would really appreciate it if you did not put 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.390
 no food because I 'm not going to make them 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.190
 do not do anything of food anything of things 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.260
 so disgusting because good people like 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.020
 I already told them personally, I do not know 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.870
 It makes me comfortable too I'm nothing else think 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.750
 in those is a girl and I have my limits 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.250
 Relaxation is fine there is fun is what 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.709
 you want but as long as 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.590
 there is respect and good gave him the 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.900
 limit because 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.760
 after surpassing that kind of thing and 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.709
 every time they become more expensive arcore and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.080
 can that somehow candles and I 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.129
 He gave that kind of thing because he has good 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.220
 its details 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.470
 likes for example - such done things from 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.319
 destination to which you say this plane of 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.260
 plan or not the idea is that in a video 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.970
 it's not just about that, youtuber 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.530
 suffer true in that type of challenges but 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.959
 that he also has fun as well 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.930
 how are you having fun 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.120
 is what this is about, we do not do it 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.680
 Well, the youtuber every time he tries 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.840
 make a challenge that is going to say is not 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.660
 I do not feel like what they look difficult 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.250
 ie I started I do not like this we 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.980
 like the other 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.940
 I do not know, I have to take energy and strength 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.120
 because it's really super difficult 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.800
 the challenge is very disgusting then 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.780
 imagine yourself instead of enjoying it 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.720
 to have desire will be a video of that style 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.000
 it does not have to be anything its very 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.070
 upload a video every time is once a 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.110
 Month is not the week or I do not know once every 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.170
 three months is depending from today on 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.840
 the personal thing I'm not going to be that kind of 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.760
 challenges excuse me but I'm not sorry if 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.340
 I do not know I know how personally 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.530
 there is a limit of god of challenges then 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.900
 if you do not want to know that you do not 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.160
 use do it cropped ok and just 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.950
 you use grenades to kill the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.860
 people or ones them I am that you are 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.600
 a great imagination and I know that you of 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.730
 they will truly be able to move forward be 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.360
 serious and I know they're going to laugh a lot 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.840
 because good 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.340
 for what I see and for what I say and that 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.729
 that did not even follow him angry that 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.479
 I usually get angry the grade in years 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.889
 of war 3 therefore people I hope 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.870
 that true support in that kind of thing 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.759
 and can you say good many youtube already what 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.099
 have done and that kind of thing but today 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.719
 it's different I already know a girl who 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.669
 try to do and personally I 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.260
 I want to do it I had a lot of great 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:46.190
 a lot of time but like who did not give me 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.900
 courage does not do not do not encourage me said no 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.270
 is that that good do not locate I do not know what 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.770
 but well now you do not feel that 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:54.530
 it is different in the same way 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.150
 we can move forward I tell them this 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.130
 series with your true support and with your 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.190
 comments on everything because good if 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.110
 your comments then and follow your challenges 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.640
 it can not be the headquarters if it could put me 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.100
 me the same challenge of kino then now 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.930
 I want I do not know how to kill like to cut 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.490
 but it's not the same, it's not the same, not what 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.040
 same as a warm person I want 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.070
 that you make this challenge is not the same people 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.430
 therefore people already know that is the 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.860
 good conclusion there will be video of 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.750
 challenges and even many more series more 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.000
 after I will explain 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.910
 obviously as time passes and the 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.010
 support but good video of challenges whether 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.980
 five appointed me by the style because 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.289
 I do not want to do that, I'm not going to do it 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.389
 either 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.279
 weapons challenges of things like that 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.949
 whatever it has to do with the game is worth 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.869
 but good people life experiences are 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:46.180
 feels good and carcelÃ©n comments me 

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:49.639

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.310
