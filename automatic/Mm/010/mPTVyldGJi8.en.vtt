00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.390
 we intended to do this 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.580
 appearance to denounce the trial 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.289
 political that today had to start in 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.189
 Madrid 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.769
 we wanted to bring here the situation in the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.469
 that we are where four 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.899
 members of the national council of sortu 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.850
 they had to be tried in the audience 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.100
 national pernando aurena marisa 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.970
 alejandro marijé fullaondo eta juan joxe 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.480
 petrikorena but as you know that judgment 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.440
 has been suspended for the moment 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.270
 we wanted to denounce that today in 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.079
 euskal herria is still without equality 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:59.559
 of conditions to do politics 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.020
 We wanted to denounce that sortu when they have 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.300
 after four years since it ended 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.660
 definitely the armed activity of 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.700
 eta continues to have to perform his 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.270
 political activity in worse conditions 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.180
 that the rest we have some members of 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.190
 our prison training we have 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.130
 others waiting for condemnation in these 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 moments and some others as well 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.700
 you know 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.250
 returning from that trial that for now 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.370
 it is not going to celebrate 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.700
 in the Spanish state he pays us with 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.140
 revenge our political commitment to 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.780
 favor of euskal herria 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.270
 and today today in the morning we have had 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.080
 knowledge of the detention of another 16 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.060
 people 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.450
 most of them are lawyers and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.450
 lawyers is to say people who are in 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.570
 the day to day carrying out its activity of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.390
 public form in the courts and still and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.320
 all the civil guard has decided 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.400
 stop them by an operation 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.159
 that way today the 35 people 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.350
 that are processed and that they had to 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.570
 be judged today in madrid those 35 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.250
 people from the 'abertzale' left 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.250
 have been left without 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.320
 without legal representation when I had 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.320
 to start that trial 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.820
 and all this happens two days after 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.660
 a massive demonstration in 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.610
 bilbo against criminal policy 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.650
 of criminal penitentiary policy 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.870
 of the Spanish state 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.269
 Some might think that it is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.310
 a coincidence we and we 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.709
 we think we do not think it's about 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.709
 a response from the one who understands 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.689
 the Spanish state and revenge 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.109
 We consider that this operation 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.269
 Today's operation is part of politics 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.780
 criminal penitentiary of the state 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:06.310
 Spanish whose sole purpose is to remove 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.170
 all kinds of support all kinds of support 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.739
 and the group of political prisoners 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.739
 Basque 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.860
 the Spanish state 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.560
 employs again and again revenge against 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.530
 euskal herria we are without a doubt 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.950
 in front of a terrorist state 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.670
 Quixote who sees giants where there is only 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.980
 mills 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.890
 that sees terrorists where there is only 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.890
 lawyers and that instead of seeing 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.140
 political activists see dangerous 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.490
 criminals though our only weapons 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.320
 just the pen and the paper 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.630
 this operation has been given the name 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.730
 of mate 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.610
 because it complements another previous one that 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.980
 It was called Check 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.530
 because we and we say that it is 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.110
 the moment that this town gives 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.530
 checkmate the civil guard is the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.880
 when they leave Basque Country 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.880
 we live a key moment in all europe 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.880
 Some 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.530
 some in favor supposedly in favor of 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.959
 the freedom to try to protect 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.290
 our freedom they intend to restrict 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.760
 we maximize our freedoms the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.220
 citizens we have to 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.010
 make it clear that we are not willing 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.669
 to leave our future in hand in hands 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.530
 of the securócratas yesterday in paris 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.220
 millions and millions of people shouted 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.550
 jesuit charly and we agree with 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.520
 they and with them today thousands and thousands of 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.240
 people and us with them and with 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.660
 they shouted yesui basque 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.699
 we do not renounce to claim any of 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.800
 the rights that correspond to us 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.800
 we will continue to claim each and every 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.590
 one of them but without deceiving us to day 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.770
 today we know that the only scenario 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.229
 possible of peace democracy and freedom 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.110
 for our people it is outside the 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:11.289
 been Spanish so we have to go 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.139
 the sooner in that sense 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.990
 sortu wants to make an appeal 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.960
 to join forces to the whole of 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:25.740
 Basque citizenship to make that possible 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.740
 peace scene democracy and freedom 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.670
 against the policy of revenge and the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.790
 strategy of war of the Spanish state 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.790
 it's time to join forces it 's time to 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.820
 join forces to make that way possible 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.770
 Basque for peace and democracy and for 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.930
 we make an appeal to all the 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.880
 Basque people to each and every one of the 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.410
 citizens of euskal herria to join

 forces is the moment
