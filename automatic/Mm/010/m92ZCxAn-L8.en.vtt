00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.510
 Well look and finish the first round despite showing here how this tip is going 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.690
 n in thread I walk a little 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 that he simply put on 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 aquilino marquez and carving would be a detection close look like this 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 good is an idea 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.029
 Miguel Castillo in this round 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.640
 I've been two laps high 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.899
 the first 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.890
 they are also giving shape 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.550
 with the second 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 so here I am left with this point flying 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 they are cited 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.899
 here 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.380
 The second round of the high point goes up the second 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.420
 so 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.740
 here this 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.950
 I do not do it anymore I'm just going to knit 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.069
 in one way 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.070
 accident 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.160
 simply meteor wide sack 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.240
 because it's the way I can cut it by being on the shore 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.900
 so 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.490
 in this way we already had the second round where we implemented the 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.230
 stitch point percent 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.270
 relief 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.420
 so we have left 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580
 and from the back 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.800
 this is how we have the relief point 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.610
 in this way 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.550
 activity that we did two laps but if you are weaving your tissues 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.560
 circular 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.360
 they are always going to weave a fabric the relief point in this way 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.780
 if you are a fabric it is not circular and that challenge as well as this one is either 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.670
 square rectangular 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.700
 or whatever 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.500
 percent and that you are going to have to flip the fabric 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.950
 and keep protecting 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.570
 but stop powder to continue weaving is aimed then you have to weave the 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.180
 next turn in a different way 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.640
 here I am going to start 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160
 taking 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.580
 I'm going to teach them first 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.020
 with three chains can raise the point 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.100
 to teach them how to knit and then start this first point with the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.829
 point percent in a different way 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.670
 so 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.700
 the three chains do not serve to raise the high point 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.490
 i reached the second point instead of taking it by the peeling top 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.810
 we are going to take it 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.409
 from the bottom 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.569
 this way I took and launched here 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.730
 and he took it out by simply taking the point that follows 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.199
 pulled out has given me a lot 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.279
 and then since he said 1 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:24.159
 two 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.639
 gone 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.249
 what is the high point 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.939
 the second 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.159
 this is the second point 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:33.759
 good the third 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.759
 but it is the one that follows then net miranzo 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.589
 here 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.179
 I hang the hook 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.979
 saracco 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:45.849
 he left 1 2 books 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.239
 in this way I already have two points 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.180
 to miguel here is how pacis how is it going 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.669
 it remains the same 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.159
 Well, I'm going to derail this because I want to show you how you can 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.109
 achieve and the first point also weave it as relief point but from the side 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.509
 Reverse 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:06.890
 or on the bottom because 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.869
 there are different ways to call it then 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:14.459
 if I already finished knitting at a point in this way of the last round this 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.369
 previous return 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:16.989
 if they put it in turn to 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.310
 here is my point then I pass it in the back maybe here 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:26.149
 grabbed a bow tie and I have two centuries 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.479
 isaac others 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.150
 this point will have a chain 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.599
 to have the height of the high point I need 300 schools efe 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.799
 two more chains and with that I already have the height and I have the mounted here 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 the first as point l relief also 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.479
 well then we continue the next point 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.579
 is this 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.419
 I put it on the bottom 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:56.579
 the bows as healer threw sack 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.209
 paco 1 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.730
 2 and 2 again 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.039
 grabbed the room 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.039
 and what he said hanging the ranch on the bottom 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.689
 Nancy 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.119
 grandson the hook 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.119
 here for sacco 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:18.120
 one 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.219
 two 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.610
 let's do it the way so that this one can not appreciate better 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.479
 I am going to narrate this point which is the one that follows 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.629
 A) Yes 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:30.469
 isaac 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:33.180
 na 2 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.749
 the one that follows that it would be this 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.039
 always remember this is for a while below 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.180
 let's try to explain in a different way so that you want to see 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.909
 better than I understood how sara ramírez you read 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.450
 well I do not know I hope without appreciating 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.950
 here you see in the two centuries this is because we hang there 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.930
 the point is here 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.990
 when we are here here you see that the point is cut off above 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.940
 then who is counted it is easy to distinguish when this point 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.129
 is on the right side or when it is on the wrong side 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.129
 the right is when we grab it from above 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.480
 the reverse is when we take it 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.809
 under 

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:18.930
 so 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.099
 here 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.830
 we have to pinch the backhand point 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.650
 all on the bottom 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.419
 it means that we are going to grow it 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.029
 taking the sada 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.210
 we put the ranch 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.129
 we hung the point 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.520
 and here the tissues 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.830
 in this way 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.500
 and so we will continue knitting I will continue weaving several laps to 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.569
 that you see how you want 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.389
 from this side 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.819
 and on this side 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.189
 of the return of the right or from above or below 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:53.210
 to see 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.020
 like I was knitting not in that way where all the points are the same in 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.409
 the same line 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:02.409
 it was on the same lap 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.749
 well here I already gil 

00:06:07.749 --> 00:06:11.499
 a number of laps look to count the laps we do for 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:15.529
 hundred when we have that stitch and can distinguish how many turns we take 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:20.979
 simply telling quintín this would be a return states that is three 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.570
 this 4 and this one 5 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.120
 here we have five laps one two three four 5 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.350
 in this way the laps are counted 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.449
 what is being stitched 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.340
 good expo a slight tower then 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:38.449
 this would be the point highlighted by the top 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:43.400
 and that would be the point highlighted by the bottom part then 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.440
 here is the view that you like more and like more as headquarters this 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.520
 it can be the right 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.060
 or if they like it more like celeste 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.000
 these boards are very useful for when I burn shoes there were 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.229
 even 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:01.999
 i can do them combined with other stitches, well, well this is 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:04.919
 basically that you learn to be this highlight 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.169
 i therefore nothing 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.590
 I hope we continue learning 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.250
 do not hesitate to visit my channel 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.590
 so they can appreciate percent 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.619
 the other videos that I have uploaded previously 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.999
 that is fine if you have not subscribed you should not subscribe 

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.709
 until next time
