00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.580
 How are you doing the bridge? 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.859
 that I love everything that has many 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.620
 colors and the colors of the rainbow 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.590
 In fact, my nails give me away and 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.330
 Today I want to show you how to make a cheesecake 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.370
 rainbow that in fact already exists but 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.320
 I want to make this special video for 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.870
 tell you what those secrets are for 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.790
 a cheesecake will be perfect this 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 cheesecake or rather said in Spanish 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.399
 cheesecake is baked and really 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.200
 he knows very differently from those who are without 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.370
 oven and giving it a rainbow touch is 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.370
 so let's see things 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.330
 the ingredients for the base 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.250
 cookies are a packet of cookies 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.500
 Maria made powder in the blender or 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.000
 processor and 4 tablespoons of butter 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
 without melted salt 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.100
 mix the cookies with the butter 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 until there is something like that 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 and in a removable mold like this one 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.810
 It measures approximately 20 centimeters 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.729
 diameter the truth these molds are very 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.350
 practical and are special for 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.600
 I recommend much cheesecakes 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.830
 buy one add the mixture and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.830
 press very well 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.380
 the secret here is that you can flip it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.000
 and if nothing falls, it means that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.469
 it is well pressed and you are not going to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.329
 break inside the freezer or 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.990
 refrigerator while we make the mixture 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.990
 rainbow 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.440
 to mix the cheesecake you need 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.119
 three packages of cream cheese takes out the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.430
 a few minutes before the refrigerator for 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 that are very soft three quarters of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.690
 cup of sugar three quarters of a cup 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 acid cream or half cream or cream 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.890
 milk you find three quarters of 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.869
 cup of cream to beat liquid three 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 eggs a teaspoon of essence 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.069
 Vanilla the juice of a lemon to give it 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.989
 a special touch and colorants 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.010
 vegetables red orange yellow green 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.010
 blue and lilac 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.349
 First start your oven at 160 degrees 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.879
 centigrade to preheat it after 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.349
 cream the cream cheese with the 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.349
 sugar until they join 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.280
 add the eggs one by one 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.459
 ah 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.459
 ah 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.700
 add vanilla cream and juice 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.700
 lemon beats about 5 seconds more 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.560
 and in another bowl beat average speed the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.489
 cream to beat a few minutes until 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.489
 Thicken a little 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.129
 you add it to the mix and beat for the last 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.129
 time about 5 more seconds 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.780
 it is for the mixture in six portions 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.780
 same 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.300
 and add a little bit of each dye to 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.300
 each 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730
 or 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.280
 take out the mold from the freezer that has 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.439
 cookies and first with aluminum foil 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.390
 wrapping the whole bottom part the 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.260
 cheesecake so that nothing is thrown away and 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.260
 not going to get water 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.500
 then you are going to add to it first the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.950
 red color and extending it with a 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.950
 teaspoon 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:59.380
 after the orange the yellow only 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.950
 let it fall and make the shape as of a 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.950
 circle 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:15.430
 the green the blue and the lilac 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.739
 Cover with another layer of aluminum mold 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.419
 and you are going to add the mold the cheesecake 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.699
 in another larger mold where you can fit 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.070
 inside and add little water this will be 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.440
 a bain-marie type but in the oven like that 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.210
 it will be really beautiful and this is a 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.520
 secret between you and me to achieve a 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.130
 perfect cheese that now if you put it to 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.780
 bake at 160 degrees centigrade another 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.940
 tip is that you should not be to bake 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.370
 high temperature will last as a 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.949
 hour with 40 minutes just notice that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.620
 something like this very soft but I'm sure 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.720
 let it cool a bit and then 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.780
 put it in the refrigerator all night 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.490
 or to the freezer for about two hours 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.120
 take it out and then first pass a little stick 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.690
 all over the shore remove the belt 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.690
 of the mold 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.430
 and with the same stick I took out the 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.810
 cheesecake and put it where you want 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.540
 present it 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.550
