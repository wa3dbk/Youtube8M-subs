00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.800
 The school festival is over 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.789
 If you think you started 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.890

 What is the cause of today's hemorrhoids 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.340

 Dawn at the time with us 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.750
 It seems that something happened after we broke up with us 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.630
 To mud tape of reconciliation had entered 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.340
 I got a pen again on my way back 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:05.089

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:10.620
 I 'm leaving when I get suspended 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:13.250
 It is not good for a shrine maiden, but if you do so, we will be able to play with us again 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.250
 3 difference 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.450
 Do you believe so 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.990
 Yes What'll I can say this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:28.180
 I don't think that two people get along well 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 That's right, even though it looks like a contract 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.990

 I 'm doing a post kiss when I leave 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.610
 I took it for a while. 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.810
 I do not know where to ask for Ito but 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.480
 It's not about being jealous because it's a partner you can say 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 Along car 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.950

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 Minami-chan absolutely farewell Le monday 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:24.950
 Even if you say so much to invite you to Kyoto, you have a breadth of knowing it right after you do it 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.950
 Owed 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.920
