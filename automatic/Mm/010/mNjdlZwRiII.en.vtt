00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.320
 there is a question in particular 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.320
 a 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.680
 wellink the third place in the wise and the 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.440
 Mexico 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.940
 it was a very interesting problem because 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.010
 It has been like the biggest one I've played 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.160
 me so far 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.160
 my record was 82 with boeing 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.969
 lost I did not lose will come in these four 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.500
 because with work it is not supremely 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.500
 bad but good 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.890
 on the wheel that is going to say this 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.120
 I lost with tron ​​gadgets 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.430
 the robbery as god 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.710
 I earn 20 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:06.630
 and I lost against and lost with working peak 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.530
 in dance they gave me 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.310
 today came four hits of one 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.310
 will go nothing to do 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.440
 and the next I was four thousand 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.860
 rules 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.370
 with vujin plan of all wines mans 2 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.370
 far fish 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.670
 and visual and if I'm not bad 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.530
 I think other phases 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.500
 the format 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.360
 then until the prime arrives 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.650
 l'origine we are all level but 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
 when the new expansion comes 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.470
 I think the goal is going to change totally 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.650
 and they will prioritize three or four hours not 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.650
 more and the two are going to be like 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 3. 4 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.440
 I think that madoff has good potential 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.480
 because he makes a master in the first shift 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.770
 boeing because having the acceleration of 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.390
 to be able to make hits without first turn 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.070
 to play 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.280
 silvan because of the speed 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.530
 can do 7 very easily and the other 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.140
 it's hard and fax because of the diversity that 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.950
 have with all the decks to settle 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.950
 Thank you
