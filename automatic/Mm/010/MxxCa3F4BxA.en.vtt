00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.990
 the depth of the soul 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.990
 we proceeded to power the fpi 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.040
 for me it's a word of all Ivorians the togo unemployment rate at 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.200
 lowest since April 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.360
 with neighbors 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.619

 everything is a lot softer 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790
 for me the month of August you make you remember it a funny 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.829
 Moreover the damage of deficiencies 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.829
 it took two times the ajax amsterdam 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.539

 in a meeting that had started since then why fuels for 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.159
