recently<00:04:26.039> about<00:04:26.460> dlcs<00:04:27.150> i<00:04:27.229> listed<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.320> whole

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
recently about dlcs i listed a whole

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.560 
recently about dlcs i listed a whole
bunch<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.919> different<00:04:29.280> games<00:04:29.430> and<00:04:29.820> because

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
bunch of different games and because

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.010 
bunch of different games and because
it's<00:04:30.720> just<00:04:30.870> extra<00:04:31.259> DLCs<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.830> I<00:04:31.860> just<00:04:32.070> have<00:04:32.220> so

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
it's just extra DLCs that I just have so

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.270 
it's just extra DLCs that I just have so
it's<00:04:34.020> better<00:04:34.229> given<00:04:34.530> way<00:04:34.740> just<00:04:34.979> to<00:04:35.070> have<00:04:35.190> them

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
it's better given way just to have them

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.529 
it's better given way just to have them
sitting<00:04:35.550> around<00:04:35.820> and<00:04:36.030> because<00:04:36.270> then<00:04:36.389> they

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
sitting around and because then they

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.100 
sitting around and because then they
expire<00:04:36.960> after<00:04:37.199> a<00:04:37.380> while<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.630> does<00:04:39.630> very<00:04:39.810> unique

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
expire after a while so does very unique

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.540 
expire after a while so does very unique
code<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.500> think<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.770> is<00:04:40.830> going<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.160> go<00:04:41.340> for<00:04:41.520> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
code I think this is going to go for a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.029 
code I think this is going to go for a
lot<00:04:41.699> of<00:04:41.820> money<00:04:41.970> I<00:04:42.479> saw<00:04:43.169> people<00:04:43.320> on<00:04:43.530> ebay<00:04:43.740> paying

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
lot of money I saw people on ebay paying

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.770 
lot of money I saw people on ebay paying
thirty<00:04:44.340> five<00:04:44.580> forty<00:04:44.610> dollars<00:04:45.240> for<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:45.539> code

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
thirty five forty dollars for this code

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.540 
thirty five forty dollars for this code
I<00:04:46.110> bet<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> lot<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.860> people<00:04:46.949> don't<00:04:47.250> even<00:04:47.340> know

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
I bet a lot of people don't even know

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.300 
I bet a lot of people don't even know
about<00:04:47.580> this<00:04:47.940> code<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.509> it<00:04:48.919> might<00:04:49.919> even<00:04:50.039> go<00:04:50.280> up

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
about this code so it might even go up

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.110 
about this code so it might even go up
