00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 come on 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.050
 chieti pesaro was to be a direct clash between two suitors for the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.220
 final victory 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.390
 but in reality there was practically no game 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.980
 just listen or if you prefer straws eighteenth presicci 25th and the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.420
 rest stuff that does not make stock 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.390
 the chieti starts on the right foot and shows itself to be on the field 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.610
 inresistibile 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 a real Latin bissa that is not to be confused with the namesake from Marche 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.930
 that to be awarded at least as far as the gerini saw 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.400
 has been shown to have more than a few problems 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.800
 Spikes Brilliant in the first half he made the race his own, giving the impression 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.180
 to be the only team but present on the pitch 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.009
 to be reported for the duty of objectivity 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.819
 that guests could not deploy the number one magnani like 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:24.680
 announced 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.470
 as the goalkeeper was injured during the pre-match 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.880
 on the pitch between the poles, therefore, the strongest recipes among them are lined up 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.410
 however he was not in good physical condition 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.630
 about accidents, chieti also had its headache 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.130
 great fear when the beginning of recovery feola was forced to abandon the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.080
 play ground on a stretcher 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.410
 the black-green fullback was 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.040
 immediately rescued and taken to the hospital on the field in his place 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.220
 the angel with zini 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.850
 but let's move on to the images 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 at the third minute of play chieti shows gianni cavezzi 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.910
 the pesaro defends itself and at the same time the slalom in the area seems to be beautiful 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.049
 Viterbini 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.489
 which, however, is not successful 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.859
 the neroverdi hit in the pride immediately do justice 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.039
 eighteenth the assist e rt cavezzi 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.670
 the splendid pumpkin 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.769
 It is signed straw 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.569
 it is a magic moment for the fox men who make the ball spin with 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.989
 much skill 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.269
 astonished ibis are watching 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.519
 presicci at the 23rd provides a good straw-that-plate football 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.309
 he is usually put down by blowflies 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.239
 for all regular dinels 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 pickets wastes no time in futile protests and 100 seconds later 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.299
 doubles with presicci on punishment 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.689
 2 to 0 for the chieti 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.299
 the replica of the pesaro 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.450
 little stuff and it runs out with this crazy conclusion out of it 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.699
 chieti never dome for a show 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.549
 let's enjoy this choral action that took place at half-hour and yes 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.549
 materialized with the iron blow 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.020
 even in the end to say it 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.169
 still chieti 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:16.719
 44th 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.099
 understand from the left cut the field for elegant presicci and its control 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 the conclusion is valid 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.060
 a minute later presicci tries again well primed by outsiders and this time 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.499
 his low shot is stopped by bimby recipes 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.309
 in the second half that is the feola injury and at the twenty-sixth lavis yes 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.239
 alarm and pazzaglia concludes so 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.929
 pgt that in the second half paid particular attention to administering 

00:03:42.929 --> 00:03:48.319
 then immediately reply with a heel to cut them off for the benefit of 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.890
 Lion 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.549
 that sets presicci in motion 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.169
 the pesaro dances to the rhythm of satan 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.700
 5 minutes from the end the Marches 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.579
 have their cross chance which is fail with devana t 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.539
 here the text crosses the whole mirror but in vain 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.269
 the final high is still black green 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.599
 capizzi answers the call with a fireball from outside 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.459
 and squeezes the hidden lockit for a starting spot for the tournament
