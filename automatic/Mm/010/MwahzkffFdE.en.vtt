00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

I've<00:00:00.210> been<00:00:00.390> meaning<00:00:00.719> to<00:00:00.750> try<00:00:01.020> some<00:00:01.410> multi-axis

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
I've been meaning to try some multi-axis

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.869 
I've been meaning to try some multi-axis
turning<00:00:02.850> which<00:00:03.330> is<00:00:03.720> where<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.980> turn<00:00:05.279> part<00:00:05.759> of

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
turning which is where you turn part of

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.570 
turning which is where you turn part of
an<00:00:05.970> object<00:00:06.089> then<00:00:07.130> remounted<00:00:08.130> on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> lathe

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
an object then remounted on the lathe

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.270 
an object then remounted on the lathe
with<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.120> different<00:00:09.870> axis<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.410> rotation<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
with a different axis of rotation and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.270 
with a different axis of rotation and
turn<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.360> different<00:00:12.809> part<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.500> turn<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.070> same

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
turn a different part or turn the same

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.359 
turn a different part or turn the same
part<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.820> different<00:00:15.210> way

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
part in a different way

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
part in a different way
multi<00:00:17.369> axis<00:00:17.730> turning<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> really<00:00:18.810> an<00:00:18.960> art<00:00:19.740> form

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
multi axis turning is really an art form

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.109 
multi axis turning is really an art form
in<00:00:20.310> itself<00:00:21.410> it<00:00:22.410> kind<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.070> breaks<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.820> door

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
in itself it kind of breaks the door

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.140 
in itself it kind of breaks the door
wide<00:00:24.420> open<00:00:24.449> from<00:00:25.430> traditional<00:00:26.430> solids<00:00:27.029> of

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
wide open from traditional solids of

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.220 
wide open from traditional solids of
revolution<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.949> far<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.150> interesting

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
revolution to far more interesting

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.799 
revolution to far more interesting
complicated<00:00:31.230> freeform<00:00:31.980> shapes<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.809> it's

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
complicated freeform shapes and it's

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.959 
complicated freeform shapes and it's
really<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> test<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.829> your<00:00:35.190> imagination

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
really a test of your imagination

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.740 
really a test of your imagination
because<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.960> geometry<00:00:38.570> associated<00:00:39.570> with

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
because the geometry associated with

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.110 
because the geometry associated with
this<00:00:39.870> type<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.320> turning<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.829> actually<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:42.000> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this type of turning is actually kind of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.799 
this type of turning is actually kind of
complex<00:00:43.129> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> blank<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> walnut<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
complex this is a blank of walnut and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.959 
complex this is a blank of walnut and
paducah<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.860> i<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> really

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
paducah which i think is a really

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.720 
paducah which i think is a really
striking<00:00:48.360> combination<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> colors<00:00:49.860> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
striking combination of colors really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
striking combination of colors really
nice<00:00:51.000> looking<00:00:51.449> even<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.350> rough<00:00:52.620> form<00:00:52.980> i

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.510 

mounted<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> between<00:00:58.260> centers<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.460> i

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
mounted this between centers but i

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580 
mounted this between centers but i
offset<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> bit<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.570> each<00:01:00.780> end<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
offset it a bit on each end so the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
offset it a bit on each end so the
paduka<00:01:01.949> stripe<00:01:02.280> would<00:01:02.489> look<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.879> little

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
paduka stripe would look a little

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.280 
paduka stripe would look a little
off-kilter

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
off-kilter

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
off-kilter
if<00:01:04.700> you've<00:01:05.700> seen<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.299> few<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:06.869> other

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
if you've seen a few of my other

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
if you've seen a few of my other
projects<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> theme<00:01:09.030> I've

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
projects you know this is a theme I've

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
projects you know this is a theme I've
kind<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.600> been<00:01:09.750> exploring<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.610> such

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
kind of been exploring you get such

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.420 
kind of been exploring you get such
elegant<00:01:12.570> curves<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.430> intersect

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
elegant curves when you intersect

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
elegant curves when you intersect
something<00:01:14.820> round<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.360> something<00:01:15.780> straight

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
something round with something straight

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.800 
something round with something straight
but<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.070> angle<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:18.420> think<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but at an angle and I think it's a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
but at an angle and I think it's a
really<00:01:19.080> neat<00:01:19.259> effect<00:01:20.900> here<00:01:21.900> I'm<00:01:22.020> using<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
really neat effect here I'm using a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.270 
really neat effect here I'm using a
roughing<00:01:23.070> gouge<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> true<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
roughing gouge to true this up and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
roughing gouge to true this up and
increasing<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> speed<00:01:26.640> intermittently<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
increasing the speed intermittently to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
increasing the speed intermittently to
keep<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> vibration<00:01:28.920> down<00:01:31.430> once<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.549> blank<00:01:32.790> was

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
keep the vibration down once a blank was

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.819 
keep the vibration down once a blank was
round<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.540> marked<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> key

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
round I marked out some of the key

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.210 
round I marked out some of the key

since<00:01:41.400> my<00:01:41.670> last<00:01:41.909> fear<00:01:42.270> didn't<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.960> well

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
since my last fear didn't go so well

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
since my last fear didn't go so well
I'm<00:01:43.560> really<00:01:44.460> taking<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:44.970> time<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.600> measure

I'm really taking my time to measure
this<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.770> exactly<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.259> used

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this out and get it exactly right I used

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
this out and get it exactly right I used
a<00:01:49.439> parting<00:01:49.860> tool<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.460> set<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.850> thickness<00:01:51.090> of

a parting tool to set the thickness of
what<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.500> spoons<00:01:52.829> handle<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> then

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
what will be the spoons handle and then

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
what will be the spoons handle and then
I<00:01:54.479> got<00:01:54.689> started<00:01:54.990> bringing<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> shape<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
I got started bringing the shape down to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.580 
I got started bringing the shape down to
what<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> want

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
what I want

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.020 
what I want
I'm<00:01:59.590> still<00:01:59.799> learning<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.340> use<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> spindle

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
I'm still learning to use a spindle

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.780 
I'm still learning to use a spindle
gouge<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> tricky<00:02:03.280> spot<00:02:03.549> right

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
gouge and this is a tricky spot right

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.910 
gouge and this is a tricky spot right
here<00:02:03.850> where<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.450> sphere<00:02:04.810> meets<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.320> handle

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
here where the sphere meets the handle

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.910 
here where the sphere meets the handle
I<00:02:06.090> wasn't<00:02:07.090> being<00:02:07.299> careful<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.380> left<00:02:08.709> side

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
I wasn't being careful and the left side

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.490 
I wasn't being careful and the left side
of<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.160> gouge<00:02:09.399> which<00:02:09.849> is<00:02:10.060> unsupported<00:02:11.020> by<00:02:11.200> the

much more comfortable with because I was

little<00:03:10.829> sled<00:03:11.189> for<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.849> honestly<00:03:12.299> I<00:03:12.420> was

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
little sled for this but honestly I was

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.589 
little sled for this but honestly I was
able<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.989> cut<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.379> better<00:03:13.680> just<00:03:13.980> freehand

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
able to cut it better just freehand

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.000 
able to cut it better just freehand
don't<00:03:15.599> do<00:03:15.870> this<00:03:16.079> if<00:03:16.349> you're<00:03:16.439> not<00:03:16.620> comfortable

don't do this if you're not comfortable
with<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.400> though<00:03:17.730> since<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.540> not<00:03:18.780> well

and<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:31.260> smoke<00:03:31.680> which<00:03:31.980> I'm<00:03:32.159> sure<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.790> sign

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
and they smoke which I'm sure is a sign

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.259 
and they smoke which I'm sure is a sign
that<00:03:33.569> something's<00:03:34.140> not<00:03:34.230> set<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.799> right<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.280> need

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that something's not set up right I need

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.059 
that something's not set up right I need
to<00:03:36.450> spend<00:03:36.720> some<00:03:36.870> time<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.500> give<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.829> saw

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
to spend some time and give this saw

to spend some time and give this saw
some<00:03:38.340> TLC<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.980> made<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.129> spoon<00:03:41.489> chuck<00:03:41.819> out<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
some TLC I made the spoon chuck out of

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.470 
some TLC I made the spoon chuck out of
some<00:03:42.420> scrap<00:03:42.569> oak<00:03:43.489> also<00:03:44.489> considered<00:03:45.030> making

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
some scrap oak also considered making

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.390 
some scrap oak also considered making
some<00:03:45.840> custom<00:03:46.319> jaws<00:03:46.560> for<00:03:46.889> my<00:03:47.069> scroll<00:03:47.370> Chuck

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
some custom jaws for my scroll Chuck

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.149 
some custom jaws for my scroll Chuck
that<00:03:48.180> would<00:03:48.329> hold<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.659> spoon<00:03:48.959> but<00:03:49.859> I<00:03:49.889> chose

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
that would hold the spoon but I chose

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.949 
that would hold the spoon but I chose
this<00:03:50.400> type<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.819> design<00:03:51.269> because<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.720> its

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
this type of design because of its

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.460 
this type of design because of its
simplicity<00:03:52.379> I<00:03:53.540> didn't<00:03:54.540> film<00:03:54.810> any<00:03:55.170> of<00:03:55.349> its

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
simplicity I didn't film any of its

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440 
simplicity I didn't film any of its
construction<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.310> it's<00:03:56.459> essentially<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.150> a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
construction but it's essentially just a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.319 
construction but it's essentially just a
bowl<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.379> is<00:03:58.440> sized<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.310> exactly<00:03:59.909> fit<00:04:00.269> the

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
bowl that is sized to exactly fit the

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.960 
bowl that is sized to exactly fit the
spoon<00:04:00.840> with<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> small<00:04:02.069> lip<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.609> inside

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
spoon with a small lip on the inside

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.960 
spoon with a small lip on the inside

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
edge to kind of snap the spoon in and a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.659 
edge to kind of snap the spoon in and a
notch<00:04:06.150> cut<00:04:06.480> out<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.870> handle<00:04:07.639> then<00:04:08.639> I

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
notch cut out for the handle then I

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.250 
notch cut out for the handle then I
cinch<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.359> down<00:04:09.389> with<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> hose<00:04:10.139> clamp<00:04:11.989> now<00:04:12.989> this

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
cinch it down with a hose clamp now this

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.470 
cinch it down with a hose clamp now this
is<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.709> bit<00:04:14.010> scary<00:04:14.310> with<00:04:14.609> the<00:04:14.730> handle<00:04:15.209> flying

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
is a bit scary with the handle flying

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.469 
is a bit scary with the handle flying
around<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.079> barely<00:04:16.440> visible<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:17.209> just<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479
