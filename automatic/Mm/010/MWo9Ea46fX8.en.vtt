00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.140

 we find ourselves for a fairly fast rate 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 since yesterday I could not falsify 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 then you start with 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.450
 download the archived that I put in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.640
 forgotten or if you have floated 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.050
 to watch the video to be able to have 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 the shortcuts I'm going to you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.620
 present 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.059
 So we see the download avoid 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.010
 make is what is good is already 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.180
 finished it's really fast because 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.619
 it's just a file that is seeking 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.130
 tech 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.330
 here I move ok so now you 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.280
 can open record a disc to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
 inside you have that you have a 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 little folder so I would advise you 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 the extract is always more 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.439
 simple and term if the months in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 and of which you have all your 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.180
 tastes your travel orders or so we 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.270
 decide to start with the very first 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.060
 so so the very first order these 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.860
 years on the desk of the host so 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.960
 by simply pressing start 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.829
 the key that I show you on the screen 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.079
 right now 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.149
 this is just you press 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.360
 second shortcut consisting of everything 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.590
 simply to belittle all 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.399
 windows to display the desktop 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.079
 himself 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.060

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.070
 on the start key plus the key 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.700

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.940
 fourth commune and one does not touch 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.880
 consists of bex rocked for example from 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.730
 very simple keys alt tab 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.360
 so I can go to downloads 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.220

 combination is to display its 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.600
 justice and by a combination of 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.040

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.630
 it is displayed 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.540
 this is the 6th combination consists of 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.120
 show the 20th configuration panel 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.340
 there we can manage all the tools of 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.090
 windows with our keyboard so we 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.100
 press marshes +6 you can 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.830

 example the office on the side of this 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.920
 way like this or any 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.230
 application like those like this where 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 no matter how with the keys of the 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.450
 keyboard so for the beginning you have to 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.780
 call on start over the points and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.459
 after guiding you with the arrows up 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.380
 put them in the places you 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.900
 wish to set to delete it 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.900

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.110
 the eighth shortcut is low and 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.180
 well to save a screenshot 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.390
 which will be in the image folder 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.850
 so you just have to get started and 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.190
 printed crampons hop you could see 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.540
 a little the objective to show up and have everything 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.440
 right away went get the catch 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:07.350
 images and screenshots and there 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.320
 you see it appear here the second 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.480
 shortcut is to display the bar 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.430
 execution so by pressing the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.630
 Dr. Marsh more wella little butter 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.880
 happens and you can score any 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:24.210
 what are we going to block 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:31.080
 orders to these defendants percent 100 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:33.420
 and presto it's here you're the record 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.860
 the pink and the 12th are about the same 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.080
 so I will present them at the same 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:41.130
 time so they serve for the first to 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.180
 toggle a window on the coast 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.250
 which for example take it on 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.620
 notepad up yolande and on the left 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.630
 the same thing in house right so in 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.460
 taking marsh over arrows on 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.280
 the right 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:56.460
 to lower it reduce the m 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.320
 here so it's starting over the chamba 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:03.360
 and for the rise of marshes more 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:06.000
 arrow and after we can click on it 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.850
 and to display it in big start 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.470
 more up arrow here is the 13th 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.030
 is to open an application to 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.340
 really looking in all our 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.560
 applications whose confident on alt and that 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.380
 we can mark searched for example 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.430
 adobe and there we will come across the products 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.470
 to others I have a style 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.389
 like the 13th and the 14th on your part and 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.159
 I will present them at the same time 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.870
 so the 13th is to make a 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.900
 search whose files by pressing 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.629
 on swamps and heads up and one can 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.860
 search for example the image we are going 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:46.909
 search and there for example I was marking 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:50.050
 anytime I scored kiko here 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:53.870
 and when he will come across all the icons 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.840
 files that echo that I've got 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.400
 is the fourteenth is to display at 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.430
 search in the settings so in 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:07.490
 pressing marsh and w and so there 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:09.819
 we could mark it here but 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.620
 do their harp double roots 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:17.919
 I will introduce you to the last two 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.449
 so we will start by opening the 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:24.110
 windows billboard so we have 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:28.190
 could see it all that we 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:31.880
 will manage the pc and the last 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.050
 it's good I have friends there the thing that 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.029
 I never understood what it was 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.740
 can handle the display of the second screen 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:38.479
 so I think if pardon you have a 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.150
 smartphone next to it if you sync 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:44.719
 you will have twice the microphone that 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.969
 so pressing on swamps peace 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:50.409
 that's it and so is chronically 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:54.560
 duplicate and tender second screen 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.599
 on this I tell you to the next will have 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.900
 a new tutorial template or I do not know 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.120

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.840
 go ciao everyone pass a 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.840
