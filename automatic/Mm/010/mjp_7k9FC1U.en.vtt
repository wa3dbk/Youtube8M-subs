00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:22.600
 muse of the day and astrubal at the game more 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.320
 known as the word and I am 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.670
 creative brand beautiful basin after 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.340
 a passage in the masculine 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:35.109
 Bobo decides to set his sights on the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.370
 styling part of the fact that at the office at 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.050
 every time I get dressed and people 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.239
 were interested in what I was wearing 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.969
 to structure the bay how did you do 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.640
 that and suddenly it came like that and 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.440
 as my mother has a shop of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.289
 stylists too so I was doing some 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.929
 little crafts I took my dresses 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.909
 to change a little bit I had told myself for 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.190
 accessorize a bit and go from 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.260
 the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.079
 it has its mark which makes it possible to value 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.120
 the African and Senegalese woman in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.060
 particular 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.850
 the philosophy of the brand is rather 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.310
 create a chic to Senegalese like 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 as I read the book of ines of the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.310
 Fressange who was Chanel's muse 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.320
 so who spoke of chic Parisian 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.229
 and I thought to myself and why not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.810
 the chic to the Senegalese use our 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.119
 local fabrics to create clothes 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.540
 much more modern and more correct 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.729
 because I want the image of the woman 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.479
 ok well dressed super class and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.759
 chic 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.100
 the nickname beaubourg does not come up etc 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.039

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.800

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.649

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.119
 complicated is one of my oaths of 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.130

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.780

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.130
