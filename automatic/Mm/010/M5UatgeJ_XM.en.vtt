a 20 mile radius of where it will hit

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.790 
a 20 mile radius of where it will hit
and<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.830> believe<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.490> hit<00:02:23.610> Baghdad

are<00:03:57.209> much<00:03:57.660> greater<00:03:58.049> than<00:03:58.320> you<00:03:58.440> might<00:03:58.650> at<00:03:58.890> first

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
think Daniel was told to seal the book

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.060 
think Daniel was told to seal the book
even<00:04:02.580> to<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> time<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.750> end<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.920> know

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
even to the time of the end so we know

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.039 
even to the time of the end so we know
the<00:04:05.220> Book<00:04:05.370> of<00:04:05.519> Daniel<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.090> revelation<00:04:06.360> will

the Book of Daniel and revelation will

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.620 
the Book of Daniel and revelation will
be<00:04:07.200> revealed<00:04:07.980> near<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.730> end<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.360> can<00:04:09.540> be

be revealed near the end and you can be

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.410 
be revealed near the end and you can be
a<00:04:09.660> part<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.230> by<00:04:10.380> sharing<00:04:10.829> this<00:04:10.920> information
