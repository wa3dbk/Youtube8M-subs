00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.530

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:40.090
 almost there to live through from this just 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:44.649

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.130
 marinating prawns in that curry with that 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.369
 oil is that little bit of liquid 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.189
 reviews had 5 minutes I had standing too 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.649

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.749
 curries quite spicy how tastiest 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.009

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.740
 a little more million at still how does this make 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.960
 actually when i put this on together 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.880
