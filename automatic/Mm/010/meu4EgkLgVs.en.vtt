world and the manuscripts began to be

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
world and the manuscripts began to be
copied<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.890> copied<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.310> copied<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.970> know

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
copied and copied and copied as we know

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
copied and copied and copied as we know
for<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> first<00:01:54.630> about<00:01:54.899> 300<00:01:55.350> years<00:01:55.759> wasn't<00:01:56.759> a

for the first about 300 years wasn't a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
for the first about 300 years wasn't a
real<00:01:57.000> safe<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.689> Christian<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.320> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
real safe thing to be a Christian and so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.380 
real safe thing to be a Christian and so
sometimes<00:01:59.219> some<00:01:59.759> manuscripts<00:02:00.090> were

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
sometimes some manuscripts were

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.940 
sometimes some manuscripts were
destroyed<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> Romans<00:02:01.409> would<00:02:01.560> find<00:02:01.799> a

body<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.310> believers<00:02:02.340> during<00:02:02.909> those<00:02:03.119> periods

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
body of believers during those periods

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.120 
body of believers during those periods
of<00:02:03.600> persecution<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:04.890> forth

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
of persecution and so on and so forth

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160

but<00:02:05.280> eventually<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.390> became<00:02:06.750> legal<00:02:06.930> to

but eventually when it became legal to
be<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> Christian<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> text<00:02:08.789> could<00:02:08.940> be

be a Christian then the text could be

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
be a Christian then the text could be
copied<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.720> more<00:02:09.899> open<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.649> more

professional way

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.800 
professional way
and<00:02:12.580> many<00:02:12.820> of<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.090> differences<00:02:13.540> we'll<00:02:13.720> be

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and many of the differences we'll be

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.630 
and many of the differences we'll be
discussing<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.500> rise<00:02:14.710> in<00:02:14.950> those<00:02:15.040> first<00:02:15.310> few

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
discussing a rise in those first few

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.880 
discussing a rise in those first few
years<00:02:15.700> but<00:02:16.690> what<00:02:16.810> took<00:02:16.990> place<00:02:17.050> over<00:02:17.470> time<00:02:17.680> has

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
years but what took place over time has

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.160 
years but what took place over time has
eventually<00:02:18.190> noose<00:02:18.760> new<00:02:19.240> types<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.690> materials

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
eventually noose new types of materials

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.040 
eventually noose new types of materials
to<00:02:20.230> be<00:02:20.320> used<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.650> lasted<00:02:21.400> longer<00:02:22.050> vellum

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
to be used that lasted longer vellum

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.170 
to be used that lasted longer vellum
began<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.650> used<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.190> even<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.820> script

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
began to be used and even the script

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.450 
began to be used and even the script
that<00:02:25.240> was<00:02:25.420> used<00:02:25.660> began<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.170> change<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.830> then

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
that was used began to change and then

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.030 
that was used began to change and then
over<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.150> period<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.660> history<00:02:29.140> starting
