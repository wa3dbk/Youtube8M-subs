ok<00:00:04.350> today<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:05.070> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.520> plate<00:00:05.760> some

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
ok today we're going to plate some

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.600 
ok today we're going to plate some
sample<00:00:07.050> orthodontic<00:00:08.270> brackets<00:00:09.270> and<00:00:10.610> using

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
nickel strike as an activator and it'll

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
nickel strike as an activator and it'll
be<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> three-step<00:00:21.869> process<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.770> we<00:00:23.010> begin

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
be a three-step process where we begin

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.960 
be a three-step process where we begin
by<00:00:24.410> electro<00:00:25.410> cleaning<00:00:25.770> the<00:00:25.890> surface<00:00:26.070> which

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
by electro cleaning the surface which

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.269 
by electro cleaning the surface which
cleans<00:00:27.869> any<00:00:28.140> material<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.890> makes<00:00:29.100> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
cleans any material and makes the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.060 
cleans any material and makes the
surface<00:00:29.640> hydrophilic<00:00:30.000> or<00:00:30.539> wet<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.320> then

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
surface hydrophilic or wet out and then

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.689 
surface hydrophilic or wet out and then
we'll<00:00:32.220> go<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.519> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.850> woods<00:00:33.809> nickel<00:00:34.260> strike

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
we'll go on to the woods nickel strike

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.240 
we'll go on to the woods nickel strike
that<00:00:35.699> we've<00:00:35.909> set<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> bagged<00:00:37.559> nickel

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that we've set up with a bagged nickel

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.210 
that we've set up with a bagged nickel
anode<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.909> the<00:00:39.720> final<00:00:40.080> step<00:00:40.320> will<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.650> plating

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
anode and the final step will be plating

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.860 
anode and the final step will be plating
in<00:00:41.519> the<00:00:41.820> 24<00:00:42.390> karat<00:00:42.949> bright<00:00:43.949> gold<00:00:44.280> solution<00:00:44.909> now

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
in the 24 karat bright gold solution now

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.590 
in the 24 karat bright gold solution now
we've<00:00:46.049> got<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.409> temperature<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:47.390> right<00:00:48.390> about

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
we've got the temperature is right about

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.829 
we've got the temperature is right about
a<00:00:48.659> hundred<00:00:49.019> degrees<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.650> is<00:00:49.830> correct<00:00:50.220> and

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
a hundred degrees which is correct and

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.350 
a hundred degrees which is correct and
so<00:00:52.040> we're<00:00:53.040> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> begin<00:00:53.400> we'll<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.180> drop

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
so we're going to begin we'll just drop

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
so we're going to begin we'll just drop
the<00:00:54.570> part<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.320> woods<00:00:55.589> nickel<00:00:55.979> strike

the part into the woods nickel strike

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.789 
the part into the woods nickel strike
first<00:00:57.299> electro<00:00:58.080> clean<00:00:58.290> first<00:00:58.530> does<00:00:58.680> the

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
first electro clean first does the

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:02.600 
first electro clean first does the
electric<00:00:59.129> flame<00:00:59.339> first<00:00:59.670> yeah<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.460> we'll

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
electric flame first yeah and we'll

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.830 
electric flame first yeah and we'll
leave<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:02.970> in<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.330> for<00:01:03.390> probably<00:01:05.420> 15<00:01:06.420> 20

we're<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.420> into<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> woods<00:01:34.560> nickel

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
we're going to go into the woods nickel

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.399 
we're going to go into the woods nickel
strike<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:36.270> going<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.719> do<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.109> for

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
strike and I'm going to do that for

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.700 
strike and I'm going to do that for
probably<00:01:38.329> 10<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> 15<00:01:39.899> seconds<00:01:40.350> also<00:01:42.530> what<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
probably 10 to 15 seconds also what this

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.529 
probably 10 to 15 seconds also what this
does<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.100> ensures<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.850> adhesion<00:01:45.359> will

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
does is ensures that the adhesion will

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.440 
does is ensures that the adhesion will
be<00:01:45.689> good<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> dole<00:01:47.119> okay<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.299> we'll

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
be good with the dole okay now we'll

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.880 
be good with the dole okay now we'll
rinse<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.189> we'll<00:01:50.340> go<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.880> final

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
rinse and then we'll go into a final

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.399 
rinse and then we'll go into a final
distilled<00:01:52.890> water<00:01:53.100> rinse<00:01:53.929> and<00:01:54.929> then<00:01:55.109> we'll<00:01:55.259> go

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
distilled water rinse and then we'll go

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.819 
distilled water rinse and then we'll go
into<00:01:55.590> our<00:01:57.020> wrangled<00:01:58.020> solution

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
into our wrangled solution

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.749 
into our wrangled solution
I<00:01:59.840> need<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> adjust<00:02:01.319> the<00:02:01.469> voltage<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.130> about

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
I need to adjust the voltage up to about

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.030 
bit make sure the fresh solution is down
on<00:02:37.450> all<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.900> nooks<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.319> crannies<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
on all the nooks and crannies and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.210 
on all the nooks and crannies and
actually<00:02:39.730> I'm<00:02:39.849> going<00:02:39.970> to<00:02:40.090> pick<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.420> part<00:02:40.690> up

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
actually I'm going to pick the part up

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.440 
actually I'm going to pick the part up
take<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.250> quick<00:02:42.519> look<00:02:42.670> at<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.269> turn<00:02:43.420> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
take a quick look at it and turn it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.470 
take a quick look at it and turn it
around<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> expose<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.700> other<00:02:45.850> side<00:02:46.180> to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
around just to expose the other side to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.000 
around just to expose the other side to
the<00:02:46.600> anode<00:02:46.989> then<00:02:47.170> we'll<00:02:47.350> let<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.530> run<00:02:47.769> for

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
the anode then we'll let it run for

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.350 
the anode then we'll let it run for
another<00:02:48.100> couple<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.090> minutes<00:02:50.970> okay<00:02:51.970> now<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
another couple of minutes okay now the

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.729 
another couple of minutes okay now the
plating<00:02:52.750> that's<00:02:52.870> been<00:02:53.019> going<00:02:53.319> on<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.680> about

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
plating that's been going on for about

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.580 
plating that's been going on for about
four<00:02:54.130> minutes<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.900> important<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.440> note

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
four minutes and it's important to note

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.160 
four minutes and it's important to note
here<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:56.890> this<00:02:57.670> ship<00:02:57.910> plate<00:02:58.209> about<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.600> half<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
here that this ship plate about a half a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.340 
here that this ship plate about a half a
micron<00:02:59.940> which<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> normal<00:03:01.569> jewelry<00:03:02.110> great

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
micron which is a normal jewelry great

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.070 
micron which is a normal jewelry great
thickness<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.010> gold<00:03:03.280> however<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:04.600> want<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
thickness of gold however if you want it

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.320 
thickness of gold however if you want it
to<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.319> thicker<00:03:05.620> for<00:03:06.130> more<00:03:06.489> durability<00:03:06.910> or

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
to be thicker for more durability or

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.530 
to be thicker for more durability or
longer-lasting<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.620> could<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:10.360> could

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
longer-lasting you could you could

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.590 
longer-lasting you could you could
actually<00:03:10.720> plate<00:03:11.640> twice<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.850> long<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.360> get

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
actually plate twice as long and get

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.259 
actually plate twice as long and get
twice<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.870> thickness<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.640> cost<00:03:15.880> would

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
twice the thickness and the cost would

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.530 
twice the thickness and the cost would
not<00:03:16.510> be<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:17.769> significant<00:03:18.609> on<00:03:18.730> parts<00:03:19.090> this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
not be that significant on parts this

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.180 
not be that significant on parts this
tiny<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:21.519> I<00:03:21.630> I<00:03:22.630> don't<00:03:23.530> know<00:03:23.650> if<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.829> can<00:03:23.980> tell

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
tiny so I I don't know if you can tell

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.240 
tiny so I I don't know if you can tell
them<00:03:24.400> out<00:03:24.549> if<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.739> parts<00:03:26.739> play<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:27.070> worked

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
them out if the parts play that worked

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.280 
them out if the parts play that worked
very<00:03:27.549> well<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.090> in<00:03:28.390> rocking<00:03:28.750> these<00:03:28.900> parts

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
very well and in rocking these parts

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.800 
very well and in rocking these parts
what<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.500> did<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.359> parts<00:03:31.630> had

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
what I did was some of the parts had

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.870 
what I did was some of the parts had
through<00:03:32.109> holes<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.070> threaded<00:03:33.700> them

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
through holes and so I threaded them

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.720 
through holes and so I threaded them
onto<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.269> fine<00:03:34.630> copper<00:03:35.079> wire<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:36.280> then<00:03:36.400> two<00:03:36.609> of

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
onto a fine copper wire and then two of

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.849 
onto a fine copper wire and then two of
the<00:03:36.820> parts<00:03:37.180> did<00:03:37.720> not<00:03:37.900> have<00:03:38.140> any<00:03:38.350> holes<00:03:38.620> that

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
the parts did not have any holes that

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.449 
the parts did not have any holes that
they<00:03:39.130> did<00:03:39.310> have<00:03:39.489> protruding<00:03:40.739> parts<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:41.980> so

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
they did have protruding parts and so

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.550 
they did have protruding parts and so
what<00:03:42.609> I<00:03:42.640> did<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.150> tied<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> loop<00:03:44.019> in<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.350> wire

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
what I did is I tied a loop in the wire

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.970 
what I did is I tied a loop in the wire
an<00:03:45.549> overhand<00:03:46.000> knot<00:03:46.120> and<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.799> looped<00:03:47.799> it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
an overhand knot and just looped it

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.039 
an overhand knot and just looped it
around<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.459> part<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:49.660> way<00:03:49.840> they're

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
around the part that way they're

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.349 
around the part that way they're
attached<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.650> copper<00:03:50.920> wire<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:52.120> now<00:03:52.299> that

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
attached to the copper wire so now that

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.780 
attached to the copper wire so now that
we're<00:03:52.720> done<00:03:52.900> I'll<00:03:53.230> go<00:03:53.799> ahead<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.280> cut<00:03:54.640> the

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
we're done I'll go ahead and cut the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.130 
we're done I'll go ahead and cut the
parts<00:03:55.120> off<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.519> wire<00:03:57.760> will<00:03:58.359> clean<00:03:59.019> them

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
parts off the the wire will clean them

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.530 
parts off the the wire will clean them
and<00:03:59.350> dry<00:03:59.590> them<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.040> what<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.120> only<00:04:01.359> thing

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
and dry them and what the only thing

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.170 
and dry them and what the only thing
remaining<00:04:01.900> will<00:04:02.170> be<00:04:02.380> a<00:04:02.700> 24<00:04:03.700> karat<00:04:04.030> gold

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
remaining will be a 24 karat gold

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.989 
remaining will be a 24 karat gold
deposit
