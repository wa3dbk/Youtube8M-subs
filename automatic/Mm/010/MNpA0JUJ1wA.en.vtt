Council<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.909> sorts<00:01:50.270> are<00:01:50.390> not<00:01:50.600> mistaken

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
Council of sorts are not mistaken

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.980 
Council of sorts are not mistaken
because<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:52.190> was<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:52.790> preview<00:01:53.390> prior<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
because this was a a preview prior to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.840 
because this was a a preview prior to

the Protestant Reformation there was

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.180 
the Protestant Reformation there was
some<00:01:56.360> predecessors<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:58.010> think

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
some predecessors to that and I think

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.190 
some predecessors to that and I think
John<00:01:58.430> hosts<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:58.940> I've<00:01:59.060> got<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.360> name<00:01:59.510> right<00:01:59.659> in

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
John hosts if I've got the name right in

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
reckon the church is universal and and

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.790 
reckon the church is universal and and
Fatima<00:04:22.539> is<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.660> message<00:04:23.229> for<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.380> universal

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800

Church<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.700> think<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.060> is<00:04:25.180> what's<00:04:25.389> but

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
Church and so I think this is what's but

Protestant<00:05:42.190> practice<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.910> fact<00:05:43.090> as<00:05:43.570> you<00:05:43.720> know

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
Protestant practice in fact as you know

Protestant practice in fact as you know
John<00:05:44.110> christened<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:45.100> whole<00:05:45.220> idea<00:05:45.460> of

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
John christened the whole idea of

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.610 
John christened the whole idea of
community<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.880> hand<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.320> present<00:05:47.320> practice

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
community the hand is a present practice

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.290 
community the hand is a present practice
and<00:05:47.950> of<00:05:48.250> course<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.520> product<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:48.940> process<00:05:49.180> and

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
and of course the product of process and

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.409 
and of course the product of process and
practice<00:05:49.419> arranged<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.680> order<00:05:50.919> to<00:05:51.070> change<00:05:51.669> the

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
practice arranged in order to change the

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.719 
practice arranged in order to change the
faith<00:05:52.660> so<00:05:53.320> and<00:05:53.620> that's<00:05:53.770> because<00:05:54.130> there's<00:05:54.550> been

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
faith so and that's because there's been

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.570 
faith so and that's because there's been
this<00:05:54.910> historical<00:05:55.900> context<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:57.250> in<00:05:57.430> the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
this historical context in the in the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.360 
this historical context in the in the
west<00:05:57.760> of<00:05:58.030> John<00:05:58.990> Jose<00:05:59.229> whatnot<00:05:59.650> that's<00:06:00.130> why<00:06:00.310> the

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
west of John Jose whatnot that's why the

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.250 
west of John Jose whatnot that's why the
discipline<00:06:00.820> has<00:06:00.940> to<00:06:01.060> be<00:06:01.150> maintained<00:06:01.630> so<00:06:01.900> we

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
discipline has to be maintained so we

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.110 
discipline has to be maintained so we
don't<00:06:02.440> have<00:06:02.590> Protestant<00:06:03.039> ideas<00:06:03.130> about<00:06:03.910> there

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120
