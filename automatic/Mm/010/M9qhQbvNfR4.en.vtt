 Honeywood channel you think you know everything 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.590
 about tree doubts so this is a cycle 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.720
 gears will highlight those types of wood that 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.789
 grow and our territory namely 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:33.140
 middle strip Russia Ukraine and 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:35.840
 Belarus today I want to tell you about 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.149
 apple tree apple tree is the most 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.930
 popular fruit tree of the world is the birthplace and 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.210
 growth 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.230
 Kazakhstan is considered today but today 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.079
 village on any edge of the forest and in any 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.329
 kolkhoz garden you can meet a few 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.700
 and intricate but quite interesting 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.700
 trees namely for us carvers 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.140
 the apple tree is just beautiful and not 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.640
 crucified talk about strength and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.160
 wear resistance of other things 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.440
 she's just beautiful more beautiful tree because 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.650
 the most accessible is very difficult to find 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.740
 she has a huge amount 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.090
 iridescent shades from white to white 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.780
 practically milky 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.970
 until light dark dark red-brown 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.119
 there are places with transitions and even 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.310
 small product can be placed 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.050
 a huge range of beautiful flowers 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.050
 play and paint 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.290
 here is apple wood at cross 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.230
 sawing 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.760
 this video is split as 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.690
 my log cracked practically on 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.690
 meter along 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:08.229
 you can easily notice sap 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.960
 it is a whiter wood amulet from it 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.320
 You now see on the screen, but the sound 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.240
 part 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.870
 amulet where the sound part is used and 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.260
 for the blind too now on your screen 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 as you can see 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.690
 wood has a bit of cream 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.660
 this log lay in my garage 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.480
 more than two years but with fresh you slept 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.900
 You see that this part is bright white and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.470
 it's dark brown here the transition is more 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.580
 smooth and there are places where the transition 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.489
 very sharp worth remembering that the apple tree 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.739
 very cracks so be 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.890
 ready that over a third of the material can 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.170
 go to the expense here you see here 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.769
 crack 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.769
 more than 20 centimeters crack here more 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:09.660
 20 centimeters although the tree began 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:13.630
 dry in the fall not in hot weather 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 I'll show you the planks from now 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.799
 apple trees and these are my usual blanks for 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.200
 making amulets here you can 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.820
 see it 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:30.250
 planochka apologize for the balloon 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.400
 burnt plot circular saw you 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:37.030
 see wood 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 cream white with stains of dark 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.769
 plots here precisely because of such 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:48.370
 the plot obtained such amulets that 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:51.060
 now you have the white part on the screen 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.060
 sapwood 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.100
 bitches almost always crack 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.820
 so do not count on using them 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.700
 in making yes they are beautiful but 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.630
 almost always they crack but 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.490
 smoother transition plan 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:11.890
 see here the sound part goes over 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.870
 sap but not dramatically since here 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.720
 see the sapwood sound cutting part 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.660
 very transition amulets with such a transition 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.739
 now on your screen and here more 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.050
 smooth transition 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.630
 see the core is replaced by sapwood start 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.700
 dark brown sweat dark cream 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.440
 then brighter and now if there was 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.570
 continued then you saw a smooth 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.310
 transition to such a state amulet with 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.160
 this transition is also now on your 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.610
 here you can see the screen 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:55.520
 sound part 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:58.010
 and this is already sapwood but because of the smoothness 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.100
 transition is almost impossible to distinguish 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:05.860
 Where 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.860
 the central part of the tree and where are its edges 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.169
 I really like the place where they are combined 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.000
 sharply in himself 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:19.760
 dark brown and light cream you see 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.740
 This line is a bright difference between 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.600
 two sections of the tree is very beautiful 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.820
 amulets are obtained from them here is one of 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.479
 You can also have them on the screen now. 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.150
 find areas where this transition is not one 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:37.340
 the line is about zigzag 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.780
 here's the amulet on your screen now 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:45.919
 it was also on one plot with 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.320
 such a transition here is a crack which 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:53.210
 almost always present therefore 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:57.260
 do not be upset here I showed you 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.360
 basic three types 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.760
 doses of points that can be obtained from 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.580
 apple wood 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:09.470
 light white or light cream 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:13.099
 color is sapwood a smooth transition from 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.909
 central part on the edges of the tree and 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:18.680
 abrupt transition and the other part in sapwood 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:24.590
 these are the most interesting for us 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:27.469
 three kinds I hope you enjoyed this 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.960
