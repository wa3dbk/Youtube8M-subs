00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
solid or liquid kind of depending on the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269 
solid or liquid kind of depending on the
temperature<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.570> does<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> very<00:00:28.710> very<00:00:28.980> low

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
temperature it does have a very very low

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.490 
temperature it does have a very very low
melting<00:00:29.640> temperature<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.600> for<00:00:30.930> instance<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
melting temperature so for instance I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
melting temperature so for instance I
