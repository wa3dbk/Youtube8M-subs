00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.200
 so we finished decorating the points 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.630
 and now we need 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.720
 decide 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.469
 Centre 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:10.269
 as valuable halls 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 such bad access 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.829
 and sew 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.619
 it is necessary 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.609
 cut off the necessary amount of jewelry 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.979
 strange 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.220
 for our area 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 without fail 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 further moment begins to collect 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.630
 for this we need 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 Petersburg 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.670
 in a hat for them 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 fittings 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.260
 funny metal items 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.930
 so on 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.820
 which months 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 the amount of five pieces 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 so maybe all these elements are decided 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.860
 bead 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.910
 and now we start 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.150
 yes or no one but first you need 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.370
 fix we take the data 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.380
 rather big iron beads 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.380
 we put on weekly installations 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.820
 fixed to life 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 dudukina since the use of lagos 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.180
 pressing down 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 thus fix 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.890
 I personally do not envy him 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.840
 so now we are to them 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.260
 but did one part boost 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.790
 Now we need to attach the lock but 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.210
 This model take a day 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.210
 now it is a lock 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.599
 and fixed 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.599
 but it is not clear that he is a make-up artist 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.279
 non-audit assets 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.279
 child 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.299
 dunk fixed 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.779
 in the same way oulu 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.709
 ending with the second part of our 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.709
 state 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.229
 because we have Kotov feed bridge era 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.589
 dead mosgortrans 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.620
 Obama 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.109
 weight 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:55.729
