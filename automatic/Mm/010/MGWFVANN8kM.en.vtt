so<00:00:47.630> this<00:00:48.630> was<00:00:48.840> one<00:00:49.079> move<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.880> kind<00:00:50.880> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so this was one move that I kind of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.610 
so this was one move that I kind of
wondered<00:00:51.239> about<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.600> seemed<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.050> natural<00:00:52.290> to

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
wondered about it seemed very natural to

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.090 
wondered about it seemed very natural to
me<00:00:52.649> didn't<00:00:53.010> move<00:00:53.130> the<00:00:53.309> Bishop<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> c5<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.100> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
me didn't move the Bishop to c5 and that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340 
me didn't move the Bishop to c5 and that
could<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:56.640> well<00:00:56.700> be<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.059> fine<00:00:57.450> move<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:58.140> I

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
could very well be a fine move but I

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
could very well be a fine move but I
guess<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> reason<00:00:59.550> to<00:01:00.000> want<00:01:00.360> to<00:01:00.540> tuck<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
guess the reason to want to tuck the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.660 
guess the reason to want to tuck the
bishop<00:01:01.260> all<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.520> watch

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
bishop all the way back here is to watch

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.969 
bishop all the way back here is to watch
over<00:01:02.910> these<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:04.019> watch<00:01:04.170> over<00:01:04.290> both<00:01:04.559> dark

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
over these to watch over both dark

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.330 
over these to watch over both dark
squares<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.670> one<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> avoid<00:01:07.979> an

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
squares for one and also to avoid an

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.419 
squares for one and also to avoid an
eventual<00:01:09.170> tempo<00:01:10.170> gaining<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:10.709> against<00:01:11.219> the

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
eventual tempo gaining move against the

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.300 
eventual tempo gaining move against the
bishop<00:01:11.780> notice<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:12.959> by<00:01:13.200> playing<00:01:13.469> to<00:01:13.619> c5<00:01:14.009> sure

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
bishop notice that by playing to c5 sure

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
bishop notice that by playing to c5 sure
you're<00:01:14.490> hitting<00:01:14.639> the<00:01:14.850> Queen<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.600> at<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you're hitting the Queen but up at the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.190 
you're hitting the Queen but up at the
end<00:01:16.709> of<00:01:16.829> it<00:01:17.329> what<00:01:18.329> do<00:01:18.389> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.659> white<00:01:18.990> will

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
end of it what do we have white will

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.139 
end of it what do we have white will
eventually<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.979> able<00:01:20.069> to<00:01:20.219> gain<00:01:20.429> a<00:01:20.459> tempo<00:01:20.909> back

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
eventually be able to gain a tempo back

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.649 
eventually be able to gain a tempo back
against<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> bishop<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.709> Knight<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> e4<00:01:23.659> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
against the bishop with Knight to e4 so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
against the bishop with Knight to e4 so
I<00:01:24.719> believe<00:01:25.049> he's<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:26.340> dropping<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.029> way

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
I believe he's just dropping all the way

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.989 
I believe he's just dropping all the way
back<00:01:27.359> for<00:01:27.779> that<00:01:28.560> reason<00:01:28.979> watch<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.459> for

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:29.999 
back for that reason watch over for

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:31.339 
back for that reason watch over for
those<00:01:30.119> two<00:01:30.329> reasons<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> watch<00:01:30.959> over<00:01:31.139> these

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:31.349 
those two reasons to watch over these

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:33.830 
those two reasons to watch over these
two<00:01:31.759> squares<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.849> the<00:01:33.060> pawn<00:01:33.270> watches<00:01:33.689> over

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
two squares that the pawn watches over

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.779 
two squares that the pawn watches over
and<00:01:34.200> avoid<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.529> potential<00:01:35.159> temple<00:01:35.520> gaining

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789

this<00:02:34.290> slight<00:02:34.680> space<00:02:34.980> advantage<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.700> having

bishops having them on dark squares this
is<00:02:44.700> not<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> variation<00:02:45.570> we<00:02:45.720> went<00:02:46.010> into<00:02:47.239> instead

could be giving but I don't know if you

opening up of the G file this is not the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
easiest to maybe calculate the Queen can

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.710 
easiest to maybe calculate the Queen can
grab<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.590> pawn<00:03:34.829> for<00:03:35.130> one<00:03:35.340> you<00:03:36.090> can<00:03:36.239> also<00:03:36.390> grab

this rook but maybe it's still well not

this rook but maybe it's still well not
in<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.680> position<00:03:40.910> maybe<00:03:41.910> at<00:03:42.180> this<00:03:42.390> point
