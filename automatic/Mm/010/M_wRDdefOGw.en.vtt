00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.769
 making a drawing will be very few 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.349
 things paper sheets obviously and 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.619
 felt- tip pens we will start with the bic 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.630
 I accept the bit but you can choose 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.310
 paternity has also begun to do 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.500
 the model attention this is one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.500
 lesson for making a fish 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.620
 somewhere else 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.920
 and this is my project and no 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.770
 said let's continue with a colored pen 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.680

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 then you can choose any other 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:11.860
 we continue redone we do here is i 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 vines has obviously improved from con 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.840
 the sky go by red felt-tip pen 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.750
 we trace the whole mouth and above 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:33.790
 eyes a little all over the pen 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:37.479
 green and echo the result at the end 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:43.690
 we use dark green on fish it is then 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:46.440
 we have other things to do and we do 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.440
 that the bordeaux 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.509
 now we will have a tricolor fish but 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.420
 now a year and we need blue and with 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:02.840
 the blue we do all the things we do 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.220
 we lack the skin of the fish 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.289
 sugar then we make lines with all the 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:20.989
 then we used markers 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:24.880
 dark blue gresini red 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.880
 and here is the result that will come 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.190
 always in the same way now changing 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.030
 a bit sequence of colors you had them 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:41.030
 got that too so we have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.720
 two good signs though we were useful 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.720
 and affection
