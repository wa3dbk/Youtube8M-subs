00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello here is one of giga I am 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.320
 here in london at the lg event where lg 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 just the new flagship the lg 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.410
 has presented after I have the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.360
 possibility had a short sensors too 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.039
 I wanted to do that to the device 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 now in direct comparison to the HTC 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.949
 look at 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.460
 the first thing I might do here 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.039
 striking is the lg and htc whole 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 apparently a similar material 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 have set 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.649
 because both shine in one wonderful 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.480
 metallic luster 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.980
 However, you have to say that it is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.270
 Above all , there is a difference 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 then you notice the two devices in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.730
 the upper hand while the had in fact 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.350
 actually mainly made of metal 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.500
 managed naturally know except the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.980
 display sets lg at gp on one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.289
 combination of polycarbonate plastics 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.969
 and a metal alloy is here so 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.430
 metal in the surface with it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 However, it is plastic 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.710
 covered that is there for one thing 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.600
 so that they lose our and less 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.640
 so fingerprints and stuff does exist 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 also just outside probably 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.820
 pragmatic reasons to receive it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.480
 very good is we have such a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.700
 charging station 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.790
 you just go for a wireless 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.860
 can use recharge and therefore just 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.600
 in the choice to the material here must 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.140
 But I say that it is not like that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.580
 It is easy to judge that it is 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.780
 not pure metal trading, if 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.730
 That's the first time the hand takes 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.080
 you have the feeling that for the first time 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.300
 is definitely something else 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.760
 must be as normal now 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.280
 polycarbonate what ultimately too 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.950
 another difference is that that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 display of the lg also a tick 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.420
 greater than that of the council yuan 8 um 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.020
 To be precise has the m8 1 5 inch large 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.050
 display and the lg are 0 5 inches 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.580
 more so that has a 55 inches 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.560
 big display that's why 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.320
 amazing because the device has become 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 actually so much bigger than 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.289
 the htc on the 8th 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.910
 If you look closely, you will see one of them 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.580
 reasons that the display so much 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.410
 get more space on the one hand has htc 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.720
 down here is this bar at all 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.530
 no function at all except that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 to waste display and also above 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.840
 manages to fly 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.049
 lg save a bit of space and 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 thus giving the display more space on the screen 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.069
 device front to procure 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.170
 But there is a big difference 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.780
 also to be seen in the attachment of the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.560
 loudspeaker who on the ordinary 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.239
 and 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.610
 I would say pretty good sound 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.340
 at least for a smartphone is the 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.319
 is certainly more likely to tap that 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.720
 that is how to proceed with one 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.300
 stereo speakers on the front off 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.040
 and starts here in front 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.320
 Are you giving two speakers 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.670
 attached the sound forward 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.500
 just beaming while gambling maybe 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.490
 listen to music and it's a bit like that 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.800
 stay better 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.950
 elky early it is like many others 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.750
 smartphones again here below 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.420
 relatively small speakers that me 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.440
 was very loud but loud 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.760
 Overall, the sound is then 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.520
 pretty bad and I have to say that 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.760
 So I'm not a lot of that over 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.470
 speaker hears but who is looking for it 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.320
 that was done with the hair test 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.640
 publicly much better advice 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.710
 Another difference, of course, also in 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.650
 she had to find the camera she was holding 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.230
 feast on the four ultra pixels 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.020
 lg puts on a 3 10 megapixel camera 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.570
 big difference is also here too 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.150
 find it is a laser autofocus with 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.730
 The extremely fast built-in sharp 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.310
 make promises when photographing 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 lg has this second one again 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.049
 Lenses built in for such 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.730
 depth of field effects and so stands and 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.530
 there comes to use, however , he has 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.540
 any software moderately resolved and so can 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.130
 you also take very good pictures here 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.280
 the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.110
 yes in the aftermath then again re 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.070
 you can be focused 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.230
 on the background or the foreground 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.460
 otherwise I would say concentrate 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.750
 fallen from both devices the 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.760
 Surface is pretty good here now 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.700
 quite a lot of organic stuff or 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.100
 Asian apps are installed on the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.880
 of course, not European device 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.860
 available 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.350
 but all in all a pretty good one 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.290
 appearance is like that 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.470
 relatively clean and well structured too 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.210
 at the HTC one he makes that the case 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.940
 there you can find your way around well and you 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.640
 also has the feeling with lg too 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.800
 android to stay for the surface 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.270
 is not so totally messed up now 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.130
 That's a bit different from others 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.530
 manufacturers knows the third whole 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.570
 my hand because that's the equipment 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.160
 but charged that I can I 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.600
 Of course not remove because then it works 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.220
 the alarm 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.270
 All in all, if I have the two 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.390
 so much longer in the device 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.400
 keep that simple is just one man 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.020
 notices that it is pure metal pure 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.700
 aluminum is that's pretty cool 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.440
 we have the device here but rather 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.930
 a bit warmer just like the one from 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.750
 All in all, polycarbonate knows everything 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.190
 Two very smart devices too 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.120
 In terms of price you have to be modest 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.180
 Yes 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.590
 because you have to look if a problem 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.229
 actually true that's been called 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.419
 was lg street from the should 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.139
 is about 15 90 euro is still 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.510
 not entirely clear 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.280
 that still has to be treated as calm 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.870
 all further technical details to the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.270
 of course, you will find both devices 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.550
 us on the page in the corresponding 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.880
 article of this video is also to be found 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.710
 on giga.de / android I watch myself 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.540
 now a few other devices in the 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.580
 compared to lt 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.080
 I hope you have this first impression 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.139
 is fallen point goodbye me 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.759
 thus seen at the court 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.009
 on the left side now comes to 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.800
 playlist from the lg dre and on the right 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.360
 page to the test of the htc makes that 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.009
 Breakfast customers with one already several 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.990
 weeks and there is even one 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:56.580
 long-term report you will find then 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.159
 Also here on the playlist there you can 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.629
 you just have to click through 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.129
 From the first impression is the question 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.639
 which one you like better with that 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.349
 normal display or the one with the q hd 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:10.490
 2560 ultra however, write display 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.490
