00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
terabyte one terabyte hard drive that's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.539 
terabyte one terabyte hard drive that's
about<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.939> so<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.600> actually<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> 1.5

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
about it so you can actually get a 1.5

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.710 
about it so you can actually get a 1.5
terabyte<00:01:50.880> hard<00:01:51.570> drive<00:01:51.930> which<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.040> biggest

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
terabyte hard drive which is the biggest

2.5 SATA hard drive that I'm aware of so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.670 
2.5 SATA hard drive that I'm aware of so
you<00:01:57.360> can<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.509> step<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.500> little

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
you can actually step this up a little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.760 
you can actually step this up a little
bit<00:01:58.979> further<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.500> terabyte

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
bit further but this is a one terabyte
