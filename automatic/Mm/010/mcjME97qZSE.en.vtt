00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.650 
from the keyboard as you bummed on it
now<00:03:02.950> why<00:03:03.190> would<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.519> need<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.760> phoned<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.510> it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
now why would you need to phoned on it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.059 
now why would you need to phoned on it
well<00:03:05.530> as<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:06.459> matter<00:03:06.819> of<00:03:06.970> fact<00:03:07.390> my<00:03:08.290> experience

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
well as a matter of fact my experience

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.090 
well as a matter of fact my experience
with<00:03:09.340> it<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.870> sensitivity<00:03:11.380> to

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
with it is that the sensitivity to

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.990 
with it is that the sensitivity to
playing<00:03:12.489> is<00:03:12.880> not<00:03:13.870> as<00:03:15.209> great<00:03:16.209> as<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.829> might

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
playing is not as great as you might

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.630 
playing is not as great as you might
desire<00:03:19.500> even<00:03:20.500> when<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.950> have<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.340> set<00:03:21.609> to

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
desire even when you have it set to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.270 
desire even when you have it set to
light<00:03:22.120> touch<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> that<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.859> would<00:03:24.010> imagine

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
light touch so that you would imagine

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.810 
light touch so that you would imagine
that<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.850> will<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.570> loader<00:03:26.440> sound<00:03:27.010> with

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
that you will get a loader sound with

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.420 
that you will get a loader sound with
less<00:03:28.120> than<00:03:28.390> a<00:03:28.510> pounding<00:03:29.170> effort<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:32.620> range<00:03:32.980> of

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
less than a pounding effort the range of

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.620 
less than a pounding effort the range of
velocity<00:03:34.239> touch<00:03:34.480> between<00:03:34.870> zero<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:36.630> maximum

velocity touch between zero and maximum

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.000 
velocity touch between zero and maximum
volume<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.430> still<00:03:39.430> what<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.239> might<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:41.590> upset

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
volume is still what you might be upset

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.840 
volume is still what you might be upset
with<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.000> what<00:03:43.269> you<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:43.810> should<00:03:44.049> do<00:03:44.850> before

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
with so what you really should do before

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
purchasing one of these babies is to

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.940 
purchasing one of these babies is to
play<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.870> make<00:03:50.079> sure<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.470> you're

a piano feel for much more money and
they<00:04:47.219> would<00:04:47.370> probably<00:04:47.610> be<00:04:47.879> better<00:04:48.180> MIDI

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
they would probably be better MIDI

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.360 
they would probably be better MIDI
controllers<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.319> offer<00:04:49.560> you<00:04:49.830> all<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.219> other

knobs and various other things that you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.649 
knobs and various other things that you
expect<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.289> MIDI<00:05:01.529> controller<00:05:02.449> so<00:05:03.449> the

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
expect in a MIDI controller so the

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.350 
expect in a MIDI controller so the
primary<00:05:04.259> use<00:05:04.949> of<00:05:05.159> this<00:05:05.310> MIDI<00:05:05.580> controller<00:05:06.120> is

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
primary use of this MIDI controller is

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.510 
primary use of this MIDI controller is
just<00:05:06.389> to<00:05:06.750> get<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.139> piano<00:05:07.379> feel<00:05:07.889> when<00:05:08.189> playing

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
just to get that piano feel when playing

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.830 
just to get that piano feel when playing
piano<00:05:08.759> voices<00:05:09.479> but<00:05:10.319> certainly<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:12.360> would<00:05:12.629> not

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
piano voices but certainly it would not

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.719 
piano voices but certainly it would not
fund<00:05:13.169> that<00:05:13.349> it<00:05:13.560> would<00:05:13.740> not<00:05:13.919> function<00:05:14.159> well<00:05:14.550> as

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
fund that it would not function well as

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.459 
fund that it would not function well as
an<00:05:14.879> all<00:05:15.060> room<00:05:15.360> MIDI<00:05:15.599> controller<00:05:16.139> in<00:05:16.409> your

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.409 
studio setup so I had to augment this
with<00:05:21.810> the<00:05:22.999> purchase<00:05:23.999> of<00:05:24.029> the<00:05:24.449> roland<00:05:26.120> 800<00:05:27.120> pro
