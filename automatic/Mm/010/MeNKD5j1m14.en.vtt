you<00:02:43.600> know<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.900> next<00:02:44.140> round<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.709> we<00:02:45.010> just<00:02:45.730> in<00:02:46.090> to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
you know the next round so we just in to

you know the next round so we just in to
win<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.110> good<00:02:47.260> confidence<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:47.860> us<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.130> go

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
into the next step and I think today we

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
into the next step and I think today we
did<00:02:50.560> pretty<00:02:50.770> well<00:02:50.890> considering<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.550> was<00:02:51.670> from

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
did pretty well considering it was from

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.350 
did pretty well considering it was from
a<00:02:52.150> second<00:02:52.690> half<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:54.280> went<00:02:54.730> against<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> wind

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
a second half we went against the wind

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.750 
a second half we went against the wind
but<00:02:55.840> we<00:02:56.230> managed<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> keep<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.980> ball<00:02:57.430> together

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
but we managed to keep the ball together

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.910 
but we managed to keep the ball together
and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:59.140> know<00:02:59.260> managed<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.620> play<00:02:59.770> our<00:02:59.890> game

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
and you know managed to play our game

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.090 
and you know managed to play our game
and<00:03:00.430> score<00:03:01.360> enough<00:03:01.690> with<00:03:02.320> our<00:03:02.350> speed<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.070> I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
and score enough with our speed so I

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.720 
and score enough with our speed so I
think<00:03:03.280> it's<00:03:03.700> a<00:03:03.850> satisfying<00:03:04.360> game<00:03:04.750> overall<00:03:05.730> but

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
think it's a satisfying game overall but

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.790 
think it's a satisfying game overall but
