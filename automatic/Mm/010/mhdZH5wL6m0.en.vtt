00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hello guys 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.420
 We came here to talk about avengers . 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.120
 found the trunk any way you want 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.550
 We already saw it, I know this premiere is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.650
 fifth midnight friday so I'm 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.210
 very confused with the releases 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 lately lower when the cut in 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.800
 but we attended last week 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 in a disney cabin in são paulo 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.619
 Thank God, father, for this 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.510
 and the film is great and I 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.230
 I really liked it here in the movie line of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.280
 heroes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
 I have no doubt that it is one of the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.079
 best in your company and it brings a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 lot of element but it is not confusing 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.700
 Ours brings many people in many 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.399
 characters have many villains have many 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.460
 events is a film the glauber is 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.440
 more global is happen several is not the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 The first avenger was 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440
 battle of new york 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.660
 Are you going to have the battle in South Africa? 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.170
 and will have the battle in korea where 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:06.780
 in color is that the year is not that part of the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.430
 Eastern Europe has but has the part of the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 Eastern Europe which has a base 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.000
 hydra it we will meet two new 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.790
 characters friends bar enemy villains 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.790
 friends and rivals vegas and rivals premise 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.670
 I'm on the same level and the lavender oil ii 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.619
 bar pizza forget scarlet it 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.000
 appeared at the beginning of the film when 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.580
 Avengers are on a mission to 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.460
 find and a street appears on the scene 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.649
 post-credits japan america two 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.750
 but I say in this movie they appear 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.299
 they will attack the basis of the idea that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.820
 they discovered in Europe however the 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.590
 weapons exact hydra and there he actually 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.810
 They are not going there because of the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.240
 neither the pietro nor the band are behind the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.479
 brain of the pack in rescue that was 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.110
 stolen on the previous adventures I 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.270
 I understand how it got there, right? 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 comments that I do not remember but there I 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.890
 I also tried to speak what is 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.280
 because he was still dominating china is 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.959
 Truth I love full screen wall sepe 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.580
 the part that I liked the most when they 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.950
 jump out of the car and get all the players 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.440
 It's really cool there , it's looking at 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.540
 show that we did not have much 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.549
 in fact you have this sensation 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.620
 But when the movie goes by, you see 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.150
 that's not quite right, so the captain 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.250
 America has the leadership flaws 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900
 This movie is cool because the deep 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.220
 much in the characters will show the 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.120
 each one's problem 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.489
 the natasha huc will have something has 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.650
 an end in an atmosphere between them and him 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.690
 also presents a difficulty for 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.600
 characters also have a character 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.609
 new that the vision is that the vision too 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.650
 good and enjoyed his entry in the series is 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.650
 quite different from his origin at the start 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:09.170
 in history holds you enjoyed the arrival 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:10.430
 of summer the universe marvel with second 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.430
 intentions 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.410
 I think it's cool, I thought you stayed in 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.850
 with this marvel universe does not 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.650
 you can reproduce everything that is in us 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.780
 comics she will do all faithful 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.160
 because they also have no right to everything 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.900
 exactly divided between the sony under 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.150
 Anyway, it's a great arrival for 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.160
 marvel universe he has a 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.770
 important participation in this film has 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.920
 a reference in his story 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.270
 At the end of the biggest battle, there is a 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.040
 thing that happens to him with the band 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.440
 I think it's a joke, huh? 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.630
 already the writers, then we have to 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.700
 talk also that the movie ideas 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.060
 the connections but it does not leave much 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.550
 time and is explicitly retreated there when 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.250
 used for South Africa is absurd is 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.620
 funk and then they already do some leave a 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.950
 track on the black panther that will be 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.450
 one of the next air is planting the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.140
 seed had one of the next films there 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.090
 The strange doctor has nothing 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.920
 ant man I have my doubts 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.800
 the ant man one hour will join 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.540
 or not with the avengers he is from the team 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.030
 original joking but he goes 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.580
 back he will appear naked with the new 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.860
 Avengers and Edson understand that they will have 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.690
 then our people will appear later 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.540
 Already having new avengers is very 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.240
 fast I can already die ozzy japan or 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.030
 Internet type has already left something new 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.130
 the movie has two and a half hours it calls 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.110
 of a log was such a thing. 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.310
 great and two hours and thirty is not 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.170
 enough for this story I think 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.330
 I hope this villain voice in a way 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.180
 or other but that did not curl 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.490
 not to mention a thing behind the 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.790
 other up because another arises already longer want 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.890
 to end it all already has a plan mounted 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:57.620
 and is already going into the attack but it is a 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.990
 sensation of 20 and 30 years of age 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.650
 longer period without material is all a 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:06.380
 thing the other he joins with the vanda 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.930
 with pietro that's what they make the team 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.750
 of evil moved to computers but there 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.100
 the band sees that he is not what he wants 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.510
 to do is not 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.000
 I no longer agree with what he 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.150
 explained to them is because the other it 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.260
 comes from an image of land innovation 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.150
 only that he does not explain that this 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.640
 renewal comes from the destruction of 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.230
 land and it has the basements there until 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.770
 to do this how often 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.790
 even resurfaced after having been 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.730
 destroyed 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.650
 there is a very cool jataí film in the 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.350
 theaters this weekend you have to 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.760
 watch more gives a recapitulate in 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.409
 marvel movies you do not mess 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.959
 with the jewel of infinity 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.069
 there to make everything clear in the 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:50.209
 your head is fine 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.209
 until the next manager
