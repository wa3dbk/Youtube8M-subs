00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
process of genetic engineering so

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.770 
process of genetic engineering so
they're<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.799> considered<00:01:56.280> safe<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.450> more

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
they're not considered safe the more

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.410 
they're not considered safe the more
something<00:01:58.590> has<00:01:58.680> been<00:01:58.829> processed<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.969> terms<00:02:00.270> of

something has been processed in terms of

genetic engineering the less risky it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.230 
genetic engineering the less risky it
would<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.820> corn<00:02:06.119> on

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
would be but so if you have like corn on

would be but so if you have like corn on

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.860 
GMOs so if you eat corn on the cob that
produces<00:02:31.410> Bt<00:02:31.800> toxin<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:33.150> gene<00:02:33.480> that

all sorts of things according to doctors
and<00:02:45.239> scientists<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.739> you<00:02:46.920> end<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.280> eating

and scientists so if you end up eating

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.120 
and scientists so if you end up eating
raw<00:02:47.940> genetically<00:02:48.660> engineered<00:02:49.110> foods<00:02:49.410> it's

raw genetically engineered foods it's

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.280 
raw genetically engineered foods it's

got the complete DNA intact it's got the
