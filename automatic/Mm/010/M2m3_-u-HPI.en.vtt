operated<00:01:22.049> screw<00:01:22.710> gun<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.580> by<00:01:23.729> holding<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
operated screw gun just by holding the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
operated screw gun just by holding the
button<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.570> once<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> push<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.590> trigger

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
button up once that you push the trigger

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.100 
button up once that you push the trigger
in<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> sit<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.540> run<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.900> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
in so then you can sit and run this in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
in so then you can sit and run this in
just<00:01:28.560> pound<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.070> screws<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:30.060> makes<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
just pound in screws and that makes a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
just pound in screws and that makes a
big<00:01:30.600> difference<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:31.259> you're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> use

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
big difference if you're going to use

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.260 
big difference if you're going to use
the<00:01:32.700> optional<00:01:33.240> ma<00:01:33.630> 55<00:01:34.280> automatic<00:01:35.280> feed<00:01:35.579> here

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the optional ma 55 automatic feed here

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
the optional ma 55 automatic feed here
we'll<00:01:36.869> get<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.560> minute

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
we'll get into that in a minute

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
we'll get into that in a minute
now<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> cool<00:01:39.030> things<00:01:39.299> about<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
now some of the cool things about this

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.440 
now some of the cool things about this
is<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:40.500> doing<00:01:40.650> depth<00:01:41.130> control

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
is that if you're doing depth control

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.319 
is that if you're doing depth control
once<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:43.369> adjust<00:01:44.369> your<00:01:44.460> depth<00:01:44.759> which<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.119> easy

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
once you adjust your depth which is easy

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
once you adjust your depth which is easy
upfront<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.140> pull<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.430> either

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
upfront if you pull this off to either

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.580 
upfront if you pull this off to either
put<00:01:48.090> in<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.270> screw<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.630> more<00:01:49.020> take<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
put in a screw a little more take one

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
put in a screw a little more take one
out<00:01:49.770> whatever<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.310> need<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.360> pop<00:01:51.600> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
out whatever you need to do you pop this

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.380 
out whatever you need to do you pop this
back<00:01:52.110> on<00:01:52.409> you're<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.280> same<00:01:53.490> depth<00:01:53.790> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
back on you're at the same depth so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.090 
back on you're at the same depth so
there's<00:01:54.600> no<00:01:54.720> need<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> readjust<00:01:55.350> anything

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
there's no need to readjust anything

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
there's no need to readjust anything
that's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.090> neat<00:01:57.270> there's<00:01:57.780> an<00:01:57.930> LED<00:01:58.320> light

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that's really neat there's an LED light

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.319 
that's really neat there's an LED light
at<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.860> bottom<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.369> helps<00:01:59.790> light<00:02:00.030> up<00:02:00.180> the
