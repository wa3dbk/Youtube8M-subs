00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.529
 Now I'm going to ask you to look 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.080
 coming back well to the question since 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.990
 We've already made this discussion for you. 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.570
 look there for the grass 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.400
 these lines that will show the 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.859
 you domains, Sunday bacterium or 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.570
 kari arkivuo then of all the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.120
 possibilities for horizontal transmission 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 We talk about genetic engineering. 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.750
 transition conjugation hybridization and 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.239
 transformation these last three and 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.300
 procare organisms others 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.570
 here you are seeing that you have the arrows 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.700
 show two important events that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.320
 is related to any of those I 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.969
 I explained earlier 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.149
 The question that I'm going to ask you is 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.280
 What do you think it means to these 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.800
 first ones that goes to the first 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.580
 ball and then the second right 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.130
 while you think to reproduce 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:10.009
 recycled grass here 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.259
 the other sakineh ball that he is 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.930
 showing some people passing through 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.130
 bacterium 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.310
 happened a transmission in the 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.009
 horizontal transfer of information 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:27.380
 genetics for this primitive ancestor 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.470
 that gives rise to all his affection and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.209
 after passing another welcome this 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.140
 evolutionary history because you have here 

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.050
 huh 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:41.149
 the time in billions of years 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.080
 here this event here is between 3 and 21 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.880
 and that other ball that is between 2000 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.149
 and there is another event that happens 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.069
 later, he will then make a 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.380
 horizontal transmission of information 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:59.270
 genetics to give rise to a part of the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.500
 individuals that dominated guy maybe 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.970
 staff feels difficult to respond 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.310
 without knowing what it means that your 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.720
 domains while you still think the 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.360
 that may have been this first event 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.879
 here in the first ball and the second 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.129
 event will differentiate these three 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.470
 here we think of your 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.360
 mythical ones we see that the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.150
 first primitive ancestor 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.120
 common to all and feels 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.170
 glass will give rise to what everyone 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.090
 they obvious right? 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.250
 but he will get together staying here at 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.150
 group that gives rise to the bacterial domain 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.340
 and in the other group that will follow here 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.200
 originating eucary and arch with this 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.569
 business that bacteria came from 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.370
 here we are seeing that the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.780
 farc are more related to allocating 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.470
 than the bacteria themselves are 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.030
 even if we analyze it is 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.200
 biomolecularly these individuals and 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.870
 I had the greatest degree of similarity 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.629
 really send that face they would be 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.569
 these arks they are bacteria too 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.579
 but are then extremophile bacteria 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.709
 they live in regions that have high 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.870
 High temperature high salinity 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.489
 concentration of sulfur and they resist 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.680
 well these conditions 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.590
 they are the crime beings or they synthesize 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.590
 ante most of the bacteria are already 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.750
 unicellular beings by Oscar and others and 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.459
 which will not necessarily be 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.709
 individuals who will live in these 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.090
 conditions are dead are all 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.470
 these most common bacteria that people 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.769
 talk to you mainly in 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.650
 and of course make up the majority of 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.900
 of organisms seek out others and used 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.810
 dude there are all the beings I want you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.720
 will have the fungi designers the plants 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.239
 and the animals will physically and will goes with 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.760
 they whose is what they can have 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.579
 passed from the bacterium to form 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.349
 all I charge and have passed the bacteria 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.349
 to form a part of my expensive
