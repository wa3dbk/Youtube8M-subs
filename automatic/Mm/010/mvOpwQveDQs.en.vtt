00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
steam engine turbine I think was made in

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.980 
steam engine turbine I think was made in
2008<00:00:14.130> and<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.580> purchased<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.179> off<00:00:15.299> fellow<00:00:15.599> steam

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
2008 and I purchased it off fellow steam

man<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.830> mousse<00:00:17.340> man<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:18.300> got<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> lit<00:00:18.990> match<00:00:19.230> in

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
man a mousse man I've got a lit match in

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470 
man a mousse man I've got a lit match in
my<00:00:19.500> hand<00:00:19.859> which<00:00:20.039> I'd<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.430> use<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
my hand which I'd better use here I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.019 
my hand which I'd better use here I
decided<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.529> pre<00:00:22.830> warm<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.340> thing<00:00:23.609> up<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
decided to pre warm this thing up and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.480 
decided to pre warm this thing up and
then<00:00:24.420> I've<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:24.990> looked<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.619> burner<00:00:25.830> again

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
then I've just looked the burner again

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.910 
then I've just looked the burner again
so<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.269> starts<00:00:27.630> almost<00:00:28.170> instantly<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:28.740> can

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
so it starts almost instantly you can

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.999 
so it starts almost instantly you can
see<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.390> turbine<00:00:30.500> automatically<00:00:31.500> getting

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
see that turbine automatically getting

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.260 
see that turbine automatically getting
going<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.399> neck<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> water<00:00:33.000> had<00:00:33.180> been

gothic looking arches and I kind of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:50.569 
gothic looking arches and I kind of
liked<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510 
tends to make the burner flame sort of
walk<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.140> forth<00:02:01.229> under<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.979> ball<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
walk back and forth under the ball and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.999 
walk back and forth under the ball and
so<00:02:03.149> it's<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.420> concentrating<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:04.500> heat

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
so it's not concentrating as much heat

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.899 
so it's not concentrating as much heat
as<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.579> if<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:05.820> was<00:02:05.969> no

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
as it would if there was no

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.559 
as it would if there was no
the<00:02:07.270> air<00:02:07.450> movement<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:08.649> what<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:09.759> does

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the air movement so what if it does

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.970 
the air movement so what if it does
20,000<00:02:11.319> on<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.800> non<00:02:12.670> breezy<00:02:13.080> day<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.380> would<00:02:14.830> say

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
20,000 on a non breezy day I would say

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.000 
20,000 on a non breezy day I would say
it's<00:02:15.130> doing<00:02:15.400> 10<00:02:15.580> or<00:02:15.670> 15,000<00:02:16.569> now<00:02:16.800> anyways<00:02:17.800> it's

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
it's doing 10 or 15,000 now anyways it's

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.509 
it's doing 10 or 15,000 now anyways it's
a<00:02:18.190> very<00:02:18.580> precision<00:02:19.349> made<00:02:20.349> very<00:02:20.769> nicely<00:02:21.069> made

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
a very precision made very nicely made

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.870 
a very precision made very nicely made
unit<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.470> size<00:02:23.709> comparison<00:02:24.220> put<00:02:24.550> my<00:02:24.640> hand

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
unit and the size comparison put my hand

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.860 
unit and the size comparison put my hand
here<00:02:25.000> it's<00:02:25.239> not<00:02:25.390> very<00:02:25.599> big<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.349> it's<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.780> of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
here it's not very big it's it's one of

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.350 
here it's not very big it's it's one of
his<00:02:29.019> his<00:02:29.680> classic<00:02:30.190> designs<00:02:30.580> utilizing<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
his his classic designs utilizing a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.440 
his his classic designs utilizing a
spinning<00:02:31.750> turbine<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:35.849> poorly<00:02:36.849> for<00:02:37.030> cooling

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
spinning turbine and poorly for cooling

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.990 
spinning turbine and poorly for cooling
so<00:02:37.569> fast<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.500> riding<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.549> ball<00:02:39.790> bearing

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
so fast but riding on a ball bearing

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940 
so fast but riding on a ball bearing
race<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.810> very<00:02:40.989> center<00:02:41.470> now<00:02:41.769> they're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
race in the very center now they're

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.259 
race in the very center now they're
exceeding<00:02:42.400> up<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.580> little<00:02:42.730> bit<00:02:42.880> maybe<00:02:43.030> air

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
exceeding up a little bit maybe air

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.039 
exceeding up a little bit maybe air
conditioned<00:02:43.660> kicked<00:02:43.900> off<00:02:44.640> there<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.730> know

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
conditioned kicked off there you know

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.020 
conditioned kicked off there you know
nice<00:02:47.049> piece<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.290> work<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.580> all<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
nice piece of work I like all the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.370 
nice piece of work I like all the
Karstens<00:02:49.450> stuff<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:49.900> as<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.170> said<00:02:50.319> I

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
Karstens stuff but as I said I

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.020 
Karstens stuff but as I said I
specifically<00:02:50.980> like<00:02:51.160> these<00:02:51.400> receive<00:02:51.849> all

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
specifically like these receive all

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.960 
specifically like these receive all
designs<00:02:52.420> anyhow<00:02:53.290> that's<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:54.640> that<00:02:54.849> but

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
designs anyhow that's that's that but

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.229 
designs anyhow that's that's that but
today<00:02:55.260> Carson<00:02:56.260> Steve<00:02:56.470> all<00:02:56.680> our<00:02:56.950> Carson<00:02:57.250> radial

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
today Carson Steve all our Carson radial

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.349 
today Carson Steve all our Carson radial
turbine<00:02:58.630> well<00:02:59.230> bye
