00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.160 

so<00:01:27.770> right<00:01:27.950> now<00:01:27.979> I'm<00:01:28.579> separating<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.750> skittles

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
so right now I'm separating the skittles

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.760 
so right now I'm separating the skittles
into<00:01:30.680> their<00:01:30.829> own<00:01:30.920> separate<00:01:31.280> colors<00:01:32.770> we're

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
into their own separate colors we're

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.810 
into their own separate colors we're
doing<00:01:34.159> about<00:01:34.430> 10<00:01:35.299> ounces<00:01:35.780> of<00:01:36.530> vodka<00:01:36.590> in<00:01:37.280> every

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.940 
doing about 10 ounces of vodka in every
bottle<00:01:38.180> so<00:01:38.960> I've<00:01:39.320> decided<00:01:39.500> that<00:01:39.799> I<00:01:39.920> really

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
bottle so I've decided that I really

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.230

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.969 
wanted a flavorful vodka so for every
ounce<00:01:45.020> is<00:01:45.610> 30<00:01:46.610> skittles<00:01:47.740> that's<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.799> lot<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979

that<00:04:15.150> actually<00:04:15.360> fits<00:04:15.959> our<00:04:16.680> lower<00:04:17.280> measuring

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
that actually fits our lower measuring

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.870 
that actually fits our lower measuring
cup<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.030> what<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.810> want<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.080> do<00:04:19.200> is<00:04:19.700> open<00:04:20.700> it

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.850 

and<00:04:29.389> then<00:04:29.509> all<00:04:29.780> that<00:04:30.050> white<00:04:30.259> stuff<00:04:30.289> will<00:04:30.710> be

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
and then all that white stuff will be

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:39.999 
and then all that white stuff will be
filtered<00:04:31.370> out<00:04:38.229> now<00:04:39.229> we<00:04:39.289> just<00:04:39.440> play<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
filtered out now we just play the

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:45.210 
filtered out now we just play the
waiting<00:04:40.190> game

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.000 

so<00:04:45.820> after<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.240> fills<00:04:46.630> up<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:47.050> got<00:04:47.350> about<00:04:51.240> 14<00:04:52.240> or

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
so after this fills up I got about 14 or

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.640 
so after this fills up I got about 14 or
enjoin<00:04:54.010> when<00:04:55.000> that<00:04:55.120> fills<00:04:55.360> up<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:55.840> will<00:04:56.320> fill<00:04:56.620> up

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
enjoin when that fills up I will fill up

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.720 
enjoin when that fills up I will fill up
my<00:04:57.720> empty<00:04:58.720> bottle<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.860> red<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.520> then<00:05:00.700> I
