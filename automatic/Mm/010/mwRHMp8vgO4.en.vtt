00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.879 

all<00:00:07.170> right<00:00:07.380> I'm<00:00:08.480> changing<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.780> spark<00:00:10.500> plugs

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
all right I'm changing the spark plugs

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.010 
all right I'm changing the spark plugs
on<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:12.440> 4.3<00:00:13.440> liter<00:00:13.969> v6<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:17.029> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.750> had

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
on my 4.3 liter v6 and to do this I had

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.669 
on my 4.3 liter v6 and to do this I had
to<00:00:19.140> take<00:00:20.180> this<00:00:21.180> hose<00:00:21.570> off<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.260> air<00:00:22.410> intake

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
to take this hose off of the air intake

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.839 
to take this hose off of the air intake
right<00:00:25.679> there<00:00:25.859> just<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.550> little<00:00:26.580> bit

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
right there just so it's a little bit

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.130 
right there just so it's a little bit
either<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.150> don't<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.390> have<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> do<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
either you don't really have to do that

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.009 
either you don't really have to do that
but<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.550> mine<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.820> can't<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.210> because<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.839> got

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
but I'm mine I can't do because I got

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.840 
but I'm mine I can't do because I got
this<00:00:31.199> box<00:00:31.529> right<00:00:31.859> here<00:00:32.990> and<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:37.670> since<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
this box right here and this since I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.950 
this box right here and this since I
have<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> half-ton<00:00:39.600> truck<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:40.830> the<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.220> the

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
have a half-ton truck with the for the

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
have a half-ton truck with the for the
4.3<00:00:42.960> liter<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.460> room<00:00:44.700> than

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
4.3 liter I have a lot more room than

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
4.3 liter I have a lot more room than
admit<00:00:45.240> word<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.960> traditional<00:00:46.710> s10

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
admit word in the traditional s10

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.220 
admit word in the traditional s10
because<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.140> maybe<00:00:49.460> two<00:00:50.460> more<00:00:50.700> feet<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
because I got maybe two more feet of

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:04.719 
because I got maybe two more feet of
front<00:00:52.230> end<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> my<00:00:55.280> spark<00:00:56.280> plugs<00:00:56.610> are<00:01:03.019> 1/3<00:01:04.019> on

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
front end so my spark plugs are 1/3 on

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.330 
front end so my spark plugs are 1/3 on
passenger<00:01:05.729> side<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.990> much

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
passenger side and it's pretty much

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:21.370 
passenger side and it's pretty much
reverse<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.539> side<00:01:13.130> 1<00:01:14.130> 2<00:01:14.509> 3<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:19.070> went<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
reverse on this side 1 2 3 I went to a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:43.929 
reverse on this side 1 2 3 I went to a
local<00:01:22.380> flea<00:01:22.829> farm<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.600> new<00:01:39.810> spark<00:01:40.319> plugs

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.359 

for<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.180> six<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.720> them<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:49.049> only<00:01:49.950> four

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
for just six of them it was only four

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.499 
for just six of them it was only four
dollars<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:51.000> think<00:01:52.670> it's<00:01:53.670> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.000> expensive

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
dollars I think it's kind of expensive

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.779 
dollars I think it's kind of expensive
in<00:01:54.930> my<00:01:55.080> book<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.560> oil<00:01:55.890> makes<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> vehicle

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
in my book but oil makes the vehicle

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:04.210 
in my book but oil makes the vehicle
start<00:01:57.090> that's<00:01:57.330> right<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.689> my<00:01:57.720> book<00:02:00.470> anyways<00:02:01.470> to

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
start that's right in my book anyways to

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.740 
start that's right in my book anyways to
take<00:02:05.220> these<00:02:05.490> off<00:02:06.979> you<00:02:09.229> -<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.269> take<00:02:12.510> your

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
take these off you - you just take your

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.470 
take these off you - you just take your
socket<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.099> have<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.440> spark<00:02:16.440> plug<00:02:16.709> socket

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
socket and I have a spark plug socket

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.710 
socket and I have a spark plug socket
and<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:20.040> fits<00:02:20.400> right<00:02:20.760> over<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:21.180> top<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.420> it

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and that fits right over the top of it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.340 
and that fits right over the top of it
and<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.209> just<00:02:24.390> hooks<00:02:24.720> right<00:02:24.989> into<00:02:25.230> it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
and you can it just hooks right into it

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.880 
and you can it just hooks right into it
and<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.590> turn<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.069> out<00:02:26.840> which<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:27.890> really

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and you can turn it out which is really

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.330 
and you can turn it out which is really
nice<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.810> don't<00:02:31.019> end<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.290> break<00:02:31.769> twisting

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
nice so you don't end up break twisting

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.070 
nice so you don't end up break twisting
and<00:02:32.519> breaking<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.090> spark<00:02:33.390> plug<00:02:33.630> which<00:02:33.900> will

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
and breaking the spark plug which will

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.080 
and breaking the spark plug which will
just<00:02:34.260> make<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.650> lot<00:02:34.830> harder<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.519> out

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.850 

and<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:40.549> will<00:02:41.660> start<00:02:42.660> up<00:02:42.810> when<00:02:42.989> I<00:02:43.080> get<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.500> old

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
and I will start up when I get the old

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.360 
and I will start up when I get the old
one<00:02:43.980> out<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.900> got<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.319> boot<00:02:46.590> off<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.160> one

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
one out I just got the boot off of one

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.599 
one out I just got the boot off of one
of<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.640> spark<00:02:47.940> plugs<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:50.070> piece<00:02:50.340> just

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
of the spark plugs and this piece just

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.210 
of the spark plugs and this piece just
right<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:50.970> just<00:02:51.410> slips<00:02:52.410> over<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:52.950> end<00:02:53.100> of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
right here just slips over at the end of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.810 
right here just slips over at the end of
the<00:02:53.310> spark<00:02:53.609> plug<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.079> clips<00:02:55.079> on<00:02:55.290> which<00:02:55.820> runs

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
the spark plug and clips on which runs

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.960 
the spark plug and clips on which runs
it<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.079> piece<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.820> runs<00:02:59.820> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
it this is the piece that runs the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.009 
it this is the piece that runs the
electricity<00:03:00.950> through<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.220> creates<00:03:02.820> air<00:03:03.720> into

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
electricity through and creates air into

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.720 
electricity through and creates air into
the<00:03:04.140> spark<00:03:04.440> plug<00:03:04.620> which<00:03:04.769> creates<00:03:05.130> two<00:03:05.340> spark

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
the spark plug which creates two spark

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.370 
the spark plug which creates two spark
that<00:03:06.690> ignites<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> cylinder<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.230> see

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that ignites in the cylinder you can see

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.670 
that ignites in the cylinder you can see
it<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.480> these<00:03:12.480> ones<00:03:12.750> are<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> lot<00:03:13.140> easier<00:03:13.470> in

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
it just these ones are a lot easier in

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.300 
it just these ones are a lot easier in
my<00:03:13.890> opinion<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.310> take<00:03:14.579> off<00:03:14.819> and<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:16.310> these

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
my opinion to take off and the these

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.680 
my opinion to take off and the these
ones<00:03:17.549> right<00:03:17.700> here<00:03:17.730> which<00:03:18.209> are<00:03:18.359> just<00:03:18.510> straight

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
ones right here which are just straight

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.059 
ones right here which are just straight
there's<00:03:21.690> like<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.900> little<00:03:22.019> elbow<00:03:22.350> piece<00:03:22.560> you

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
there's like a little elbow piece you

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.099 
there's like a little elbow piece you
just<00:03:23.100> wiggle<00:03:23.910> them<00:03:24.209> off<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.720> pops<00:03:24.959> right

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
just wiggle them off and it pops right

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.009 
just wiggle them off and it pops right
off<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.709> can<00:03:25.890> put<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:27.030> socket<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.630> take

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019

out<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.410> spark<00:03:28.859> plug<00:03:30.920> all<00:03:31.920> right<00:03:32.480> this<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.750> a

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
out the spark plug all right this is a

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:40.350 
out the spark plug all right this is a
spark<00:03:36.359> plug<00:03:36.420> that<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.840> took<00:03:36.900> out

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.730 

not<00:03:42.570> very<00:03:43.570> good-looking<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:46.720> know<00:03:46.840> how

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
not very good-looking I don't know how

00:03:47.740 --> 00:04:03.980 
not very good-looking I don't know how
well<00:03:48.010> I'll<00:03:48.190> be<00:03:48.400> able<00:03:48.490> to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.790 

there<00:04:04.620> we<00:04:04.890> go<00:04:06.410> it's<00:04:07.410> very<00:04:07.710> worn<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:10.110> space<00:04:10.500> is

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
there we go it's very worn the space is

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.620 
there we go it's very worn the space is
still<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.280> good<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:11.700> if<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.330> see

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
still really good but if you can see

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.830 
still really good but if you can see
then<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.080> know<00:04:13.260> if<00:04:13.380> you<00:04:13.500> can<00:04:14.240> one<00:04:15.240> side<00:04:15.540> of

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
then you know if you can one side of

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.620 
then you know if you can one side of
this<00:04:15.990> little<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.690> is<00:04:19.580> worn<00:04:20.580> further<00:04:21.150> down

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
this little of it is worn further down

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.800 
this little of it is worn further down
and<00:04:21.959> it's<00:04:22.890> shifted<00:04:23.580> which<00:04:24.120> means<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.660> it's

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
and it's shifted which means that it's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:33.110 
and it's shifted which means that it's
only<00:04:25.490> sparking<00:04:26.490> off<00:04:26.670> of<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:27.210> side<00:04:32.120> I'll

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
only sparking off of the one side I'll

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:43.520 
only sparking off of the one side I'll
show<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.810> side-by-side<00:04:34.770> comparison<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:43.260> is

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
show a side-by-side comparison this is

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:54.110 
show a side-by-side comparison this is
side<00:04:43.800> by<00:04:44.010> side<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:50.850> can<00:04:51.000> see<00:04:53.000> what<00:04:54.000> it's

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
side by side so you can see what it's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.170 
side by side so you can see what it's
supposed<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.630> look<00:04:54.840> like<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:56.460> what<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:57.000> looks

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
supposed to look like and what it looks

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.439 
supposed to look like and what it looks
like

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.860 

all<00:05:05.020> right<00:05:05.199> and<00:05:05.469> then<00:05:05.620> to<00:05:05.770> put<00:05:05.949> these<00:05:06.509> in<00:05:09.870> it's

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
all right and then to put these in it's

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.029 
all right and then to put these in it's
just<00:05:11.139> like<00:05:11.319> a<00:05:11.349> bolt<00:05:12.159> you<00:05:12.370> just<00:05:12.580> kind<00:05:12.819> of<00:05:14.039> you

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
just like a bolt you just kind of you

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.429 
just like a bolt you just kind of you
just<00:05:15.279> stick<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:15.819> hole<00:05:15.849> in<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.439> screw

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439 
just stick it in the hole in you screw

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.019 
just stick it in the hole in you screw
it<00:05:17.499> in<00:05:17.559> so<00:05:17.740> it's<00:05:17.889> snug<00:05:18.069> but<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.610> don't<00:05:18.789> want<00:05:18.939> to

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
it in so it's snug but you don't want to

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.749 
it in so it's snug but you don't want to
over<00:05:19.389> connect<00:05:19.719> it<00:05:19.870> but<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.169> don't<00:05:20.349> want<00:05:20.499> to

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 
over connect it but you don't want to

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.980 
over connect it but you don't want to
break<00:05:21.759> it<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:22.150> have<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.599> go<00:05:22.719> buy<00:05:22.870> new<00:05:22.900> ones<00:05:24.990> all

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
break it and have to go buy new ones all

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.529 
break it and have to go buy new ones all
right<00:05:26.259> I'll<00:05:26.620> do<00:05:26.830> I'll<00:05:27.550> start<00:05:27.939> up<00:05:28.059> again<00:05:28.330> when

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
let's see if it starts that would be

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.779 
let's see if it starts that would be
nice<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:16.360> do<00:06:16.719> all<00:06:16.839> this<00:06:16.990> work<00:06:17.740> and<00:06:18.099> everything
