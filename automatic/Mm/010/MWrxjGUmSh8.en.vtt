00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:11.719
 Welcome to our first 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.430
 driving report 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.430
 we had planned nothing more 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.630
 spend more than 50 euros for one 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.039
 Racing cars to be purchased at Amazon 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.949
 important here was that the remote control 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.039
 is there and running in the office 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.019
 Of course, only 152 of the scale is important 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.829
 we we bake all the junk also 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.010
 already load the cars and train 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.450
 right where after this first shock because 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.940
 I am so under adrenalin that I am correct 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.280
 was in the drag race that we were here 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:50.780
 just build up the traditionally first 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:53.030
 task with our cars 321 co and with 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.309
 top speed against the 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.600
 flower city very surprising way 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.309
 we bought the same car but 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.019
 still surprisingly, science was 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.780
 much faster than mine was mine 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.970
 in fact the slower I have to 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.070
 say speed was outstanding so 30 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.930
 hourly kilometers are maybe now 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.770
 a bit exaggerated but it is already 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.689
 very close 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.920
 what has the handling quite complicated 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.470
 you can imagine with such a 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.049
 big car to drive extremely fast and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 here the royal discipline of the round course 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.220
 Let's go we follow the cars in the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.340
 first turn on the type 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.910
 mighty bin yes me personally already 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.400
 right in front of the very clever 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.870
 retarded wheelchair and out again 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.060
 on the finish line 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.170
 where i just missed i still have 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.480
 trying to deport 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 this will be so times that I can do more 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.780
 How you started the quality of the car 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.560
 I would rather than below average 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 consider 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.950
 it is admittedly in one 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.530
 fallen tractor 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.800
 the remote control makes the qualitative 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 a car stolen the operation 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100
 problem 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.880
 as a gift optimal
