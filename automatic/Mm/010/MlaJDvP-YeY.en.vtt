00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
finish I would have liked it to be a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.930 
finish I would have liked it to be a
little<00:02:33.720> bit<00:02:33.959> more<00:02:34.200> satiny<00:02:35.190> more<00:02:35.459> glowy<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
little bit more satiny more glowy and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.820 
little bit more satiny more glowy and
dewy<00:02:36.120> just<00:02:36.570> personally<00:02:36.990> for<00:02:37.170> me<00:02:37.350> because<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.770> do

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
dewy just personally for me because I do

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.120 
dewy just personally for me because I do
have<00:02:38.010> dry<00:02:38.580> skin<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.810> do<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.950> this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
have dry skin but I do think that this

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650 
have dry skin but I do think that this
would<00:02:41.340> work<00:02:41.459> really<00:02:41.790> well<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.330> have

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
would work really well if you have

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.930 
would work really well if you have
normal<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.140> oily<00:02:43.410> skin<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.280> think<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.850> would

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
normal to oily skin I think it would

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.640 
normal to oily skin I think it would
help<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.390> modify<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> face<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
help to really modify the face and you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.770 
help to really modify the face and you
wouldn't<00:02:47.040> notice<00:02:47.280> any<00:02:47.700> oiliness<00:02:48.360> throughout

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
wouldn't notice any oiliness throughout

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.180 
wouldn't notice any oiliness throughout
the<00:02:48.900> day<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.170> would<00:02:49.290> definitely<00:02:49.440> prevent<00:02:50.070> that

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
the day it would definitely prevent that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.370 
the day it would definitely prevent that
from<00:02:50.250> happening<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.270> like<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.870> way<00:02:52.020> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
from happening I do like the way that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.199

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
apply foundation with my fingertips so I

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.259 
apply foundation with my fingertips so I
don't<00:03:19.830> know<00:03:19.920> how<00:03:20.040> those<00:03:20.280> how<00:03:20.640> well<00:03:20.850> that<00:03:21.030> would

don't know how those how well that would

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.759 
don't know how those how well that would
work<00:03:21.299> but<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.230> brush<00:03:22.530> right<00:03:22.650> here

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
work but this brush right here

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.949 
work but this brush right here
definitely<00:03:23.100> does<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.580> job<00:03:23.730> really<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.690> only

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
definitely does the job really the only

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.750 
definitely does the job really the only
bad<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.739> guess<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:26.010> could<00:03:26.160> say<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.700> I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
bad thing I guess you could say that I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.940 
bad thing I guess you could say that I
would<00:03:27.239> say<00:03:27.989> about<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.769> gets

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
would say about this is that it gets

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.330 
would say about this is that it gets
very<00:03:29.280> messy<00:03:29.850> especially<00:03:30.720> where<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:31.980> product

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
very messy especially where the product

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.190 
very messy especially where the product
comes<00:03:32.549> out<00:03:32.820> because<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.330> just<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.780> dang

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
comes out because it's just so dang

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
comes out because it's just so dang
liquidy<00:03:34.769> that<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.489> pretty<00:03:35.670> much<00:03:35.730> gets

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
liquidy that it pretty much gets

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.610 
liquidy that it pretty much gets
everywhere<00:03:36.510> all<00:03:36.750> over<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.080> place<00:03:37.350> I'll<00:03:37.590> show

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
everywhere all over the place I'll show

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.310 
everywhere all over the place I'll show
you<00:03:37.709> guys<00:03:37.860> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.100> close-up<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> do<00:03:40.110> feel

was<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.150> little<00:03:57.450> bit<00:03:57.570> flatter<00:03:57.870> so<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> could<00:03:58.320> just

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
was a little bit flatter so I could just

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.110 
was a little bit flatter so I could just
rest<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.830> up<00:03:58.980> right<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.519> don't<00:03:59.640> have<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.940> go

you<00:04:00.420> know<00:04:00.510> through<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.170> whole<00:04:01.290> motion<00:04:01.440> of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you know through the whole motion of

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.470 
you know through the whole motion of
putting<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:01.920> cap<00:04:02.070> back<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.489> then<00:04:02.700> resting

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
putting the cap back on and then resting

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.090 
putting the cap back on and then resting
it<00:04:03.570> like<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.840> unscrewing<00:04:04.500> it<00:04:04.680> doing<00:04:04.890> another

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
it like this unscrewing it doing another

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.280 
it like this unscrewing it doing another
pump<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.120> packaging<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.720> would<00:04:06.900> say<00:04:07.170> is

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
pump so the packaging I would say is

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.710 
pump so the packaging I would say is
probably

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
probably

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.410 
probably
the<00:04:07.870> fail<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.130> product<00:04:09.580> but<00:04:10.030> really

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.760 
the fail of this product but really
that's<00:04:10.600> the<00:04:10.660> only<00:04:10.900> bad<00:04:11.080> thing<00:04:11.110> that<00:04:11.440> I<00:04:11.470> have<00:04:11.650> to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
that's the only bad thing that I have to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.800 
that's the only bad thing that I have to
say<00:04:11.950> about<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.310> the<00:04:12.790> four<00:04:13.120> out<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.240> five<00:04:13.390> review

say about it the four out of five review

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.870 
say about it the four out of five review
on<00:04:14.050> Sephora<00:04:14.500> was<00:04:14.680> pretty<00:04:14.980> accurate<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.700> would

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
on Sephora was pretty accurate I would

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.000 
on Sephora was pretty accurate I would
give<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.299> same<00:04:16.570> rating<00:04:17.380> just<00:04:17.709> because<00:04:17.980> I

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
give it the same rating just because I

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.680 
give it the same rating just because I
have<00:04:18.400> other<00:04:18.640> foundations<00:04:19.269> that<00:04:19.450> are<00:04:19.540> around

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.470 
have other foundations that are around
the<00:04:19.840> same<00:04:20.019> price<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.920> I<00:04:20.950> like<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:22.030> wish

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
the same price that I like more I wish

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.420 
the same price that I like more I wish
it<00:04:22.720> just<00:04:22.930> had<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:23.170> little<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.680> more<00:04:23.740> doing<00:04:24.280> as

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
it just had a little bit more doing as

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.850 
it just had a little bit more doing as
to<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:26.230> it's<00:04:26.470> very<00:04:26.560> easy<00:04:26.770> to

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
to it I think that it's very easy to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.040 
to it I think that it's very easy to
apply<00:04:27.100> it's<00:04:27.580> very<00:04:27.760> blendable<00:04:28.150> all<00:04:28.690> your<00:04:28.870> other

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
of it and I think honestly in my opinion

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.580 
of it and I think honestly in my opinion
the<00:04:33.520> most<00:04:33.670> number<00:04:34.240> one<00:04:34.270> thing<00:04:34.870> about<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.350> is

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590
