a<00:01:39.930> lego<00:01:40.409> version<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> each<00:01:41.100> tower<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.790> make

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
a lego version of each tower and make

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
a lego version of each tower and make
that<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> correct<00:01:43.350> size<00:01:43.619> for<00:01:44.009> your<00:01:44.100> bridge

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that in the correct size for your bridge

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then stick that onto a Lego base and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
and then stick that onto a Lego base and
build<00:01:47.250> walls<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.600> you'll<00:01:49.020> notice

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
build walls up around it you'll notice

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.350

you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.250> pull<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.640> Lego<00:02:11.819> walls<00:02:12.209> off<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you can just pull the Lego walls off and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.280 
you can just pull the Lego walls off and
then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
then

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
then
loosen<00:02:13.620> each<00:02:13.799> edge<00:02:14.159> of<00:02:14.400> push<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.060> Lego<00:02:15.329> out

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
loosen each edge of push the Lego out

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.569 
loosen each edge of push the Lego out
and<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.500> mold<00:02:16.829> for<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.280> end<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
and you now have a mold for the end of

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.360 
and you now have a mold for the end of
your<00:02:17.700> bridge<00:02:18.560> fill<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.709> mold<00:02:19.890> with<00:02:20.010> white

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
your bridge fill the mold with white

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.459 
your bridge fill the mold with white
chocolate<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.120> give<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.659> a<00:02:21.750> tap<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.290> rid

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469 
chocolate and give it a tap to get rid

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.559 
chocolate and give it a tap to get rid
of<00:02:22.530> any<00:02:22.709> air<00:02:22.980> bubbles<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.150> see<00:02:24.390> this

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
of any air bubbles and you can see this

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.809 
of any air bubbles and you can see this
is<00:02:24.750> bulging<00:02:25.049> out<00:02:25.439> slightly<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.310> sides<00:02:26.579> and

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
is bulging out slightly on the sides and

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.610 
is bulging out slightly on the sides and
I<00:02:26.909> don't<00:02:26.969> mind<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.540> shape<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.319> bridge

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
I don't mind that shape for my bridge

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.470 
I don't mind that shape for my bridge
but<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.129> want<00:02:29.340> yours<00:02:29.579> perfectly<00:02:30.120> straight

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
but if you want yours perfectly straight

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.630 
but if you want yours perfectly straight
then<00:02:31.019> just<00:02:31.049> add<00:02:31.439> some<00:02:31.650> Lego<00:02:31.829> walls<00:02:32.159> around<00:02:32.459> it

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
then just add some Lego walls around it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.649 
then just add some Lego walls around it
to<00:02:32.849> support<00:02:33.239> it

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
to support it

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.750 
to support it
what's<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.530> set<00:02:34.799> push<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.189> out<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.549> mold

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
what's it set push it out of the mold

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.429 
what's it set push it out of the mold
and<00:02:35.970> then<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.420> another<00:02:36.780> one<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.019> that<00:02:37.379> you

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
and then make another one so that you

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.309 
and then make another one so that you
have<00:02:37.590> one<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:38.040> each<00:02:38.220> end<00:02:38.900> now<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.959> make<00:02:40.290> our

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
have one for each end now to make our

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.280 
have one for each end now to make our
road<00:02:40.739> I'm<00:02:41.129> making<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> fairly<00:02:42.659> thick<00:02:42.989> as<00:02:43.139> it

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
road I'm making this fairly thick as it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.599 
road I'm making this fairly thick as it
needs<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.709> support<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.219> weight<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
needs to support the weight of the

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.089 
needs to support the weight of the
bridge<00:02:44.849> without<00:02:45.329> breaking<00:02:45.930> spread<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.920> out

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
bridge without breaking spread it out

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.580 
bridge without breaking spread it out
smoothly<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:48.120> then<00:02:48.299> let<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.510> start<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.290> set

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
smoothly and then let it start to set

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.369 
smoothly and then let it start to set
then<00:02:50.220> take<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> ruler<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.209> trim<00:02:51.689> it<00:02:51.840> straight

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
then take a ruler and trim it straight

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.740 
then take a ruler and trim it straight
making<00:02:52.950> sure<00:02:53.189> it's<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.459> right<00:02:53.819> width<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.510> fit

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
making sure it's the right width to fit

making sure it's the right width to fit
on<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:55.019> bridge<00:02:55.260> towers<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:55.859> you're<00:02:56.010> not<00:02:56.159> sure

on your bridge towers if you're not sure

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.429 
on your bridge towers if you're not sure
make<00:02:56.669> it<00:02:56.849> narrower<00:02:57.299> than<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.750> think<00:02:57.930> because

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
make it narrower than you think because

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.539 
make it narrower than you think because
you<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:58.829> want<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.069> put<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.280> all<00:02:59.400> together

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
you don't want to put it all together

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.270 
you don't want to put it all together
and<00:02:59.939> then<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.329> fit<00:03:00.629> then<00:03:01.530> place<00:03:01.859> another
