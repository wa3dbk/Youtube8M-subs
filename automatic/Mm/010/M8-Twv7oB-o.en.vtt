games now without winning but it's a
long<00:05:16.219> season<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.699> was<00:05:16.849> by<00:05:16.969> far<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.240> toughest

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:17.839 
long season this was by far the toughest

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.300

really<00:05:24.139> this<00:05:24.319> first<00:05:24.589> month<00:05:25.249> month<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:25.639> a<00:05:25.729> half

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
really this first month month and a half

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.790

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
performance from Liverpool today it was

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.740 
performance from Liverpool today it was
sloppy<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.949> we<00:05:37.009> misplaced<00:05:37.370> passes<00:05:37.759> at<00:05:38.539> some

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750

Jedi<00:05:59.750> today<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.289> thought<00:06:00.469> Jared<00:06:00.800> was<00:06:00.919> in<00:06:01.039> an

00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:01.159 
Jedi today I thought Jared was in an

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:03.159 
Jedi today I thought Jared was in an
interesting<00:06:01.430> position<00:06:01.759> today<00:06:02.180> when<00:06:02.990> I<00:06:03.020> saw

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
interesting position today when I saw

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.350 
interesting position today when I saw
the<00:06:03.229> teamsheet<00:06:03.529> i<00:06:03.830> saw<00:06:04.009> that<00:06:04.219> indeed<00:06:04.909> Shelby

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
the teamsheet i saw that indeed Shelby

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.089 
the teamsheet i saw that indeed Shelby
was<00:06:05.509> starting<00:06:05.750> over<00:06:05.960> shahin<00:06:06.349> so<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:06.889> thought

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
was starting over shahin so I thought

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.369 
was starting over shahin so I thought
okay<00:06:07.430> it'll<00:06:07.819> be<00:06:07.909> Shelby<00:06:08.300> and<00:06:08.569> Gerard<00:06:08.960> and<00:06:09.259> then

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:09.379 
okay it'll be Shelby and Gerard and then

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.649 
okay it'll be Shelby and Gerard and then
Joe<00:06:09.860> Allen<00:06:10.189> will<00:06:10.520> be<00:06:10.639> less<00:06:11.000> wrestling<00:06:11.389> behind

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
Joe Allen will be less wrestling behind

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.329 
Joe Allen will be less wrestling behind
them<00:06:11.839> but<00:06:11.930> in<00:06:12.050> fact<00:06:12.199> it<00:06:12.439> was<00:06:12.560> actually<00:06:12.889> Gerard

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:13.339 
them but in fact it was actually Gerard

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.879 
them but in fact it was actually Gerard
and<00:06:13.610> Joe<00:06:14.210> Allen<00:06:14.569> and<00:06:14.810> john<00:06:15.469> de<00:06:15.589> she'll<00:06:15.800> be

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
and Joe Allen and john de she'll be

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.170 
and Joe Allen and john de she'll be
getting<00:06:16.009> forward<00:06:16.460> so<00:06:16.639> we're<00:06:16.729> playing<00:06:16.939> as<00:06:17.029> a

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
getting forward so we're playing as a

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.420 
getting forward so we're playing as a
false<00:06:17.449> 10<00:06:17.750> or<00:06:17.899> the<00:06:17.930> second<00:06:18.379> most<00:06:19.129> you<00:06:19.310> know

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
false 10 or the second most you know

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.920 
false 10 or the second most you know
closest<00:06:19.909> thing<00:06:20.089> that<00:06:20.120> Liverpool<00:06:20.599> had<00:06:20.750> to<00:06:20.899> a

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
closest thing that Liverpool had to a

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.510 
closest thing that Liverpool had to a
support<00:06:21.289> striker<00:06:21.589> today<00:06:21.919> I<00:06:22.129> thought<00:06:22.370> hey

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
support striker today I thought hey

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.189 
support striker today I thought hey
that's<00:06:22.759> like<00:06:22.909> a<00:06:22.939> role<00:06:23.389> that<00:06:23.419> Gerard<00:06:23.960> would

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 
that's like a role that Gerard would

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.110 
that's like a role that Gerard would
really<00:06:24.649> be<00:06:24.800> good<00:06:25.039> and<00:06:25.279> I<00:06:25.310> don't<00:06:25.490> know<00:06:25.580> why<00:06:25.759> I'm

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
really be good and I don't know why I'm

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.939 
really be good and I don't know why I'm
Brendan<00:06:26.719> Rodgers<00:06:27.020> one<00:06:27.169> with<00:06:27.289> that<00:06:27.409> Shelby<00:06:27.830> had

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:27.949 
Brendan Rodgers one with that Shelby had

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:29.589 
Brendan Rodgers one with that Shelby had
a<00:06:27.979> decent<00:06:28.219> performance<00:06:28.819> he<00:06:29.000> was<00:06:29.089> okay<00:06:29.389> getting

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 
a decent performance he was okay getting

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.689 
a decent performance he was okay getting
forward<00:06:30.020> but<00:06:30.529> I<00:06:30.560> really<00:06:30.830> just<00:06:31.009> thought<00:06:31.189> Jared

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:31.699 
forward but I really just thought Jared

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.100 
forward but I really just thought Jared
should<00:06:31.879> be<00:06:32.000> there<00:06:32.210> and<00:06:32.449> I<00:06:32.539> don't<00:06:32.750> really<00:06:32.839> want

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
should be there and I don't really want

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.839 
should be there and I don't really want
Jerrod<00:06:33.560> sort<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:33.830> controlling<00:06:34.279> the<00:06:34.370> attack<00:06:34.639> up

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
Jerrod sort of controlling the attack up

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.029 
Jerrod sort of controlling the attack up
top<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:35.440> directing<00:06:36.440> and<00:06:36.589> being<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:36.800> fuel

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
top and directing and being the fuel

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.409 
top and directing and being the fuel
general<00:06:37.399> Joe<00:06:37.669> and<00:06:37.969> I<00:06:38.000> think<00:06:38.209> it<00:06:38.269> should<00:06:38.389> be

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:38.419 
general Joe and I think it should be

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.279 
general Joe and I think it should be
