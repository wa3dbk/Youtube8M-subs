00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello today there will be a little video about 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.910
 tom as a result of all wedding preparation 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.830
 how can you do everything that you see 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 on the table with their own hands 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.960
 Well, a little more detail here are these red 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.189
 boxes 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.119
 tied with a ribbon called 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.390
 bonbonniere in them are candy patterns 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 I took it all from the internet 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 just being bent and very 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 a little time is entertaining 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.030
 tie a ribbon and turn it here with 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.180
 such a beautiful bow these three cans are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.399
 sand ceremony jars as a rule 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.770
 sold in the store 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.399
 they are inexpensive if you will 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.649
 to ask 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.620
 these jars are called jars for 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.449
 oils big jar she for loose 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 what rub so all this together all this 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 together costs about 200 rubles well, you yourself 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.220
 do you understand what to order such 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.510
 sets of some kind of professional 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 bridal stores will and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.540
 everything is much more expensive that's what 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.040
 touches the sand I bought it in the store 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.650
 soap making there is a hobby such a shop 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.119
 A bag of 200 grams costs 50 rubles 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.140
 bridal salons worth a ton not much 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.020
 more expensive here is water in one 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.990
 oiler so let's say it fits 2 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.970
 sandbag further 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.920
 all the famous mustache and lips store 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.320
 you can also buy them 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.450
 not issued for 38 rubles but I was 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.310
 interesting to do it their own gouache not 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.899
 the whole thing paints a lot 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 cool it turns out further glasses glasses 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:02.280
 very really simple something keeps 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 that there were houses entwined so let's say and 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.299
 lace lace is sold in any 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 fabric store 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.259

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.180
 everywhere 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.010
 it appears on the floor so if you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.829
 buy one hank for thirty rubles then 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.250
 it's everywhere you and it is useful in an environment you have it 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:23.040
 Why use two pairs of glasses alone 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 as a rule, the second are taken for a walk 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.680
 left cafe next bouquet bouquet like me 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.989
 has long shown 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 takes a lot of time but mine 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.299

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.390

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.640
 all this is visible 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:52.099
 the bouquet as we see is made of wire 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.909
 twisted between themselves and on it and masturbation 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.500
 strung pearl 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.250
 here about six hundred and seven hundred pearls 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.690
 naturally less well buttonhole 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.870
 a lot of labor so if you will 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.629
 do please be patient 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.060
 further chest I made a chest 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:18.030
 a master class from the Internet this chest 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:23.569
 inside the chest then let's say the box for here 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.370
 these patterns is acquired by the lace 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.250
 ribbon well and the beads are all sewn 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.040
 beads are sewn everywhere they are not pasted on 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.010
 strength chest just opens 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.109
 now lace and tie 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.510
 customer and the whole thing can be removed easily 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:44.639
 and open further as I understood on 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.959
 today not all young couples 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:51.599
 they want to be told bitterly therefore 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.780
 we made the signs that 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.790
 will lie on our table and we will 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.609

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.569

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:12.470
 the tables on the table that is no bitter so 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.319
