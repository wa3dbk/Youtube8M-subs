00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.220
 speaks youtube guys here to john 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.510
 Henrique 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.660
 and in this video we will create knowledge 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.559
 exactly 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.840
 Let's study about the pyramids. 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.960
 ecological and technological 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.120
 nothing more than another way in which 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.620
 create a food chain 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.239
 only in the shape of a pyramid there are three 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:01.239
 ecological types of pirambu cad 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.829
 among them we have the numerical energy 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.289
 and biomass 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:12.640
 Good. Let's start energetic here. 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.200
 You will see an example 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.590
 first we have to know that in 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.289
 whole food chain 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.820
 first we have a producer 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:29.360
 second we have a primary consumer 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.030
 that in the case would be or a herbivore the 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.259
 book and then a secondary consumer 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.840
 and so it goes 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:43.160
 which in the case the product here the grass with 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:48.110
 40 thousand calories in the primary consumer 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.200
 we have the 600-calorie grasshopper and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.869
 the frog as a secondary consumer with 40 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.910
 calories, what's this? 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.840
 the first we have to know in which the 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.709
 sun it gives energy to the grass 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.750
 there the grass she does not she does not stay with 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.660
 energy to spare 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.599
 if the sun gives 100% to the suffered with leftover 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.910
 80 because what comes there is the concept 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.800
 will be used for photosynthesis and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.640
 other things and it loses that part of 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.760
 energy 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.290
 That's when that was another 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.680
 energy does not take all 80% of the child with 50 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.430
 because because it will serve the 30 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 for engineering of 7 and so 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.939
 successively this way here is the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.019
 people have the grass with 40 thousand calories 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:47.980
 as I said 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:51.219
 grasshopper and has no way to - calories 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.980
 feed more calories what they feel 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:57.840
 is this can not exist a pyramid 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.609
 inverted energy simply does not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.900
 exist 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.739
 simply because they have no less 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.239
 calories 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:11.560
 to limit more calories now let's 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:15.430
 the numerical ones when they are 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:19.079
 100 units only numbers 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:29.579
 How are you here in this example here? 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:29.579
 thousand plants a thousand food plants in 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:53.260
 2011 only great 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:58.689
 of course you can give an example of the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:01.599
 parasite like the tick it several 40 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:03.759
 feed on a single cow 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:07.030
 this is another example as the cockroach 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:09.430
 dies and it shows up a lot of bug 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.329
 to her they are not there in the 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.220
 UN funeral they are feeding 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.709
 of food that is cheap 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.560
 I'm very much of a single 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:31.900
 there is a numerical inverted pyramid 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:36.430
 this is the one that exists the ypiranga and here 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.460
 have an example that is three trees either 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.090
 ipi because it's a tree type three targets 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.270
 food thousand beetles and those thousand euros 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.930
 element 20 targets 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.280
 is the exact opposite of a 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.340
 pyramid 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.370
 if you see you're not in the right way 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.220
 which is thus the opinion if it is not 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.550
 Jack, you're right if you're a stranger to 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.410
 less then you see she's drinking 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.870
 does not need to be perfectly 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:16.210
 inverted and finally we have ab 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:21.060
 biomass that is when it has our 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:25.450
 only this we have an example here of 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:30.400
 10,000 square footage of 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.630
 gram 10 thousand grams per square meter 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.260
 of grass 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.590
 there feed one thousand grams per meter 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:48.340
 grasshopper square 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:51.550
 and these foods in grams for 10 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.360
 grams per square meter of area 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.460
 When you see that you have this mass you have 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.420
 grass with the square meter something 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.300
 similar 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:07.090
 Do you realize that they are biomass 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:10.960
 then there will be inverted 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.560
 yes there is now only one is an example 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.680
 either when the phytoplankton that everything 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.830
 it means when 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.070
 feeds on phytoplankton is the only 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.740
 way that it can exist to have a 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.810
 inverted pyramid of biomass 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.260
 So that's it, folks, I hope you have 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.260
 liked the video if you liked 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.000
 I did not like it like even more had 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.690
 served to the favorites that is here 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.430
 down 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.130
 this is the first time you have seen the 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.130
 video on this channel sign up to watch 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.240
 other videos like this different from you 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.850
 also 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.080
 so that's it folks until the next study 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.080
 the drawing
