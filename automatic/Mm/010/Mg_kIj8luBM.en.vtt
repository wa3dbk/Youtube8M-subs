which<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.120> lot<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.600> couldn't<00:00:33.870> figure<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
which a lot I couldn't figure out how to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010 
which a lot I couldn't figure out how to
take<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.690> part<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
take off so I think that's just part of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.950 
take off so I think that's just part of
it<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> black<00:00:39.510> skinny

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
it and you want to get the black skinny

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.000 
it and you want to get the black skinny
tie<00:00:40.399> which<00:00:42.140> there's<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> navy<00:00:43.500> skinny<00:00:43.829> tie<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
tie which there's the navy skinny tie I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.319 
tie which there's the navy skinny tie I
thought<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> black<00:00:44.579> actually<00:00:44.850> looked<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
thought the black actually looked a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
thought the black actually looked a
little<00:00:45.570> bit<00:00:45.840> nicer<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.559> Navy

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
little bit nicer than the Navy

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
little bit nicer than the Navy
so<00:00:47.730> yeah<00:00:47.879> chance<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.390> black<00:00:48.629> instead<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
so yeah chance there's black instead and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.189 
so yeah chance there's black instead and
you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.559> keep<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> shoes<00:00:50.129> because<00:00:50.430> they<00:00:50.789> come

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
you can keep the shoes because they come

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
you can keep the shoes because they come
with<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.440> outfit<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.370> so<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.750> to

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
with the outfit and so what you want to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.529 
with the outfit and so what you want to
do<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> haircut<00:00:55.920> place<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
do is go over to the haircut place and

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.660 
do is go over to the haircut place and
now<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.870> believe<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> haircut<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.430> have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
now I believe the haircut that we have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
now I believe the haircut that we have
on<00:00:59.910> right<00:01:00.120> now<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.660> called<00:01:00.750> side<00:01:01.230> parting

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
on right now is called side parting

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.469 
on right now is called side parting
spiked<00:01:02.100> maybe<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:04.460> got<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.640> blondish

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
spiked maybe and I got a blondish

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.039 
spiked maybe and I got a blondish
brownish<00:01:07.260> sort<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.950> color<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.490> match<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.060> don't

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
brownish sort of color to match I don't

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.330 
brownish sort of color to match I don't
think<00:01:10.260> there<00:01:10.439> are<00:01:10.470> any<00:01:10.560> hair<00:01:10.860> cuts<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> are

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
think there are any hair cuts that are

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.870 
think there are any hair cuts that are
closer

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
closer

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.359 
closer
there's<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> buzz<00:01:13.110> cut<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.740> relatively

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
there's the buzz cut which is relatively

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.969 
there's the buzz cut which is relatively
close<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.619> hair<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> little

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
close but I think it's hair is a little

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.499 
close but I think it's hair is a little
bit<00:01:17.220> longer<00:01:17.430> than<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> buzz<00:01:17.880> cut<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> show

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
bit longer than a buzz cut in the show

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
bit longer than a buzz cut in the show
so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.549> did<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.869> haircut<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.710> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
so I did the this haircut which is it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
so I did the this haircut which is it's
a<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.119> relatively<00:01:24.509> close<00:01:24.780> haircut<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.290> I

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
a it's a relatively close haircut and I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.570 
a it's a relatively close haircut and I
haven't<00:01:25.650> heard<00:01:25.770> anything<00:01:26.040> about<00:01:26.220> new

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
haven't heard anything about new

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
haven't heard anything about new

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
haircuts coming out with heists so this

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.190 
haircuts coming out with heists so this
is<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> chose<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200

the video says hi slicked sides but I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.480 
the video says hi slicked sides but I
think<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.770> might<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:37.979> been<00:01:38.040> English<00:01:38.340> I'm

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.670 
think that might have been English I'm
pretty<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.180> called<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> side

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
pretty sure this is called the side

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.910 
pretty sure this is called the side
parting<00:01:41.100> spiked<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.500> yeah<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.829> then

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the trimmed beard I did the tenth color

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
the trimmed beard I did the tenth color

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
it's the charcoal combat pants I think

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.660

do<00:02:44.940> great<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.569> think<00:02:45.630> charcoal<00:02:46.290> is<00:02:46.349> a

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
do great but I think charcoal is a

do great but I think charcoal is a
little<00:02:46.590> bit<00:02:46.709> closer<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.310> think<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.180> dark<00:02:48.390> looks

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
little bit closer I think the dark looks

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.460 
little bit closer I think the dark looks
a<00:02:48.840> little<00:02:48.930> bit<00:02:49.140> nicer<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:51.329> loading<00:02:52.290> do

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
a little bit nicer in that loading do

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.589 
a little bit nicer in that loading do
the<00:02:52.739> charcoal<00:02:53.250> combat<00:02:53.819> top<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.450> that

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
the charcoal combat top and that so that

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.170 
the charcoal combat top and that so that
it<00:02:57.690> matches<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.079> pants<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.709> then<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.940> over<00:03:00.060> to

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
it matches the pants and then go over to

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
circle beard I think that's a pretty

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.960 
circle beard I think that's a pretty
close<00:04:13.260> beard<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.769> what<00:04:13.950> he<00:04:14.160> actually<00:04:14.609> had<00:04:14.790> on

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
close beard to what he actually had on

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.680 
close beard to what he actually had on
the<00:04:15.060> show<00:04:15.500> so<00:04:16.669> yeah<00:04:17.669> do<00:04:17.849> black<00:04:18.150> circle<00:04:18.539> beard

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the show so yeah do black circle beard

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.690 
the show so yeah do black circle beard
and<00:04:19.019> then<00:04:19.139> you<00:04:19.289> want<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.500> put<00:04:19.620> on<00:04:19.739> guyliner

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
and then you want to put on guyliner

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.580 
and then you want to put on guyliner
I<00:04:20.729> think<00:04:21.539> it<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.780> makes<00:04:21.959> his<00:04:22.109> eyes<00:04:22.289> pop<00:04:22.560> a

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
I think it just makes his eyes pop a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.260 
I think it just makes his eyes pop a
little<00:04:22.890> bit<00:04:23.010> more<00:04:23.190> because<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.760> eyes<00:04:23.940> in<00:04:24.180> the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
little bit more because the eyes in the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.350 
little bit more because the eyes in the
game<00:04:24.479> look<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.409> little<00:04:25.560> bit<00:04:25.830> dull

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
game look a little bit dull

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.179 
game look a little bit dull
me<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.800> do<00:04:28.219> the<00:04:28.430> guyliner<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.569> sure<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:33.189> put

00:04:34.179 --> 00:04:34.189 
me so do the guyliner for sure and I put

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.869 
me so do the guyliner for sure and I put
I<00:04:34.400> changed<00:04:34.909> it<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.150> brown<00:04:35.830> contacts<00:04:36.879> dark

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:37.879 
I changed it to brown contacts dark

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.610 
I changed it to brown contacts dark
brown<00:04:38.530> because<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:40.340> found<00:04:40.909> that<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.990> green<00:04:42.409> I

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
brown because I found that the green I

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.469 
brown because I found that the green I
mean<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.069> can<00:04:43.310> do<00:04:43.520> green<00:04:43.759> if<00:04:43.939> you're<00:04:44.090> on<00:04:44.210> last

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
mean you can do green if you're on last

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.230 
mean you can do green if you're on last
gen<00:04:44.710> but<00:04:45.710> I'd<00:04:45.889> take<00:04:46.099> advantage<00:04:46.310> of<00:04:46.789> if<00:04:47.030> you're

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
gen but I'd take advantage of if you're

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.670 
gen but I'd take advantage of if you're
on<00:04:47.330> next-gen<00:04:47.719> and<00:04:47.750> take<00:04:48.020> advantage<00:04:48.469> of<00:04:48.590> the

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
on next-gen and take advantage of the

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.100 
on next-gen and take advantage of the
fact<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:49.009> you<00:04:49.189> can<00:04:49.400> do<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.569> can<00:04:50.719> change<00:04:50.960> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
fact that you can do you can change the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.050 
fact that you can do you can change the
eye<00:04:51.139> color<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:52.699> changed<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.900> uh<00:04:53.930> I<00:04:55.060> changed

it<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.210> dark<00:04:56.479> brown<00:04:56.719> because<00:04:56.960> I<00:04:57.110> thought<00:04:57.289> it

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:57.439 
it to dark brown because I thought it

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.980 
it to dark brown because I thought it
looked<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.800> little<00:04:57.949> bit<00:04:58.219> closer<00:04:58.599> although<00:04:59.599> it's

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
looked a little bit closer although it's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.230 
looked a little bit closer although it's
