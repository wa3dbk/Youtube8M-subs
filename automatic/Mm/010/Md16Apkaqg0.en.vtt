what we can get and for the first one we
get<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> plug<00:00:29.070> 1<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.580> ascendant<00:00:30.119> energies

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
get the plug 1 and ascendant energies

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.260 
get the plug 1 and ascendant energies
and<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.140> mode<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.410> light<00:00:31.859> let's<00:00:32.850> go<00:00:33.030> into<00:00:33.180> the
