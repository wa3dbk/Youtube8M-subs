00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.329
 that nothing will start to show how 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.039
 consists of this super cool game 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.199
 we just have to go unlocking 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.150
 boards in this case as you are seeing 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.310
 I for example I only have unlocked 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.480

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.640

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.829
 tips to be able to mark the objective 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.320
 is to score goals as the game is called 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.180
 score so nothing simply we have 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 than using the touch interface to 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.469
 we in this case can score goals 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.210
 either taking a step to our partner 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.380
 directly chutando here for example 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 is giving me an indication that 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.469
 I can rotate the camera and they are 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.329
 saying what would be the procedure 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.490
 I have to pass to my partner and my 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.070
 partner is the one who has to kick 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.869
 how are you seeing like that agree here 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.759
 I scored a goal to the first such and 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.290
 as they say emulating a bit the goal 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.149

 game consists of emulating and reviving goals 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.310
 because already marked in real life we are going to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.439

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.890
 example the goal that I have to score in 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.869
 turkey kazakhstan that was marked on 3 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.179
 September 2010 I have to move on to my 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.740
 partner so what I see here gives me 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.420
 small tips use the tips for 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.149
 kick and the perfect path to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.799
 your shot let's see let's see if 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.330
 I get in this case to move 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.539
 partner 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.799
 let's see where I want the pass 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.679
 come let's see if my 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.970
 perfect mate uses shots now if 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:56.799
 you are having problems to execute 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.200
 successfully a shot or a pass we're going to 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.720
 try this function and I just put a 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.549
 awesome goal guys is from the game 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.130
 It's fantastic, especially to get rid of you 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.810
 it is immune that some will have when 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.250
 ends a football game or when 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.479
 you are waiting to do something because 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.360
 It is the typical game that does not require 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.950
 think simply of kicking is very book 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.850
 very very fun let's go to the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.680
 next level japan 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.600
 here for example I guess that what 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.920
 I have to score is a direct goal I think 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.800
 that this one is going to fail but we are going to 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.620
 try to kick directly hugo that 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.060
 bad I'm very deer very blind let's go to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.970
 try again and if you did not mark a 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 golden shot of those is worth this consists 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.570
 that with the touch screen we 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790
 we mark the trajectory of the ball of 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.830
 agreement we can do well let's see if 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.300
 we do it well we're going to try to cheat 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.560
 with the trajectory nothing this goalkeeper is 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.800
 unbeatable so let's try to use 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.330
 a shot of gold and have set us come 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.340
 we have removed this bad drink and we are going to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.780
 move to the next level and with this 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.340
 close the video because I think it has 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.790
 its operation is quite clear 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.710

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.260
 mate will be the one who has to blame 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.060

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.670
