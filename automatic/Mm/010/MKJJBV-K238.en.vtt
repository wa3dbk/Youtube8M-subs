00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 bugs and show more giving 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.750
 continuation of that assessment of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.559
 Then a big question from him is 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 referring to this component here pd 16 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.299
 that sk 10 45 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.039
 Martyr began with me the first day 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.350
 for almost an hour and an hour and 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.050
 little on the stamp on the cell phone 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.680
 and when he mentioned that the model of the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.599
 s calfat component Liomar csk 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.189
 usually is code used in bridge 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 rectifier 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.309
 Are you telling me to want an offer? 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.660
 but generally used code of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.270
 bridge rectifier 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 but it's ok I went I went 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.450
 evaluate that we can study that we also 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 do not know everything not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.280
 so it 's no one on the diagram when you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.510
 will do the diagram evaluation 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.719
 it's schematic is a great 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.260
 tool that helps a lot of people is in the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.480
 diagnosis is the use of is and is 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.239
 acrobat reader and this for you 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 read the pdfs because this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.400
 much easier at the time of your search than 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 for example you come in here and you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 places the model of the component 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.560
 It 's written on the plate 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.479
 usually have an associated code 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:25.259
 You come here in edit you will edit 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:30.060
 locate I came back akp from 16 and ask for 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.820
 to automatically find acrobat 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.759
 network it will gives you the position of the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.409
 component lets show you is to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.250
 you have a notion the rain has 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.960
 who play here for 75 in the preview 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.799
 so look how interesting when I 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.369
 I put here p of 16 what he does 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.390
 Network combat selection is a highlight of 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.320
 components is fantastic this helps 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.049
 very 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.030
 so come on let's look at the 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.149
 believe that pd 16 he is up 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 selected here okay so by 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.390
 diagram confirmed what I had 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.410
 actually is not a transistor. 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.000
 mosfet and a diode is not okay 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.790
 who looks here 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.250
 it will look and where or not where else 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.650
 would be a bridge rectifier 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.470
 what is a bridge rectifier a bridge 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.240
 rectifier a set of diodes right 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 then this diagram and drawing here 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.610
 it's a little bit boring it would be more or less 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.270
 You see, do not occupy 12 on floor 3 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.640
 then it would pin a pin one attached to a 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.700
 pin diode 2 connected to a diode and 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.950
 joining the exit at 3 good good if I 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.890
 I had to pose, it's easy. Let's go because I 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.750
 had a current alternating current 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.260
 alternating here I will have a current 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.150
 continuous a network a rectifier is good 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.709
 my machine is very slow understood 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.930
 Why am I going through all this? 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.489
 that virus fight here but here it is 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.459
 It's very simple for us to understand reading 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.170
 that's good, so let's observe the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.360
 Question of pd 16 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.140
 so it is what a rectifying bridge 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.130
 I 've even looked at natashi to the rate 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.590
 that I will not open because the machine 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.410
 is very slow then by the diagram 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.950
 you will notice that he is what he 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.170
 He's an idiot, he's not a bridge. 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.970
 can make a set of 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.959
 gold can be two can be late can 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.260
 to be four 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:29.070
 so let's note here is is the big 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.630
 entry here where you will enter the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.760
 power supply 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.810
 here I connector he connected that I 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.180
 I told you that I did not like the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.709
 weld quality 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.810
 I'll try to go back there to show you 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.160
 You have here I did not like the 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.519
 government not liking what I see 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.790
 the soldering here then is let me come back 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:55.040
 here it is entered that the power supply 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.930
 source you notice that on the floor 3 pin 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.810
 314 pin 10 and pinot is connected to the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.250
 negative such negative source legacy 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.910
 then in the case a power pin 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.100
 by positive goes at 3 right and it comes out 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.769
 on pin one and on the 2nd floor 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.920
 so the 19 volts of 12 flights does not matter 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:16.769
 the voltage that enters here in the connector it 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.280
 enters the floor 3 to 1 at the pin 12 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.220
 negative is going to 14 10 and 9 connected to 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.900
 carcass, and here it is also linked to hunting 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.560
 the other side the connector here has a 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.870
 capacitor 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.190
 The fact is that it is connected together with 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.220
 attention 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.190
 so here you should find the same 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.220
 attention you have when you average 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.730
 right source so you can measure here 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.620
 gave 19 has to give 19 right here gave 19 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.930
 who did not give it here 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.110
 the connector is not seated can be 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.510
 Let go with problem, okay, how 's it going? 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.370
 can do a continuity test boot the 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.780
 reason on the stairs average continuity 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.889
 three by one have to drive and measured 45 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.470
 you have to drive that is connected to the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.210
 album to negative 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.440
 giving continuance it will come here 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.610
 is that you have to measure the voltage 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:12.979
 nominal right again be ok to be 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.500
 alternately, well, that source is playing 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.729
 alternating here will enter two micro wire 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.560
 of coils 202 coil and here you 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.690
 have to be careful attention you have 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.250
 here and here you have to be aware that 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.530
 she should give a download should give a 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:33.840
 then crush what he will do and will 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:37.160
 to enter this is in this bridge rectifier 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.490
 Okay then here if I got back 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.380
 alternating 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.370
 after the game has to have volts 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.680
 to be continued 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.289
 Okay, so it's alternating on pin one and 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.600
 two of the 16 pd and here I will have continuous 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.580
 Okay, so you have a zink capacitor to 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.520
 make a filter and here in front of a 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.919
 big secret that is pd 14 which is a 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.880
 Game baby joe 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:05.310
 let's suppose you had 19 there entered 19 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.340
 rectified fell to 19 and here we go 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.600
 because this game being 12 volts 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.860
 it will make that voltage drop to 12 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.169
 example volts the bike has to know 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.700
 Tell me, if it's done from here, it's okay. 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:22.820
 Let me take a break in the new video 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.820
 for power is not to hang around a little
