00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there it's kind of interesting I find

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
there it's kind of interesting I find
the<00:01:10.290> darker<00:01:10.740> colors<00:01:11.100> blend<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> hair

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the darker colors blend in with the hair

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.719 
the darker colors blend in with the hair
a<00:01:12.510> bit<00:01:12.659> more<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.500> almost<00:01:13.680> hard<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
a bit more so it's like almost hard to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.520 
a bit more so it's like almost hard to
tell<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.090> apart<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> hair<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
tell it apart from the hair but with the

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.280 
tell it apart from the hair but with the
lighter<00:01:16.770> colors<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.460> less<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.450> an<00:01:18.600> issue<00:01:18.869> for

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
lighter colors it's less of an issue for

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.240 
lighter colors it's less of an issue for
me<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.619> that's<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:21.180> opinion<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> I'll

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
me but that's just my opinion and I'll
