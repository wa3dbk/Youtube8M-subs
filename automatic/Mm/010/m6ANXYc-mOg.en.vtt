00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.459
 welcome to one here 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.320
 another video from your uni hall gives 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.179
 it has been 5 video again for a long time 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.449
 to be precise, I started the 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:22.029
 clubman about evaluating or I make 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.970
 the video about the first two best 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.199
 place and say something to me 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.740
 actually planned three places 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.449
 however , the third place was not like that 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.680
 not working that for me before 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.020
 thought 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.300
 the clock itself was really cool 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.780
 made but she just did not like that 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.949
 works like me that a building 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.329
 that means as much as you can 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.350
 decane time counts because the numbers themselves 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.039
 a bit wild 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.989
 jumped 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.809
 which was a pity , therefore 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.489
 I have to omit the place however 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.239
 the subsequent massively less 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.879
 liked 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.949
 So these are the 20 kids 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.340
 Compensation came to me to fit 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.010
 to have 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 and now I will give you the first time 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:08.170
 show second place 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.170
 the second place 3 4 from 20 07 04 o'clock 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.549
 is just done right do not know 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.950
 whether you have the version 10 752 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.090
 works in the current games i 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.890
 I'm still hanging on only two 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.060
 stayed there safe white 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.229
 the competitor works there 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.860
 a bit older and not me 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.850
 master 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.320
 from the versions 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.170
 I've been there since 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 no longer played but no matter 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 I will now briefly outside first 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.270
 function in the clock show the rest 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.030
 is real 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.860
 you can watch how you watch a minute 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.290
 counting 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.080
 ten minutes thuns will be an hour 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 and coppenbrügge 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.710
 but is really well made 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.520
 works fine too 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.950
 as well as the setlist start 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.509
 it just takes something happens 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.450
 I'll try everything ready then I will 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.770
 start fast 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.229
 and let the whole run wonder become times 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.090
 a little bit already 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.810
 Incidentally, the measures garden are 1 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 I eat 20 times 20 blocks 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.940
 totally good the technology'm sure of 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.350
 not very good 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.220
 but I will not do that much 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.660
 say strayed again 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 I will wait so long until the first 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.360
 so part of it is the duo 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.310
 really minutes exactly 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.850
 looked the ccia has a second 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.650
 But you can give me one like that 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:43.100
 hour beyond 221 222 so it is 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.109
 I already work for him 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.519
 very grateful for the clock so youngest 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.560
 I liked something similar 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.299
 to do as well 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:58.180
 I even did that, too 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:03:00.410
 However, an apple paper works 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.630
 If you had not enough for the competition 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.150
 has qualified and because i am the usa 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.530
 do not tell them a bit 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.760
 exactly those have 1 now 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.859
 and I will know what I am 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.390
 not say 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:20.200
 So the system works like me 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.200
 has fully noticed 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.359
 are scrutinized 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:34.239
 Almost everything is left here 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.930
 I do not know if I can think that 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.930
 I am made each other 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.560
 I am that one night form one 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.660
 27 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.170
 so that's how you use reset yours from these 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.750
 pay that means this fell black 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.880
 is paying in less what is this here 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.050
 that does not stop exactly 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:05.390
 In any case we were the something 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:08.010
 special do that then a system 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.890
 bit in it, we are for example in 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.160
 hessens covers defines with which one 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.030
 special values ​​increase again 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.540
 here a certain value high 14 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.290
 or spend directly 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.290
 We'll probably have it down here 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:28.010
 So police 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:32.750
 What happened naturally? 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.530
 we also panicked in the customer's channel 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.940
 can do it all in the 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.220
 description after look and that has 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.240
 Download yourself there 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.210
 and maybe you will find the technology 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.960
 So I'm a little bit about it 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.370
 expand 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:49.460
 it is in any case not so much only 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.710
 two times to space I what you everything 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.220
 I still have a few holes left 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:56.690
 wants to give me white lust with me like 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.650
 often they will just do so a 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.780
 bit too dry then you can not 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.600
 Report with me just for me 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.820
 will you answer or announce 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.750
 then we can record him resp 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:11.600
 play something on what you have to 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.950
 You Cabinets Everything was up to the 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.730
 s video I would be back for now 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:21.590
 say goodbye to place one 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.000
 given and by then say goodbye 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:26.560
