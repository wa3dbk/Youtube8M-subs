 Brazil and one of the best selling cars 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.810

 inner space and trunk of the segment 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.980
 stand out in the most important segment 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.410

 of sales is no easy task 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.550
 internal 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.900
 among the main novelties of the new 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.150
 generation is its construction on a 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.879
 new platform with a new structure 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.369

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.110
 direction and new suspensions 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.539
 moreover the design was totally 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.539

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.659
 assigning fluidity 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.030
 the taillights also gain the 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.890
 the bumper reinforces the robustness of the model 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.259
 continuing with the philosophy of bringing 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.630
