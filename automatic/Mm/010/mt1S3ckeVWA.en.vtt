here a couple of helical antennas now
these<00:00:15.650> are<00:00:16.040> high<00:00:16.309> gain<00:00:16.610> antennas<00:00:17.180> for<00:00:17.840> use

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
these are high gain antennas for use

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.900 
these are high gain antennas for use
with<00:00:18.200> circularly<00:00:18.710> polarized<00:00:19.310> systems<00:00:19.730> it's

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
with circularly polarized systems it's

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.540 
with circularly polarized systems it's
we<00:00:20.030> have<00:00:20.150> a<00:00:20.410> skew<00:00:21.410> planer<00:00:21.740> or<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.100> cloverleaf

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
we have a skew planer or a cloverleaf

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.610 
we have a skew planer or a cloverleaf
antenna<00:00:23.119> on<00:00:23.270> your<00:00:23.390> transmitter<00:00:23.720> then<00:00:24.320> these

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 
antenna on your transmitter then these

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.410 
antenna on your transmitter then these
antennas<00:00:25.190> will<00:00:25.700> give<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:25.970> a<00:00:26.030> whole<00:00:26.210> lot<00:00:26.300> of

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
antennas will give you a whole lot of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.360 
antennas will give you a whole lot of
gain<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:26.750> like<00:00:26.870> a<00:00:26.900> yogi<00:00:27.380> or<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.560> patch<00:00:27.830> but<00:00:28.220> they

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:28.370 
gain but like a yogi or a patch but they

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.940 
gain but like a yogi or a patch but they
work<00:00:28.580> with<00:00:29.060> circularly<00:00:29.600> polarized<00:00:30.140> radio

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
work with circularly polarized radio

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.799 
work with circularly polarized radio
signals<00:00:31.340> which<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.580> great<00:00:31.820> because<00:00:32.059> on<00:00:32.300> 5.8

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
signals which is great because on 5.8

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.420 
signals which is great because on 5.8
you<00:00:32.899> really<00:00:33.230> need<00:00:33.379> circular<00:00:33.770> polarization<00:00:34.340> to

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
you really need circular polarization to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.010 
you really need circular polarization to
avoid<00:00:34.640> all<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:35.030> multipathing<00:00:35.780> and

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
avoid all the multipathing and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.660 
avoid all the multipathing and
reflections<00:00:36.469> and<00:00:36.559> the<00:00:36.649> little<00:00:37.070> dropouts<00:00:37.460> and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
reflections and the little dropouts and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.160 
reflections and the little dropouts and
all<00:00:37.730> sorts<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:37.969> stuff<00:00:38.149> so<00:00:38.300> that's<00:00:38.540> what<00:00:39.079> you

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
all sorts of stuff so that's what you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.110 
all sorts of stuff so that's what you
need<00:00:39.260> now<00:00:39.410> I've<00:00:39.679> got<00:00:39.980> two<00:00:40.249> here<00:00:40.519> and<00:00:40.640> it's

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
need now I've got two here and it's

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.549 
need now I've got two here and it's
really<00:00:41.480> interesting<00:00:41.719> they<00:00:42.109> represent

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
really interesting they represent

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.259 
really interesting they represent
opposite<00:00:43.010> ends<00:00:43.429> of<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.550> spectrum<00:00:43.789> in<00:00:44.239> terms

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
opposite ends of the spectrum in terms

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.329 
opposite ends of the spectrum in terms
of<00:00:44.539> quality<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.140> performance<00:00:45.679> and<00:00:46.219> let's

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
of quality and performance and let's

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.009 
of quality and performance and let's
have<00:00:46.429> a<00:00:46.489> close<00:00:46.730> look<00:00:46.940> at<00:00:47.059> them<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.390> see<00:00:47.809> why

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
have a close look at them and see why

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.899 
have a close look at them and see why
they're<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:48.530> different<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:49.219> here<00:00:49.489> they<00:00:49.670> are

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:49.909 
they're so different and here they are

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:51.970 
they're so different and here they are
we've<00:00:50.269> got<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:50.839> is<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.109> one<00:00:51.260> from<00:00:51.409> Circular

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
we've got this is the one from Circular

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.369 
we've got this is the one from Circular
Wireless<00:00:52.579> and<00:00:52.789> it's<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.690> quite<00:00:53.899> expensive

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
Wireless and it's it's quite expensive

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.959 
Wireless and it's it's quite expensive
this<00:00:54.769> is<00:00:54.920> one<00:00:55.069> from<00:00:55.309> I<00:00:55.460> got<00:00:55.609> this<00:00:55.670> one<00:00:55.819> from

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
this is one from I got this one from

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.290 
this is one from I got this one from
high<00:00:56.210> model<00:00:56.539> and<00:00:56.690> it's<00:00:57.079> quite<00:00:57.379> cheap<00:00:57.800> now<00:00:58.579> what

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
high model and it's quite cheap now what

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.969 
high model and it's quite cheap now what
about<00:00:59.449> value<00:00:59.839> because<00:01:00.079> everyone<00:01:00.499> knows<00:01:00.829> about

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
about value because everyone knows about

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.500 
about value because everyone knows about
price<00:01:01.339> you<00:01:01.550> can<00:01:01.670> tell<00:01:01.789> a<00:01:01.819> price<00:01:02.059> by<00:01:02.239> looking<00:01:02.420> at

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
price you can tell a price by looking at

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.270 
price you can tell a price by looking at
the<00:01:02.569> sticker<00:01:02.749> but<00:01:03.319> what<00:01:03.440> about<00:01:03.649> the<00:01:03.739> value<00:01:04.129> how

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the sticker but what about the value how

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.920 
the sticker but what about the value how
well<00:01:04.489> do<00:01:04.640> these<00:01:04.790> things<00:01:05.000> work<00:01:05.150> well<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.840> be

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
well do these things work well to be

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.390 
well do these things work well to be
honest<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.290> really<00:01:06.350> don't<00:01:06.830> have<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.159> do<00:01:07.250> much

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
honest I really don't have to do much

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.890 
honest I really don't have to do much
more<00:01:07.610> than<00:01:07.670> look<00:01:07.909> at<00:01:08.030> these<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.390> see<00:01:08.540> which<00:01:08.720> one

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
more than look at these to see which one

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.060 
more than look at these to see which one
of<00:01:08.930> these<00:01:09.050> is<00:01:09.110> going<00:01:09.440> to<00:01:09.500> work<00:01:09.620> really<00:01:09.830> well

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
of these is going to work really well

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.550 
of these is going to work really well
and<00:01:10.640> which<00:01:10.880> one<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.299> really<00:01:12.079> not<00:01:12.200> going<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.500> be

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
and which one is really not going to be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.200 
and which one is really not going to be
very<00:01:12.799> good<00:01:13.040> at<00:01:13.219> all<00:01:13.369> let's<00:01:13.670> let's<00:01:13.909> do<00:01:14.060> some

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
very good at all let's let's do some

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.910 
very good at all let's let's do some
comparisons<00:01:14.689> now<00:01:14.840> as<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.469> can<00:01:15.590> see<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.799> one

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
comparisons now as you can see the one

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.200 
comparisons now as you can see the one
from<00:01:16.070> Circular<00:01:16.490> Wireless<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.880> has<00:01:17.030> this

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
from Circular Wireless it has this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.660 
from Circular Wireless it has this
plastic<00:01:17.930> formers<00:01:18.530> over<00:01:18.770> there's<00:01:19.159> no<00:01:19.310> way<00:01:19.490> this

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
plastic formers over there's no way this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.819 
plastic formers over there's no way this
wire<00:01:19.969> can<00:01:20.210> move<00:01:20.479> it's<00:01:20.780> really<00:01:21.140> rigidly<00:01:21.500> held

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
wire can move it's really rigidly held

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.620 
wire can move it's really rigidly held
on<00:01:22.280> that<00:01:22.549> plastic<00:01:22.880> form<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.180> has<00:01:23.299> a<00:01:23.329> solid

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
on that plastic form it has a solid

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.679 
on that plastic form it has a solid
metal<00:01:24.049> base<00:01:24.289> as<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.579> see<00:01:25.729> there<00:01:25.939> in<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.149> SMA

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
metal base as you can see there in a SMA

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.990 
metal base as you can see there in a SMA
connector<00:01:27.079> and<00:01:27.380> if<00:01:27.680> we<00:01:28.070> could<00:01:28.189> do<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.280> close-up

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
connector and if we could do a close-up

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.429 
connector and if we could do a close-up
look<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.509> can<00:01:29.659> see<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:29.990> where<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.259> wire

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
look you can see that where the wire

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.230 
look you can see that where the wire
comes<00:01:30.469> through<00:01:31.159> notice<00:01:31.490> how<00:01:31.579> close<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.119> to

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
comes through notice how close it is to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.700 
comes through notice how close it is to
that<00:01:32.360> base<00:01:32.630> there<00:01:32.930> at<00:01:33.049> the<00:01:33.110> bottom<00:01:33.259> edges<00:01:33.469> down

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
that base there at the bottom edges down

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.440 
that base there at the bottom edges down
here<00:01:33.890> notice<00:01:34.219> how<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:34.520> hugs<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.909> base<00:01:35.180> there

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
here notice how it hugs the base there

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.749 
here notice how it hugs the base there
and<00:01:35.600> that<00:01:36.170> provides<00:01:36.530> what<00:01:36.770> they<00:01:36.859> call<00:01:37.039> some

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
and that provides what they call some

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.279 
and that provides what they call some
matching<00:01:38.240> it<00:01:38.329> provides<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.659> level<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.960> matching

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
matching it provides a level of matching

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.289 
matching it provides a level of matching
so<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:39.710> signal<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:40.670> comes<00:01:40.759> down<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.119> wire

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
so the signal that comes down that wire

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.969 
so the signal that comes down that wire
is<00:01:41.539> closely<00:01:41.960> matched<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.590> actual

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
is closely matched to the actual

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.980 
is closely matched to the actual
impedance<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.210> cable<00:01:44.600> we're<00:01:44.780> using

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
impedance of the cable we're using

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.230 
impedance of the cable we're using
through<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.619> SMA<00:01:46.039> connector<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:47.060> means

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
through the SMA connector so that means

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.529 
through the SMA connector so that means
this<00:01:47.390> has<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.600> low<00:01:47.930> SW<00:01:48.799> are<00:01:49.009> most<00:01:50.000> of<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:50.210> energy

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
this has a low SW are most of the energy

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.669 
this has a low SW are most of the energy
that<00:01:50.630> comes<00:01:50.780> down<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.020> wire<00:01:51.259> will<00:01:51.439> actually

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
that comes down the wire will actually

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.020 
that comes down the wire will actually
end<00:01:51.799> up<00:01:51.859> going<00:01:52.039> out<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.549> cable<00:01:52.820> into<00:01:53.000> your

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
end up going out the cable into your

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.849 
end up going out the cable into your
receiver<00:01:53.359> so<00:01:53.659> it<00:01:53.689> will<00:01:53.899> transfer<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.619> lot<00:01:54.770> of

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:54.859 
receiver so it will transfer a lot of

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:56.139 
receiver so it will transfer a lot of
that<00:01:54.950> receive<00:01:55.250> signal<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.729> your<00:01:55.789> receive<00:01:56.060> you

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
that receive signal to your receive you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.419 
that receive signal to your receive you
get<00:01:56.270> good<00:01:56.479> results<00:01:56.509> with<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.649> and<00:01:57.890> because

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
get good results with that and because

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.609 
get good results with that and because
this<00:01:58.579> why<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.060> can't<00:01:59.479> change<00:02:00.020> in<00:02:00.200> dimensions

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
this why I can't change in dimensions

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.679 
this why I can't change in dimensions
can't<00:02:00.890> bend<00:02:01.490> or<00:02:01.609> twist<00:02:01.640> then<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.539> going<00:02:02.630> to

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
can't bend or twist then it's going to

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.840 
can't bend or twist then it's going to
be<00:02:02.780> consistent<00:02:03.229> from<00:02:03.590> one<00:02:03.770> day<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.009> another<00:02:04.310> in

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
be consistent from one day to another in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.310 
be consistent from one day to another in
terms<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.270> performance<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.109> that's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
terms of the performance so that's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.690 
terms of the performance so that's
brilliant<00:02:06.619> this<00:02:06.829> is<00:02:06.920> obviously<00:02:07.219> made<00:02:07.429> from

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
brilliant this is obviously made from

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.719 
brilliant this is obviously made from
looks<00:02:08.149> like<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> laser<00:02:08.570> cut<00:02:08.840> acrylic<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.729> it's

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
looks like a laser cut acrylic and it's

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.120 
looks like a laser cut acrylic and it's
really<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.450> nicely<00:02:12.110> made<00:02:12.140> little<00:02:12.800> piece<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
really a nicely made little piece of

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.950 
really a nicely made little piece of
antenna<00:02:13.520> with<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> good<00:02:14.300> quality<00:02:14.450> semi

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
antenna with a good quality semi

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.839 
antenna with a good quality semi
connector<00:02:15.379> they're<00:02:15.560> gold-plated<00:02:16.519> for

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
connector they're gold-plated for

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.390 
connector they're gold-plated for
minimum<00:02:17.150> loss<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:17.750> yeah<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> like<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.860> like

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
minimum loss so yeah I like that I like

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.350 
minimum loss so yeah I like that I like
that<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.790> lot

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
that a lot

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.120 
that a lot

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
I'm sure either company's selling but

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.960 
I'm sure either company's selling but
it's<00:02:26.650> obviously<00:02:26.890> made<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.310> China<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:27.790> if<00:02:27.880> you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
it's obviously made in China now if you

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.640 
it's obviously made in China now if you
look<00:02:28.120> at<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.840> see<00:02:29.110> where<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.410> wire

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
look at it you can see where that wire

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.750 
look at it you can see where that wire
comes<00:02:29.980> through<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.190> bit<00:02:30.280> harder<00:02:30.520> with<00:02:30.640> the

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
comes through it's bit harder with the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.370 
comes through it's bit harder with the
reflections<00:02:31.210> here<00:02:31.330> but<00:02:31.480> where<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.200> wire

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
reflections here but where that wire

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.230 
reflections here but where that wire
comes<00:02:32.710> through<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.760> can<00:02:33.850> see<00:02:33.940> it's<00:02:34.030> actually

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
comes through you can see it's actually

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.060 
comes through you can see it's actually
a<00:02:34.270> long<00:02:34.630> way<00:02:34.840> from<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.110> back<00:02:35.260> reflector<00:02:35.830> here

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
a long way from the back reflector here

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.460 
a long way from the back reflector here
that<00:02:36.820> probably<00:02:37.750> means<00:02:37.900> they're<00:02:38.110> not<00:02:38.140> using

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that probably means they're not using

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.810 
that probably means they're not using
any<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.010> matching<00:02:39.370> they<00:02:39.460> haven't<00:02:39.670> tested

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
any kind of matching they haven't tested

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.790 
any kind of matching they haven't tested
these<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.270> see<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> that<00:02:40.810> actually<00:02:41.020> match

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
these to see that that actually match

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.900 
these to see that that actually match
properly<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> lot<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.460> the<00:02:42.580> signal<00:02:42.850> that

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
properly so a lot of the signal that

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.150 
properly so a lot of the signal that
comes<00:02:43.120> down<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.480> wire<00:02:43.660> may<00:02:44.230> end<00:02:44.500> up<00:02:44.710> just

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
comes down this wire may end up just

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.860 
comes down this wire may end up just
being<00:02:45.220> lost<00:02:45.640> by<00:02:45.820> bouncing<00:02:46.240> back<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.570> due<00:02:46.750> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
being lost by bouncing back out due to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.480 
being lost by bouncing back out due to
the<00:02:46.990> poor<00:02:47.200> match<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:47.920> look<00:02:48.010> at<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.190> also

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the poor match and look at this also

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.910 
the poor match and look at this also
look<00:02:48.700> see<00:02:49.660> this<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> why<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.560> completely

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
look see this is why it's completely

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.100 
look see this is why it's completely
free<00:02:51.160> to<00:02:51.310> move<00:02:51.540> inside<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.690> plastic<00:02:53.080> tube

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
free to move inside this plastic tube

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.080 
free to move inside this plastic tube
it's<00:02:54.040> ridiculous<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.610> means<00:02:54.910> there's

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it's ridiculous that means there's

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.150 
it's ridiculous that means there's
there's<00:02:55.420> no<00:02:56.290> way<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.680> be<00:02:56.770> sure<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.130> not

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
there's no way you can be sure it's not

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.240 
there's no way you can be sure it's not
going<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.460> be<00:02:57.580> altered<00:02:58.420> or<00:02:58.570> even<00:02:59.410> vibration

I'm<00:03:03.340> not<00:03:03.580> impressed<00:03:03.850> with<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.150> at<00:03:04.330> all<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.840> also

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
I'm not impressed with it at all it also

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.230 
I'm not impressed with it at all it also
has<00:03:05.320> an<00:03:05.470> SMA<00:03:05.830> connector<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:06.280> one<00:03:06.880> thing<00:03:07.090> with

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
has an SMA connector but one thing with

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.150 
has an SMA connector but one thing with
noting<00:03:07.540> is<00:03:07.630> look<00:03:07.750> at<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.960> size<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
noting is look at the size of the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.040 
noting is look at the size of the
reflectors<00:03:09.940> held<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.330> zoom<00:03:10.570> out<00:03:10.690> of<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.900> here

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
reflectors held on a zoom out of it here

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.330 
reflectors held on a zoom out of it here
that's<00:03:11.470> right<00:03:11.620> look<00:03:11.740> at<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:11.950> size<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that's right look at the size the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.590 
that's right look at the size the
reflectors<00:03:12.910> you'll<00:03:13.030> notice<00:03:13.270> it<00:03:13.360> on<00:03:13.420> this

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
reflectors you'll notice it on this

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.870 
reflectors you'll notice it on this
circular<00:03:13.930> wireless<00:03:14.170> one<00:03:14.320> there's<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.500> huge

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
circular wireless one there's a huge

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.000 
circular wireless one there's a huge
base<00:03:15.880> plate<00:03:16.150> there<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.960> the<00:03:17.170> Chinese<00:03:17.500> one<00:03:17.710> it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
base plate there on the Chinese one it's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.120 
base plate there on the Chinese one it's
really<00:03:18.430> quite<00:03:18.700> small<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.530> me<00:03:20.530> you<00:03:20.740> notice<00:03:20.980> it

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
really quite small and me you notice it

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.460 
really quite small and me you notice it
also<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:22.000> has<00:03:22.240> its<00:03:22.450> connector<00:03:23.050> right<00:03:23.200> in<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
also this has its connector right in the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.210 
also this has its connector right in the
middle<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.920> where<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.890> circular<00:03:26.890> wireless

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
middle so where is the circular wireless

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.010 
middle so where is the circular wireless
one<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.330> helical<00:03:28.690> doesn't<00:03:28.900> actually

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
one the the helical doesn't actually

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.800 
one the the helical doesn't actually
stop<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.560> go<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.830> on<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.880> cheap<00:03:31.240> Chinese<00:03:31.420> one

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
stop and go in on the cheap Chinese one

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.660 
stop and go in on the cheap Chinese one
the<00:03:32.080> helical<00:03:32.470> xpect<00:03:32.980> actually<00:03:33.250> stops<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.610> it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
the helical xpect actually stops and it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.400 
the helical xpect actually stops and it
bends<00:03:33.850> right<00:03:33.910> across<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.360> middle<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.720> now

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
bends right across the middle so now

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.860 
bends right across the middle so now
that's<00:03:35.620> not<00:03:35.830> good<00:03:36.040> not<00:03:36.430> good<00:03:36.490> at<00:03:36.730> all<00:03:36.880> but<00:03:37.480> more

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
that's not good not good at all but more

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
that's not good not good at all but more
importantly<00:03:38.410> is<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:39.130> dimensions<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:39.820> this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
importantly is the dimensions of this

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.160 
importantly is the dimensions of this
thing<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.210> you<00:03:40.300> compare<00:03:40.570> the<00:03:40.660> dimensions<00:03:40.780> of

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
thing if you compare the dimensions of

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.170 
thing if you compare the dimensions of
these<00:03:41.350> antennas<00:03:41.830> you'll<00:03:42.730> notice<00:03:43.000> something

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
these antennas you'll notice something

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.420 
these antennas you'll notice something
very<00:03:43.420> important<00:03:43.840> they're<00:03:43.960> not<00:03:44.140> actually<00:03:44.710> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
very important they're not actually the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.180 
very important they're not actually the
same<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.150> this.hi<00:03:47.110> model<00:03:47.350> one<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.890> much

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
same the this.hi model one is a much

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.400 
same the this.hi model one is a much
larger<00:03:48.580> diameter<00:03:49.090> than<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.750> circular

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
larger diameter than the circular

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.960 
larger diameter than the circular
wireless<00:03:50.890> one<00:03:51.040> which<00:03:51.460> means<00:03:51.610> it's<00:03:51.760> probably

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
wireless one which means it's probably

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.640 
wireless one which means it's probably
not<00:03:52.210> even<00:03:52.480> working<00:03:52.660> on<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.960> right<00:03:53.110> frequency

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
not even working on the right frequency

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.310 
not even working on the right frequency
I<00:03:53.860> mean<00:03:54.520> uh<00:03:54.550> you<00:03:55.240> know<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.020> people<00:03:56.260> who

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
I mean uh you know that the people who

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.350 
I mean uh you know that the people who
made<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:56.830> get<00:03:57.550> think<00:03:57.820> oh<00:03:57.970> here's<00:03:58.300> a

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
made this just get think oh here's a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.550 
made this just get think oh here's a
piece<00:03:58.510> of<00:03:58.540> plastic<00:03:58.870> tube<00:03:59.080> we<00:03:59.260> can<00:03:59.410> find

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
piece of plastic tube we can find

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.870 
piece of plastic tube we can find
somewhere<00:03:59.830> in<00:03:59.980> there<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.370> then<00:04:00.790> we<00:04:00.850> can

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
somewhere in there and then we can

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.190 
somewhere in there and then we can
solder<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.360> a<00:04:01.420> piece<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.720> copper<00:04:02.050> at<00:04:02.140> the

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
solder it to a piece of copper at the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.600 
solder it to a piece of copper at the
bottom<00:04:02.410> put<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.890> plug<00:04:03.100> on<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.280> and<00:04:03.400> we'll<00:04:03.490> call

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
bottom put a plug on it and we'll call

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.660 
bottom put a plug on it and we'll call
it<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.820> helical<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:04.930> yeah<00:04:05.620> I'm<00:04:05.950> not<00:04:06.430> totally

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
it a helical so yeah I'm not totally

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.090 
it a helical so yeah I'm not totally
impressed<00:04:07.210> with<00:04:07.390> this<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:07.930> it's<00:04:08.650> very<00:04:08.890> cheap

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
impressed with this it's it's very cheap

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.280 
impressed with this it's it's very cheap
and<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.700> mean<00:04:09.880> cheap<00:04:10.150> not<00:04:10.420> economical<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.110> mean

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
and I mean cheap not economical I mean

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.560 
and I mean cheap not economical I mean
cheap<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:12.130> what<00:04:12.250> I'm<00:04:12.340> going<00:04:12.520> to<00:04:12.580> do<00:04:12.760> is<00:04:12.940> and

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
cheap but what I'm going to do is and

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.210 
cheap but what I'm going to do is and
some<00:04:13.960> videos<00:04:14.260> coming<00:04:14.530> up<00:04:14.620> I'm<00:04:14.920> going<00:04:15.100> to<00:04:15.160> be

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
some videos coming up I'm going to be

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.220 
some videos coming up I'm going to be
doing<00:04:15.370> some<00:04:15.520> comparative<00:04:15.970> testing<00:04:16.359> now<00:04:17.109> one

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
doing some comparative testing now one

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.870 
doing some comparative testing now one
thing<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.440> noticed<00:04:17.680> also<00:04:17.830> with<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.340> that

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
thing I noticed also with this is that

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.610 
thing I noticed also with this is that
this<00:04:19.270> is<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> left-hand<00:04:19.900> polarized<00:04:20.290> this<00:04:20.440> is

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
this is a left-hand polarized this is

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.230 
this is a left-hand polarized this is
right<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:20.920> polarized<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.700> didn't<00:04:21.970> say<00:04:22.150> it

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
right and polarized this didn't say it

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.610 
right and polarized this didn't say it
was<00:04:22.330> left-hand<00:04:22.660> polarized<00:04:23.020> I<00:04:23.170> just<00:04:23.350> ordered

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
was left-hand polarized I just ordered

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.040 
was left-hand polarized I just ordered
it<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.270> got<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:25.420> be<00:04:25.540> careful<00:04:25.720> what<00:04:25.900> you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
it and so you got to be careful what you

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.780 
it and so you got to be careful what you
order<00:04:26.290> this<00:04:26.800> obviously<00:04:27.190> would<00:04:27.340> not<00:04:27.490> work<00:04:27.670> at

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
order this obviously would not work at

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.240 
order this obviously would not work at
all<00:04:27.910> well<00:04:28.180> with<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.900> right<00:04:29.650> hand<00:04:29.800> polarized

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
all well with a right hand polarized

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.900 
all well with a right hand polarized

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
I've got a set of each types of antennas

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.499 
I've got a set of each types of antennas
for<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.949> transmitter<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.909> an<00:04:37.090> upcoming<00:04:37.210> video

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
for the transmitter so an upcoming video

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.179 
for the transmitter so an upcoming video
as<00:04:37.960> soon<00:04:38.199> as<00:04:38.289> my<00:04:38.409> exemption<00:04:38.830> comes<00:04:39.009> through

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:39.189 
as soon as my exemption comes through

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:40.920 
as soon as my exemption comes through
I'll<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.729> doing<00:04:39.909> some<00:04:40.090> tests<00:04:40.599> we'll<00:04:40.719> see<00:04:40.840> how

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
I'll be doing some tests we'll see how

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.260 
I'll be doing some tests we'll see how
much<00:04:41.219> gain<00:04:42.219> these<00:04:42.400> have<00:04:42.639> and<00:04:42.849> how<00:04:42.909> much<00:04:43.000> gain

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
much gain these have and how much gain

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.379 
much gain these have and how much gain
this<00:04:43.840> has<00:04:44.080> do<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.620> comparisons<00:04:45.189> but<00:04:45.430> honestly

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
this has do the comparisons but honestly

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.390 
this has do the comparisons but honestly
when<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.960> comes<00:04:47.139> to<00:04:47.319> if<00:04:47.590> pv<00:04:48.069> gear<00:04:48.280> especially

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
when it comes to if pv gear especially

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.490 
when it comes to if pv gear especially
antennas<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.689> it<00:04:49.840> doesn't<00:04:50.139> always<00:04:50.229> pay<00:04:50.439> to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
antennas and it doesn't always pay to

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.929 
antennas and it doesn't always pay to
cut<00:04:50.740> corners<00:04:51.099> by<00:04:51.280> buying<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.639> cheap<00:04:51.819> stuff

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
cut corners by buying the cheap stuff

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.580 
cut corners by buying the cheap stuff
but<00:04:52.180> we'll<00:04:52.270> find<00:04:52.449> out<00:04:52.659> I'll<00:04:53.199> put<00:04:53.319> it<00:04:53.409> to<00:04:53.439> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
but we'll find out I'll put it to the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.140 
but we'll find out I'll put it to the
test<00:04:53.620> we'll<00:04:54.250> see<00:04:54.430> which<00:04:54.580> one<00:04:54.610> actually<00:04:54.969> works

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
test we'll see which one actually works

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.510 
test we'll see which one actually works
the<00:04:55.990> best<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.469> I<00:04:56.830> threw<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.159> old<00:04:57.250> dial

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
the best and I threw the old dial

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.010 
the best and I threw the old dial
calipers<00:04:58.030> on<00:04:58.180> these<00:04:58.330> antennas<00:04:58.719> to<00:04:58.810> get<00:04:58.930> an

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
calipers on these antennas to get an

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.140 
calipers on these antennas to get an
idea<00:04:59.319> of<00:04:59.349> that<00:04:59.439> difference<00:04:59.919> in<00:05:00.129> diameter<00:05:00.699> the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
idea of that difference in diameter the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.879 
idea of that difference in diameter the
circular<00:05:01.599> wireless<00:05:02.080> antenna<00:05:02.650> has<00:05:02.800> an

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
circular wireless antenna has an

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.749 
circular wireless antenna has an
external<00:05:03.360> diameter<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.840> about<00:05:05.289> 17<00:05:06.279> point<00:05:06.550> two

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 
external diameter of about 17 point two

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.640 
external diameter of about 17 point two
millimeters<00:05:07.300> which<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.509> about<00:05:07.750> right<00:05:07.990> for<00:05:08.169> 5.8

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
millimeters which is about right for 5.8

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.869 
millimeters which is about right for 5.8
gigahertz<00:05:08.889> on<00:05:09.189> the<00:05:09.250> band's<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.580> on<00:05:09.789> the

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
gigahertz on the band's we on the

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.050 
gigahertz on the band's we on the
frequencies<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.479> use<00:05:10.629> this<00:05:11.729> nineteen<00:05:12.729> point

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
frequencies we use this nineteen point

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.580 
frequencies we use this nineteen point
five<00:05:13.300> so<00:05:13.569> it's<00:05:13.659> two<00:05:13.870> millimeters<00:05:14.409> bigger

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
five so it's two millimeters bigger

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.040 
five so it's two millimeters bigger
that's<00:05:14.830> enormous<00:05:15.330> difference<00:05:16.330> in<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.599> what

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
that's enormous difference in that what

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.559 
that's enormous difference in that what
takes<00:05:17.289> it<00:05:17.409> out<00:05:17.620> of<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.949> band<00:05:18.129> that<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:19.060> use<00:05:19.389> for

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
takes it out of the band that we use for

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.779 
takes it out of the band that we use for
it<00:05:19.689> if<00:05:19.810> PV<00:05:20.169> on<00:05:20.259> 5.8<00:05:20.770> are<00:05:21.009> bad<00:05:21.819> monkeys<00:05:22.629> so<00:05:23.259> yeah

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
it if PV on 5.8 are bad monkeys so yeah

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.010 
it if PV on 5.8 are bad monkeys so yeah
if<00:05:24.789> you<00:05:24.879> tempted<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.330> buy<00:05:25.449> one<00:05:25.629> of<00:05:25.659> these<00:05:25.779> wait

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
if you tempted to buy one of these wait

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.350 
if you tempted to buy one of these wait
till<00:05:26.259> you<00:05:26.439> see<00:05:26.650> how<00:05:26.860> works<00:05:27.520> out<00:05:27.759> in<00:05:27.909> real<00:05:28.180> world

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
till you see how works out in real world

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.700 
till you see how works out in real world
because<00:05:28.599> antennas<00:05:29.229> are<00:05:29.319> funny<00:05:29.529> things

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
because antennas are funny things

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.890 
because antennas are funny things
sometimes<00:05:30.430> they<00:05:30.490> don't<00:05:30.729> always<00:05:31.029> obey<00:05:31.180> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
sometimes they don't always obey the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.029 
sometimes they don't always obey the
laws<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.110> physics<00:05:32.349> in<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.680> way<00:05:32.770> you'd<00:05:32.949> expect

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
laws of physics in the way you'd expect

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.740 
laws of physics in the way you'd expect
so<00:05:33.460> sometimes<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.939> ones<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.240> look<00:05:34.360> dad<00:05:34.539> work

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
so sometimes the ones that look dad work

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.070 
so sometimes the ones that look dad work
well<00:05:34.990> but<00:05:36.120> we'll<00:05:37.120> find<00:05:37.270> out<00:05:37.449> in<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.839> practical

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
well but we'll find out in the practical

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.149 
well but we'll find out in the practical
test<00:05:38.349> in<00:05:38.469> the<00:05:38.529> meantime<00:05:38.680> if<00:05:38.889> you<00:05:38.949> got<00:05:39.039> any

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
test in the meantime if you got any

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.200 
test in the meantime if you got any
questions<00:05:39.639> stick<00:05:39.909> them<00:05:40.000> on<00:05:40.089> the<00:05:40.150> video

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
questions stick them on the video

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.180 
questions stick them on the video
comments<00:05:40.779> on<00:05:40.839> the<00:05:40.930> video<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.379> stay<00:05:41.979> tuned

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
comments on the video and stay tuned

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.559 
comments on the video and stay tuned
because<00:05:42.250> there's<00:05:42.550> more<00:05:42.729> stuff<00:05:43.210> coming<00:05:43.270> up

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:43.569 
because there's more stuff coming up

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:44.700 
because there's more stuff coming up
hopefully<00:05:43.750> with<00:05:44.020> lots<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.259> flight<00:05:44.409> videos

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
hopefully with lots of flight videos

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.579 
hopefully with lots of flight videos
very<00:05:45.250> soon<00:05:45.400> in<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:45.819> meantime<00:05:45.849> from<00:05:46.779> me<00:05:47.080> it's

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:47.589 
very soon in the meantime from me it's

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.639 
very soon in the meantime from me it's
back<00:05:48.069> to<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.490> bench
