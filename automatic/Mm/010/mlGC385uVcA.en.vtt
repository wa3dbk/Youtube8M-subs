00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.539 

right<00:00:04.049> we've<00:00:04.350> proved<00:00:04.740> it<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.040> principle<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
right we've proved it the principle of

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.849 
right we've proved it the principle of
induction<00:00:05.879> employed<00:00:06.569> no<00:00:06.839> no<00:00:07.170> start<00:00:07.589> again

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
induction employed no no start again

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.190 
induction employed no no start again
we've<00:00:08.040> proved<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.540> well<00:00:09.809> ordering

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
we've proved that the well ordering

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.410 
we've proved that the well ordering
principle<00:00:10.639> implies<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.969> principal

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
principle implies the principal

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
principle implies the principal
abduction<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.320> now<00:00:13.469> let's<00:00:13.799> prove<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
abduction so now let's prove that the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.220 
abduction so now let's prove that the
principle<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.670> strong<00:00:15.089> induction<00:00:15.450> implies

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
principle of strong induction implies

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.230 
principle of strong induction implies
the<00:00:16.500> well<00:00:16.710> ordering<00:00:16.920> principle<00:00:17.119> so<00:00:18.119> we're

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the well ordering principle so we're

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.830 
the well ordering principle so we're
going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.510> do<00:00:18.630> strong<00:00:19.170> induction<00:00:20.840> implies

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
going to do strong induction implies

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.859 
going to do strong induction implies
well<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.150> we've<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> do<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
well for so what we've got to do is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.130 
well for so what we've got to do is
prove<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.949> some<00:00:26.310> statement<00:00:27.029> about<00:00:27.390> sets<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
prove you some statement about sets to

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.400 
prove you some statement about sets to
prove<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:29.210> well<00:00:30.210> rings<00:00:30.630> cute<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.230> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
prove that well rings cute so the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:41.530 
prove that well rings cute so the
statement<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:33.050> unless<00:00:34.370> he<00:00:35.370> n

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.670 

statements

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.819 

in

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.420 
in
and<00:00:47.300> is<00:00:48.440> in<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:50.519> set

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
and is in a set

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:03.230 
and is in a set
and<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:54.350> has<00:00:54.620> a<00:00:54.650> least<00:00:54.980> amount

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:03.240 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.980 

okay<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.590> now<00:01:04.920> let's<00:01:05.310> try<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> prove<00:01:06.330> by

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
okay so now let's try and prove by

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
okay so now let's try and prove by
strong<00:01:07.500> induction<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> fats<00:01:10.860> being<00:01:11.250> true

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
strong induction this fats being true

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.380 
strong induction this fats being true
for<00:01:11.910> every<00:01:12.330> n<00:01:12.570> because<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.650> prove<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.390> for

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
for every n because if we prove that for

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
for every n because if we prove that for
every<00:01:15.660> end<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.020> we've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.560> every<00:01:16.830> non

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
every end then we've got that every non

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.530 
every end then we've got that every non
and<00:01:17.400> empty<00:01:17.820> set<00:01:18.120> is<00:01:19.940> having<00:01:20.940> these<00:01:21.060> elements

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and empty set is having these elements

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
and empty set is having these elements
because<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.020> you're<00:01:22.140> not<00:01:22.170> acting<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.890> means

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because if you're not acting that means

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.800 
because if you're not acting that means
you've<00:01:23.220> got<00:01:23.400> some<00:01:23.700> n<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.390> set<00:01:25.050> okay<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
you've got some n in your set okay so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.950 
you've got some n in your set okay so
first<00:01:27.810> note<00:01:28.310> note<00:01:30.380> in<00:01:31.550> TN<00:01:32.550> is<00:01:32.820> true

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
first note note in TN is true

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.190 
first note note in TN is true
for<00:01:35.960> all<00:01:36.200> natural<00:01:36.770> numbers<00:01:38.469> then<00:01:39.469> well<00:01:40.280> order

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
for all natural numbers then well order

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.460 
for all natural numbers then well order
is<00:01:42.200> true<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.220> our<00:01:43.460> aim<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.450> use<00:01:45.020> strong

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
is true so our aim is to use strong

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.350 
is true so our aim is to use strong
induction<00:01:45.829> to<00:01:46.340> prove<00:01:46.579> that<00:01:46.610> this<00:01:46.909> is<00:01:47.060> true<00:01:47.299> for

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
induction to prove that this is true for

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.130 
induction to prove that this is true for
all<00:01:47.659> M<00:01:48.310> so<00:01:49.310> let's<00:01:49.850> first<00:01:50.179> check<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.719> case<00:01:50.899> N

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
all M so let's first check the case N

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.039 
all M so let's first check the case N
equals<00:01:51.590> 1<00:01:52.179> N<00:01:53.179> equals<00:01:54.140> 1<00:01:54.439> or<00:01:55.069> certainly<00:01:56.049> it

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
equals 1 N equals 1 or certainly it

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.730 
equals 1 N equals 1 or certainly it
should<00:01:57.289> be<00:01:57.319> a<00:01:57.409> set<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:58.399> natural<00:01:58.939> numbers

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.330 

if<00:02:04.159> n<00:02:04.670> is<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.840> if<00:02:06.409> what<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.040> sense<00:02:07.220> of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
if n is in if what is in a sense of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.279 
if n is in if what is in a sense of
natural<00:02:07.729> numbers<00:02:07.759> then<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.720> has<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:08.989> least

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
natural numbers then it has a least

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.719 
natural numbers then it has a least
element<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:09.709> least<00:02:09.890> element<00:02:10.069> has<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.429> be<00:02:10.489> 1

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
element the least element has to be 1

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.320 
element the least element has to be 1
because<00:02:11.000> 1<00:02:11.150> is<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> smallest<00:02:11.900> natural<00:02:12.650> number

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
because 1 is the smallest natural number

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.110 
because 1 is the smallest natural number
if<00:02:14.330> n<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.920> an<00:02:16.220> ass<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:18.370> whoops<00:02:19.370> if<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:19.970> is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
if n is an ass then whoops if one is

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.380 
if n is an ass then whoops if one is
eNOS<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:20.959> one<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:23.230> released

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 

so<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:28.960> should<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.380> said<00:02:29.530> somewhere<00:02:29.950> let<00:02:30.550> us

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
so I should have said somewhere let us

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.570 
so I should have said somewhere let us
be<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> set<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.540> natural<00:02:31.690> numbers<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:34.180> true

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
be a set of natural numbers that's true

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.380 
be a set of natural numbers that's true
uh

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.430 

yes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.100 

be<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> set<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.160> natural<00:02:44.310> numbers

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.870 

it<00:02:47.170> s<00:02:47.500> the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
it s the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.920 
it s the
that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.700 

one<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.920> past<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:59.319> one

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
one is in past and one

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.200 
one is in past and one
must<00:03:02.310> be

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
must be

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.920 
must be
these<00:03:04.420> elements

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.750 

your<00:03:11.930> book<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:13.480> true<00:03:14.770> so<00:03:15.770> now<00:03:15.950> let's<00:03:16.250> try<00:03:16.550> and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
your book is true so now let's try and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.890 
your book is true so now let's try and
show<00:03:17.060> that<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:18.260> can<00:03:18.410> deduce<00:03:18.650> peer<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.730> k<00:03:20.090> plus<00:03:20.540> 1

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
show that we can deduce peer of k plus 1

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.300 
show that we can deduce peer of k plus 1
using<00:03:21.620> all<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.580> p<00:03:22.820> of<00:03:23.120> one's<00:03:23.480> up<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.050> pk<00:03:24.650> so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
using all of the p of one's up to pk so

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.800 
using all of the p of one's up to pk so
this<00:03:25.460> is<00:03:25.610> why<00:03:25.730> we've<00:03:25.940> got<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:26.120> use<00:03:26.360> strong

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
this is why we've got to use strong

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.240 
this is why we've got to use strong

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
duction here because we're going to have

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.200 
duction here because we're going to have
to<00:03:28.430> use<00:03:28.850> not<00:03:29.570> just<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:30.140> K<00:03:30.470> case<00:03:31.010> but<00:03:31.370> all<00:03:31.700> of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
the cases from one of the cave so now we

I'm<00:04:30.660> true<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.830> particular<00:04:32.270> PJ<00:04:33.270> has<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.810> be

I'm true so in particular PJ has to be

we<00:04:37.560> know<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.130> set<00:04:38.370> has<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> least<00:04:38.880> element

we know that the set has a least element

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.439 
we know that the set has a least element
so<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.430> implies<00:04:42.919> in<00:04:43.919> which<00:04:44.160> case

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.730 

so<00:04:59.040> look<00:04:59.250> at<00:04:59.340> what<00:04:59.460> we've<00:04:59.610> done<00:05:00.320> we've<00:05:01.320> assumed

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
so look at what we've done we've assumed

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.850 
so look at what we've done we've assumed
that<00:05:02.130> p<00:05:02.400> 1<00:05:02.430> or<00:05:02.730> 2<00:05:02.850> PK<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:03.600> true<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.290> we're

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
that p 1 or 2 PK are true and we're

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.310 
that p 1 or 2 PK are true and we're
trying<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.220> deduce<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.940> p<00:05:06.390> of<00:05:06.510> k<00:05:06.720> plus<00:05:06.960> 1<00:05:07.170> is

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
trying to deduce that p of k plus 1 is

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.550 
trying to deduce that p of k plus 1 is
true<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.460> suppose<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:09.210> peak<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.930> k<00:05:10.110> plus<00:05:10.380> 1

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
true so suppose that peak that k plus 1

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.690 
true so suppose that peak that k plus 1
is<00:05:10.710> in<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:10.920> set<00:05:11.280> either<00:05:11.910> k<00:05:12.870> plus<00:05:13.140> 1<00:05:13.440> is<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.490> least

in which case s has a least element

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.430 
in which case s has a least element

because p of jay is true so I away s has

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.860 
because p of jay is true so I away s has
to<00:05:28.620> have<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.800> least<00:05:29.130> element<00:05:29.280> so<00:05:30.180> we<00:05:30.390> deduced

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
to have a least element so we deduced

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:39.850 
to have a least element so we deduced
that<00:05:31.080> here<00:05:31.530> k<00:05:31.830> plus<00:05:32.070> 1<00:05:32.280> is<00:05:32.430> true

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.249 

and<00:05:40.370> that's<00:05:40.520> what<00:05:40.699> we<00:05:40.789> wanted<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.180> show<00:05:41.479> right

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
and that's what we wanted to show right

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.640 
and that's what we wanted to show right
we've<00:05:42.710> done<00:05:43.039> a<00:05:43.069> step<00:05:43.550> we've<00:05:43.819> assumed<00:05:44.270> that<00:05:44.719> he

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
went up to pee care drew and we've

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.679 
went up to pee care drew and we've

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:50.689 
deduced that PK plus 1 is true therefore

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.570 
deduced that PK plus 1 is true therefore
by<00:05:51.289> the<00:05:51.349> principle<00:05:51.919> of<00:05:51.979> strong<00:05:52.280> induction

by the principle of strong induction
here<00:05:53.210> that<00:05:53.389> n<00:05:53.509> is<00:05:53.539> true<00:05:53.960> I<00:05:54.229> don't<00:05:54.860> know<00:05:54.949> where

here that n is true I don't know where

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:06.249 
to put it now I run out of space hmm sit

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
here therefore by strong induction B of

n is true for all n in the natural

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.170 
n is true for all n in the natural
numbers

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.080

therefore the world order principal is
true
