00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.960 

as<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.869> finish<00:00:19.199> up<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.500> concept<00:00:19.890> car<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.369> want

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
as we finish up the concept car I want

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.670 
as we finish up the concept car I want
you<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.180> keep<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.539> mind<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.900> sculptress<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
you to keep in mind that sculptress is

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.400 
you to keep in mind that sculptress is
not<00:00:22.949> meant<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> create<00:00:23.939> finished<00:00:24.539> car<00:00:24.840> models

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
not meant to create finished car models

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.560 
not meant to create finished car models
it's<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.130> sculpting<00:00:26.609> tool<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:27.090> very<00:00:27.150> useful

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
it's a sculpting tool that's very useful

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.939 
it's a sculpting tool that's very useful
for<00:00:28.050> sketching<00:00:28.470> out<00:00:28.560> ideas<00:00:28.590> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
for sketching out ideas and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.759 
for sketching out ideas and
experimenting<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.210> designs<00:00:30.769> but

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
experimenting with different designs but

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500 
experimenting with different designs but
if<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> try<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.850> make<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> render

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
if you try to use it to make a render

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.049 
if you try to use it to make a render
quality<00:00:34.050> car<00:00:34.320> model<00:00:34.710> you'll<00:00:35.250> probably<00:00:35.550> end<00:00:35.910> up

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
quality car model you'll probably end up

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
quality car model you'll probably end up
very<00:00:36.300> disappointed<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:37.620> goal<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.070> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
very disappointed so our goal at this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.709 
very disappointed so our goal at this
stage<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.820> get<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> car<00:00:39.420> ready<00:00:39.660> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
stage is to get the car ready for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
stage is to get the car ready for
remodeling<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> program<00:00:41.010> that's<00:00:41.250> better

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
remodeling in a program that's better

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.580 
remodeling in a program that's better
suited<00:00:41.910> for<00:00:41.969> finished<00:00:42.480> car<00:00:42.750> modeling<00:00:43.110> like

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
suited for finished car modeling like

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
suited for finished car modeling like
Maya<00:00:43.920> or<00:00:44.219> Rhino<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.450> let's<00:00:45.660> finish<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> car<00:00:46.230> up

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
Maya or Rhino so let's finish the car up

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
Maya or Rhino so let's finish the car up
basically<00:00:47.340> what<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.579> trying<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
basically what I'm trying to do here is

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.869 
basically what I'm trying to do here is
clean<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.719> any<00:00:48.899> problem<00:00:49.320> areas<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.920> want<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
clean up any problem areas I want to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
clean up any problem areas I want to
remove<00:00:51.090> any<00:00:51.300> unnecessary<00:00:51.750> triangles<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
remove any unnecessary triangles so that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
remove any unnecessary triangles so that
the<00:00:52.980> model<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.370> lighter<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.820> easier<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.390> work

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the model is lighter and easier to work

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
the model is lighter and easier to work
with<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.930> other<00:00:55.079> programs<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
with in other programs so I'm going to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
with in other programs so I'm going to
turn<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.910> wireframe<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.600> W<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.680> let's<00:00:58.859> look

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
turn on wireframe with W and let's look

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.260 
turn on wireframe with W and let's look
around<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.340> any<00:00:59.609> places<00:00:59.850> where<00:01:00.000> there's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
around for any places where there's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
around for any places where there's
unnecessary<00:01:00.960> triangles<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.620> looks<00:01:01.770> like

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
unnecessary triangles so it looks like

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.000 
unnecessary triangles so it looks like
there's<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> bottom<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:04.010> also

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
there's some here on the bottom and also

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
there's some here on the bottom and also
probably<00:01:05.220> some<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.030> top<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
probably some here on the top as well so

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.190 
probably some here on the top as well so
I'm<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> reduced<00:01:08.640> brush<00:01:08.909> out

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
I'm just gonna get the reduced brush out

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:16.670 
I'm just gonna get the reduced brush out
and<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.350> clean<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:15.560> okay<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and just clean up some of this okay that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.630 
and just clean up some of this okay that
should<00:01:16.770> be<00:01:16.830> good<00:01:16.920> enough<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:19.640> another

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
should be good enough for now another

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
should be good enough for now another
thing<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.060> might<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.869> point

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
thing I might want to do at this point

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
thing I might want to do at this point
is<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> refine<00:01:23.400> any<00:01:23.700> shapes<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> car<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
is to refine any shapes of the car that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
is to refine any shapes of the car that
might<00:01:24.840> still<00:01:25.140> need<00:01:25.320> work<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.460> example<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
might still need work for example the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.789 
might still need work for example the
body<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> car<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.080> overlapping<00:01:28.590> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
body of the car is overlapping the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.520 
body of the car is overlapping the
wheels<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> few<00:01:29.460> places<00:01:30.020> so<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.200> here<00:01:31.409> you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
wheels in a few places so right here you

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.990 
wheels in a few places so right here you
can<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> there's<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.640> overlap

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
can see that there's kind of an overlap

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
can see that there's kind of an overlap
that<00:01:33.240> wheels<00:01:33.420> shouldn't<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.900> hitting<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that wheels shouldn't be hitting the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
that wheels shouldn't be hitting the
body<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> car<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> would<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.340> drive

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
body of the car that would not drive

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.210 
body of the car that would not drive
very<00:01:35.850> well<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.439> gonna<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.009> hold

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
very well so what I'm gonna do is hold

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.249 
very well so what I'm gonna do is hold
down<00:01:38.310> H<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.240> click<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> wheel<00:01:39.930> and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
down H and click on the wheel and

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
down H and click on the wheel and
they're<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.159> hide<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.759> can

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
they're just gonna hide that so I can

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.030 
they're just gonna hide that so I can
work<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.899> body<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.439> bit<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
work on the body a little bit so I can

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760 
work on the body a little bit so I can
make<00:01:44.700> sure<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.970> don't<00:01:45.240> overlap<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.680> I'm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
make sure they don't overlap so I'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.550 
make sure they don't overlap so I'm
gonna<00:01:46.890> go<00:01:47.100> into<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> grab<00:01:47.850> tool<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.409> try

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
gonna go into the grab tool and just try

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
gonna go into the grab tool and just try
to<00:01:49.619> scoot<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:49.979> around<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.490> bit<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> I

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
to scoot this around a little bit so I

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.319 
to scoot this around a little bit so I
can<00:01:51.030> make<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.570> space<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.140> wheel

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.060 

all<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:57.450> let's<00:01:57.600> hit<00:01:57.719> control<00:01:58.110> H<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.860> bring

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
all right let's hit control H to bring

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
all right let's hit control H to bring
the<00:01:59.219> wheel<00:01:59.369> back<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.640> let's<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.030> how<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the wheel back and let's see how that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.530 
the wheel back and let's see how that
fits<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.719> okay<00:02:01.140> much<00:02:01.350> better<00:02:02.540> another

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
fits in there okay much better another

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
fits in there okay much better another
thing<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> fix<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> little<00:02:04.829> bit<00:02:04.920> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
thing to fix up is a little bit of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
thing to fix up is a little bit of
lumpiness<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.820> kind<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.360> over<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
lumpiness that's kind of all over the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.490 
lumpiness that's kind of all over the
model<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.640> I'm<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:08.910> switch<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:10.229> my

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
model so I'm gonna switch to the my

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440 
model so I'm gonna switch to the my
smooth<00:02:10.860> brush<00:02:11.190> actually<00:02:11.879> any<00:02:12.030> brush<00:02:12.270> will

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
smooth brush actually any brush will

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.370 
smooth brush actually any brush will
work

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
work

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.130 
work
it's<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:14.360> just<00:02:15.360> hold<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.630> shift<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> go

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's I can just hold down shift to go

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.840 
it's I can just hold down shift to go
into<00:02:16.290> smooth<00:02:16.530> mode<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:17.040> let's<00:02:17.520> just<00:02:17.640> try<00:02:17.820> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
into smooth mode and let's just try to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.440 
into smooth mode and let's just try to
smooth<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.240> any<00:02:18.390> weird<00:02:18.660> lumps<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:23.240> might<00:02:24.240> also

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
smooth out any weird lumps I might also

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.690 
smooth out any weird lumps I might also
want<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.900> go<00:02:25.020> into<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.320> flatten<00:02:25.710> brush<00:02:25.950> and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
want to go into the flatten brush and

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.160 
want to go into the flatten brush and
just<00:02:26.790> kind<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> work<00:02:27.390> with<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.840> it'll

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
just kind of work with that it it'll

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.110 
just kind of work with that it it'll
work<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.710> sandpaper<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.850> sand

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
work kind of like sandpaper to just sand

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.980 
work kind of like sandpaper to just sand
down<00:02:30.390> any<00:02:30.750> rough<00:02:31.050> areas<00:02:35.600> okay<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:36.660> I<00:02:36.810> could

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
down any rough areas okay so I could

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.780 
down any rough areas okay so I could
spend<00:02:37.290> quite<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.620> while<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.670> I'm

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
spend quite a while on that but I'm

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.650 
spend quite a while on that but I'm
gonna<00:02:38.910> move<00:02:39.060> ahead<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.180> also<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.480> good

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
gonna move ahead now this is also a good

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.510 
gonna move ahead now this is also a good
time<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.200> about<00:02:43.290> specific<00:02:44.100> details

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
time to think about specific details

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.210 
time to think about specific details
like<00:02:44.790> how<00:02:44.820> panels<00:02:45.570> should<00:02:45.810> join<00:02:45.990> together<00:02:46.230> so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
like how panels should join together so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.710 
like how panels should join together so
let's<00:02:47.430> try<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.730> find<00:02:48.000> an<00:02:48.120> area<00:02:48.390> that's<00:02:48.510> not

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
let's try to find an area that's not

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.860 
let's try to find an area that's not
totally<00:02:48.990> resolved<00:02:49.620> yet<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:51.180> maybe<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.660> this

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
totally resolved yet so maybe like this

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.090 
totally resolved yet so maybe like this
area<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.320> here<00:02:52.380> where<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.890> hatchback

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
area right here where the hatchback

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.060 
area right here where the hatchback
comes<00:02:53.640> down<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.630> back<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:55.410> not<00:02:55.620> entirely

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
comes down in the back it's not entirely

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.320 
comes down in the back it's not entirely
clear<00:02:56.280> how<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> work

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
clear how this is going to work

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.910 
clear how this is going to work
mechanically<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.320> might<00:02:58.470> be<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.650> good

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
mechanically so this might be a good

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.460 
mechanically so this might be a good
point<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.310> try<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.850> figure<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.270> out<00:03:00.470> maybe

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
point to try to figure that out maybe

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.780 
point to try to figure that out maybe
I'll<00:03:01.710> come<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:02.010> with<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> crease<00:03:02.460> brush<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
I'll come in with the crease brush and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.120 
I'll come in with the crease brush and
try<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.410> something<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:04.800> working<00:03:05.070> a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
try to it's something that's working a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.680 
try to it's something that's working a
little<00:03:05.340> bit<00:03:05.460> better<00:03:05.850> from<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.210> mechanical

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
little bit better from a mechanical

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.760 
little bit better from a mechanical
standpoint<00:03:09.020> we<00:03:10.020> try<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> figure<00:03:10.440> out<00:03:10.560> where

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
standpoint we try to figure out where

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.100 
standpoint we try to figure out where
hinges<00:03:11.220> would<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.510> maybe<00:03:15.690> I<00:03:15.810> could<00:03:15.870> figure

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
hinges would be so maybe I could figure

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.250 
hinges would be so maybe I could figure
out<00:03:16.230> where<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.440> license<00:03:16.890> plate<00:03:16.950> might<00:03:17.310> go

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.540 

something<00:03:22.260> else<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.500> could<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.070> turn<00:03:23.460> off

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
something else you could do is turn off

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.420 
something else you could do is turn off
symmetry<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.480> try<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.990> work<00:03:25.200> in<00:03:25.410> any<00:03:25.890> details

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
symmetry and try to work in any details

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.790 
symmetry and try to work in any details
that<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.850> asymmetrical<00:03:27.510> so<00:03:27.930> for<00:03:28.200> example<00:03:28.560> a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
that are asymmetrical so for example a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.260 
that are asymmetrical so for example a
gas<00:03:29.670> cap<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.990> know<00:03:31.020> maybe<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:32.730> fuel<00:03:33.060> gets

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
gas cap you know maybe the the fuel gets

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.210 
gas cap you know maybe the the fuel gets
loaded<00:03:33.660> in<00:03:33.780> on<00:03:33.930> this<00:03:34.140> side<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:34.860> don't<00:03:35.040> want

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
loaded in on this side and we don't want

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.750 
loaded in on this side and we don't want
to<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.430> gas<00:03:35.640> cap<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.030> both<00:03:36.210> sides<00:03:40.760> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
to have a gas cap on both sides and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.980 
to have a gas cap on both sides and
maybe<00:03:41.940> there's<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.210> little<00:03:42.480> notch<00:03:42.690> right<00:03:42.930> here

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
maybe there's a little notch right here

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.080 
maybe there's a little notch right here
where<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.320> can<00:03:43.470> lift<00:03:44.220> your<00:03:44.400> finger<00:03:44.700> into<00:03:44.910> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
where you can lift your finger into it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.520 
where you can lift your finger into it
and<00:03:45.420> open<00:03:46.350> up<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.530> gas<00:03:46.710> cap<00:03:46.980> there<00:03:48.470> don't<00:03:49.470> need

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and open up the gas cap there don't need

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.930 
and open up the gas cap there don't need
to<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.770> too<00:03:49.950> specific<00:03:50.100> just<00:03:50.580> trying<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.820> work

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
to get too specific just trying to work

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.550 
to get too specific just trying to work
out<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> simple<00:03:51.660> design<00:03:52.080> for<00:03:52.320> how<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.500> might

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
out a simple design for how this might

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.910 
out a simple design for how this might
look<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:57.300> could<00:03:57.420> also<00:03:57.540> put<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.990> maybe<00:03:58.230> exhaust

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
look you could also put in maybe exhaust

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.500 
look you could also put in maybe exhaust
pipes<00:03:59.280> or<00:03:59.780> anything<00:04:00.780> else<00:04:01.050> really<00:04:02.510> remember

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
pipes or anything else really remember

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.540 
pipes or anything else really remember
that<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.870> most<00:04:04.050> purposes<00:04:04.320> this<00:04:05.100> car<00:04:05.400> will

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
that for most purposes this car will

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.250 
that for most purposes this car will
have<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.850> be<00:04:05.940> remodeled<00:04:06.420> in<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.750> program<00:04:07.110> that's

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
have to be remodeled in a program that's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.860 
have to be remodeled in a program that's
more<00:04:07.590> suited<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.040> hard<00:04:08.460> surface<00:04:08.880> modeling<00:04:09.330> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
more suited for hard surface modeling so

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.540 
more suited for hard surface modeling so
really<00:04:10.230> I'm<00:04:10.350> just<00:04:10.380> sculpting<00:04:10.860> enough<00:04:11.160> detail
