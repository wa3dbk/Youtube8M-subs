00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Now I'll show you in one 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:11.730
 quicktipp how to act on marzipan or 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.650
 it takes hold so that's homer 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 cepal and here i have icing sugar and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.910
 Although you mix this in the ratio one 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.939
 to one 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:29.269
 Now you can do the marzipan just like that 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.269
 crumble into it 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:45.960
 and indeed you need that noted 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:48.720
 marzipan more often for pies or other 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 Opportunities where you want to do nothing is 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.760
 that must be here now in the powdered sugar 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 to be kneaded with the whole thing 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.320
 powdered sugar that's a sticky one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.940
 affair but that is relatively fixed 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.800
 and the more you the powdered sugar a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.650
 the less clip works the whole 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.479
 also it will be difficult the whole 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 icing sugar to work on 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.020
 Try as much as you can 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.910
 working in the industrial park all the more 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.280
 easier you have it for later 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.509
 further processing at this point 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 you could now for example too 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 add food coloring and that 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.100
 dye marzipan if you are looking for a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.509
 pies blanket for example colorful 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.149
 marzipan or need now is for Easter 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.090
 the most up to date you want 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.759
 to make carrots 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 then of course it needs to be done now 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.890
 marzipan apology what now 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.459
 powdered sugar is still left 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.459
 so what did not work with them in 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.380
 that is incorporated in the smart plan 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:15.020
 can you simply have on the area 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:20.490
 what we need now and that currently 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:26.280
 roll out decker and if that's good 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:30.330
 The marzipan has made it nice and dry 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:37.459
 is and no longer sticks then you can 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.459
 with the rolling pin without tools 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.970
 we pick as called panic from time 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.970
 Try if that works 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.310
 You see , that works quite well 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.360
 so you can also without assistance 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:43.010
 any other means nice one 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.970
 cover for a cake or something for the end 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 go back a different 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:07.879
 yes that was the quicktipp for today how 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.920
 one acts marzipan and I hope you 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.849
 now have great ideas what to do with the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.849
 can make marzipan 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.859
 I already have some ideas 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.620
 take care 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.199
 Maybe we'll see each other next 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.870
