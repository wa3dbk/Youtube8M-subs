 I am very happy to face again 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 from another stage of my season my 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 sports career and I hope to stay the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.739
 true all around as long as possible 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.040
 good the truth that all the companions 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.770
 that are coming because they are super super 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.590
 pleasant in personal treatment as 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.059
 and in sports in sports and 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.390

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.399
 level and good then we have to continue 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 knowing us to continue valuing and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.760
 good and learn as much as possible from 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.730
 Each of them has said my partner 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 to a very good group very human that you 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.850
 makes being close to all of them 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 they are all very good but in 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.400
 particular 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.110
 Juan, for example, to a very young boy 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 close out of the playing fields and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.250
 as soon as within the field of the game 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.250
 It is very good to work and very happy 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.340
 be able to be here in montecastillo together 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.460
 to these great people who are both 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.619
 what sports as personal and very 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.350
 happy trying to learn the most 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.320
 of experience and stay with what 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.880
 positive I was already started 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 pre-season planning with 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.820
 directing us and I was running I love the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 gym and my mother came running a 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.320
 crazy 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:53.329
 and nothing called me my mother and I went to my house 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.329
 and I called VICTOR and explained everything and 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:03.170
 in the super nervous scene I was 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:05.810
 talking and I work the truth that today 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.320
 today if you go to sleep to talk 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.399
 with me and has told me one aspect 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.660
 tactical that he thinks I have to 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.390
 improve and the truth that I am very 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.160
 grateful for those words that have 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.230
 transmitted because the truth is that they are 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.750
 necessary in these instants Thursday the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.990
 it's a brutal change for me 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.600
 be used to the cold of vitoria 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.459
 bilbao and then I came here and find you 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.140
 with this heat that you can not even have 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.390
 standing up for me it has been a change 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.489
 very abrupt that our good I think that 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.709
 I'm here quite slowly killing 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.810
 good and good to see if I can do it 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.370
 everything to be quiet is not 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.260
 what happens badly is that in the end you have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.320
 the body accustomed to whatever 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.209
 other temperatures to train as with 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.250
 a more light temperature and when coming 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.450
 here to find you with the sun this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.400
 it seems you have 10 kilos more on 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.319
 like you feel uncomfortable like you 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.379
 lack of air if it gives the feeling 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.450
 like the heat is are you get yourself 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.239
 is up to the bone you get 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.120
 it gets inside and you're not comfortable not 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.060
 you are with that so with that ease that 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.510
 are there in the north is not 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.330
 dancing 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 we are before the illusion the desire that 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.050
 has to triumph to convince the coach 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.690
 this preseason but I also hope 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.489
 that that humility is not the desire you have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.140
 but above all your site that what 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.459
 you have already said clear and coal for 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.200
 example that he came here to convince the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.519
 mister but I think you have to play with 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.900
 the goal of without any kind of 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.480
 problem to enjoy the experience 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 clear and then what he says 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.640
 Yes , of course I knew that first hour I 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.200
 first with the subsidiary I 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.690
 they made the call a week before 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.180
 to come here 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.640
 I knew I was going with it but my place 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.230
 this year in the subsidiary continues senna por 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.810
 temporary with it I get to know 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.670
 more than good to me as well as to the same 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.530
 that my partner but our education 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.980
 in cooling the moment of truth is 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.840
 that I see little difference some like 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.030
 every year the players change and 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.530
 the people are different but 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.460
 practically the workouts are 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.540
 almost the same 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.190
 the training methodology of equal and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.100
 nothing what remains is to continue working and 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.040
 go to the top for the coach to give 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.609
 account that those who go below 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.230
 we are very much the truth that follows the 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.200
 last season is I think I've 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.720
 I greatly improved much remains 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.700
 improve learning how to learn I learn 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.170
 a lot when it comes to being able to train with 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.270
 the big ones because it's not the same 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.250
 train with a first division that 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.840
 train with a second time and the truth 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.900
 that learns a lot in intensity in 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.120
 squeeze when putting in the leg that is 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.380
 what the boss wants me to do 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.760
 make 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.520
 and the truth is that it shows because 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.480
 the intensity is much bigger and the 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 requirement 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.640
 clear that it increases very well with antonio and 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.190
 with any of the other like paula or 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.680
 Peric and very safe system with nobody 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.910
 go they transmit speech insecurity te 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.960
 directs to one side to another that is what 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.120
 have at home is to teach 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.200
 I have to learn from them and with 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.790
 works with any of aia with the 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.060
 that puts me to power very happy and very 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.060
 safe
