 what can I do massage of course but I 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.690

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.599
 all say do massage is not necessary for it 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.209

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.739

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.060
 good river soaked 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.849

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:35.849
 nice i don't cut this piece like this 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.849
 here I will be saying it all 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.940
 pickle is not marinade is that dry 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.220
 pickled so I read and I add garlic 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.670
 garlic i'm a little bit 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.879
 Crush the garlic in therapy and will not 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:55.189
 Iâ€™ll just cut them so small 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:59.549
 the pieces will be aroma and at the same time 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:01.980
 if i know that my husband doesn't love 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.330
 garlic he will not eat him therefore 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.370
 its just that it will be cleansed and without . wrote 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:14.030
 and a promises necessarily first we 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:18.030
 to feed and continue without salt will 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.959
 me from Terek he is surely salt but 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.520
 what do i do i take the salt 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.310
 I have to see an antique table 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.350

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.840
 you are probably in sight who do not have it I 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.750
 still there is such a thrifty mistress 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.000
 on the bottom I pour salt but as I always 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:42.270
 already said this thing fish and all that 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.240
 salt pepper asala salt is not afraid she 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.650
 excess salt does not absorb this fat it 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.190
 if you can pour a lot 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:57.979
 do not be afraid so pour salt and 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.440
 how much do you not mind here on top of the snow 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.430
 dresses like this 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.639
 these quarrels make me so big 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.990
 leveled and gasoline for over 40 and not 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.810

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.610
 I have already salted all this 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.289

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:21.930

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.090

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:46.500

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.139
