needs<00:04:38.919> defensive<00:04:39.919> help<00:04:40.160> in<00:04:40.580> my<00:04:40.730> opinion<00:04:41.060> I

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
needs defensive help in my opinion I

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.730 
needs defensive help in my opinion I
think<00:04:41.419> they<00:04:41.720> need<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.990> focus<00:04:42.169> on<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.560> and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
think they need to focus on that and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.610 
think they need to focus on that and
bringing<00:04:43.100> in<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.250> goalscorer<00:04:44.530> finding<00:04:45.530> those

bringing in a goalscorer finding those

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.290 
bringing in a goalscorer finding those
players<00:04:45.919> will<00:04:46.130> be<00:04:46.280> difficult<00:04:46.760> but<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.180> know

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
