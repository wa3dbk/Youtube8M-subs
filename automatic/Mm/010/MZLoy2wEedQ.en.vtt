00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.910
 the control of the master system this frame 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 pequeninho square or lisinho 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.750
 rectangular is the control that came 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.029
 originally with master system that he 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.750
 control that we children of the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.599
 80 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.170
 we must remember very well against the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.020
 cool little he has a design like that 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.480
 high here in these parts coming here 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.560
 does not have a footprint behind it is against 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.380
 very simple 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.960
 that I enrolled tectoy while the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.270
 US be blind and put Tectoy 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.850
 kind of in control there also translated 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.940
 in control start rather than control 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.040
 asks stadium but this is it is small in 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.630
 rectangular buttons 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.460
 it is similar to the original control of the 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.080
 little angel I do not know if a lot of people 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.420
 knows the control understands already that the 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.650
 We only had a lot of clones here. 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.170
 in Brazil is not it 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.110
 but finding that originally comes the 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.150
 master system has directional big mouth 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.189
 for a small control it is of the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.890
 a little bigger than my finger 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:18.109
 then it finds relatively small 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.240
 the directional great power to say I have 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.130
 he is very comfortable because he does not have a 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.299
 start button to start the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 close button 1 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.929
 so much that here is written at the beginning and 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.929
 buttons have a certain depth 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.950
 if you see they have a car in 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.350
 movement right 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.639
 You do not need a scholarship to get down there. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.569
 for you to feel have button response 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:40.609
 but it is a very good control very 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.900
 comfortable design has a bit 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.800
 strange for today but it is 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.470
 charming he uses the same blog as the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.870
 mega drive control and also serves the 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.650
 atari 2600 you can use to play the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 afternoon games 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.690
 better than he found of stain and 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.760
 here at this point Kenyan here in front 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.140
 we should have written blind but the 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.790
 national control 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.650
 at least not mine wrote 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.660
 I can not tell if all the controls 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.210
 my plan does not have it but it fits in 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.920
 mega drive is not recommend you use on 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.850
 my job because it has fewer buttons 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.360
 button 1 will be a plus b and o2 and be 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.040
 more start then sonic yet to play 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.050
 but other games I do not recommend 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.260
 really but it works with mega 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.880
 drive if you use that adapter to 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.720
 play play play this game has to work 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 usually occurs andrade is not 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.370
 very precise in the kitchen the sides they 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.720
 are very good but I think a 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.640
 few moves you make 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.520
 so already you go up paying down 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.980
 so it ends up being a little better 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.230
 on diagonals to be honest is games 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.370
 like boots like that in the zone for example 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.519
 that you have to exchange money is very 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 fast up down to the left is 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.810
 you end up rolling a little bit not 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.180
 is very precise in this sense but there is a 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.120
 Comfortable control works well 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.400
 there is in the back we have written 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.050
 2d technical toy limited 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.510
 produced in the free zone of Manaus 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.030
 Brazilian industry in the account 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.660
 we would have been written 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.769
 the model of control of these things 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.480
 you can find this control with greater 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.980
 ease in the free market you 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.510
 located about 40 reais you can 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.250
 be cheap with this I wanted if you 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.410
 find broken or not working and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.980
 know how to fix say the bench 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.209
 Simple you can find cheaper and I heard 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 say that this control does not have a chip 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.610
 inside there are only daughters and connections 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.010
 so technically your console does not 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.750
 I could tell if the album is original and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.290
 control colors 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.110
 they combine with the cartridges have 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.430
 same shade of red is black the priest 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.090
 checkerboard gaucho and also combine 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.739
 with the crown of the master system if but not 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.019
 I have a certainty at the moment the mega 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.820
 drive to play my master game 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.260
 system with adapter so I do not have 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.160
 no more chances and now it will show 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.500
 if you do not show until she consulted 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.329
 several models of control but the sega 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.329
 even made by sega pro master system 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.489
 tension and if tectoy even launched 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.799
 some other models that are generally 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.490
 seems very much to control their 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.290
 mega drive buttons and in the case of 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.930
 buttons do not suit much kisses 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.870
 and good buttons 1 and 2 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.110
 there would be two more and three 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.060
 up would be turbo 2 3 bottom buttons and the 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.610
 start does not receive anything 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.470
 but to what extent did he make other 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.630
 controls do not intend to acquire any 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.710
 but if by chance I put my 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.780
 little brother 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.730
 I will bring a review I'll do I 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.650
 I want to do review of control consoles 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.570
 accessories various other things whole 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.230
 everything related to the harvest rule that 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.090
 meet 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.680
 I'm going to do a review besides games 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.120
 so for my mother 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.840
 if someone wants to make a donation to the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.340
 I'm accepting but this is it 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.380
 control of mastitis finds it very good 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.970
 not comfortable, tiny 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.880
 It reminds me of a simpler time, right? 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.770
 It would be nice to see this 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.760
 back nowadays, the controls already have 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.590
 more buttons 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.250
 not that this is a bad thing of course not me 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.310
 I think it's a great thing, but I miss it or 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.740
 had time of simplicity control 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.810
 so weird squares but 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.180
 worked so well and it seemed that two 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.190
 people could do everything the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.540
 our imagination allow 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.269
