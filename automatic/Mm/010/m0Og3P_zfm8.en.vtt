 a mixture of rye and wheat flour 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.829

 we rub hands 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.170
 to evenly distribute the oil 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.090
 add water and knead very soft 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.090

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:41.340
 grated cheese mix cheese greens 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.340
 can be slightly salted 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.709
 now proceed to rolling out the dough 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.489
 powder the table with flour 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:54.709
 take a piece of dough and roll it in 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.470
 flat cake should give thin here 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.989
 something like this 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:04.450
 now lay out the stuffing on one 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.299
 half a cake in this way 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:14.060
 leave free edges and collapse 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:19.760
 so pinch the cake 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:23.359
 edges with a fork and ship our 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.129
 wherever to the pan well 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:31.629
 heat the dry griddle without oil and 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:34.519
 put the kutabs in the pan 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.920
 we bake where on a hot frying pan 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:42.920
 about one minute from one 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:48.590
 side turn the kutab and bake 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:52.099
 one more minute we serve kutab at once hot 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.269
 as long as the internal is still very tasty 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.269
 melted colt 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.300
 ready-made kutabs served with sauce 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.090
 sony is such a fermented milk sauce 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.640
 if you adapt it to our products 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.260
 then you can use sour cream or 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.209
 natural homemade yogurt 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.270
 probably yogurt is more suitable because 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.180
 that skill fat yogurt should be 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.150
 Naturally without additives we take a few 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.430
 garlic cloves peel and 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.090
 we press through our press 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.450
 dairy product such as yogurt 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:44.560
