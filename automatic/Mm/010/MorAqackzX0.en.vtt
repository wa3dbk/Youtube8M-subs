00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:14.130
 [Music] 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:16.109
 to this race which is called the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.820
 hell like that or I want to be 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.810
 clear with you and tell you that we are 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.660
 before the race of hell boy 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.430
 so be careful because this can go well 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.509
 it can go very wrong 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.509
 well it's called that it goes well 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.210
 I really do not know exactly what it is about 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.210
 this 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:54.220
 foolish and I pass for the good there is no 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.150
 what to do seems to be selling for 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.020
 here 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.020
 little by little both sides 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 here I know that the two roads I think 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.170
 more I pick up actually it seems more 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.390
 comfort the one on the left but 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.300
 I think that the ramp is going to 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.590
 help more to get to where I have to 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 take a bigger ramp we can 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.560
 say the old one and we make a low tco 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.900
 well then first difficult area of ​​the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.900
 past war and that nobody 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:44.930
 61 be careful with the poster, but good 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:48.050
 there it is here and now it is necessary to do 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.830
 worth what the hell that yes this is worth 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.830
 to go up here 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.170
 you have to go up to the poster 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:02.390
 but on the left it seems very 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.100
 well and I fall because if I think 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.520
 incredible the truth if you have to go up 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.520
 the left side 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.780
 and now for the interesting stick me 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.810
 it seems something that seems to me something 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.040
 interesting 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.260
 it's worth calmly and with tranquility 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.760
 with tranquility, the proposal challenged today 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.349
 that I'm around the bridge is worth this 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.910
 I had a lot of morale but good 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.710
 we will do it boy in no way 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.210
 type of problem 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.860
 a little bit little by little little bit 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.189
 to little 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.180
 there is 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:44.370
 and I was wearing it well and now 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.909
 you have to go down the hostel and the other 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.909
 go down the other 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.480
 if we take water 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:02.490
 on the left it there four 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.580
 come here we are going to try 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.320
 it's really simple it's a bit 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.150
 narrow and such it gets a bit nervous 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.630
 to actually see just that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.630
 wait a bit of the credible eye point 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.630
 eye 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.750
 they are very good 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:34.319
 the eye eye that the guy pretty much craves for 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.709
 win the race plus pretty much so 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.709
 very much 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.650
 there is there is the boys 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.290
 perfect perfect do not push me 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.480
 miserable eye also for believing not 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.709

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.690
 I really want and thanks to people 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.970
 that has pushed me because we are going to have 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.569
 that when we want it or I tried that 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.999
 I faced it a little 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.459
 it does not appear to play it, nothing is useful 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.450
 what to do is download exemplary fast what 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.639
 faster than we can boy the most 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.139
 fast that we can really once we 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.019
 let's be here to do 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.879
 here slow down try to do it as fast 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.389
 that we can boys but it is also 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:18.400
 list is already is already perfect and bounced 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.020
 shit to try to catch the point 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.280
 I got it I got the slut 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.830

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.360
 even trying to close the maximum 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.419
 possible I do not know if the one that we took anything 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.590
 or not 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.060
 I swear to you that this is worth it we put 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.030
 there is a little bit that tries to go as fast 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.540
 possible I really at a minimum option the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.820
 eye speed 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:55.260
