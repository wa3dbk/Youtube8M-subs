medium tanks with their crew skills
medium<00:00:11.820> tanks<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.960> all-rounders<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.650> the

battlefield and in my opinion you want

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.720 
battlefield and in my opinion you want
to<00:00:15.750> try<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.109> develop<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.619> crew<00:00:17.070> skill<00:00:17.369> set

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
to try and develop a crew skill set

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.700 
to try and develop a crew skill set
which<00:00:18.029> will<00:00:18.210> keep<00:00:18.390> them<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.900> they<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.560> do

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
which will keep them so they really do

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.220 
which will keep them so they really do
benefit<00:00:20.130> from<00:00:20.189> nearly<00:00:20.580> every<00:00:20.820> crew<00:00:21.810> skill<00:00:22.080> in

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
benefit from nearly every crew skill in

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.689 
benefit from nearly every crew skill in
the<00:00:22.320> game<00:00:22.500> being<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.100> sort<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.400> mix<00:00:23.609> between

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the game being a sort of a mix between

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.279 
the game being a sort of a mix between
the<00:00:24.029> lights<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> heavy<00:00:24.720> tank<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.140> that

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the lights and the heavy tank and that

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.080 
the lights and the heavy tank and that
means<00:00:25.470> there's<00:00:25.710> all<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.340> more<00:00:26.519> important<00:00:27.000> to

and just want to copy what I do so first
off<00:00:44.190> what<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.879> your<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.390> skill<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
off what is your first skill going to be

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
off what is your first skill going to be
on<00:00:46.260> your<00:00:46.410> medium<00:00:46.710> tank<00:00:46.980> as<00:00:47.219> soon<00:00:47.730> as<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> get

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
on your medium tank as soon as you get

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
on your medium tank as soon as you get
above<00:00:48.629> tier<00:00:49.379> 5<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.250> opinion<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.879> should<00:00:51.180> be

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
above tier 5 in my opinion it should be

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
above tier 5 in my opinion it should be
repairs<00:00:51.960> below<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.190> probably

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
repairs below that I would probably

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
repairs below that I would probably
recommend<00:00:53.850> using<00:00:54.210> camouflage<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.289> some<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
recommend using camouflage so some of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.380 
recommend using camouflage so some of
you<00:00:55.649> may<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.800> asking<00:00:56.039> why<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:57.090> if<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you may be asking why is that well if we

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
you may be asking why is that well if we
consider<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> health<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:59.010> at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
consider the health that you have at

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
consider the health that you have at
tier<00:00:59.399> 5<00:00:59.430> tier<00:01:00.149> 5<00:01:00.359> tanks<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.930> got<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> between

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
tier 5 tier 5 tanks have got a between

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.310 
tier 5 tier 5 tanks have got a between
about<00:01:01.770> 400<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> 500<00:01:03.000> hit<00:01:03.149> points<00:01:03.480> generally<00:01:04.080> if

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
about 400 to 500 hit points generally if

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
about 400 to 500 hit points generally if
you<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.680> hit<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.159> anything<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
you get hit by anything that's going to

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
you get hit by anything that's going to
take<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.510> track<00:01:06.780> off<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.170> gonna<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.710> done

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
take your track off is gonna have done

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.520 
take your track off is gonna have done
about<00:01:08.310> 1/3<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.240> 1/2<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.780> hip<00:01:10.049> points<00:01:10.229> with

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
about 1/3 to 1/2 of your hip points with

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
about 1/3 to 1/2 of your hip points with
that<00:01:10.650> shot<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.549> means<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.360> my

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that shot what that means is that in my

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.570 
that shot what that means is that in my
opinion<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> threshold<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:14.100> benefit

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
opinion that is the threshold of benefit

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.429 
opinion that is the threshold of benefit
from<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.479> probably<00:01:15.869> better<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.320> have

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
from when it's probably better to have

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
from when it's probably better to have
camouflage<00:01:17.040> repair<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.939> only<00:01:18.180> useful<00:01:18.750> during

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
camouflage repair is only useful during

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560 
camouflage repair is only useful during
the<00:01:19.110> battle<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:20.430> effect<00:01:20.909> getting<00:01:21.450> your

the battle if your effect getting your

the battle if your effect getting your
modules<00:01:22.020> damaged<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.770> need<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.490> put<00:01:23.729> them

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
modules damaged and you need to put them

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
modules damaged and you need to put them
back<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.840> repair<00:01:25.350> them<00:01:25.530> quickly<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.400> if

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
back on or repair them quickly and if

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.950 
back on or repair them quickly and if
you<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> high<00:01:27.210> enough<00:01:27.240> health<00:01:27.630> pool

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you don't have a high enough health pool

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.230 
you don't have a high enough health pool
and<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.799> point<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> having<00:01:29.400> repair<00:01:29.820> so

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and there's no point to having repair so

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.569 
and there's no point to having repair so

reached<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.360> magical<00:03:11.870> fourth<00:03:12.140> skill<00:03:12.500> I

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
reached that magical fourth skill I

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.190 
reached that magical fourth skill I
recommend<00:03:13.250> taking<00:03:13.459> recon<00:03:14.360> on<00:03:14.390> your<00:03:14.720> commander

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
recommend taking recon on your commander

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.410 
recommend taking recon on your commander
either<00:03:15.590> respecting<00:03:16.340> your<00:03:16.459> skills<00:03:16.819> and<00:03:17.030> taking

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
either respecting your skills and taking

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.810 
either respecting your skills and taking
designated<00:03:18.049> target<00:03:18.500> or<00:03:18.650> starting<00:03:19.220> camouflage

designated target or starting camouflage

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.030 
designated target or starting camouflage
on<00:03:20.120> your<00:03:20.299> gunner<00:03:20.510> taking<00:03:21.140> off<00:03:21.350> road<00:03:21.650> driving

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
on your gunner taking off road driving

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.340 
on your gunner taking off road driving
on<00:03:22.459> your<00:03:22.820> driver<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.450> one<00:03:23.930> thing<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.290> would

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
on your driver and one thing I would

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.500 
on your driver and one thing I would
actually<00:03:24.859> like<00:03:25.370> to<00:03:25.549> highlight<00:03:25.790> quickly<00:03:26.420> as

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
actually like to highlight quickly as

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.259 
actually like to highlight quickly as
this<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.900> my<00:03:27.109> object<00:03:27.350> 140<00:03:28.340> driver<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
this is my object 140 driver and the

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.620 
this is my object 140 driver and the
object<00:03:29.569> 140<00:03:29.810> has<00:03:30.519> 54<00:03:31.519> degrees<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.150> second

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
object 140 has 54 degrees a second

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.140 
object 140 has 54 degrees a second
Traverse<00:03:32.900> speed<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.890> prioritized<00:03:34.609> taking

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
Traverse speed I have prioritized taking

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.720 
Traverse speed I have prioritized taking
off-road<00:03:35.540> driving<00:03:35.650> over<00:03:36.650> clutch<00:03:36.890> braking<00:03:37.489> on

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
off-road driving over clutch braking on

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.670 
off-road driving over clutch braking on
my<00:03:38.390> driver<00:03:38.720> because<00:03:39.170> I<00:03:39.260> feel<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.500> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
my driver because I feel that the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.590 
my driver because I feel that the
Traverse<00:03:40.040> speed<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.519> enough<00:03:40.910> on<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.299> object

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
Traverse speed is enough on the object

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.360 
Traverse speed is enough on the object
140<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.650> something<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:43.069> think<00:03:43.220> about

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
140 so that's something to think about

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.789 
140 so that's something to think about
just<00:03:44.090> because<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.389> take<00:03:44.780> clutch<00:03:45.319> braking

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
just because I take clutch braking

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.979 
just because I take clutch braking
before<00:03:46.010> off-road<00:03:46.639> driving<00:03:46.670> on<00:03:47.239> my<00:03:47.389> driver<00:03:47.720> on

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
before off-road driving on my driver on

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.020 
before off-road driving on my driver on
my<00:03:48.200> comet<00:03:48.680> which<00:03:48.889> has<00:03:49.130> quite<00:03:49.400> poor<00:03:49.670> Traverse

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
my comet which has quite poor Traverse

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.370 
my comet which has quite poor Traverse
speed<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.540> doesn't<00:03:50.930> mean<00:03:51.049> that<00:03:51.079> you<00:03:51.230> should

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
speed that doesn't mean that you should

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.110 
speed that doesn't mean that you should
always<00:03:51.500> do<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.280> if<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.639> Traverse<00:03:52.970> speed

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
always do that and if the Traverse speed

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.199 
always do that and if the Traverse speed
is<00:03:53.389> maybe<00:03:53.630> above<00:03:53.989> 45<00:03:54.920> degrees<00:03:55.400> in<00:03:55.609> my<00:03:55.760> opinion

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
is maybe above 45 degrees in my opinion

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.150 
is maybe above 45 degrees in my opinion
as<00:03:56.359> a<00:03:56.389> rule<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:56.810> thumb<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.200> will<00:03:57.410> probably<00:03:57.889> take

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
as a rule of thumb I will probably take

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.009 
as a rule of thumb I will probably take
off-road<00:03:58.579> driving<00:03:58.609> before<00:03:59.150> clutch<00:03:59.569> brake<00:03:59.810> as

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
off-road driving before clutch brake as

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.379 
off-road driving before clutch brake as
a<00:04:00.560> fourth<00:04:00.920> skill<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.430> radio<00:04:01.790> operator<00:04:02.239> in

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
a fourth skill and a radio operator in

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.090 
a fourth skill and a radio operator in
my<00:04:02.630> opinion<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.440> want<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.680> be<00:04:03.769> taking

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
my opinion you want to be taking

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.520 
my opinion you want to be taking
camouflage<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.389> my<00:04:05.569> opinion<00:04:06.019> your<00:04:06.230> loader

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
camouflage and in my opinion your loader

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.770 
camouflage and in my opinion your loader
wants<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.310> either<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.639> taking<00:04:08.000> situational

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
wants to either be taking situational

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.420 
wants to either be taking situational
awareness<00:04:08.840> if<00:04:09.380> it's<00:04:09.500> available<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:10.010> your<00:04:10.190> tank

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
awareness if it's available on your tank

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.670 
awareness if it's available on your tank
or<00:04:10.700> taking<00:04:11.329> camouflage<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.260> that's<00:04:12.470> one

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
or taking camouflage and that's one

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.349 
or taking camouflage and that's one
thing<00:04:12.889> to<00:04:13.010> realize<00:04:13.190> guys<00:04:13.670> is<00:04:14.060> that

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
thing to realize guys is that

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.360 
thing to realize guys is that
situational<00:04:15.109> awareness<00:04:15.170> is<00:04:15.620> either<00:04:15.859> on<00:04:16.340> a

situational awareness is either on a
radio<00:04:17.030> man<00:04:17.239> as<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.600> dedicated<00:04:18.109> skill<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:18.979> if

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
radio man as is a dedicated skill but if

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
it's your loader who can use it our

commander skill only provides you with
two<00:04:30.470> percent<00:04:30.950> still<00:04:31.340> when<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:31.640> combine<00:04:32.030> them

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
two percent still when you combine them

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.820 
two percent still when you combine them
it<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.540> increase<00:04:32.990> your<00:04:33.110> view<00:04:33.320> range<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.680> in

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
it can increase your view range and in

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.040 
it can increase your view range and in
tanks<00:04:34.190> such<00:04:34.340> as<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> FV<00:04:34.790> 4202<00:04:35.210> which<00:04:35.630> have<00:04:35.780> got

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
tanks such as the FV 4202 which have got

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.920 
tanks such as the FV 4202 which have got
a<00:04:36.080> monster<00:04:36.580> 410<00:04:37.580> meters<00:04:37.910> view<00:04:38.300> range<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.720> can

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
a monster 410 meters view range this can

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.420 
a monster 410 meters view range this can
really<00:04:39.170> allow<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.530> spot<00:04:40.010> well

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
really allow you to spot well

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.360 
really allow you to spot well
camouflaged<00:04:40.730> enemies<00:04:41.480> at<00:04:41.860> maximum<00:04:42.860> spotting

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
camouflaged enemies at maximum spotting

camouflaged enemies at maximum spotting
distances<00:04:43.880> of<00:04:44.030> 445<00:04:44.930> meters<00:04:45.290> realistically<00:04:46.220> in

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
distances of 445 meters realistically in

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.580 
distances of 445 meters realistically in
my<00:04:46.460> opinion<00:04:46.910> getting<00:04:47.240> a<00:04:47.300> fifth<00:04:47.630> skill<00:04:48.020> crew<00:04:48.350> is

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
my opinion getting a fifth skill crew is

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.010 
my opinion getting a fifth skill crew is
only<00:04:49.070> really<00:04:49.430> going<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.760> add<00:04:49.940> camouflage<00:04:50.630> to

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
only really going to add camouflage to

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.990 
only really going to add camouflage to
these<00:04:51.230> tanks<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:51.920> maybe<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.760> want<00:04:52.940> to

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
these tanks and maybe you want to
