one of the things that's critical far as
I'm<00:01:21.720> concerned<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:23.160> venturi<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.950> opening

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
notes the of the leap but I'd like to

notes the of the leap but I'd like to
tell<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.830> that's<00:01:34.979> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
tell you what that is but that's a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880

secret but it has to be exact because

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.820 
secret but it has to be exact because
this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.430> much<00:01:38.670> many<00:01:39.270> years<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.720> trial<00:01:40.050> another

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
this is much many years of trial another

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.219 
this is much many years of trial another
thing<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.520> no<00:01:42.270> Western<00:01:42.630> Vincent<00:01:43.050> Bach

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
thing that no Western Vincent Bach

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.170 
thing that no Western Vincent Bach
decreed<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.190> eighth<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> an<00:01:44.610> inch<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.970> gap

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
decreed is an eighth of an inch in gap

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.990 
decreed is an eighth of an inch in gap
up<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:45.660> so<00:01:45.900> my<00:01:46.650> buddy<00:01:46.920> Terry<00:01:47.250> Warburton<00:01:47.850> made

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
up here so my buddy Terry Warburton made

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
up here so my buddy Terry Warburton made
this<00:01:48.150> really<00:01:48.390> cool<00:01:48.510> tool<00:01:49.640> for<00:01:51.619> measuring<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this really cool tool for measuring that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.389 
this really cool tool for measuring that
end<00:01:53.340> gap<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:57.830> think<00:01:58.830> he's<00:01:58.950> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.190> start

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
end gap and I think he's going to start

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.480 
end gap and I think he's going to start
making<00:01:59.729> them<00:01:59.820> again<00:01:59.940> although

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.870 

right<00:02:06.120> now<00:02:06.330> that's<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.930> about<00:02:07.520> three<00:02:08.520> six

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
right now that's just about three six

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:31.470 
right now that's just about three six
minutes

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.580 

well<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> that's<00:02:33.520> where<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.849> gets<00:02:33.970> soldered

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
well so that's where it gets soldered

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.309 
well so that's where it gets soldered
and<00:02:36.300> there's<00:02:37.300> one<00:02:37.480> that<00:02:37.599> I've<00:02:38.170> already

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
and there's one that I've already

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.150 
and there's one that I've already
finished<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.730> then<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.060> gets<00:02:40.239> cut<00:02:40.540> off

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
finished and then it gets cut off

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.570 
finished and then it gets cut off
obviously<00:02:42.160> at<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.060> predetermined<00:02:43.930> length

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
obviously at a predetermined length

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.640 
obviously at a predetermined length
which<00:02:45.580> then<00:02:46.180> gets<00:02:49.019> fit<00:02:50.019> into<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.410> upper

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
which then gets fit into the upper

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.850 
which then gets fit into the upper
receiver<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.630> put<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.080> golf

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
receiver then you put on the golf

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.949 
receiver then you put on the golf
section<00:02:54.580> by<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.760> way<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.030> do<00:02:55.209> not<00:02:55.540> make<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
section by the way I do not make the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.020 
section by the way I do not make the
health<00:02:56.080> obviously<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> certainly<00:02:57.790> have<00:02:57.970> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
health obviously but I certainly have a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.120 
health obviously but I certainly have a
good<00:02:58.209> supplier<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:59.080> there<00:02:59.380> some<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.890> best

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
good supplier is there some of the best

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.180 
good supplier is there some of the best

the beat being soldered so it's a

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
as good so I only do the Bell sometimes

as good so I only do the Bell sometimes
I'll<00:04:40.340> do<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.580> lead<00:04:40.730> pipes<00:04:41.030> but<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.570> always<00:04:42.470> do

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
the bill so now they're so ugly we get

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.440 
the bill so now they're so ugly we get
to<00:04:51.950> put<00:04:52.130> them<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.310> some<00:04:52.460> muriatic<00:04:52.669> acid<00:04:53.090> and

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
to put them in some muriatic acid and

to put them in some muriatic acid and
pickle<00:04:53.720> them<00:04:53.810> get<00:04:54.110> them<00:04:54.200> cleaning<00:05:00.940> about<00:05:01.940> 30

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
pickle them get them cleaning about 30

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:23.850 
pickle them get them cleaning about 30
seconds<00:05:02.720> that's<00:05:02.810> about<00:05:03.080> all<00:05:03.229> we<00:05:03.350> need

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.379 

it's<00:05:24.860> nice<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.280> have<00:05:25.430> a<00:05:25.460> wide<00:05:26.000> variety<00:05:26.240> of

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
it's nice to have a wide variety of

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.770 
it's nice to have a wide variety of
bells<00:05:26.630> to<00:05:26.720> pick<00:05:26.960> from<00:05:27.139> and<00:05:27.850> generally<00:05:28.850> what<00:05:29.720> I

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
bells to pick from and generally what I

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.409 
bells to pick from and generally what I
do<00:05:29.900> is<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.800> get<00:05:30.860> everything<00:05:31.699> assembled<00:05:31.970> here

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
do is I get everything assembled here

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:36.670 
do is I get everything assembled here
and<00:05:32.740> then<00:05:34.300> go<00:05:35.300> through<00:05:35.540> all<00:05:35.690> the<00:05:35.810> bells<00:05:36.020> that

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
and then go through all the bells that

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.100 
and then go through all the bells that
I've<00:05:36.919> got<00:05:37.130> which<00:05:37.430> could<00:05:38.120> be<00:05:38.240> as<00:05:38.360> many<00:05:38.510> as<00:05:38.690> 50<00:05:39.080> or

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
I've got which could be as many as 50 or

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.550 
I've got which could be as many as 50 or
so<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.710> then<00:05:40.669> narrow<00:05:41.419> it<00:05:41.570> down<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.780> six<00:05:42.199> seven

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
so and then narrow it down to six seven

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.860 
so and then narrow it down to six seven
eight<00:05:42.770> and<00:05:43.010> then<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.370> usually<00:05:43.639> enlist<00:05:44.150> my<00:05:44.660> good

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
eight and then I usually enlist my good

get pretty good baseline fur for what

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.610 
get pretty good baseline fur for what
they<00:06:01.780> ultimately<00:06:02.780> are<00:06:03.139> going<00:06:03.200> to<00:06:03.350> be<00:06:03.470> like

they ultimately are going to be like

00:06:03.620 --> 00:07:02.879 
they ultimately are going to be like
before<00:06:04.010> you<00:06:04.160> mount<00:06:04.610> them<00:06:04.790> up

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:05.419 
we'll start up the beat get it just a

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.379 
we'll start up the beat get it just a
little<00:07:05.539> bit<00:07:05.689> clean<00:07:05.990> first
