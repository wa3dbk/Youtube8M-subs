00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780 

what<00:00:00.810> do<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:00.989> buying<00:00:01.199> are<00:00:01.469> acids<00:00:01.949> which<00:00:02.669> are

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
what do the buying are acids which are

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.410 
what do the buying are acids which are
bases<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.419> why<00:00:04.910> remember<00:00:05.910> that<00:00:06.029> acids

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
bases and why remember that acids

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.299 
bases and why remember that acids
increase<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:12.090> hydrogen<00:00:12.509> ion<00:00:12.750> concentration

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
increase the hydrogen ion concentration

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.660 
increase the hydrogen ion concentration
bases<00:00:15.139> decrease<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:17.010> hydrogen<00:00:17.430> ion

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
bases decrease the hydrogen ion

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.720 
bases decrease the hydrogen ion
concentration<00:00:19.189> so<00:00:20.189> let's<00:00:20.369> look<00:00:20.490> at<00:00:20.609> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
concentration so let's look at this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.210 
concentration so let's look at this
first<00:00:20.939> one<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.380> showing<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
first one this is showing the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
first one this is showing the
dissociation<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.990> substance<00:00:25.439> into<00:00:27.470> this

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
dissociation of a substance into this

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.979 
dissociation of a substance into this
should<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.920> be<00:00:29.340> 2<00:00:29.730> h<00:00:30.000> plus<00:00:30.029> s<00:00:30.599> plus<00:00:32.030> s<00:00:33.030> 0

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
should actually be 2 h plus s plus s 0

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.970 
should actually be 2 h plus s plus s 0
for<00:00:34.350> 2<00:00:34.680> minus<00:00:35.660> since<00:00:38.930> this<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.170> dissociating

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
for 2 minus since this is dissociating

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
for 2 minus since this is dissociating
to<00:00:41.190> form<00:00:41.460> hydrogen<00:00:41.730> ions<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.540> increasing

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
to form hydrogen ions it's increasing

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.580 
to form hydrogen ions it's increasing
the<00:00:43.320> concentration<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.550> hydrogen<00:00:45.120> ions<00:00:45.590> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the concentration of hydrogen ions to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.920 
the concentration of hydrogen ions to
the<00:00:46.680> solvent<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.100> added<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.460> their<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.570> this

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the solvent is added to their for this

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.850 
the solvent is added to their for this
is<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.230> acid<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> actually<00:00:51.860> sulfuric

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
is an acid and this is actually sulfuric

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.920 
is an acid and this is actually sulfuric
acid<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:55.280> it<00:00:56.280> dissociates<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.149> form<00:00:57.390> sulfate

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
acid and it dissociates to form sulfate

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.939 
acid and it dissociates to form sulfate
plus<00:00:58.770> hydrogen<00:00:58.949> ions<00:01:01.730> hno3<00:01:03.739> dissociates<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
plus hydrogen ions hno3 dissociates to

plus hydrogen ions hno3 dissociates to
form<00:01:05.220> h<00:01:05.460> plus<00:01:05.909> plus<00:01:06.710> no.3<00:01:07.710> minus<00:01:08.119> again<00:01:09.119> since

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
form h plus plus no.3 minus again since

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
form h plus plus no.3 minus again since
this<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.110> dissociating<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> form<00:01:11.280> hydrogen

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
this is dissociating to form hydrogen

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.910 
this is dissociating to form hydrogen
ions<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.330> increasing<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> concentration

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
ions it's increasing the concentration

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.030 
ions it's increasing the concentration
of<00:01:14.490> hydrogen<00:01:14.790> ions<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.560> therefore<00:01:16.560> it's<00:01:16.860> an

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of hydrogen ions and therefore it's an

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.149 
of hydrogen ions and therefore it's an
acid<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> strong<00:01:18.900> acid<00:01:19.409> nitric<00:01:19.619> acid

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
acid this is the strong acid nitric acid

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
acid this is the strong acid nitric acid
and<00:01:25.340> it's<00:01:27.229> dissociating<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:29.159> form<00:01:29.600> hydrogen

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and it's dissociating to form hydrogen

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.700 
and it's dissociating to form hydrogen
ions<00:01:31.200> plus<00:01:31.770> nitrate<00:01:32.220> ions<00:01:33.290> okay<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.530> have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
ions plus nitrate ions okay here we have

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.890

h<00:01:40.110> minus<00:01:41.450> recall<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.920> another<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.130> look

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
h minus recall that another way to look

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.499 
h minus recall that another way to look
at<00:01:44.369> bases<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.450> increase

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
at bases is that they increase

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.340 
at bases is that they increase
concentration<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:49.200> hydroxide<00:01:50.100> ions<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.350> then

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
concentration of hydroxide ions and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.719 
concentration of hydroxide ions and then
the<00:01:52.890> hydroxide<00:01:53.460> ions<00:01:54.920> find<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> hydrogen<00:01:56.430> ions

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the hydroxide ions find a hydrogen ions

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.319 
the hydroxide ions find a hydrogen ions
to<00:01:57.000> form<00:01:57.149> water<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.619> turn<00:01:58.649> decreases

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
to form water and that in turn decreases

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.240 
to form water and that in turn decreases
the<00:02:00.329> hydrogen<00:02:00.780> ion<00:02:01.020> concentration<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
the hydrogen ion concentration so you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.010 
the hydrogen ion concentration so you
can<00:02:02.340> think<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.610> base<00:02:02.790> either<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.450> just

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
can think of a base either as just

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
can think of a base either as just
something<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.439> decreases<00:02:05.250> hydrogen<00:02:05.670> ion

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
something that decreases hydrogen ion

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.819 
something that decreases hydrogen ion
concentration<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.259> increases

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
concentration or that increases

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.669 
concentration or that increases
hydroxide<00:02:08.399> ions<00:02:08.869> since<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.020> increasing

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
hydroxide ions since this is increasing

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.930 
hydroxide ions since this is increasing
the<00:02:10.770> concentration<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.489> O<00:02:11.610> h<00:02:11.760> minus

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
the concentration of O h minus

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.630 
the concentration of O h minus
it's<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> base<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.070> strong<00:02:15.400> base

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
it's a base and this is a strong base

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:23.420 
it's a base and this is a strong base
sodium<00:02:17.940> hydroxide<00:02:18.940> sodium<00:02:19.900> hydroxide

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.440 

disassociates<00:02:24.430> into<00:02:24.750> sodium<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:25.990> hydroxide

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
disassociates into sodium and hydroxide

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.970 
disassociates into sodium and hydroxide
here<00:02:28.450> i<00:02:28.480> have<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.990> arrows<00:02:29.260> going<00:02:29.290> both<00:02:29.950> ways

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
here i have the arrows going both ways

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.240 
here i have the arrows going both ways
because<00:02:30.910> these<00:02:31.420> are<00:02:31.600> weaker<00:02:31.930> basis<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:32.740> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
because these are weaker basis so the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.690 
because these are weaker basis so the
reactions<00:02:33.730> not<00:02:33.910> so<00:02:34.150> far<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.570> right<00:02:35.700> now

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
reactions not so far to the right now

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.920 
reactions not so far to the right now
let's<00:02:36.910> look<00:02:37.030> at<00:02:37.150> what's<00:02:37.330> happening<00:02:37.660> with<00:02:37.780> this

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
let's look at what's happening with this

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.880 
let's look at what's happening with this
one<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.410> dissociating<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.640> form<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> these

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
one it's dissociating to form so these

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.470 
one it's dissociating to form so these
are<00:02:41.950> weaker<00:02:42.310> acids<00:02:42.730> or<00:02:42.820> bases<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.300> have<00:02:43.420> to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
are weaker acids or bases we have to

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.190 
are weaker acids or bases we have to
figure<00:02:43.570> out<00:02:43.660> which<00:02:43.810> one<00:02:43.960> this<00:02:44.140> is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
figure out which one this is

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.710

this<00:03:08.800> is<00:03:08.980> bicarbonate<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.900> hydroxide<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> i

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
this is bicarbonate and hydroxide so i

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.280 
this is bicarbonate and hydroxide so i
can<00:03:12.610> see<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:13.390> this<00:03:13.540> increase<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
can see with this increase in the

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.610 
can see with this increase in the
hydroxide<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:15.340> i<00:03:15.370> have<00:03:15.640> is<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> base<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.620> this

hydroxide what i have is a base and this

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.870 
hydroxide what i have is a base and this
is<00:03:18.030> sodium<00:03:19.030> bicarbonate<00:03:19.630> which<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.610> weak
