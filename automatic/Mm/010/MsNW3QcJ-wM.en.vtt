00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
laughed at the idea and in the first

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.889 
laughed at the idea and in the first
instance<00:00:39.770> but<00:00:40.610> I<00:00:40.670> was<00:00:40.940> assured<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.570> was<00:00:41.870> a

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
instance but I was assured that it was a

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.139 
instance but I was assured that it was a
young<00:00:42.530> man's<00:00:42.829> game<00:00:42.950> that<00:00:43.370> old<00:00:43.520> men<00:00:43.760> to<00:00:43.910> play

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
and I found there was more skill in the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.600 
and I found there was more skill in the
game<00:00:46.910> than<00:00:47.180> I<00:00:47.300> first<00:00:47.570> thought<00:00:48.190> so<00:00:49.190> here<00:00:49.489> I<00:00:49.520> am

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.060 

about<00:01:08.000> three<00:01:08.270> years<00:01:08.300> ago<00:01:08.570> I<00:01:09.110> realized<00:01:09.530> that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
about three years ago I realized that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.400 
about three years ago I realized that
the<00:01:10.340> numbers<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.360> bowlers<00:01:11.900> for<00:01:12.080> dropping

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
throughout the state bowling clubs were

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.780 
throughout the state bowling clubs were
going<00:01:15.260> broke<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.540> folding<00:01:17.540> up<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:18.790> right

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
going broke and folding up and right

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.130 
going broke and folding up and right
along<00:01:20.030> think<00:01:20.300> about<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.840> thought<00:01:20.990> well

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
along think about it and I thought well

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.859 
along think about it and I thought well
maybe<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.890> fact<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:23.660> younger

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
maybe it's the fact that the younger

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.500 
maybe it's the fact that the younger
people<00:01:24.140> today<00:01:25.270> do<00:01:26.270> not<00:01:26.300> like<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.900> cream

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510

uniforms that we wear and that type of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.700 
uniforms that we wear and that type of
thing<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.009> we<00:01:31.130> thought<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.520> would<00:01:32.560> try<00:01:33.560> and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
thing so we thought we would try and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.980 
thing so we thought we would try and
bring<00:01:33.950> bowls<00:01:34.190> into<00:01:34.550> the<00:01:34.640> 21st<00:01:35.149> century<00:01:35.300> and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
bring bowls into the 21st century and
