there's a lot of them that will be tough
to<00:00:49.720> beat<00:00:49.900> I<00:00:49.930> think<00:00:50.290> it's<00:00:50.440> gonna<00:00:50.589> be<00:00:51.210> Dixon<00:00:52.210> I

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
to beat I think it's gonna be Dixon I

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.930 
to beat I think it's gonna be Dixon I
think<00:00:52.839> power<00:00:53.049> is<00:00:53.229> gonna<00:00:53.409> be<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.559> big<00:00:53.739> threat<00:00:54.040> he

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
think power is gonna be a big threat he

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.560 
think power is gonna be a big threat he
has<00:00:55.739> tremendous<00:00:56.739> speeds<00:00:57.339> on<00:00:57.729> some<00:00:58.030> tracks<00:00:58.330> and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
has tremendous speeds on some tracks and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
has tremendous speeds on some tracks and
he<00:00:59.530> certainly<00:00:59.739> can<00:01:00.129> be<00:01:00.250> very<00:01:00.460> difficult<00:01:00.670> to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
he certainly can be very difficult to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.560 
he certainly can be very difficult to
beat<00:01:01.180> on<00:01:01.360> pure<00:01:01.600> pace<00:01:02.549> but<00:01:03.549> some<00:01:03.760> others<00:01:04.180> are

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
beat on pure pace but some others are

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.420 
beat on pure pace but some others are
the<00:01:04.720> drivers<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.110> strength<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.860> just<00:01:06.190> race

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
the drivers of strength in just race

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.969 
the drivers of strength in just race
pace<00:01:06.670> which<00:01:07.390> i<00:01:07.570> think<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.900> my<00:01:08.049> strength<00:01:08.380> you

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
pace which i think is my strength you

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.160 
pace which i think is my strength you
know<00:01:09.130> right<00:01:10.119> now<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.540> IndyCar<00:01:10.869> Series

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
know right now in the IndyCar Series

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.000 
know right now in the IndyCar Series
there<00:01:11.590> are<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.159> many<00:01:12.430> good<00:01:12.640> drivers<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:14.010> think

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
there are so many good drivers I think

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.970 
there are so many good drivers I think
you<00:01:15.220> could<00:01:15.400> name<00:01:15.580> easily<00:01:16.330> ten<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:17.440> I<00:01:17.470> think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
you could name easily ten that I think

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.680 
you could name easily ten that I think
would<00:01:18.160> have<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.370> legitimate<00:01:18.820> shot<00:01:19.150> at<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
would have a legitimate shot at the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.080 
would have a legitimate shot at the
championship<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.200> so<00:01:23.590> I<00:01:23.980> think<00:01:24.090> first

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
championship and and so I think first

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.720 
championship and and so I think first
and<00:01:25.270> foremost<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:25.990> you<00:01:26.770> know<00:01:26.830> Dixon<00:01:27.310> reigning

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
and foremost is you know Dixon reigning

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.000 
and foremost is you know Dixon reigning
champion<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.390> never<00:01:29.110> count<00:01:29.380> him<00:01:29.470> out<00:01:29.650> because

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
champion and never count him out because

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.680 
champion and never count him out because
if<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.670> looked<00:01:30.850> halfway<00:01:31.120> through<00:01:31.300> last<00:01:31.480> year

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
if you looked halfway through last year

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.880 
if you looked halfway through last year
you<00:01:31.780> would<00:01:32.050> never<00:01:32.200> have<00:01:32.380> thought<00:01:32.410> that<00:01:32.620> he'd

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
you would never have thought that he'd

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
you would never have thought that he'd
go<00:01:33.040> not<00:01:33.250> go<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.610> and<00:01:33.700> win<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:33.910> championship<00:01:33.940> so

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
go not go on and win the championship so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.750 
go not go on and win the championship so
I<00:01:35.080> think<00:01:35.590> that's<00:01:35.710> how<00:01:35.830> competitive<00:01:36.190> it<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.610> and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
I think that's how competitive it is and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.080 
I think that's how competitive it is and
how<00:01:36.880> close<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.520> know<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.700> points<00:01:39.970> can

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
how close it is you know the points can

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.060 
how close it is you know the points can
go<00:01:40.240> up<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.510> down<00:01:40.690> I'm<00:01:41.140> sure<00:01:41.200> Team<00:01:41.650> Penske<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
go up and down I'm sure Team Penske is

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.730 
go up and down I'm sure Team Penske is
gonna<00:01:42.280> be<00:01:42.400> fast<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:42.790> year<00:01:43.200> but<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.710> know

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
gonna be fast this year but you know

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.830 
gonna be fast this year but you know
you've<00:01:45.010> got<00:01:45.220> Ganassi<00:01:46.090> that's<00:01:46.510> gone<00:01:46.690> to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
you've got Ganassi that's gone to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.120 
you've got Ganassi that's gone to
Chevrolet<00:01:47.230> you've<00:01:47.409> got<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.710> earlier<00:01:47.980> that's

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
Chevrolet you've got and earlier that's

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.990 
Chevrolet you've got and earlier that's
gone<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.430> Honda

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
gone to Honda

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.460 
gone to Honda
it's<00:01:49.420> mix<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.780> up<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:49.990> lot<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.320> lot<00:01:50.440> of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
it's mix it up a lot and a lot of

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.080 
it's mix it up a lot and a lot of
continuity<00:01:50.770> with<00:01:51.190> drivers<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.580> teams<00:01:51.909> as

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
continuity with drivers and teams as

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.880 
continuity with drivers and teams as
well<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:52.600> I<00:01:52.810> think<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.409> going<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.590> be<00:01:53.680> super

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
well so I think it's going to be super

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.160 
well so I think it's going to be super
competitive<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:55.600> know<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.720> hope<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.050> be<00:01:56.140> a

I<00:02:57.130> think<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.880> benchmark<00:02:58.300> is<00:02:58.450> always<00:02:58.810> your

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
I think the benchmark is always your

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.590 
I think the benchmark is always your
teammate<00:03:00.070> because<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.120> have<00:03:01.330> as

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
teammate because you know you have as

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.870 
teammate because you know you have as
good<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.900> equipment<00:03:02.380> as<00:03:02.500> they<00:03:03.010> do<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.400> they're

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
good of equipment as they do and they're

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.150 
good of equipment as they do and they're
they're<00:03:04.420> on<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.630> same<00:03:04.780> level<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.350> having<00:03:06.040> to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
they're on the same level so having to

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.280 
they're on the same level so having to
go<00:03:06.580> through<00:03:06.610> Scott<00:03:07.030> Dix<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:08.050> reigning

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
go through Scott Dix and as the reigning

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.810 
go through Scott Dix and as the reigning
champion<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.770> confidence<00:03:09.220> he<00:03:09.250> carries<00:03:09.640> in
