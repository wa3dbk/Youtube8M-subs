achievement<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.640> actually<00:02:53.970> branches<00:02:54.569> off<00:02:54.750> so

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
achievement it actually branches off so

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.559 
achievement it actually branches off so
no<00:02:55.670> we're<00:02:56.670> not<00:02:56.700> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.209> branch<00:02:57.389> off

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
no we're not going to have it branch off

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:58.789 
no we're not going to have it branch off
anything<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.260> I'll<00:02:58.319> just<00:02:58.350> leave<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
anything so I'll just leave it like that

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.710 
anything so I'll just leave it like that
for<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.370> show<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.359> what<00:03:00.480> i<00:03:00.540> mean<00:03:00.569> about

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
for now show you what i mean about

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.199 
for now show you what i mean about
branching<00:03:01.230> off<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.769> second<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:03.090> go

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
branching off in a second just go

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.800 
branching off in a second just go
register<00:03:03.750> achievement<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.660> our

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
register achievement and in our

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.229 
register achievement and in our
achievement<00:03:07.319> method<00:03:07.680> okay<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.060> haven't

okay oh okay okay okay now actually
before<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.280> add<00:03:50.669> in<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.940> last<00:03:51.209> line<00:03:51.510> of<00:03:51.630> code

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859 
before I add in the last line of code

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.229 
before I add in the last line of code
let<00:03:52.859> me<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.130> show<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.370> okay<00:03:54.090> what's

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
let me just show you okay what's

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.909 
let me just show you okay what's
actually<00:03:54.359> going<00:03:54.630> on<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.109> you<00:03:55.590> might<00:03:55.739> be<00:03:55.829> the

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
actually going on here you might be the

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.740 
actually going on here you might be the
confuses<00:03:56.370> about<00:03:56.579> by<00:03:56.880> this<00:03:57.060> but<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.569> being

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
confuses about by this but the being

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.050 
confuses about by this but the being
awesome<00:03:58.169> is<00:03:58.349> actually<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.859> top<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.489> taking

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
awesome is actually on top of the taking

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.699 
awesome is actually on top of the taking
inventory<00:04:00.269> that's<00:04:00.900> why<00:04:01.110> it's<00:04:01.230> branching<00:04:01.439> off

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
inventory that's why it's branching off

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.729 
inventory that's why it's branching off
here<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:03.989> just<00:04:04.230> go<00:04:04.290> back<00:04:04.439> into<00:04:04.590> your

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
here so if you just go back into your

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.589 
here so if you just go back into your
code<00:04:05.010> open<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.140> achievement<00:04:07.140> list<00:04:07.500> java<00:04:08.599> and

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
code open the achievement list java and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.959 
code open the achievement list java and
you'll<00:04:09.719> see<00:04:09.840> all<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.110> achievements<00:04:10.170> ah<00:04:10.969> and

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:11.969 
you'll see all the achievements ah and

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.589 
you'll see all the achievements ah and
you'll<00:04:12.480> see<00:04:12.629> these<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.110> coordinations<00:04:14.599> for

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
you'll see these the coordinations for

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.190 
you'll see these the coordinations for
each<00:04:15.930> achievement<00:04:16.140> so<00:04:16.680> open<00:04:17.070> inventory<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.579> it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
each achievement so open inventory is it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.170 
each achievement so open inventory is it
so<00:04:19.200> open<00:04:19.440> in<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> trees<00:04:19.799> at<00:04:20.010> 0<00:04:20.250> 0<00:04:20.489> as<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.969> being

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
so open in the trees at 0 0 as is being

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.850 
so open in the trees at 0 0 as is being
awesome<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:22.049> we're<00:04:22.140> gonna<00:04:22.229> move<00:04:22.469> that<00:04:22.530> may<00:04:22.800> be

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
awesome so we're gonna move that may be

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.580 
awesome so we're gonna move that may be
up<00:04:23.010> here<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:24.090> yeah<00:04:24.840> and<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.200> will<00:04:25.380> have<00:04:25.500> to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
up here so yeah and you will have to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.029 
up here so yeah and you will have to
play<00:04:25.740> around<00:04:25.860> with<00:04:26.130> this<00:04:26.219> quite<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> bit<00:04:28.039> so

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
play around with this quite a bit so

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.140 
play around with this quite a bit so
fine<00:04:29.250> just<00:04:29.460> go<00:04:29.669> here<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.120> go<00:04:30.300> maybe<00:04:30.570> minus<00:04:30.990> two

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
fine just go here and go maybe minus two

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.779 
fine just go here and go maybe minus two
plus<00:04:33.150> two<00:04:33.620> tests<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.219> I<00:04:35.340> think<00:04:35.580> we'll<00:04:35.760> be

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
plus two tests that and I think we'll be

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.120 
plus two tests that and I think we'll be
fine<00:04:35.940> with<00:04:36.539> it<00:04:36.570> being<00:04:36.870> up<00:04:37.169> there<00:04:37.530> i'll

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
fine with it being up there i'll

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.790 
fine with it being up there i'll
probably<00:04:38.340> change<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:39.210> yeah<00:04:39.719> this<00:04:40.289> is<00:04:40.590> on

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
probably change it but yeah this is on

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.290 
probably change it but yeah this is on
its<00:04:40.950> own<00:04:41.099> it's<00:04:41.280> not<00:04:41.370> branching<00:04:41.909> off<00:04:42.030> anything

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
its own it's not branching off anything

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.420 
its own it's not branching off anything
however<00:04:43.080> achievers<00:04:43.650> like<00:04:43.680> getting<00:04:44.099> wood<00:04:44.250> is

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
however achievers like getting wood is

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.909 
however achievers like getting wood is
branching<00:04:45.000> off<00:04:45.120> taking<00:04:45.450> inventory<00:04:45.659> and<00:04:46.140> the

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
branching off taking inventory and the

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.820 
branching off taking inventory and the
code<00:04:47.159> for<00:04:47.430> that<00:04:47.690> if<00:04:48.690> you<00:04:48.840> see<00:04:48.990> mine<00:04:49.200> would<00:04:49.409> it's

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
code for that if you see mine would it's

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.450 
code for that if you see mine would it's
branching<00:04:50.159> off<00:04:50.460> opening<00:04:50.909> vettori<00:04:51.240> ours<00:04:52.460> isn't

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
branching off anything which is why we

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.209 
branching off anything which is why we
put<00:04:55.260> null<00:04:56.510> okay<00:04:57.510> now<00:04:58.349> to<00:04:58.409> actually<00:04:58.830> register
