 Hello! I'm Susana from Pink &amp; Fun 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.420
 and today I come to show you a mini album that I did 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.700
 to donate to the Portuguese X-Fragile Syndorm Association 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.280
 who will be present at Natalis this year 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.340
 which is a fair that will take place at FIL from December 3 to 7 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.960
 Of course I did not record the video to show you the album 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.660
 even because 2 or 3 photos were more than enough because he is super, super simple 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.700
 but to leave you the invitation to visit the fair 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.940
 and thus they will be able to see, or acquire, of course, 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.580
 this album and several other pieces made by super creative girls with a huge heart 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.900
 who also donated their work to this cause 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.400
 This album was made following a tutorial that you already know 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.180
 I myself followed my tutorial :) 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.720
 and I put birds (of course ...), 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.240
 flowers and butterflies 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 the little bird is on chipboard 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.480
 and the flowers have only here a few pearls 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.660
 the bow to open 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.020
 and behind is simple 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.040
 Here in the tutorial I have the strip 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.240
 on the vertical and here I have on the diagonal 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.300
 I made this change because I placed a pearl here on the tag 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:52.120
 and to engage with the strip vertically, this would run aground even in the center of the strip 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.760
 and then I made this change 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.280
 I put it here and I no longer have this problem 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.360
 Here is the accordion, super simple 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.520
 and this side, the same thing, but with some pockets and some tags 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.400
 And ready! This was the little bit I did 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.160
 I would have liked to have done more but I did not really have time 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.240
 I hope you have enjoyed this video 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.600
 thank you very much for having attended, do not miss visiting the fair, 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.100
 see you next time!
