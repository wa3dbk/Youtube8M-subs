00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
once we have our image finalized we need

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.910 
once we have our image finalized we need
to<00:01:33.000> save<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> TGA<00:01:33.930> file<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
to save it as a TGA file I'm going to be

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060 
to save it as a TGA file I'm going to be
saving<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.400> TSL<00:01:35.970> graffiti<00:01:36.479> 39<00:01:37.170> TGA

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.800 
saving it as TSL graffiti 39 TGA
now<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> next<00:01:39.119> step<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.479> we<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.659> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
now the next step is that we need to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.899 
now the next step is that we need to
convert<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.320> TGA<00:01:40.770> into<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> valve<00:01:41.460> texture

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
convert this TGA into a valve texture

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.660 
convert this TGA into a valve texture
format<00:01:42.329> file<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.990> vtf<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.070> use<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> program

in<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:54.890> blank<00:02:55.130> text<00:02:55.370> file<00:02:55.670> now<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.690> need<00:02:56.870> to

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
in a blank text file now you need to

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.930 
in a blank text file now you need to
edit<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.350> value<00:02:57.680> next<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.070> base<00:02:58.280> texture<00:02:58.760> so

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
edit the value next to base texture so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.310 
edit the value next to base texture so
it<00:02:59.060> directs<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.540> your<00:02:59.660> new<00:02:59.840> VT<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.230> have

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
it directs to your new VT you have

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.800 
it directs to your new VT you have
created<00:03:00.739> so<00:03:00.980> he<00:03:01.310> for<00:03:01.580> our<00:03:01.610> example<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.150> we'll

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
created so he for our example here we'll

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.500 
created so he for our example here we'll
put<00:03:02.959> in<00:03:03.080> crash<00:03:03.350> slash<00:03:03.800> t<00:03:04.040> SL<00:03:04.340> graffiti<00:03:04.730> 39<00:03:05.180> and

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
put in crash slash t SL graffiti 39 and

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.390 
put in crash slash t SL graffiti 39 and
now<00:03:05.570> save<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:06.079> with<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.350> same<00:03:06.560> name<00:03:06.829> as<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.070> VM

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
now save this with the same name as a VM

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150 
now save this with the same name as a VM
T<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.940> might<00:03:08.120> need<00:03:08.590> assurance<00:03:09.590> on<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.860> Windows

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
T you might need assurance on in Windows

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.760 
T you might need assurance on in Windows
if<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.430> can't<00:03:10.640> see<00:03:10.820> them

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.020 

so<00:03:15.770> now<00:03:15.890> that<00:03:15.950> that's<00:03:16.130> saved<00:03:16.460> we<00:03:16.640> can<00:03:16.760> open<00:03:16.850> up

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
so now that that's saved we can open up

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.500 
so now that that's saved we can open up
hammer<00:03:18.430> load<00:03:19.430> up<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:19.700> map<00:03:19.880> we<00:03:20.030> want<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.270> place

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
hammer load up the map we want to place

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.920 
hammer load up the map we want to place
our<00:03:20.690> new<00:03:20.840> overlay<00:03:21.170> in<00:03:25.420> use<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.570> material

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
our new overlay in use the material

our new overlay in use the material
browser<00:03:27.020> to<00:03:27.410> search<00:03:27.590> for<00:03:27.740> our<00:03:27.800> overlay<00:03:30.400> select

it<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:34.000> place<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.030> with<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.420> overlay<00:03:35.720> tool

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
it and place it with the overlay tool

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.700 
it and place it with the overlay tool
and<00:03:37.720> if<00:03:38.720> it<00:03:38.840> needs<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.050> be<00:03:39.110> scale<00:03:39.380> at<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:39.590> we

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
and if it needs to be scale at all we

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.040 
and if it needs to be scale at all we
can<00:03:39.830> do<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.130> right<00:03:40.160> now<00:03:40.490> and<00:03:40.760> that's<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.270> there

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
can do so right now and that's it there

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.480 
can do so right now and that's it there
are<00:03:42.170> a<00:03:42.230> lot<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.500> other<00:03:42.770> options<00:03:43.040> for<00:03:43.400> your

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
are a lot of other options for your

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.950 
are a lot of other options for your
materials<00:03:43.940> and<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.120> highly<00:03:44.360> suggest<00:03:44.570> looking

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
materials and I highly suggest looking

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.690 
materials and I highly suggest looking
at<00:03:45.230> into<00:03:45.530> what<00:03:45.770> each<00:03:45.980> one<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.280> these<00:03:46.340> VMT

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
at into what each one of these VMT

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.100 
at into what each one of these VMT
parameters<00:03:47.210> are<00:03:47.300> doing<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.780> could<00:03:47.930> better

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
parameters are doing so you could better

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.390 
parameters are doing so you could better
be<00:03:48.230> prepared<00:03:48.590> in<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:48.740> future<00:03:48.770> for<00:03:49.250> anything

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
be prepared in the future for anything

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.980 
be prepared in the future for anything
