we're going to show you how to replace
the<00:00:16.540> coupling<00:00:17.170> on<00:00:17.320> a<00:00:17.410> KitchenAid<00:00:17.980> blender

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the coupling on a KitchenAid blender

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.900 
the coupling on a KitchenAid blender
this<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.770> coupling<00:00:21.189> on<00:00:21.369> your<00:00:21.520> blender

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
this is the coupling on your blender

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.940 
this is the coupling on your blender
you'll<00:00:22.810> know<00:00:22.930> that<00:00:22.960> it<00:00:23.170> needs<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.410> be<00:00:23.500> replaced

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
you'll know that it needs to be replaced

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.710 
you'll know that it needs to be replaced
because<00:00:24.250> your<00:00:24.640> blender<00:00:24.939> will<00:00:25.090> no<00:00:25.180> longer<00:00:25.360> mix

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
because your blender will no longer mix

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.690 
because your blender will no longer mix
or<00:00:25.989> perhaps<00:00:26.829> you'll<00:00:27.160> hear<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.310> little<00:00:27.489> bit<00:00:27.579> of<00:00:27.640> a

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
or perhaps you'll hear a little bit of a

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.350 
or perhaps you'll hear a little bit of a
grinding<00:00:28.119> sound<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:30.099> remove<00:00:30.340> it<00:00:30.489> I'm<00:00:31.029> going<00:00:31.329> to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
grinding sound to remove it I'm going to

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.960 
grinding sound to remove it I'm going to
use<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:31.570> flat<00:00:32.020> bladed<00:00:32.259> screwdriver<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:33.730> going

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
use a flat bladed screwdriver I'm going

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.720 
use a flat bladed screwdriver I'm going
to<00:00:34.030> insert<00:00:34.630> it<00:00:34.809> underneath<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.290> coupling

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to insert it underneath the coupling

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.280 
to insert it underneath the coupling
lift<00:00:36.730> up<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.270> little<00:00:37.450> bit<00:00:37.630> and<00:00:37.840> give<00:00:38.170> the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
lift up a little bit and give the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.860 
lift up a little bit and give the
screwdriver<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.829> bit<00:00:38.980> of<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.130> twist<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:40.270> I'm

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
screwdriver a bit of a twist and I'm

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.540 
screwdriver a bit of a twist and I'm
just<00:00:40.989> going<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.170> work<00:00:41.350> my<00:00:41.530> way<00:00:41.559> around<00:00:41.830> turning

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
just going to work my way around turning

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.890 
just going to work my way around turning
the<00:00:42.640> coupling<00:00:43.030> about<00:00:43.210> a<00:00:43.240> quarter<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.720> turn

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
the coupling about a quarter of a turn

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.500 
the coupling about a quarter of a turn
each<00:00:44.110> time<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.820> repeating<00:00:45.820> that<00:00:45.940> same<00:00:46.210> motion

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
each time and repeating that same motion

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:56.400 
each time and repeating that same motion
and<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:48.250> pry<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.580> off<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.270> there<00:00:56.110> it<00:00:56.230> came

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
and just pry it off and there it came

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.180 
and just pry it off and there it came
free<00:00:58.079> before<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.140> thread<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.560> new<00:00:59.680> coupling<00:01:00.100> on

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
free before I thread the new coupling on

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.800 
free before I thread the new coupling on
I'm<00:01:00.370> going<00:01:00.490> to<00:01:00.550> take<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.000> look<00:01:01.150> at<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.390> spindle

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
I'm going to take a look at the spindle

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.630 
I'm going to take a look at the spindle
you<00:01:02.079> can<00:01:02.230> see<00:01:02.440> there's<00:01:02.650> a<00:01:02.890> little<00:01:03.370> bit<00:01:03.520> of

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
you can see there's a little bit of

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.690 
you can see there's a little bit of
metal<00:01:04.000> from<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.329> old<00:01:04.479> threads<00:01:05.400> still<00:01:06.400> on<00:01:06.549> that

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
metal from the old threads still on that

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.069 
metal from the old threads still on that
spindle<00:01:07.240> I'm<00:01:07.390> just<00:01:07.630> can<00:01:07.750> take<00:01:07.899> my<00:01:07.990> little

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
spindle I'm just can take my little

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.230 
spindle I'm just can take my little
screwdriver<00:01:08.619> here<00:01:08.979> and<00:01:09.270> clean<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.420> off<00:01:12.240> like

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
screwdriver here and clean that off like

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.300 
screwdriver here and clean that off like
that<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:15.100> I<00:01:15.130> can<00:01:15.370> take<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.670> new<00:01:15.760> coupling

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that now I can take the new coupling

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.680 
that now I can take the new coupling
thread<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:18.820> blender<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.510> a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
thread it on to the blender that is a

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.770 
thread it on to the blender that is a
reverse<00:01:20.050> thread<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:21.120> it<00:01:22.120> just<00:01:22.330> needs<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.659> be

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
reverse thread and it just needs to be

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.800 
reverse thread and it just needs to be
hand<00:01:23.050> tight<00:01:23.320> as<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:24.490> use<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.180> blender<00:01:25.600> it's

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
hand tight as you use the blender it's

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.760 
hand tight as you use the blender it's
going<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.229> tighten<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.650> coupling<00:01:27.010> back<00:01:27.370> down

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
going to tighten that coupling back down

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.440 
going to tighten that coupling back down
before<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:29.979> go<00:01:30.070> I<00:01:30.460> want<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.760> show<00:01:30.909> you<00:01:30.970> another

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
before we go I want to show you another

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.899 
before we go I want to show you another
method<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:32.020> remove<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.500> coupling<00:01:32.920> this

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
method to remove the coupling this

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.430 
method to remove the coupling this
method<00:01:34.330> requires<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.840> little<00:01:35.140> bit<00:01:35.260> more

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
method requires a little bit more

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.860 
method requires a little bit more
technique<00:01:35.950> but<00:01:36.790> if<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.030> works<00:01:37.180> for<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.750> is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
technique but if it works for you it is

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.260 
technique but if it works for you it is
an<00:01:37.990> easier<00:01:38.320> way<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.590> remove<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.130> coupling<00:01:39.520> you

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
an easier way to remove the coupling you

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.719 
an easier way to remove the coupling you
take<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.510> screwdriver<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.350> put<00:01:42.340> it<00:01:42.430> on<00:01:42.520> one<00:01:42.700> of

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
take a screwdriver and put it on one of

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.210 
take a screwdriver and put it on one of
the<00:01:42.909> teeth<00:01:43.180> on<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.570> coupling<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.110> then<00:01:45.010> with

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
the teeth on the coupling and then with

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.109 
the teeth on the coupling and then with
a<00:01:45.250> mallet<00:01:46.170> give<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.350> sharp<00:01:47.619> tap<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.400> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
a mallet give it a sharp tap and the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:58.800 
a mallet give it a sharp tap and the
coupling<00:01:49.330> should<00:01:49.780> spin<00:01:50.080> free<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
coupling should spin free like that the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.480 
coupling should spin free like that the
coupling<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.409> one<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.740> most<00:01:59.890> common<00:02:00.280> parts

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
coupling is one of the most common parts

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.120 
coupling is one of the most common parts
