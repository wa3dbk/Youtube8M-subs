00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
also medium food that actually is

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.990 
also medium food that actually is
probably<00:02:20.410> somewhere<00:02:21.160> between<00:02:21.220> medium<00:02:21.910> and

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
probably somewhere between medium and

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.080 
probably somewhere between medium and
sit<00:02:22.269> down<00:02:22.299> actually<00:02:23.310> because<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.640> better<00:02:24.910> I

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sit down actually because it's better I

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.550 
sit down actually because it's better I
think<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:25.510> very<00:02:25.630> quality<00:02:26.140> at<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.320> chick-fil-a

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
think it's very quality at a chick-fil-a

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
think it's very quality at a chick-fil-a
I<00:02:27.070> mean<00:02:27.700> chick-fil-a<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.470> quality

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
I mean chick-fil-a is a quality

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.940 
I mean chick-fil-a is a quality
basically<00:02:31.480> would<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.870> compare<00:02:32.290> chick-fil-a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
basically would you compare chick-fil-a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.640 
basically would you compare chick-fil-a
with<00:02:33.190> McDonald's<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.019> McDonald's
