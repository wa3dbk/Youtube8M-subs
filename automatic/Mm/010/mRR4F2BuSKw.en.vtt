00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 You are lik 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.190
 It found toward the stam and portal 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.660
 You also Ri together 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.770
 Where are you going 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.720
 Of course it's a porter 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.930
 Go with solar sailor 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.170
 It should have come out of the four corners 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170
 so 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.100
 Escape 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.000

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.000
 It is painted without 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.620
 That's it 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.650
 The body is stable 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.440
 If you don't get it back, the crew will go out to the outside world 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.730
 Then the reality in front of you will be destroyed 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.730
 Do nothing more than this 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.650
 What do you do from now on 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.690
 Nothing 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.260
 do nothing 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.590
 As it is 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.590
 Have 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.360
 Go riding on the O error Sailor 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.710
 It is full speed to portal 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.710
 You should go ahead before you come 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.390
 I think craft 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.379
 She is saved 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.690
 It will be so 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.319
 Probably program dad wrote 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.620
 Branch flower 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.909
 down 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.909
 Other than that very much 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.530
 b don't say 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.110
 Crawler fit likely 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.060
 Love 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.880
 A whole new life position 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.840
 Cola Wow, that last survival 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.840
 Father's invention 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.010
 It appeared 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.850
 suddenly 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.370
 It does not say from here 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.569
 Appears if the conditions are met 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.760
 They are large 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:31.269
 It is a pure existence that has finished the position we have drawn to fantasy 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.250
 Control and order in the system 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.250
 It was no use searching for perfection 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.600
 It said the section is fit likely splendor as you Todokeyo to the world 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.209
 This will be fine 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:53.380
 It takes some time to start west 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.610
 I wonder what has become trying to Todokeyo 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.460
 Glue dot 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.890
 Went crew is moving 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.350
 He only accepts perfection 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.620
 It would fit of infinite possibilities 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.590
 It was destroyed as it was considered incomplete and not perfect 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.260
 Terrible 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.819
 However 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.799
 It's my sweater 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.120
 The crew is me 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.530
 I'm looking for perfection too 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.720
 I overlooked something in front of my eyes 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.940
 Important things 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.210
 People's quest scene 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.810
 Narrow that share 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.810
 I am unhappy when I get caught around 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:44.569
 anthem 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:48.729
 Being created by Zeanote's pure inquiry 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:48.729
 There is no one who does not have an inquiring mind 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.970
 Whoever 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.970
 There is also the possibility of creating an anthem 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.200
 It seems to have been found yet It seems to have changed the course 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.220
 Even go accustomed model fu 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.580

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:40.609
 me 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.259
 I'm not relieved to see if I shake it 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.110

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.190

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.490

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.520
 I'm not going to put out the mouth to the parent-child thing gar 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:13.080
 At least not the disc would be better to irreversible 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.950
 Before Blue destroys the outside world 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.270
