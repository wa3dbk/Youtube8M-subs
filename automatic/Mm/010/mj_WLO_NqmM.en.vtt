00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
playing catch with it for a while and so

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.139 
playing catch with it for a while and so
far<00:01:56.530> it's<00:01:56.770> been<00:01:56.920> really<00:01:57.100> good<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.609> haven't<00:01:58.000> used

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
far it's been really good I haven't used

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:59.580 
far it's been really good I haven't used
it<00:01:58.329> in<00:01:58.359> any<00:01:58.509> games<00:01:58.780> yet<00:01:58.959> I've<00:01:59.140> only<00:01:59.289> had<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.500> for

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
it in any games yet I've only had it for

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.859 
it in any games yet I've only had it for
a<00:01:59.740> few<00:01:59.770> days<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:01.030> probably<00:02:01.179> about<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.539> third

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
a few days it's probably about a third

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.940 
a few days it's probably about a third
of<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.079> way<00:02:02.170> broken<00:02:02.679> in<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:04.240> i<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:05.770> it's

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
of the way broken in so i think it's

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.499 
of the way broken in so i think it's
going<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.130> be<00:02:06.219> a<00:02:06.280> good<00:02:06.520> blow<00:02:06.670> for<00:02:06.909> me<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.270> i'm

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
going to be a good blow for me and i'm

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.600 
going to be a good blow for me and i'm
going<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.719> use<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.049> the<00:02:08.110> fall<00:02:08.319> season<00:02:08.610> so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
going to use it in the fall season so

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.630 
going to use it in the fall season so
we'll<00:02:10.390> see<00:02:10.539> how<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.690> works<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:11.140> there<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:12.489> if

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
we'll see how it works out there so if

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
we'll see how it works out there so if
you're<00:02:12.670> an<00:02:12.819> infielder<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.959> want<00:02:14.170> evolve

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
you're an infielder and you want evolve

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.650 
you're an infielder and you want evolve
you<00:02:14.920> can<00:02:15.040> use<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.489> while<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
you can use it for a while this is the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.019 
you can use it for a while this is the
one<00:02:16.780> for<00:02:16.810> you
