00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.420 
I saw the first Iron Man trailer I mean
the<00:03:49.960> first<00:03:50.200> one<00:03:50.410> actually<00:03:50.530> sent<00:03:51.010> shivers<00:03:51.220> up

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
the first one actually sent shivers up

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.100 
the first one actually sent shivers up
my<00:03:51.460> spine<00:03:51.550> that<00:03:51.910> was<00:03:52.120> like<00:03:52.270> really<00:03:52.540> intense

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
my spine that was like really intense

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.360 
my spine that was like really intense
this<00:03:53.950> one<00:03:55.170> while<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:56.320> was<00:03:56.440> intense<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:57.070> don't

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
this one while it was intense I don't

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.590 
this one while it was intense I don't
know<00:03:57.460> it<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.670> didn't<00:03:58.000> give<00:03:58.090> me<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.300> same

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.800 
know it just didn't give me that same
feeling<00:03:58.930> but<00:03:59.320> either<00:04:00.190> way<00:04:00.540> trailer<00:04:01.540> looks

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
feeling but either way trailer looks
