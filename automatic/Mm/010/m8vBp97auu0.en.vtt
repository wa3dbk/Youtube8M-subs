00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
first up is the left-hand barrel so we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.900 
first up is the left-hand barrel so we
start<00:00:51.510> pitching<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.040> we<00:00:53.040> move<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.430> stick<00:00:53.699> to

the 7 o'clock position and then we start

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
the 7 o'clock position and then we start
applying<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.969> little<00:00:57.239> bit<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> rudder<00:00:57.780> while

holding that stick position to tighten
the<00:01:00.300> barrel<00:01:00.629> roll<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.589> roll<00:01:01.769> out<00:01:02.180> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.269> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the barrel roll you roll out and then we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.790 
the barrel roll you roll out and then we
level<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:04.159> get<00:01:05.159> up<00:01:05.250> an<00:01:05.369> external<00:01:06.680> see<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.530 
aircraft sign the pitch up we start the
roll<00:01:12.860> using<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.070> rudder<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.420> tighten<00:01:15.420> the
