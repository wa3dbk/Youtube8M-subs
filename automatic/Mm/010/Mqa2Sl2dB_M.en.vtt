00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
the safety and natural appearance and so

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.969 
the safety and natural appearance and so
it<00:04:46.939> is<00:04:47.089> definitely<00:04:47.899> something<00:04:47.929> that<00:04:48.289> can<00:04:48.709> be

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
it is definitely something that can be

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.499 
it is definitely something that can be
done<00:04:49.249> in<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.909> way

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:50.509 
done in that way

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:52.479 
done in that way
now<00:04:51.139> that's<00:04:51.319> my<00:04:51.619> opinion<00:04:52.009> and<00:04:52.279> my

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:52.489 
now that's my opinion and my

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:54.879 
now that's my opinion and my
recommendation<00:04:53.300> when<00:04:53.929> you<00:04:54.050> meet<00:04:54.289> ten

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
recommendation when you meet ten

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.320 
recommendation when you meet ten
surgeons<00:04:55.369> you'll<00:04:55.550> naturally<00:04:55.969> get<00:04:56.119> ten

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
surgeons you'll naturally get ten

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.549 
surgeons you'll naturally get ten
opinions<00:04:56.839> but<00:04:57.019> there<00:04:57.199> should<00:04:57.409> be<00:04:57.589> some<00:04:58.300> some

00:04:59.549 --> 00:04:59.559 
opinions but there should be some some

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.079 
opinions but there should be some some
perspective<00:05:00.559> that<00:05:00.679> you<00:05:00.919> bring<00:05:00.949> with<00:05:01.879> the

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:02.089 
perspective that you bring with the

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:03.669 
perspective that you bring with the
knowledge<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.689> you're<00:05:02.899> acquiring<00:05:03.229> from

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:03.679 
knowledge that you're acquiring from

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:07.149 
knowledge that you're acquiring from
asking<00:05:04.219> so<00:05:04.909> many<00:05:05.029> a<00:05:05.179> question<00:05:05.629> in<00:05:05.749> this<00:05:05.869> way<00:05:06.159> so

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
asking so many a question in this way so

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.329 
asking so many a question in this way so
again<00:05:08.119> it's<00:05:08.839> it's<00:05:09.169> lower<00:05:09.739> eyelid<00:05:10.159> fat

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
again it's it's lower eyelid fat

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:11.199 
again it's it's lower eyelid fat
prolapse

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:11.209
