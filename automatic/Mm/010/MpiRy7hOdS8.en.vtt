feel like the entire game really was
just<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.920> place<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.310> kept<00:00:17.789> compelling<00:00:18.240> me

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
these kinds of less place and would

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.810 
these kinds of less place and would
rather<00:00:43.590> see<00:00:43.890> someone's<00:00:44.219> reactions<00:00:44.700> as

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
rather see someone's reactions as

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
rather see someone's reactions as
they're<00:00:45.000> experiencing<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.840> game<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.350> trust

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
they're experiencing the game but trust

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
they're experiencing the game but trust
me<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.280> isn't<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.670> kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.059> game<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.110> do

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
me this isn't that kind of game if I do

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.959 
me this isn't that kind of game if I do
it<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.530> way<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> videos<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.520> shorter

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it this way the videos will be shorter

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.490 
it this way the videos will be shorter
the<00:00:51.149> gameplay<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.719> better<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.170> I'm

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the gameplay will be better because I'm

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560 
the gameplay will be better because I'm
more<00:00:52.680> focused<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.430> game<00:00:53.640> than<00:00:54.000> talking<00:00:54.360> at

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
more focused on the game than talking at

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
more focused on the game than talking at
the<00:00:54.660> time<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.960> playing<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the time of playing it and the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.619 
the time of playing it and the
commentary<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:56.940> informative<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
commentary will be more informative and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.150 
commentary will be more informative and
coherent<00:00:58.079> because<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.440> will<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.649> focused<00:00:59.039> on

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
coherent because I will be focused on

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
coherent because I will be focused on
that<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> time<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.030> commentating<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that at the time of commentating in the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
that at the time of commentating in the
end<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.559> videos<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.129> simply<00:01:02.460> wind<00:01:02.730> up

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
end these videos will simply wind up

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.469 
end these videos will simply wind up
much<00:01:03.210> better<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.470> took<00:01:04.589> this<00:01:04.890> approach

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
much better because I took this approach

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.050 
much better because I took this approach
the<00:01:06.479> audio<00:01:06.840> will<00:01:07.110> not<00:01:07.320> be<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> best<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.220> will

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
the audio will not be the best I will

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
the audio will not be the best I will
sound<00:01:09.270> like<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> game

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sound like I do right now but the game

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
sound like I do right now but the game
well<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> can't<00:01:11.820> record<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.360> frets

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
well I can't record it with frets

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390 
well I can't record it with frets
because<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> isn't<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.650> game<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.979> runs<00:01:14.189> under

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
because it isn't a game that runs under

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.399 
because it isn't a game that runs under
rec<00:01:14.549> decks<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.060> Camtasia<00:01:15.450> only<00:01:16.080> let<00:01:16.229> me<00:01:16.290> use

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
rec decks and Camtasia only let me use

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
rec decks and Camtasia only let me use
the<00:01:16.560> microphone<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> record<00:01:17.250> instead<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.850> an

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
the microphone to record instead of an

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.940 
the microphone to record instead of an
internal<00:01:18.270> speaker<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> game's<00:01:19.619> audio

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
internal speaker so the game's audio

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.399 
internal speaker so the game's audio
will<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.280> decent<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.150> great<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:22.170> stones

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
will be decent but not great some stones

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109 
will be decent but not great some stones
may<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.650> rough<00:01:22.950> on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> years<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.970> like

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
may be rough on the years and then like

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850 
may be rough on the years and then like
me<00:01:24.299> occasionally<00:01:24.869> pick<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.409> sound<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
me occasionally pick up a sound from the
