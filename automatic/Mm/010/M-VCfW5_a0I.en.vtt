00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 Welcome to a new game of 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.719
 stress today I will give you my most sincere 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.190
 opinion from you because the previous ones 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.570
 videos were for information and I 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.210
 You said history but you like call of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.000
 duty black ops 3 or do not like it then yes 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.039
 guys and I 'm going to tell you before I should 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 say that I do not like to give my opinion of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.150
 game until the past the six 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 months not this time I'm going to do it because 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.720
 Many have asked me and I think that you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 I owe it and I must also apologize 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.750
 by the two previous videos of each 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.110
 audio titled with you you told me 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.460
 that you talked too fast and that 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 you did not like it not that he did it more 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 calm but obviously had very little 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.100
 time and had a lot of information that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.770
 I hope that at least we have 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.510
 served something because I took enough 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 hours in taking all this information 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.800
 to then give you the no since I thought 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.629
 a bit so unpleasant that I tried 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.920
 everything that knew everything about the game and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.570
 you did not know anything, and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.090
 obviously if you did not point it at me and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 I took note of all this because I was not going 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.210
 to agree when I was at home but 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.289
 good guys at least I hope that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 you have enjoyed these two videos 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.199
 past heat and carries costs that the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 you have in the description if you do not 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.980
 you have seen but we are going to focus on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.700
 my personal opinion 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.080
 ceretÃ© you like call of duty black ops 3 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.390
 do not let me get carried away by my first 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.820
 but I'll tell you with more 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.440
 with my most sincere opinion of truth that 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.390
 is the game that I liked the most 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.070
 all the sagas of call of duty is to say 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.200
 is that I did not play neither call of duty 4 nor 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.050
 carlos 25 nor modern warfare 2 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.300
 I started in whites 1 so 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.570
 is my favorite from black ops 1 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.790
 also tell you that it is a mixture between 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.830
 black ops 1 and the expensive one in my opinion 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.470
 it seems a lot in terms of retired both 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.940
 games but have then let's say the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.400
 essence of one and the essence of others 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.710
 together not then for me does that the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.450
 game be a pass the fact of the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.660
 skip it, maybe I do not like it 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.150
 too much you already know that I do not know I do not see 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.440
 I do not see those jumps but fondness and 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.760
 I think they will never take us out of the 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.070
 heat and so I'm going to have to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.830
 get used to them but as I say no 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.020
 I like hopping a little jump 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.310
 tiny as there have always been, 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.990
 It seems much more correct but I already 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.540
 I say it 's a very personal opinion and 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.780
 that practically that little jump you are 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.040
 watching does not alter the game too much 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.020
 Well, I do not care too much 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.850
 the fact of the wall is not something that 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.080
 I should use too much so I'm not going 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.850
 to name because I already tell you that it is a 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.050
 animation that could be in the game 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.660
 I could not be and I would not change 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.250
 practically nothing a bone I think and 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.080
 another thing that I do not like about each 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.970
 discipline with you the only I think 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 is the fact that he could and take care of me 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.010
 suicide the only thing I do not like 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.810
 it's the snows I'm sorry guys but the 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.180
 snows I do not like that is to say as to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.690
 I love teinver but in a game 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.580
 of 14 or 15 hill markets is a pass 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.780
 otherwise the call of duty black ops' 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.940
 is the one that I really liked is this 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.310
 recipe talks about him the bow is that I 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.130
 it seems incredible how bad it is that as 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.170
 you know who is x shots and you have X 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.930
 time not then it is not a weapon 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.970
 that you will be able to use immediately 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.290
 although I hope that by some means 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.820
 where it can happen all the time from 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.890
 long because I would love it I do not know 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.540
 to record a series because I already 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.580
 I'm imagining my head and could 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.440
 get very very cool so nothing guys 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.300
 the last thing I have left to say as 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.920
 personal opinion is that I hope that 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.840
 keep the pipes as they were until 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.820
 now as you see they kill an authentic 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.650
 last and now I'm going to tell you 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.300
 why I like both call of duty 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.920
 black ops 3 as you know a password 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.500
 It seems like a game that rewards the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 Skill the skill and me that 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.130
 honestly I do not like it clear that it has 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.350
 side will be a game that rewards a lot 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.760
 the head that you had as you moved 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.200
 is that it is broken before in the gardens 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.330
 that you had a better position than the 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.250
 enemy and call of duty black on them 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.950
 that essence returns 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.410
 your movements as controls the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.210
 backup as you handle it you are bread 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.250
 because he answers is very very well 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.350
 done and I repeat with the answer or is it 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.210
 that I love to use for myself the basis of 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.160
 heat and is that the backing in this well 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.840
 and in this case disciple with you what's going 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.640
 to be it buster guys is going to be in 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.290
 these three maps that we tested were 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.180
 cool you no longer have to change 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.190
 nothing in a pre alpha because it's a pre 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.980
 alpha that is not an alpha that has said 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.290
 I do not know who is not a pre-alpha slut what 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.270
 I know for sure because he said it 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.459
 creator of the broth live with cds with what 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.560
 which is a pre alpha but yes that 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.910
 He said that alpha had already done it or 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.730
 it's good that he did not tell me because 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.639
 I do not know much English but he told me 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.129
 boy that I was with so 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.240
 nothing is that it was a pre alpha or this is 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.650
 it's a pre alpha what happens that already 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.719
 they have developed the alpha and 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.430
 probably already have the beta because the 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:32.229
 next month as you know it will come out 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.819
 for all of you on playstation 4 a 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.279
 week before nx to take I 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.529
 personally, I'm going to try it on 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:40.749
 both consoles and I will tell you in which 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.759
 I like it better but obviously playstation 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:44.590
 4 will have exclusivity so 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.029
 I suppose it will go much better filled 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.279
 warfare driving and it goes much better 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.590
 so I think that in play 4 will go 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:52.689
 super super super well taken care of that with 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.580
 the beta I think they're going to get a lot more 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.139
 information of what we saw in the pre 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.750
 alpha I think they're going to get all the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.639
 weapons and I hope at least they take out all 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.759
 the weapons of the call of duty black ops' 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.469
 because as you know, I do not provide 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.180
 almost no weapon of all those that 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:10.180
 there were always two censored and 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.740
 then, then, I could not prove everything 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.379
 what was in the game and I am very 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.419
 employee basically for a very reason 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.770
 reasons for weapons that get good 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.849
 Well, they can be well, they can be bad 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.129
 but what else what more gp me is the 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.740
 if they are going to put the ub sad 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.969
 orbital I think all of you all 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.949
 we want 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.019
 since you do not know what a streak is that gives 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.939
 a mobility on the map that gives you a 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.709
 freedom that is impressive is that it is 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.329
 take out of that and start to destroy 

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.979
 all the enemies I believe that all 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:40.719
 we like to do that from time to time like this 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.759
 that nothing guys up here the video of 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.289
