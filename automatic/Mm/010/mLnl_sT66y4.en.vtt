 short windows had up to 200 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.979
 involved workers demanded everything 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.259
 as befits an official 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.840
 Of course, the opening was also heard 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.509

 President of the Diet Harald Sondergger 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.830
 skillfully took on this task 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.510
 reason of the first experience can 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.300
 the panorama track despite many prophecies 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.070
 regarding the wind already after two 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.650
 months counted as a full success 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.510
 be very good feeling now is the 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.290
 rail officially opened now is the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.910
 band blessed though they have been for 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.850
 quite some time since a few weeks 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.190
 very well run on down to call 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.239
 despite the strong wind she drives 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.190
 almost always 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.079
 she stands stronger we mentioned old ones 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.790
 So she drives at high 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.209
 speeds that we are very happy too 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.180
 hear 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.310
 of course there are plans it will continue 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.900
 invested it goes at the same pace 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.459
 continue in recent years 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.739
 we're happy it's really big 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.560
 Projects now pending thanks to 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.000
 Construction along the main wind direction 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.400
 the new train has even less 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.370
 downtime than all the rest 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.680
 monorail together with the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.980
 blessing is now a rush through 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.989
 winter sportsman nothing in the way of 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.489
 The blessing of the evil ruler is one 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.100
 Of course, once again relieved and 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.709
 glad I'm sure she tells everyone 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.959

 million expensive investment and pleased 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.010
 as an avid skier too 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.870
 already on the first ride 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.659

 even though I have something today 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.090
 worse than usual view the 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.860
 best and the train may use after 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.780
 a short descent through the detail 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.239
 including fresh snow was at 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.810
 memory bank blessed in connection with the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.400
 new pumping station officially inaugurated 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.810
 project manager martin oberhammer supplies 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.209
 the interesting facts about the new one 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.280
 snow-making system and interested 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.709
 could learn more at a guided tour 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.900
 here at the Hochjoch at the altogether eight 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.419
 kilometer of new lines laid with 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.639
 about 130 new fast bad ones 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.580
 We also have great things with the growers 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.580
 Upgraded we have 140 new forests 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.410
 and land purchased between producers 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.600
 in total we now have about 300 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 snow producers in the state together with 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.039
 the partner klemckov has the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.970
 silvretta montafon now the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.070
 Snow-making facility in the ski area 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.710
 hochjoch stood on the latest of 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.660
 brought technology and also innovations 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.130
 have been implemented 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.750
 Of course we want with the products 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.870
 convince and we are very much 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.330
 money developments in research and 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.970
 We succeeded in loading the lance 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.099
 you build the compressed air 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.690
 Consumers with half the air out 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.479
 that comes with half the energy 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.699
 gets along and thus at the same site 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.630
 production consumes half the energy 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.449
 and that is a really energy 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.949
 This will be especially efficient with the 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.840
 silvretta montafon pushed ahead because 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:13.680
 we now have the experience in 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.750
 the height with lances the little air 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.240
 need to produce good snow 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.440
 the detail lies in the jets of the rtl 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.750
 lies 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.220
 have this head and then it works 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.260
 into the know-how rhine where you are now 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.840
 Of course, continue with the Fraunhofer 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.340
 institut and parallel to this 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.540
 by different tests also with the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.820
 to make silvretta montafon 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.040
 to conclude the opening ceremony 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.630

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.510
 Kapell restaurant loaded

 at the big buffet the 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.620
 energy reserves are refilled 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.660
 The company Doppelmayr and about both 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.080
 were instrumental in the project panorama 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.550
 involved presented romans andrae 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.010
 representing a cowbell as well 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.560
 a congratulations plate with good food 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.390
 and in a cozy atmosphere left the 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.680
 present the successful event 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.170
 finish 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.580
 and who else could do that too 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.580
 make tracks unsafe
