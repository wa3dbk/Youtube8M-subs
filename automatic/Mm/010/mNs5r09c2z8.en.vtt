corner thing and then applying some
shimmer<00:03:08.660> shadow<00:03:08.960> I<00:03:09.080> think<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:10.460> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
shimmer shadow I think it is to the

center<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> lower<00:03:11.240> lash<00:03:11.450> line<00:03:11.690> using<00:03:12.620> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
treatment with the sponge I think this

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.830 
treatment with the sponge I think this
is<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.810> brightener<00:03:18.440> or<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.100> illuminator

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
it but I will attempt to blend it all

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.030 
it but I will attempt to blend it all
out<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:45.110> use<00:03:45.380> it<00:03:45.560> as<00:03:45.739> a<00:03:45.970> contouring<00:03:46.970> technique

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
you could just remove it and go back

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.320 
you could just remove it and go back
over<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.870> foundation<00:03:51.560> but<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.070> just<00:03:53.000> decided

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
over with foundation but I just decided

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.620 
over with foundation but I just decided
to<00:03:53.480> leave<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.959> for<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.200> day<00:03:55.630> blending
