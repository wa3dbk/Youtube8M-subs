you're gonna need a 17 millimeter socket
on<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.580> extension<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:19.520> wrapped<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.699> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
on an extension but I wrapped it to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.540 
on an extension but I wrapped it to
break<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.210> loose<00:00:21.359> our<00:00:21.930> spark<00:00:22.320> plug<00:00:22.500> tool<00:00:22.740> if

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
for tool once you've broken loose

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.520 
for tool once you've broken loose
completely<00:01:03.920> there<00:01:04.920> may<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.580> come<00:01:05.760> off<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
completely there may just come off and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.640 
completely there may just come off and
you<00:01:07.619> suck<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:09.020> what<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.170> mine<00:01:10.350> they're<00:01:10.530> not

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you suck it what like mine they're not

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.490 
you suck it what like mine they're not
stuck<00:01:10.950> there<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:15.500> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
I use a magnetic pickup talk about nice

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.070 
I use a magnetic pickup talk about nice
pins<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> I'll<00:01:22.710> do

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.630 

there's<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.710> slide<00:01:26.070> Bella

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.460 

being<00:01:32.300> careful<00:01:32.690> not<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.870> damage<00:01:32.990> it<00:01:35.410> there<00:01:36.410> we

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
being careful not to damage it there we

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.080 
being careful not to damage it there we
have<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:37.420> spark<00:01:38.420> plug<00:01:38.600> out<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.940> then<00:01:40.940> that's

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
have it a spark plug out and then that's

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.860 
have it a spark plug out and then that's
the<00:01:41.120> same<00:01:41.300> process<00:01:41.780> for<00:01:41.810> all<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.650> them<00:01:43.870> and

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
the same process for all of them and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.590 
the same process for all of them and
then<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.110> place<00:01:45.350> your<00:01:45.620> new<00:01:45.680> ones<00:01:46.010> they<00:01:46.130> should

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
then to place your new ones they should

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.330 
then to place your new ones they should
pop<00:01:47.600> your<00:01:47.810> new<00:01:47.930> ones<00:01:48.229> in<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.950> there

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
pop your new ones in in there

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.530 
pop your new ones in in there
drop<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.060> there<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.240> don't<00:01:50.300> want<00:01:50.479> to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
drop it in there you don't want to

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.530 
drop it in there you don't want to
damage<00:01:50.690> it<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:52.070> if<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.400> if<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.120> can<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.450> in

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
damage it so if you if you can get it in

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.180 
damage it so if you if you can get it in
with<00:01:53.690> your<00:01:53.780> tool<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.380> putting<00:01:54.620> we've<00:01:54.740> taught

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
with your tool and putting we've taught

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.460 
with your tool and putting we've taught
if<00:01:55.850> you<00:01:55.970> have<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.240> use<00:01:56.479> your<00:01:56.690> magnetic<00:01:56.930> tool<00:01:57.229> to

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
if you have to use your magnetic tool to

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.170 
if you have to use your magnetic tool to
lower<00:01:58.070> it<00:01:58.250> into<00:01:58.400> what<00:01:58.729> I'll<00:01:58.850> do

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
lower it into what I'll do

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.580 
lower it into what I'll do
lower<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.690> and<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:01.610> just<00:02:01.880> very<00:02:02.060> gently

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
lower it in and then just very gently

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.480 
lower it in and then just very gently
tighten<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.740> well<00:02:03.860> if<00:02:04.009> you've<00:02:04.130> got<00:02:04.280> a<00:02:04.310> piece

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
tighten and well if you've got a piece

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.880 
tighten and well if you've got a piece
of<00:02:04.550> rubber<00:02:04.940> are<00:02:05.119> whores<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:06.259> tightened<00:02:06.650> put

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
of rubber are whores and tightened put

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.740 
of rubber are whores and tightened put
the<00:02:07.009> whores<00:02:07.190> on<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.430> end<00:02:07.550> of<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:07.700> plug<00:02:07.880> and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
the whores on the end of the plug and

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.330 
the whores on the end of the plug and
tighten<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.320> noise<00:02:09.530> first<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:10.280> you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
tighten with the noise first what you

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.320 
tighten with the noise first what you
don't<00:02:10.489> want<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.670> do<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.880> you<00:02:10.970> don't<00:02:11.090> want<00:02:11.270> to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
don't want to do is you don't want to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.479 
don't want to do is you don't want to
cross<00:02:11.510> thread<00:02:11.830> these<00:02:12.830> in<00:02:13.070> your<00:02:13.160> cylinder

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
cross thread these in your cylinder

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.520 
cross thread these in your cylinder
heads<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:13.820> we<00:02:13.940> do<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.380> then<00:02:15.380> you<00:02:15.500> probably

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
heads if we do that then you probably

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.740 
heads if we do that then you probably
basically<00:02:16.220> you've<00:02:17.209> got<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> bigot<00:02:17.830> repairable

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
basically you've got a bigot repairable

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.070 
basically you've got a bigot repairable
so<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:21.680> gently<00:02:21.890> tighten<00:02:22.250> them<00:02:22.430> up<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.959> then

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
so just gently tighten them up and then

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.780 
so just gently tighten them up and then
use<00:02:24.200> one<00:02:24.380> nip<00:02:24.650> them<00:02:24.770> tight<00:02:25.040> quarter<00:02:25.489> of<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.610> turn

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
use one nip them tight quarter of a turn

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.580 
use one nip them tight quarter of a turn
or<00:02:26.540> if<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.290> tart<00:02:27.530> wrench<00:02:32.500> repeat<00:02:33.500> that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
or if you have a tart wrench repeat that

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.130 
or if you have a tart wrench repeat that
process<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:34.190> four<00:02:34.220> over<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.989> then

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
process for all four over and then

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.920 
process for all four over and then
obviously<00:02:36.230> coil<00:02:36.799> pack<00:02:37.010> back<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.690> hope

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
obviously coil pack back in so I hope

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.470 
obviously coil pack back in so I hope
that<00:02:39.080> helps<00:02:39.230> someone<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.090> said<00:02:41.269> if<00:02:41.390> you
