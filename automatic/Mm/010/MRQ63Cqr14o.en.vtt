from Lance camper manufacturing you know

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.039 
from Lance camper manufacturing you know
a<00:00:14.040> lot<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.370> time<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.730> process<00:00:15.179> has<00:00:15.690> been<00:00:15.900> put

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
a lot of time and process has been put

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
a lot of time and process has been put
into<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.500> design<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.640> effort<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
into the design and the effort of the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
into the design and the effort of the
front<00:00:18.930> nose<00:00:19.140> cap<00:00:19.410> on<00:00:19.650> our<00:00:19.680> product<00:00:20.250> it's

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
front nose cap on our product it's

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.700 
front nose cap on our product it's
definitely<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> unique<00:00:21.779> type<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.140> product

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
definitely a unique type of product

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.130 
definitely a unique type of product
that's<00:00:22.830> made<00:00:23.070> out<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.310> tpo<00:00:23.810> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.960> very

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
that's made out of tpo which is very

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
that's made out of tpo which is very
similar<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> materials<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.090> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
similar to the materials in the way that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.089 
similar to the materials in the way that
you<00:00:27.390> would<00:00:27.510> design<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> front<00:00:28.260> bumper<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.740> car

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
you would design a front bumper on a car

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.519 
you would design a front bumper on a car
the<00:00:29.789> process<00:00:30.269> that<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> takes<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:31.019> build<00:00:31.230> this

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the process that it takes to build this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.240 
the process that it takes to build this
front<00:00:31.800> nose<00:00:32.040> cap<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.910> very<00:00:33.719> expensive<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
front nose cap is very expensive and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.119 
front nose cap is very expensive and
it's<00:00:35.730> also<00:00:35.960> very<00:00:36.960> creative<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> design

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
it's also very creative on the design

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430 
it's also very creative on the design
standpoint<00:00:38.700> come<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.570> actually<00:00:39.930> made<00:00:40.140> with

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
standpoint come it's actually made with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
standpoint come it's actually made with
a<00:00:40.850> aluminum<00:00:41.850> mold<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.290> where

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a aluminum mold that's actually where

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.220 
a aluminum mold that's actually where
the<00:00:43.620> front<00:00:44.370> nose<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.270> heat<00:00:45.600> press<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the front nose is is heat press and it

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.799 
the front nose is is heat press and it
goes<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.800> water<00:00:47.190> type<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.090> cooling

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
goes into a water type of cooling

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
goes into a water type of cooling
process<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:49.770> molds<00:00:50.280> our<00:00:50.430> nose

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
process that actually molds our nose

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.580 
process that actually molds our nose
it's<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.360> aerodynamic<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.430> very

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's very aerodynamic and it's very

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
it's very aerodynamic and it's very
resistant<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.949> types<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.430> temperatures

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
resistant to all types of temperatures

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
resistant to all types of temperatures
and<00:00:57.239> other<00:00:57.300> things<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.809> exist<00:00:58.350> within

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and other things that that exist within

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.099 
and other things that that exist within
the<00:00:59.460> area<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.480> thing<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the area so one thing that I want to

exactly what our noses can do you know
it's<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.610> excited<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> ball<00:01:18.540> player

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
obviously there's things that need to be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
obviously there's things that need to be
talked<00:01:22.799> about<00:01:22.950> learned<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> etiquette

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
talked about learned about the etiquette

and<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.780> production<00:01:25.380> process<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.009> let<00:01:26.100> me

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and the production process so let me

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.740 
and the production process so let me
talk<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.820> three<00:01:26.850> different<00:01:27.180> types<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
talk about the three different types of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.569 
talk about the three different types of
noses<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.380> exists<00:01:28.950> within<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.310> industry

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
noses that exists within the industry

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.620 
noses that exists within the industry
one<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.750> ABS<00:01:31.200> nose<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.979> fiberglass<00:01:32.700> nose<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
one is an ABS nose a fiberglass nose and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.560 
one is an ABS nose a fiberglass nose and
the<00:01:33.810> Lance<00:01:34.049> exclusive<00:01:34.770> PPO<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:36.150> one<00:01:36.390> thing

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the Lance exclusive PPO now one thing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
the Lance exclusive PPO now one thing
that<00:01:36.659> I'll<00:01:36.780> tell<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.170> ABS<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that I'll tell you about ABS and

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
that I'll tell you about ABS and
fiberglass<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> when<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> gets<00:01:39.840> cold<00:01:39.960> they

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
fiberglass and when it gets cold they

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
fiberglass and when it gets cold they
can<00:01:40.650> crack<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.610> if<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.850> driving<00:01:42.060> down<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
can crack and if you're driving down the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
can crack and if you're driving down the
road<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> colder<00:01:43.860> weather<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.310> things

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
road and it's colder weather and things

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
road and it's colder weather and things
like<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:45.390> something<00:01:45.780> impacts<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> front

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
like that if something impacts the front

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
like that if something impacts the front
of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> nose<00:01:47.040> there's<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.759> potential<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.360> the
