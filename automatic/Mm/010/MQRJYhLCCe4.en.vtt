mean<00:06:31.360> spandex<00:06:31.720> camp<00:06:31.960> I<00:06:32.110> don't<00:06:32.260> like<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.620> dark

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
mean spandex camp I don't like the dark

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.600

apps they're too tight they hurt
so<00:06:36.610> I<00:06:36.640> think<00:06:37.030> that<00:06:37.480> the<00:06:37.690> spinet<00:06:38.380> cap<00:06:38.650> is<00:06:38.920> like

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
so I think that the spinet cap is like

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.650 
so I think that the spinet cap is like
the<00:06:39.280> best<00:06:39.490> cat<00:06:39.820> for<00:06:40.000> the<00:06:40.090> week<00:06:40.240> because<00:06:40.480> it's

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
because at first it you could stretch it

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.620 
because at first it you could stretch it
out<00:06:45.340> to<00:06:45.580> it<00:06:45.640> however<00:06:45.790> you<00:06:46.000> want<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.270> stretch<00:06:46.510> it
