00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.080 

so<00:00:00.690> I<00:00:00.960> will<00:00:01.199> be<00:00:01.319> unboxing<00:00:01.829> at<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.280> time<00:00:02.550> the

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
so I will be unboxing at this time the

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.600 
so I will be unboxing at this time the
intel<00:00:03.629> core<00:00:03.840> i7<00:00:04.490> quad-core<00:00:05.490> processor<00:00:06.859> i7<00:00:07.859> 930

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
intel core i7 quad-core processor i7 930

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.180 
intel core i7 quad-core processor i7 930
so<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> replacement<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> 920<00:00:11.040> as

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
so this is a replacement for the 920 as

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.580 
so this is a replacement for the 920 as
you<00:00:11.790> may<00:00:12.059> know<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.630> already<00:00:13.049> watched<00:00:13.290> my

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
you may know if you already watched my

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.670 
you may know if you already watched my
unboxing<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.549> OEM<00:00:15.120> 930<00:00:15.839> which<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
unboxing of the OEM 930 which is the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.460 
unboxing of the OEM 930 which is the
exact<00:00:17.100> same<00:00:17.220> chip<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.090> not<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.510> box<00:00:18.720> it's

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
exact same chip but not in a box it's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.040 
exact same chip but not in a box it's
just<00:00:19.740> by<00:00:19.920> itself<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.210> unboxing<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.840> very

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
just by itself and the unboxing was very

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.960 
just by itself and the unboxing was very
uninteresting<00:00:22.710> because<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.789> was

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
uninteresting because you just it was

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
uninteresting because you just it was
that<00:00:24.150> chip<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:25.230> was<00:00:25.380> no<00:00:25.529> box<00:00:25.710> okay<00:00:26.519> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that chip and there was no box okay so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
that chip and there was no box okay so
why<00:00:26.820> don't<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.150> look<00:00:27.390> at<00:00:27.630> everything

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
why don't we have a look at everything

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
why don't we have a look at everything
it<00:00:28.349> says<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.099> particular<00:00:29.609> CPU<00:00:29.910> so

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
it says about this particular CPU so

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
it says about this particular CPU so
first<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> frequency<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> 2.8

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
first of all we have a frequency of 2.8

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.500 
first of all we have a frequency of 2.8
gigahertz<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:34.020> socket<00:00:34.410> LGA<00:00:34.500> 6<00:00:35.510> 1366

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
gigahertz then we have socket LGA 6 1366

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.000 
gigahertz then we have socket LGA 6 1366
the<00:00:37.140> i7<00:00:37.559> 938<00:00:38.219> Meg's<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.640> cache<00:00:38.850> 4.8<00:00:39.510> qpi

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
the i7 938 Meg's of cache 4.8 qpi

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.090 
the i7 938 Meg's of cache 4.8 qpi
transfer<00:00:41.180> frequency<00:00:42.180> ok<00:00:42.680> all<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
transfer frequency ok all of the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.560 
transfer frequency ok all of the
information<00:00:44.579> about<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> batch<00:00:45.090> as<00:00:45.329> well<00:00:45.480> as

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
information about the batch as well as

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
information about the batch as well as
the<00:00:45.690> serial<00:00:46.020> number<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:46.770> there<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.489> why

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the serial number is right there so why

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.720 
the serial number is right there so why
don't<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> show<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> road<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
don't we get this show on the road and I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
don't we get this show on the road and I
can't<00:00:51.600> believe<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.989> still<00:00:52.199> don't<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
can't believe it I still don't have a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.380 
can't believe it I still don't have a
knife<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.800> forgot<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> get<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> knife<00:00:53.550> that's<00:00:54.120> ok

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
knife I forgot to get a knife that's ok

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.139 
knife I forgot to get a knife that's ok
I'll<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.629> I'll<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.140> rip<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.590> sticker<00:00:56.250> it's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
I'll just I'll just rip the sticker it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.590 
I'll just I'll just rip the sticker it's
all<00:00:57.239> good

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
all good

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
all good
seem<00:00:57.930> slow<00:00:58.469> going<00:00:58.710> but<00:00:58.859> I'm<00:00:59.129> making<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.760> happen

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
seem slow going but I'm making it happen

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
seem slow going but I'm making it happen
here<00:01:00.239> we're<00:01:01.079> putting<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> sticker<00:01:01.590> step<00:01:02.370> by

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
here we're putting the sticker step by

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
here we're putting the sticker step by
step<00:01:02.879> step<00:01:03.270> by<00:01:03.329> step<00:01:03.809> trying<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> wreck<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
step step by step trying not to wreck it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.679 
step step by step trying not to wreck it
too<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.720> go<00:01:08.090> all<00:01:09.090> right<00:01:09.330> so

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
too much there we go all right so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.230 
too much there we go all right so
there's<00:01:09.990> another<00:01:10.170> UPC<00:01:11.159> code<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:12.210> sure

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
there's another UPC code here not sure

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
there's another UPC code here not sure
what<00:01:12.479> that's<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.860> we'll<00:01:14.070> flip<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> over

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
what that's for and we'll flip this over

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.710 
what that's for and we'll flip this over
and<00:01:15.530> out<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.890> comes<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.360> thing<00:01:18.570> we

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and out it comes so the first thing we

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.149 
and out it comes so the first thing we
will<00:01:18.840> find<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> installation

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
will find is the installation

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
will find is the installation
instructions<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:21.060> well<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> three<00:01:21.810> year

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
instructions as well as the three year

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.630 
instructions as well as the three year
limited<00:01:22.080> warranty<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> difference

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
limited warranty this is a difference

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
limited warranty this is a difference
between<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.299> retail<00:01:24.750> chip<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> an<00:01:25.530> OEM<00:01:25.860> chip<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
between a retail chip and an OEM chip is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.830 
between a retail chip and an OEM chip is
that<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> retail<00:01:27.119> chip<00:01:27.390> comes<00:01:27.630> with<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that a retail chip comes with a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
that a retail chip comes with a
three-year<00:01:28.380> warranty<00:01:28.619> whereas<00:01:29.159> an<00:01:29.280> OEM<00:01:29.820> CPU

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
three-year warranty whereas an OEM CPU

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.289 
three-year warranty whereas an OEM CPU
actually<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> believe<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.950> only<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> one-year

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
actually I believe it's only a one-year

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
actually I believe it's only a one-year
warranty<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.140> should<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
warranty and it should be through the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.760 
warranty and it should be through the
retailer<00:01:35.520> or<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.110> system<00:01:37.110> integrator<00:01:37.530> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
retailer or the system integrator that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
retailer or the system integrator that
you<00:01:37.890> buy<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> CPU<00:01:38.729> from<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.570> means<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you buy the CPU from so that means that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
you buy the CPU from so that means that
you<00:01:40.020> do<00:01:40.290> not<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.799> any<00:01:41.280> Intel<00:01:41.520> warranty<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you do not have any Intel warranty on a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.569 
you do not have any Intel warranty on a
om<00:01:42.479> CPU<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.350> also<00:01:43.530> includes<00:01:43.950> an<00:01:44.040> Intel<00:01:44.310> Inside

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.969 
just like that's all shiny and nice I
really<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.729> Case<00:01:51.060> badge<00:01:51.270> stickers

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
really like these Case badge stickers

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.670 
really like these Case badge stickers
next<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.250> find<00:01:53.689> whoa<00:01:54.689> look<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
next we will find whoa look at that it's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.280 
next we will find whoa look at that it's
like<00:01:55.770> wow<00:01:56.369> ok<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.969> been<00:01:57.180> um<00:01:57.540> why<00:01:58.110> don't<00:01:58.229> we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
like wow ok that's been um why don't we

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
like wow ok that's been um why don't we
look<00:01:58.380> at<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> heatsink<00:01:58.979> first<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> we'll

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
look at the heatsink first and we'll

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
look at the heatsink first and we'll
just<00:01:59.820> kind<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.270> sweep<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> over<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.259> okay

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
just kind of sweep that over there okay

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
just kind of sweep that over there okay
so<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.430> heatsink<00:02:02.880> mm-hmm<00:02:03.450> Wow<00:02:04.200> looks<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.500> an

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so the heatsink mm-hmm Wow looks like an

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490 
so the heatsink mm-hmm Wow looks like an
80<00:02:04.860> mil<00:02:05.070> fan<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.759> four<00:02:06.090> pin<00:02:06.299> pwm<00:02:07.079> design

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
80 mil fan it's a four pin pwm design

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.150 
80 mil fan it's a four pin pwm design
it's<00:02:07.770> your<00:02:08.099> your<00:02:08.670> bone<00:02:09.119> stock<00:02:09.629> standard<00:02:10.170> intel

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it's your your bone stock standard intel

it's your your bone stock standard intel
box<00:02:11.760> cooler<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
box cooler for the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.700 
box cooler for the
1866<00:02:14.670> socket<00:02:15.120> they<00:02:15.300> haven't<00:02:15.630> really<00:02:15.930> made<00:02:16.650> any

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
1866 socket they haven't really made any

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.060 
1866 socket they haven't really made any
changes<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.610> speak<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:19.020> has<00:02:19.170> blades<00:02:19.710> that's

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
changes to speak of it has blades that's

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.600 
changes to speak of it has blades that's
been<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:22.140> they're<00:02:22.590> plugged<00:02:23.490> in

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
been like this and if they're plugged in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.950 
been like this and if they're plugged in
backwards<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.120> guess<00:02:24.270> they<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.480> also<00:02:24.750> spin

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
backwards I guess they would also spin

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.950 
backwards I guess they would also spin
like<00:02:25.080> this<00:02:25.350> okay<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.540> four<00:02:27.750> push

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
like this okay you have the four push

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.840 
like this okay you have the four push
pin<00:02:28.200> design<00:02:28.380> so<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.070> means<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.700> when

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
pin design so that means that when

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.820 
pin design so that means that when
you're<00:02:29.970> installing<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:31.170> should<00:02:31.380> be<00:02:31.560> turned

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you're installing it it should be turned

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.030 
you're installing it it should be turned
this<00:02:32.460> way<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.810> way<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.650> when<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.860> want

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
this way that way and then when you want

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
this way that way and then when you want
to<00:02:35.100> remove<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.640> turn<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
to remove it you turn it in the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.240 
to remove it you turn it in the
direction<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> arrow<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.620> then<00:02:37.860> pop<00:02:38.070> it

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
direction of the arrow and then pop it

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.680 
direction of the arrow and then pop it
up<00:02:38.340> okay<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.330> pretty<00:02:39.540> straightforward

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
up okay so that's pretty straightforward

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.080 
up okay so that's pretty straightforward
on<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> bottom<00:02:40.620> you'll<00:02:41.070> find<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.550> copper<00:02:41.880> slug

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
on the bottom you'll find a copper slug

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.150 
on the bottom you'll find a copper slug
in<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.390> middle<00:02:42.630> not<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.380> real<00:02:43.620> slug<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:44.130> a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
in the middle not a real slug like a

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.610 
in the middle not a real slug like a
like<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.730> copper<00:02:45.630> piece<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.990> metal<00:02:46.260> not<00:02:46.410> like

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
like a copper piece of metal not like

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.010 
like a copper piece of metal not like
oozing<00:02:47.130> thing<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:47.790> goes<00:02:48.090> across<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.540> then

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
oozing thing that goes across and then

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.180 
oozing thing that goes across and then
you<00:02:49.050> will<00:02:49.260> find<00:02:49.470> thermal<00:02:50.010> compound

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
you will find thermal compound

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.220 
you will find thermal compound
pre-applied<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.450> actually<00:02:51.840> pretty<00:02:52.020> good

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
pre-applied it's actually pretty good

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.080 
pre-applied it's actually pretty good
thermal<00:02:52.440> compound<00:02:52.709> I<00:02:53.040> tested<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.550> against<00:02:54.000> I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
thermal compound I tested this against I

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.199 
thermal compound I tested this against I
think<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.420> was<00:02:54.830> MX<00:02:55.830> one<00:02:56.130> Arctic<00:02:56.670> cooling<00:02:56.940> MX

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
think it was MX one Arctic cooling MX

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.520 
think it was MX one Arctic cooling MX
one<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.570> they<00:02:57.630> were<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.020> close<00:02:58.320> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
one and they were so close in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.350 
one and they were so close in
performance<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.070> couldn't<00:02:59.370> believe<00:02:59.550> it<00:02:59.760> but

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
performance I couldn't believe it but

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.920 
performance I couldn't believe it but
this<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.690> good<00:03:00.930> stuff<00:03:01.140> that's<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.500> here<00:03:02.930> okay

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
this is good stuff that's on here okay

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.220 
this is good stuff that's on here okay
and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.620> find<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.190> CPU<00:03:05.640> which<00:03:06.540> looks<00:03:06.870> just

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and then you find a CPU which looks just

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.730 
and then you find a CPU which looks just
like<00:03:07.440> every<00:03:07.770> other<00:03:08.090> 1366<00:03:09.090> CPU<00:03:09.480> except<00:03:10.320> for<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
like every other 1366 CPU except for the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.380 
like every other 1366 CPU except for the
writing<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> top<00:03:11.520> which<00:03:11.730> I'm<00:03:11.880> not<00:03:12.030> sure<00:03:12.270> if

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
writing on the top which I'm not sure if

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.150 
writing on the top which I'm not sure if
you'll<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:13.290> be<00:03:13.440> able<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.740> read

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
you'll actually even be able to read

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.210 
you'll actually even be able to read
through<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.150> camera<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:15.990> you'll<00:03:16.140> try<00:03:16.320> okay

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
through the camera but you'll try okay

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.880 
through the camera but you'll try okay
so<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.610> says<00:03:17.910> i7<00:03:18.480> 930<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.110> then<00:03:19.500> at<00:03:19.709> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
so that says i7 930 and then at the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.490 
so that says i7 930 and then at the
bottom<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.340> CPU<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:21.330> will<00:03:21.480> find<00:03:21.840> no

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
bottom of the CPU you will find no

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.170 
bottom of the CPU you will find no
markings<00:03:22.890> whatsoever<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:23.640> what<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.970> will

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
markings whatsoever but what you will

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.500 
markings whatsoever but what you will
find<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.840> pads<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.190> those<00:03:26.400> are<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.060> contact

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
find is pads so those are the contact

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.050 
find is pads so those are the contact
pads<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.959> make<00:03:28.170> contact<00:03:28.739> with<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.250> pins<00:03:29.790> in

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
pads that make contact with the pins in

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.540 
pads that make contact with the pins in
the<00:03:30.150> CPU<00:03:30.450> in<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:31.320> CPU<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.280> motherboard

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
the CPU in the CPU in the motherboard

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.820 
the CPU in the CPU in the motherboard
see<00:03:32.850> pins<00:03:33.060> CPUs<00:03:33.780> used<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.140> have<00:03:34.290> pins<00:03:34.560> and

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
see pins CPUs used to have pins and

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.920 
see pins CPUs used to have pins and
that's<00:03:35.340> what<00:03:35.550> makes<00:03:35.730> me<00:03:35.940> say<00:03:36.180> pins<00:03:36.570> when<00:03:36.840> I'm

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.850 
talking about a CPU quite quite
frequently<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:39.900> now<00:03:40.110> it's<00:03:40.380> motherboards

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
frequently but now it's motherboards

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.979 
frequently but now it's motherboards
that<00:03:41.010> have<00:03:41.160> pins<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.730> CPUs<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.660> pads

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
that have pins and CPUs that have pads

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.500 
that have pins and CPUs that have pads
whereas<00:03:43.980> before<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.820> motherboard<00:03:45.300> had<00:03:45.480> a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
whereas before the motherboard had a

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.840 
whereas before the motherboard had a
socket<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.260> now<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:47.010> doesn't<00:03:47.310> really<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.550> mean

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
socket and now it doesn't really I mean

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.090 
socket and now it doesn't really I mean
it<00:03:47.940> still<00:03:48.120> has<00:03:48.300> a<00:03:48.330> socket<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.200> has<00:03:49.350> like<00:03:50.070> a

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
it still has a socket like it has like a

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.920 
it still has a socket like it has like a
lever<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> a<00:03:50.730> little<00:03:50.970> like<00:03:51.180> clamp<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.660> goes

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
lever and a little like clamp that goes

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.990 
lever and a little like clamp that goes
down<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:52.440> it's<00:03:52.590> more<00:03:52.769> like<00:03:53.010> it's<00:03:53.640> more<00:03:53.820> like<00:03:53.970> a

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
down but it's more like it's more like a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.170 
down but it's more like it's more like a
clam<00:03:54.390> going<00:03:55.170> over<00:03:55.470> over<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> CPU<00:03:56.640> so<00:03:56.850> basically

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
clam going over over a CPU so basically

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.199 
clam going over over a CPU so basically
if<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.450> wanted<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:57.930> CPU<00:03:58.500> mounting<00:03:59.310> guide<00:03:59.670> it

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
if you wanted a CPU mounting guide it

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.650 
if you wanted a CPU mounting guide it
would<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.450> like<00:04:00.600> this<00:04:00.980> but<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.130> motherboard

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
would be like this but on a motherboard

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.380 
would be like this but on a motherboard
thanks<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.810> checking<00:04:03.900> out<00:04:04.110> my<00:04:04.260> unboxing
