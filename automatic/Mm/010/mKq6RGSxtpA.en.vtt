00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
far the best browser I've seen on a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.820 
far the best browser I've seen on a
mobile<00:03:10.010> device<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:11.810> doesn't<00:03:12.200> adhere<00:03:12.350> to<00:03:12.710> all

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830

so<00:03:17.270> that's<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.600> bit<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.930> problem<00:03:18.400> now<00:03:19.400> i

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
so that's a bit of a problem now i

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.640 
so that's a bit of a problem now i
really<00:03:19.700> do<00:03:20.000> like<00:03:20.240> the<00:03:20.570> iphone<00:03:20.960> 3g<00:03:21.410> it's<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
really do like the iphone 3g it's a

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.980 
really do like the iphone 3g it's a
terrific<00:03:21.830> device<00:03:22.340> but<00:03:23.240> there<00:03:23.420> are<00:03:23.600> drawbacks

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
terrific device but there are drawbacks

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.230 
terrific device but there are drawbacks
for<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.650> thing<00:03:24.830> let's<00:03:24.980> talk<00:03:25.190> about<00:03:25.340> 3g<00:03:25.820> itself

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
for one thing let's talk about 3g itself

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.110 
for one thing let's talk about 3g itself
we've<00:03:26.600> seen<00:03:26.930> how<00:03:27.140> much<00:03:27.620> faster<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.370> be<00:03:28.520> but

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
we've seen how much faster it can be but

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.570 
we've seen how much faster it can be but
the<00:03:29.240> fact<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.660> 3g<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.440> in<00:03:30.710> everywhere<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.460> my

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
the fact is 3g is in everywhere in my

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.100 
the fact is 3g is in everywhere in my
