00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.430 
game definitely requires a really good
smartphone<00:05:06.860> and<00:05:07.340> tablet<00:05:08.169> otherwise<00:05:09.169> it's

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
smartphone and tablet otherwise it's

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.670 
smartphone and tablet otherwise it's
just<00:05:09.500> going<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.890> lag<00:05:10.630> um<00:05:11.630> you<00:05:12.320> need<00:05:12.470> at<00:05:12.650> least

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
just going to lag um you need at least

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.090 
just going to lag um you need at least
700<00:05:13.370> megabytes<00:05:13.610> of<00:05:13.940> RAM<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.930> run<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.590> game<00:05:15.740> so

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
700 megabytes of RAM to run the game so

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.480 
700 megabytes of RAM to run the game so
I<00:05:16.130> recommend<00:05:17.020> at<00:05:18.020> least<00:05:18.140> one<00:05:18.500> gigabyte<00:05:18.980> of

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
I recommend at least one gigabyte of

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.810 
I recommend at least one gigabyte of
course<00:05:19.790> but<00:05:20.570> ultimately<00:05:21.610> you're<00:05:22.610> going<00:05:22.760> to

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
course but ultimately you're going to

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.640 
course but ultimately you're going to
run<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.150> game<00:05:23.300> really<00:05:23.510> well<00:05:23.630> if<00:05:24.050> your<00:05:24.470> device

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
run the game really well if your device

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.220 
run the game really well if your device
has<00:05:25.070> two<00:05:25.820> gigabytes<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.780> RAM<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:29.230> ultimately

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
has two gigabytes of RAM and ultimately

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.580 
has two gigabytes of RAM and ultimately
would<00:05:30.440> be<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.620> quad-core<00:05:31.930> or<00:05:32.930> even<00:05:33.260> if<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.470> have

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
would be a quad-core or even if you have

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.510 
would be a quad-core or even if you have
a<00:05:33.620> octa-core<00:05:34.460> as<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.660> Europeans<00:05:36.520> samsung
