00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello friends with you again circle tv 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.629
 today we will talk about such a tank as m4 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.690
 from 376 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.940
 well, or cher us 6 tier simple this 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 dessert I left for later we see and not 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 miscalculated bad sensations from the branch 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 slightly subsided to its end that is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.890
 Patton turned out to be machines in principle already 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 playable though not the strongest 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 perfectly but still it was already good 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.429
 after the Pershing 20 well, this dessert 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 Of course I threw a spoonful of tar well, 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.020
 as you see the spread is quite large 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.480
 at least 33 reload speeds 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 seconds but there and damage is cheap 2 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.829
 breakthrough is not the biggest if you consider 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.440
 what throws us to the eight 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.450
 it turns out we are breaking 126 miserable 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 millimeters and cause 190 damage per 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 shot plus roll but just 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.629
 unrealistically long already 2 and 8 seconds 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.460
 such a tank for a long time to get up on one 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.670
 the place can not be full immediately start shooting 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.800
 corps huge enemies there no with top 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.079
 and the tank engine is more or less moving well 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 and at least there is something joyous in it 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.640
 so that somehow goes yes maybe 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 this is not the fastest tank but already happy 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.900
 that at least something in it is more or less 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.060
 normal gun in principle in principle 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 if not for very long information 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 It would seem to me adequate because 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.630
 at sixth level but still could 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.939
 quiet gun by the way on the head she 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.340
 pierces 177 millimeters and there already with 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 sevens you can fight hit points 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.020
 we are not so many but in general tank 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.900
 For the most part, I never pass 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 I liked how to say generally 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.860
 I didn't like him because I needed 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.229
 him to do something adequate with your 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.509
 eights they are unrealistic maximum on 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.299
 that you are capable of killing the same as 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.240
 you are six inadvertently lost in it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.549
 the world and here's to punish them somehow try 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.799
 and surreptitiously throw sevens 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.170
 eights but with this already arise 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.600
 big problems ruler us at all 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.060
 little edge well just useless because 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.119
 what comes down on a very long time I would understand 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.060
 all if information was well, at least 18 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.939
 then yes the tank would be quite straight 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.069
 not bad as well and the gun is not very if 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.479
 take into account the fact that with eights throws 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.280
 there is no armor 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.129
 absolutely no and mu speed for 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.239
 such armor and so his weapon 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.099
 inadequate it turns out that the tank is not 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.489
 has strengths but it has 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.280
 more and video vulnerabilities are not very 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.830
 a good gun well then do it once 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.920
 this tank is that here it is, generally, I 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.750
 I want to give to die on this thread she 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.209
 I can not say that right here is wild 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.329
 annoyed me right handed one tank is 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.730
 20 we build I generally hate the rest 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.420
 Tanks Well, it seems like nothing but could 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.239
 be better 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.489
 as they say the new branch is not very me 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.650
 I didnâ€™t like it so much 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.420
 can't get some 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.269
 the pleasure of playing it is rather for 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.879
 straightening hands and increasing skill without 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.440
 Golda on it is also quite difficult in 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.069
 In general, this all contributes to a very 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.489
 thoughtful 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.680
 the game and in general you are not having almost 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.010
 no advantage on their tanks 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.690
 have quite noticeable and cons and in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 In general, you are not new to newbies. 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.790
 I advise you download it and the folders and this game 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.370
 probably, too, because well, make sense to rock 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.440
 pretty poor branch maybe in 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.760
 future, some cars will be from this 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.190
 I hope so on the apat branch 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.200
 because let's say 20 for me 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.840
 turned out to be very weak play him as in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.880
 Basically this ball machoke but in general 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.519
 could be worse i suspect eat 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.380
 slightly under accustomed to this branch in 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.630
 Anyway, if you already decided to download 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.010
 st then download probably first either 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.780
 Soviet either 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.180
 German branch in general then they 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.370
 equivalent to the Germans there just a little gun 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.970
 better at the end and have advice from armor 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.700
 more abruptly 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.250
 In general, decide for yourself what you more 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.420
 you need an American branch 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.090
 chelendzh 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.250
 on checking your skill well and on 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.160
 psyche on the stability of the psyche 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.140
 this tank will suit you as it is 20 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.450
 other tanks from this thread because 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.540
 they sometimes get pretty pretty out of 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.340
 themselves because not having pros they have 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.980
 quite a lot of minuses like me already and 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.650
 said in general it accounts very much 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.170
 think hard head before somewhere 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.630
 hunch up and for the firmware here you are not 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 can and how to afford because 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.010
 they are not forgiven Well you was 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.470
 crew gt in such here is my opinion on the branch 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.720
 Well, so all the tanchik see you soon 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.400
 meetings we watch the results of the battle and I am waiting 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.590
 you in the group in contact by the way soon 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.040
 will stream about this I will announce later 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.040
 of course
