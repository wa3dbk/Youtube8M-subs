00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.759 
it's even what I do I find it to be an
easy<00:02:11.100> tip<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.600> just<00:02:12.810> pick<00:02:13.109> the<00:02:13.140> smallest

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
easy tip is you just pick the smallest

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.890 
easy tip is you just pick the smallest
hairs<00:02:14.220> at<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> bottom<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.570> pull<00:02:15.810> them

hairs at the bottom and just pull them
straight<00:02:16.109> out<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.250> helps<00:02:17.519> make<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> main

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
straight out and it helps make the main

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900 
straight out and it helps make the main
look<00:02:18.359> completely<00:02:18.840> even<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.590> not<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:20.430> cut

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
that sort of thing and then they tend to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.510 
that sort of thing and then they tend to
shake<00:03:11.660> their<00:03:11.900> cuts<00:03:12.110> but<00:03:12.800> in<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> winter<00:03:13.310> time

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
horse as much as possible so what you do

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.170 
horse as much as possible so what you do
I<00:06:19.260> like<00:06:19.920> to<00:06:19.950> start<00:06:20.340> at<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.610> bottom<00:06:21.000> of<00:06:21.120> the

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
I like to start at the bottom of the

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.110 
I like to start at the bottom of the
tail<00:06:21.450> underneath<00:06:22.410> and<00:06:23.190> if<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.460> start<00:06:23.700> up<00:06:23.880> top

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
tail underneath and if you start up top

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.030 
tail underneath and if you start up top
and<00:06:24.420> you<00:06:24.510> messed<00:06:24.750> up<00:06:24.930> you<00:06:25.440> got<00:06:25.590> nowhere<00:06:25.920> to<00:06:25.950> go

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
and you messed up you got nowhere to go

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.460 
and you messed up you got nowhere to go
so<00:06:26.400> it's<00:06:26.970> better<00:06:27.150> to<00:06:27.270> start<00:06:27.630> underneath<00:06:28.110> and

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
so it's better to start underneath and

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.580 
so it's better to start underneath and
