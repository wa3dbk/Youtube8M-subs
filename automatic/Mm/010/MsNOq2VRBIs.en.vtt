maximum<00:02:14.430> have<00:02:14.550> done<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.570> believe<00:02:16.170> it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
maximum have done with this believe it

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.290 
maximum have done with this believe it
or<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.739> basically<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.280> bolt<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:17.820> thing

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
or not this is basically a bolt in thing

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.170 
or not this is basically a bolt in thing
for<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> fox<00:02:18.900> body<00:02:19.250> some<00:02:20.250> modifications<00:02:21.060> are

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
for a fox body some modifications are

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.820 
for a fox body some modifications are
required<00:02:21.209> but<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.870> more<00:02:22.140> or<00:02:22.260> less<00:02:22.290> will<00:02:22.680> go

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
required but this more or less will go

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.470 
required but this more or less will go
right<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.220> but<00:02:23.700> what<00:02:23.820> they've<00:02:24.030> done<00:02:24.060> is

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
right in but what they've done is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.110 
right in but what they've done is
upgrade<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:26.070> bushings<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:26.940> which

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
upgrade all these bushings here which

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.530 
upgrade all these bushings here which
were<00:02:27.360> rubber<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.989> are<00:02:28.350> now<00:02:28.580> Delrin<00:02:29.580> Delrin

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
were rubber and are now Delrin Delrin

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.690 
were rubber and are now Delrin Delrin
Delrin<00:02:31.410> they<00:02:31.590> tell<00:02:31.800> me<00:02:31.830> Deloraine<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
Delrin they tell me Deloraine is the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
Delrin they tell me Deloraine is the
thing<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.269> these<00:02:33.450> are<00:02:33.690> all<00:02:33.840> Delrin

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
thing to you so these are all Delrin

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.600 
thing to you so these are all Delrin
we've<00:02:34.560> got<00:02:34.709> these<00:02:34.920> there's<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> urethane

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
we've got these there's a urethane

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.360 
we've got these there's a urethane
bushing<00:02:36.239> here<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.110> diff<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
bushing here for the diff the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.290 
bushing here for the diff the
differential<00:02:39.030> itself<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.989> 355<00:02:40.860> ratio<00:02:41.640> with

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
differential itself is a 355 ratio with

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.660

a<00:02:42.330> Torsen<00:02:42.900> t2<00:02:43.320> differential<00:02:44.310> we've<00:02:44.459> upgraded

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
a Torsen t2 differential we've upgraded

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.259 
a Torsen t2 differential we've upgraded
that<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.750> wasn't<00:02:46.170> cheap<00:02:46.380> but<00:02:47.269> hopefully

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that that wasn't cheap but hopefully

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.610 
that that wasn't cheap but hopefully
it'll<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.570> lot<00:02:48.810> more<00:02:48.989> durable<00:02:49.230> than<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it'll be a lot more durable than the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.920 
it'll be a lot more durable than the
stock<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.250> we've<00:02:50.790> got<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.120> tie<00:02:51.299> rods<00:02:51.630> here

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
what is it called a cross axis joint

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.920 
what is it called a cross axis joint
here<00:02:59.070> with<00:02:59.280> spherical<00:03:00.000> bearings<00:03:00.450> which<00:03:00.750> they

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
here with spherical bearings which they

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.690 
here with spherical bearings which they
use<00:03:01.110> in<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.380> racecars<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.010> are<00:03:02.400> really

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
