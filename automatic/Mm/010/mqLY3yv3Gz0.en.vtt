00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.230
 hey people i am the water 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.020
 from the mobile world congress this 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.910
 small backyard will soon be in the life of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.980
 us all his and billions for the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.980
 greens has been 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.660
 alex and mister helfer syndrome beer and 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.330
 sorry for the whole euphoria 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 which I let you slosh 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.580
 but what up there is the name for that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.200
 Showing here is really innovative 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.500
 and so you have developed a battery 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.930
 which you can say from 0 to 100 in and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.460
 write two minutes full load 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.020
 what they did is have one 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.060
 Samsung Galaxy's 5 taken theirs 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 special accor are inserted behind 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.899
 so special connectors on it and then 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 just when you get that pretty chunky 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.140
 charging station pushes the thing with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 two minutes full 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 you have to say that it is not that 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 final product is this aqua to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.699
 For example, only a capacity of 1000 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.280
 Milliamps hours but now comes 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.559
 whole should be in one to two years 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 be ready for the market and then be available 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.100
 follow it is the plan of stored them 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 now go to the whole manufacturer 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.030
 and try this with them 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 so if you are going to make it in the year then 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.850
 buy new mobile phone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 then you may want to rest now 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.080
 Traditional Sony Samsung Iphone Battery 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 have or the special storage battery 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.490
 already installed from inside out 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 and then there are two versions once 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.479
 a smaller one with 1500 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 millipairs which one in one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.530
 full load or a larger one 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 where, of course, much much 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.189
 longer in 2008 and 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 millipetours with a loading time 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 of five minutes 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.259
 I would go for the second version 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 decide because the four minutes extra 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.590
 I also have time to work 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.810
 Of course she also remembers that 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.100
 charging adapter becomes smaller and more manageable 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.990
 then you already have a concept on the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.119
 TV shown so should one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 that they are still pressed 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.540
 easy to take in the bag 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.009
 of course I asked for it like 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.899
 the whole is possible though 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.280
 Of course they want to 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.320
 do not look too deeply into the cards 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.450
 let what you have said is that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.549
 whole was patented behind the battery 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.079
 just thought again from scratch 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.219
 if the competition just tries 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.030
 the existing a bit too 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.829
 improve 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 I was also told that I was the whole 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.030
 Super own would be around in electric cars 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.920
 to get used to come and there 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440
 go from a loading time of five 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.940
 minutes for him an electric car as 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.040
 I with charging times of electric cars 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.920
 Not so familiar is usually around 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.930
 an hour around and the last calls 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.510
 that was communicated to me is that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.430
 these off 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.560
 have more food than 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.019
 traditional rechargeable batteries circa twice 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.269
 long keep him this great start there 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.620
 Batteries should that were the whole info 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 which I have for you right here 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.129
 from the store there and from the fair 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.049
 here in barcelona writes on everyone 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.970
 case in the comments we use this battery 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.709
 I personally believe technology 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.840
 Now I realize I'm a mega fan of mine 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.670
 I would rather have it today than tomorrow 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.750
 unfortunately we have to wait another year or so 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.730
 two patience 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.379
 ok if you have such future technology 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.030
 I already have a video with videos 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.769
 so made future of reading and also 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.629
 for the future of driving a car 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.489
 that brings you in the description box 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.140
 under this video I am looking forward to
