reminds me of a sprint frame however it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
reminds me of a sprint frame however it
is<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> much<00:01:25.229> softer<00:01:25.530> than<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> sprintf

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
is a much softer than what the sprintf

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.999 
is a much softer than what the sprintf
room<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.360> much<00:01:27.509> more<00:01:27.720> flexible<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.770> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
room is and is much more flexible as you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.100 
room is and is much more flexible as you
guys<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.369> here<00:01:29.780> for<00:01:30.780> ventilation
