second<00:01:52.659> thing<00:01:52.810> here's<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.109> exception<00:01:53.679> for

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
second thing here's the exception for

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.639 
second thing here's the exception for
the<00:01:53.920> white<00:01:54.100> keys<00:01:54.340> when<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.819> have<00:01:54.969> F<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.600> C<00:01:56.049> F

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
the white keys when you have F and C F

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.819 
the white keys when you have F and C F
or<00:01:56.950> C<00:01:56.979> natural<00:01:57.340> either<00:01:57.789> one<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:57.939> those<00:01:58.149> I<00:01:58.829> guess

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
or C natural either one of those I guess

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.260 
or C natural either one of those I guess
I<00:01:59.920> should<00:02:00.069> have<00:02:00.159> put<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.310> natural<00:02:00.670> there<00:02:00.819> too

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
I should have put a natural there too

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.239 
I should have put a natural there too
you're<00:02:02.200> gonna<00:02:02.380> use<00:02:02.590> your<00:02:02.740> second<00:02:03.159> finger

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
you're gonna use your second finger

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.169 
you're gonna use your second finger
because<00:02:03.549> that's<00:02:03.700> where<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:03.969> natural

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
because that's where the natural

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.940 
because that's where the natural
half-step<00:02:04.990> occurs<00:02:05.259> when<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.469> have<00:02:05.590> two<00:02:05.740> white

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
half-step occurs when you have two white

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.130 
half-step occurs when you have two white
keys<00:02:06.159> in<00:02:06.280> a<00:02:06.369> row<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.179> that<00:02:07.389> second<00:02:07.719> finger<00:02:07.840> will

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
keys in a row so that second finger will

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.380 
keys in a row so that second finger will
mate<00:02:08.259> will<00:02:08.410> take<00:02:08.590> up<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> slack<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.149> can

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
mate will take up the slack that you can

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.440 
mate will take up the slack that you can
get<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:10.690> extra<00:02:10.810> can<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.350> here<00:02:11.500> we<00:02:11.590> go<00:02:11.709> Y<00:02:11.890> keys

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.199 

why<00:02:14.990> here's<00:02:15.319> f<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.650> I'm<00:02:15.709> gonna<00:02:15.830> use<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.040> -<00:02:16.209> I

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.250 

when<00:02:32.879> you'll<00:02:33.030> dance<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.420> same<00:02:33.599> thang<00:02:34.019> same

thing<00:02:34.760> start<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.329> guess<00:02:36.569> see<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.049> two

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
thing start on I guess see with the two

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.000 
thing start on I guess see with the two
and<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.099> 1<00:02:38.370> 3<00:02:38.670> 1<00:02:39.299> 3<00:02:39.569> 1<00:02:39.989> 3<00:02:40.230> 2<00:02:40.650> there's<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> app

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and then 1 3 1 3 1 3 2 there's the app

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.059 
and then 1 3 1 3 1 3 2 there's the app
you<00:02:44.010> practice<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.489> learn<00:02:44.519> TM<00:02:45.920> we're<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.040> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
you practice you learn TM we're not a

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.649 
you practice you learn TM we're not a
classical<00:02:47.670> pianist<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.120> anything<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.540> may

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
classical pianist or anything you may

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.210 
classical pianist or anything you may
not<00:02:48.840> need<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.200> your<00:02:49.319> left<00:02:49.500> hand<00:02:49.739> at<00:02:49.829> all<00:02:49.950> but

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
not need to do your left hand at all but

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.949 
not need to do your left hand at all but
it's<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> same<00:02:50.609> principle

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
it's the same principle

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.720 
it's the same principle
the<00:02:52.200> only<00:02:52.349> difference<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.069> the<00:02:53.519> two

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
the only difference is that the two

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
the only difference is that the two
finger<00:02:54.150> will<00:02:54.599> be<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.780> E<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:57.359> B<00:02:57.689> instead<00:02:57.989> so

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
finger will be on E and B instead so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.619 
finger will be on E and B instead so
change<00:02:58.560> those<00:02:58.829> two<00:02:59.129> to<00:02:59.280> E<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.640> B<00:02:59.819> if<00:03:00.120> we're

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
change those two to E and B if we're

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.229 
change those two to E and B if we're
talking<00:03:00.780> about<00:03:01.049> left<00:03:01.439> hand<00:03:01.739> okay<00:03:02.120> there's<00:03:03.120> our

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
talking about left hand okay there's our

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.030 
talking about left hand okay there's our
left<00:03:03.480> hands<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.720> mirror<00:03:03.959> image<00:03:04.139> right<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.889> be

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
left hands a mirror image right so to be

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.030 
left hands a mirror image right so to be
on<00:03:05.129> env<00:03:05.609> instead<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.120> F<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.750> C<00:03:06.930> now<00:03:07.680> here's<00:03:07.920> how

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
on env instead of F and C now here's how

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.349 
on env instead of F and C now here's how
to<00:03:08.099> practice<00:03:08.489> your<00:03:08.579> chromatic<00:03:08.940> scale<00:03:09.090> do<00:03:09.269> it

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
to practice your chromatic scale do it

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:16.270 
to practice your chromatic scale do it
in<00:03:09.450> groups<00:03:09.599> of<00:03:09.810> two<00:03:09.989> first<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:10.889> to<00:03:14.689> the<00:03:15.689> down

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
in groups of two first one to the down

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.949 
in groups of two first one to the down
go<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.400> far<00:03:17.730> enough<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:18.359> do<00:03:18.510> two<00:03:18.629> groups<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
go up far enough then do two groups of

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.410 
go up far enough then do two groups of
three

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.050 

they<00:03:23.960> come<00:03:24.140> down<00:03:24.170> on<00:03:24.350> three

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.580 

I<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.690> really<00:03:27.810> make<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.110> thinking<00:03:28.440> they<00:03:28.500> do

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
I don't really make you thinking they do

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.430 
I don't really make you thinking they do
groups<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.980> four

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.720 

that<00:03:35.440> makes<00:03:35.830> me<00:03:37.980> new<00:03:38.980> groups<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.310> five<00:03:39.459> nine

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
that makes me new groups of five nine

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.870 
that makes me new groups of five nine
five<00:03:40.120> is<00:03:40.300> too<00:03:40.420> much<00:03:40.569> so<00:03:40.750> up<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.290> four<00:03:41.530> now<00:03:42.310> try

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
five is too much so up to four now try

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:52.860 
five is too much so up to four now try
to<00:03:42.940> accent<00:03:43.569> every<00:03:43.840> two

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.100 

then<00:03:53.800> accent<00:03:54.459> every<00:03:54.670> three

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.920 

little<00:04:02.830> accent<00:04:03.220> every<00:04:03.400> four

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.420 

right<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:10.829> will<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.069> help<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.370> with

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
right and that will really help you with

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.530 
right and that will really help you with
you<00:04:11.519> chromatic<00:04:11.909> and<00:04:12.060> you<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.269> of<00:04:12.360> course

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you chromatic and you can of course

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.360 
you chromatic and you can of course
apply<00:04:12.689> it<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.620> left<00:04:13.799> hand<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.159> anything

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
apply it to the left hand on anything

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.199 
apply it to the left hand on anything
okay<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.299> hope<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.540> guys<00:04:15.659> enjoy<00:04:15.959> that
