00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.220
 good morning new year holidays long ago 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:11.099
 Spring passed on the street 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 but today it's getting colder and we decided 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.170
 cook herring under a fur coat 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.720
 for its preparation we need 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.960
 several boiled potatoes we cooked 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.369
 their uniform is cleaned and now they are waiting 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.560
 in her time to herring strength 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:35.870
 we treated the herring ourselves and separated 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:40.379
 and years 1 beet carrot onion apple 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 egg every housewife can cook 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.910
 a herring under a fur coat but we have a few 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:51.809
 small nuances and we will tell about them 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 dice herring melenko 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.649
 cut onion chopped counting fill 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 vinegar solution one part vinegar 2 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.710
 parts of water and let the onion be five to ten 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 minutes, it will remove it from him 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 bitterness 3 will give a very original taste 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 this is one of our chips and now 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.340
 rubbed on a large grater rub all our 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.820
 here's the potatoes now on the same 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.790
 grate a carrot in a large grater 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.799
 light and peeled apple 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.390
 cow egg see all our products 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.320
 divided into two parts this is another one one 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.880
 small nuance 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 all layers of us will be repeated twice 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.760
 First lay out the potatoes. 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 add a little bit 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.810
 and lay out the second layer of our 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.270
 imposed herring 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.920
 now lay out pickled onions 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 marinade we already merged here and mayonnaise 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.440
 By the way, this is another nuance of fallen for us. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.280
 we will starve only two layers and everything 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.640
 two layers 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.330
 which will reduce the calorie content of this dish and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.360
 However 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.930
 will give the opportunity to soak in all our 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.810
 layers 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.190
 the next one is laying an apple 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.920
 bullseye good see oxidized 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.230
 a little yellow if the apple is bought in 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 the store does not turn yellow over time 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.970
 that is, it does not oxidize, it means it is already 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.340
 long time conserved and has 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.340
 few vitamins and nutrients 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:52.200
 now carrot the next layer of the cycle and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:57.900
 all our layers 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:03:02.660
 the first time we lubricate the military and now 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.660
 we lay the same layers but the second time 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:15.120
 old piles are laid in the same manner 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:18.360
 as 1 see what fur herring under 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 the fur coat of us turns out fluffy and last 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.130
 we spread the second layer of mayonnaise which 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.720
 sprinkled with chopped egg 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.320
 This is the beauty we got 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.540
 Now we put a salad for two or three hours 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.700
 a refrigerator so it gets soaked and 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.120
 wait do not disconnect after a couple 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.120
 hours we will give you a good appetite
