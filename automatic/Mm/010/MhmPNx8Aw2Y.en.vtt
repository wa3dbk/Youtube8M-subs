00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
close but livable were expected to be

point<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.620> livable<00:00:40.920> they<00:00:41.129> were

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
point now do you think livable they were

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.010 
point now do you think livable they were
expecting<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.850> win<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.149> could<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.870> them

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
expecting this win and could we see them

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.619 
expecting this win and could we see them
try<00:00:43.170> even<00:00:43.379> harder<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.070> match<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.670> don't

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
try even harder in this match I don't

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.729 
try even harder in this match I don't
think<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.840> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> case<00:00:46.590> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
think it's going to be so much a case of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.229 
think it's going to be so much a case of
them<00:00:46.860> trying<00:00:47.190> harder<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.149> they're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
them trying harder but I think they're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.760 
them trying harder but I think they're
going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> grab<00:00:48.629> their<00:00:48.899> way<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> prove<00:00:49.649> to

131<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.560> home<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.700> don't<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.750> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
131 at home now I don't think so but I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
131 at home now I don't think so but I
have<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> ask<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> chance<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.040> we

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
have to ask is there a chance that we

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.230 
have to ask is there a chance that we
could<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> repeat<00:01:21.240> here<00:01:22.130> in<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.250> word<00:01:23.460> no<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
could see a repeat here in a word no in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
could see a repeat here in a word no in
two<00:01:24.840> words<00:01:25.080> definitely<00:01:25.680> no<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.040> think

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
two words definitely no I think

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.940 
two words definitely no I think
