00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 all health is another scuba hunt 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 this time hunting from our old 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 friend and comrade antosha and this is ours 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.170
 copyrighted videos this is still enisei in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.240
 this video we will watch with you 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.670
 beautiful scuba hunt she's either on 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.300
 yenisee as I said but it happens 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.269
 different 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.330
 somewhere beautiful pebbles somewhere sand 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.240
 somewhere here is a cesspool of candid 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 debris saw what we have here 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.110
 large flow this is visible and 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.730
 algae and how and because it trembles 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.969
 camera at the author a small area on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.910
 Yenisei on which we see just 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.520
 pebbles that brought silt 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.379
 accordingly, the flow here is over me 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.000
 some kind of small free 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.899
 lull saw the author draw 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.809
 attention to bundles of algae at the bottom but 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.100
 This is such an interesting thing in which 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.100
 can we stand on 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.430
 Well here it is a change in the stony 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.930
 rocky 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.150
 see good boulders 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.710
 these are very good looking places 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.710
 for the rest of the fish 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.470
 the catch is diving closer to one of 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.650
 such boulders carefully examines it 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 but this is not the time and the fish there are resting 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.950
 not 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 another no less promising fornication 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
 racer too nothing is see some 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.120
 such a frank stall 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:21.290
 down here as if before an underwater 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.290
 hunters there is a small dimple 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.069
 we see that he carefully all slowly 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.250
 inspects caution and stealth 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:45.329
 This is the most important principle of the underwater 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:50.670
 Hunter because he's reward 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:53.610
 such a big fish that is worth resting 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.190
 and if she doesnâ€™t get it neatly 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:05.190
 harpoon back as in this case well 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:09.870
 next we see all the joy of the hunter as 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.950
 he gently holds his trophy in order not to 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.690
 jumped off well and see what is closer 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.700
 the shore 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.299
 that apparently did not carry over and 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.900
 already calm means confused 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:27.170
 multiply from the line set your guns well 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.810
 and that is important to go through the process 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:35.030
 blocking fish so that it already 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.030
 probably did not go anywhere 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:47.409
 we see that the instance is large enough 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.239
 the author then said he said that this 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:53.610
 instance was 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.610
 5 half kilograms exactly 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.489
 Well, that's another trophy 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.459
 charging another dive then what 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.290
 I can go to the depths he saw there 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.130
 again many all beautiful 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.609
 items at the bottom 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.260
 but the fish on this day will not torment you 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.260
 he never met again 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.970
 here is such a small spearfishing 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.650
 we say goodbye to you before the next hunt 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.800
 Thank you all for your attention and all of you 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.800
 kind
