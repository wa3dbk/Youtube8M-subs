00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.839
 missing the current situation 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.399
 characterized by 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.759
 a phenomenon 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.759
 I call the revolutionaries in his double mandate 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.810
 all over 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.110
 populations 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.520
 what happened in egypt in tunisia everything that happens today 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.650
 in Libya 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.240
 criticality 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.770
 to change 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.480
 the political system 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 and to return the most original they are there 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.880
 gold in history 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 obviously the Algerian government he understood immediately 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.030
 the situation I am not convinced 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.700
 because the same phenomena occur in Algeria and he wanted it 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.170
 bring answers 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.120
 therefore the world 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 what was brought by the Algerian government's response 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.050
 three remarks 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.190
 the first is that the techniques used 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.700
 it is not renewed 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.390
 there is no more after 1992 after October 5 there is no 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.880
 of really something new there is no air 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.060
 political input 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.840
 it's always the same strings we try to reconstruct lists 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230
 setbacks of the safeguarding committee 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.230
 to call politicians to take positions 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260
 they made promises 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.360
 to the group of great promises that are made that had been made 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.710
 at once 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.060
 the first is the lifting of the state of emergency alas 2nd is a program 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.640
 Economic and Social 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.080
 front to solve the debt problems 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.920
 very quickly as regards 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.940
 the lifting of the state of emergency 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.780
 the promise 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 hold in two sentences 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.540
 firstly the state of emergency is lifted over in the capital this is a 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.329
 mystery social bomb 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.449
 m the second is that the army is already tidy 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.679
 to apply any measure 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:18.829
 always threatened algeria with acts of terrorism that is any measure 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.269
 virtually 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.439
 leave the situation by the state 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.530
 because any political act today that is unpleasant can 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.169
 be 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.169
 easily it is considered a terrorism act the denunciation 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.129
 it is not today or in the current press that it will stop 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.939
 fiat is good 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:40.939
 so on that particular point 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:43.779
 so there is nothing new 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.979
 and the Algerians will notice 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.669
 after a while 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:48.569
 than 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.099
 the army it's still there what is that maybe what the army thinks 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.449
 often 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.439
 in only a few 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.829
 the popular movement the theme on our side she announces that she is 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:02:59.760
 responsible 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.999
 of State 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.740
 what's new politically what can we say today 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.260
 the army was responsible for the state of emergency in Algeria while 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.650
 hitherto already present 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.870
 it was said that it was the president of the republic it seems that on this 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.119
 point and on the map 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.349
 and that may not be 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 the second element is economic and social measures 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.510
 well we know what the Algerian regime is about 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.549
 and social we know what he's capable of 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.589
 when there are low prices were high prices 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.039
 and there is a lack in the mafia system and continuity 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.049
 storyteller today 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.830
 the measures that have been taken 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.819
 we are taking action and without these requests for support 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.859
 why this new site that are related to the group 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.079
 and who hold imports in particular is it possible the 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.789
 public procurement activities 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:52.279
 so young people who are waiting for a job from public markets d to 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:53.859
 from imports 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.289
 expect them a lot from this point of view 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.689
 it's just that it brings treasures 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:01.799
 e at the same point in two 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.760
 etienne the origin of the turnaround this time much more seriously 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.779
 there is a lot that there can be 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.719
 again 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.239
 a measure of abandonment of the state 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.179
 August 6 the lands 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:17.239
 and on the bottom that is to say people will accumulate a lot of complaints 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.059
 under cover of covering the mantle 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:21.549
 that's basically what the government did 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.190
 and it is before we know what situation we can ask ourselves 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.939
 question 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:28.569
 what must the people do obviously we can say right away that on 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.300
 the economic and social plan 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.210
 it will be the big point of failure because poczobut and rims actually 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.210
 polling station of economic and social results 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.870
 according to what we did according to the capacity of the government 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.070
 we can announce already that it will not have a failure of the policy 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.200
 economic and social and that it is on this basis that politically power 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.840
 and German lala to the population
