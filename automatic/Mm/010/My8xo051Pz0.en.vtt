but<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.659> how<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> use<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> can

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
but if you know how to use it you can

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.990 
but if you know how to use it you can
just<00:01:43.470> maneuver<00:01:44.009> through<00:01:44.250> shots<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
just maneuver through shots and then you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.810 
just maneuver through shots and then you
can<00:01:45.119> kill<00:01:45.329> people<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.409> black<00:01:47.040> ops<00:01:47.220> 2<00:01:47.490> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
can kill people but for black ops 2 I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
can kill people but for black ops 2 I
want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:48.479> sort<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:49.110> review<00:01:49.530> because

way<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.709> move<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> don't<00:02:20.459> know<00:02:20.520> how<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
way you move it I don't know how to

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.890 
way you move it I don't know how to
explain<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.270> but<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.540> never<00:02:21.780> actually

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
explain it but I never actually

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
explain it but I never actually
correspond<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.010> with<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.250> way<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.400> your

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
correspond it with the way you your

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.390 
correspond it with the way you your
analogues<00:02:24.870> moved<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:26.010> don't<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.250> what

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
analogues moved and I don't know what

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.440 
analogues moved and I don't know what
happened<00:02:26.700> here<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.880> should<00:02:26.940> have<00:02:27.150> killed<00:02:27.300> them

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
happened here I should have killed them

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.930 
happened here I should have killed them
but<00:02:28.050> uh<00:02:28.080> black<00:02:28.830> ops<00:02:29.040> 1<00:02:29.130> every<00:02:29.430> time<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.760> move

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
but uh black ops 1 every time you move

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.930 
but uh black ops 1 every time you move
it<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:30.900> never<00:02:31.370> cooperated<00:02:32.370> which<00:02:32.610> you<00:02:32.760> like

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
it just never cooperated which you like

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.250 
it just never cooperated which you like
you<00:02:33.150> would<00:02:33.300> turn<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.989> would<00:02:34.110> turn

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you would turn and then I would turn

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.199 
you would turn and then I would turn
like<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.709> cut<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> couple<00:02:35.910> milliseconds

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
like a cut like a couple milliseconds

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.270 
like a cut like a couple milliseconds
later<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.930> it's<00:02:37.380> pretty<00:02:37.560> slow<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.130> always

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
later so it's pretty slow and I always

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.949 
later so it's pretty slow and I always
liked<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.849> modern<00:02:39.150> warfare<00:02:39.330> 3<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
liked the way modern warfare 3 and

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.320 
liked the way modern warfare 3 and
modern<00:02:40.890> warfare<00:02:41.040> 2<00:02:41.370> moved<00:02:41.610> they're<00:02:42.000> really

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
modern warfare 2 moved they're really

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.750 
modern warfare 2 moved they're really
nice<00:02:42.480> they<00:02:42.690> were<00:02:42.810> smooth<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.400> graphics

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
nice they were smooth and the graphics

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
nice they were smooth and the graphics
are<00:02:45.390> my<00:02:45.930> favorite<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.799> modern<00:02:47.100> warfare<00:02:47.250> 3<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.620 
easy to take it down it's just like four
shots<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.609> game<00:03:20.790> itself<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.450> just

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
shots and the game itself is just

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.229 
shots and the game itself is just
amazing<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.350> what<00:03:22.980> else<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.340> there<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:24.000> lag

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
amazing and what else is there the lag

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.449 
amazing and what else is there the lag
there<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.959> no<00:03:25.170> more<00:03:25.350> lag<00:03:25.590> pretty<00:03:25.950> much<00:03:26.130> unless

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
there is no more lag pretty much unless

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.860 
there is no more lag pretty much unless
you're<00:03:26.670> in<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> lobby<00:03:26.970> with<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.299> horrible<00:03:27.570> host

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.580 
like that but in modern warfare 3
sometimes<00:03:30.239> you'd<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.569> lagging<00:03:31.049> even<00:03:31.410> with<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
what the kill she caused but it was just

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.530 
what the kill she caused but it was just
like<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.320> napalm<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.950> I<00:05:03.820> forgot<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.510> mention

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
like the napalm and I forgot to mention

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.270 
like the napalm and I forgot to mention
this<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.200> gun<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:05.410> I<00:05:05.560> picked<00:05:05.890> up<00:05:06.010> its<00:05:06.190> the

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
this is the gun that I picked up its the

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.810 
this is the gun that I picked up its the
an-94<00:05:06.760> it's<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:07.540> sort<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.810> like<00:05:07.870> an<00:05:08.080> ak-47

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
an-94 it's just sort of like an ak-47

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.430 
an-94 it's just sort of like an ak-47
but<00:05:09.820> it's<00:05:10.090> really<00:05:10.420> nice<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:10.870> here's<00:05:11.170> where<00:05:11.380> i

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
but it's really nice and here's where i

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.160 
but it's really nice and here's where i
use<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.920> dragon<00:05:12.610> fire<00:05:12.850> now<00:05:13.510> this<00:05:13.690> kill<00:05:13.930> streak

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
use the dragon fire now this kill streak

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.020 
use the dragon fire now this kill streak
is<00:05:14.290> really<00:05:14.560> nice<00:05:14.740> it's<00:05:14.980> not<00:05:15.160> too<00:05:15.370> overpowered

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
is really nice it's not too overpowered

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.730 
is really nice it's not too overpowered
it<00:05:16.180> doesn't<00:05:16.450> show<00:05:16.570> exactly<00:05:16.960> where<00:05:17.170> people<00:05:17.560> are

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
it doesn't show exactly where people are

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.060 
it doesn't show exactly where people are
unless<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.730> get<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.030> see<00:05:19.300> them<00:05:19.740> walking<00:05:20.740> out

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
unless you get to see them walking out

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.590 
unless you get to see them walking out
like<00:05:21.100> they're<00:05:21.640> outside<00:05:22.090> or<00:05:22.270> something<00:05:22.390> it

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
like they're outside or something it

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.850 
like they're outside or something it
doesn't<00:05:22.750> show<00:05:23.020> them<00:05:23.200> when<00:05:23.350> they're<00:05:23.470> inside<00:05:23.800> a

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
doesn't show them when they're inside a

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.590 
doesn't show them when they're inside a
building<00:05:24.280> so<00:05:24.820> that's<00:05:24.970> pretty<00:05:25.150> good<00:05:25.360> you<00:05:25.480> have

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
building so that's pretty good you have

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.120 
building so that's pretty good you have
to<00:05:25.690> go<00:05:25.840> sort<00:05:26.110> of<00:05:26.230> find<00:05:26.410> them<00:05:26.530> yourself<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:27.070> it

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
to go sort of find them yourself and it

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.220 
to go sort of find them yourself and it
doesn't<00:05:27.430> do<00:05:27.490> all<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.940> work<00:05:28.090> lights<00:05:28.330> up<00:05:28.630> then

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
doesn't do all the work lights up then

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.290 
doesn't do all the work lights up then
it's<00:05:29.710> sort<00:05:29.890> of<00:05:29.980> hard<00:05:30.100> to<00:05:30.250> aim<00:05:30.580> with<00:05:30.850> it<00:05:31.030> because

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
it's sort of hard to aim with it because

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.480 
it's sort of hard to aim with it because
you're<00:05:31.810> flying<00:05:32.080> around<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.620> you<00:05:33.250> have<00:05:33.370> to

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
you're flying around and you have to

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.340 
you're flying around and you have to
dodge<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:33.700> when<00:05:34.090> people<00:05:34.390> try<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.630> hit<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:34.930> with

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
dodge it when people try to hit you with

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.600 
dodge it when people try to hit you with
their<00:05:35.590> gun<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:35.980> stuff<00:05:36.160> when<00:05:36.310> they<00:05:36.400> try<00:05:36.550> to

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
their gun and stuff when they try to

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.820 
their gun and stuff when they try to
shoot<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:36.940> down<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:38.170> bullets<00:05:38.470> are<00:05:38.560> really

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
shoot you down the bullets are really

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.230 
shoot you down the bullets are really
strong<00:05:39.100> it<00:05:39.340> just<00:05:39.520> takes<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.790> couple<00:05:39.820> of<00:05:40.060> hits

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
strong it just takes a couple of hits

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.320 
strong it just takes a couple of hits
and<00:05:40.390> they're<00:05:40.510> dead<00:05:40.860> I<00:05:41.860> have<00:05:42.790> a<00:05:42.820> couple<00:05:43.210> more

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
and they're dead I have a couple more

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.020 
and they're dead I have a couple more
gameplays<00:05:43.870> if<00:05:44.140> y'all<00:05:44.380> want<00:05:44.560> to<00:05:44.650> see<00:05:44.770> me<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.640> was

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
gameplays if y'all want to see me I was

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.150 
gameplays if y'all want to see me I was
getting<00:05:46.300> the<00:05:46.420> VTOL<00:05:47.050> warship<00:05:47.560> that's<00:05:47.950> pretty

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
getting the VTOL warship that's pretty

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.950 
getting the VTOL warship that's pretty
much<00:05:48.280> like<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:48.490> chopper<00:05:48.970> gunner<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.510> gunship

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
much like a chopper gunner the gunship

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.620 
much like a chopper gunner the gunship
and<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:51.190> thing<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:51.610> just<00:05:51.790> goes<00:05:51.910> ham<00:05:52.210> you<00:05:52.420> kill

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
and that thing it just goes ham you kill

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.570 
and that thing it just goes ham you kill
everybody<00:05:52.960> with<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.530> and<00:05:53.740> it's<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.430> really

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
everybody with that and it's a really

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.950 
everybody with that and it's a really
nice<00:05:54.790> kill<00:05:55.060> streak<00:05:55.300> if<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.570> haven't<00:05:55.810> tried<00:05:55.870> it

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
nice kill streak if you haven't tried it

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.230 
nice kill streak if you haven't tried it
