because I straightened it I got a

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.130 
because I straightened it I got a
scrunch<00:06:26.980> mckerrow<00:06:27.400> Beca<00:06:27.730> because<00:06:28.180> typically

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
scrunch mckerrow Beca because typically

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.020 
scrunch mckerrow Beca because typically
I<00:06:29.260> was<00:06:29.500> shampoo<00:06:29.980> it<00:06:30.130> but<00:06:30.310> I<00:06:30.340> just<00:06:30.430> did<00:06:30.790> it<00:06:30.880> this

I was shampoo it but I just did it this

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.140 
I was shampoo it but I just did it this
morning<00:06:31.090> so<00:06:31.810> it<00:06:31.960> should<00:06:32.170> be<00:06:32.200> good<00:06:32.910> all<00:06:33.910> right

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
morning so it should be good all right

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.700 
morning so it should be good all right
so<00:06:34.680> now<00:06:35.680> that<00:06:35.920> is<00:06:36.010> when<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:37.170> can<00:06:38.170> really<00:06:38.350> start

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
so now that is when I can really start

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.770 
so now that is when I can really start
seeing<00:06:39.600> what's<00:06:40.600> still<00:06:40.870> these<00:06:41.110> two<00:06:41.350> head<00:06:41.560> so

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780 
seeing what's still these two head so

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.180 
seeing what's still these two head so
trying<00:06:43.780> to<00:06:43.870> remember<00:06:44.050> which<00:06:44.320> direction<00:06:44.800> over

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190 
trying to remember which direction over

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:53.279 
trying to remember which direction over
my<00:06:45.340> hair<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.760> even<00:06:46.240> remember

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:55.409 

so<00:06:53.919> what<00:06:54.099> I'm<00:06:54.189> going<00:06:54.279> to<00:06:54.369> have<00:06:54.520> to<00:06:54.580> do<00:06:54.819> now<00:06:55.059> know

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
so what I'm going to have to do now know

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.999 
so what I'm going to have to do now know
that<00:06:55.449> it's<00:06:56.159> what<00:06:57.159> is<00:06:57.399> around<00:06:57.939> this<00:06:58.119> edge<00:06:59.009> some

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
that it's what is around this edge some

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.839 
that it's what is around this edge some
weight<00:07:00.969> needs<00:07:01.330> to<00:07:01.539> come<00:07:01.779> off<00:07:01.809> at<00:07:02.110> it<00:07:02.580> it's<00:07:03.580> too

weight needs to come off at it it's too
heavy<00:07:04.149> so<00:07:05.309> it's<00:07:06.309> going<00:07:06.520> to<00:07:06.580> kind<00:07:06.819> of<00:07:07.770> slither

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
heavy so it's going to kind of slither

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.129
