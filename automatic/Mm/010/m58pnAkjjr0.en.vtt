00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
feeds through here to the plastic shell

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.230 
feeds through here to the plastic shell
where<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.369> it<00:02:00.030> did<00:02:00.530> strongly<00:02:02.240> complete

where it's it did strongly complete
bring<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.159> z10<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.520> pop<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.820> into

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
bring in a z10 and just pop that into

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.660 
bring in a z10 and just pop that into
the<00:02:06.420> show<00:02:06.450> like<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.200> clips<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.670> quite

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
the show like so it clips in quite

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
the show like so it clips in quite
comfortably<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:10.640> can<00:02:11.640> close<00:02:11.879> up<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
comfortably I can close up like so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
comfortably I can close up like so
so<00:02:14.130> it's<00:02:14.280> not<00:02:14.490> adding<00:02:14.850> much<00:02:15.150> weight<00:02:15.540> or<00:02:15.900> bulk

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so it's not adding much weight or bulk

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.410 
so it's not adding much weight or bulk
to<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.800> device<00:02:17.190> still<00:02:17.610> got<00:02:17.760> access<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
to the device still got access to the

camera two controls on the top etc so it

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.550 
camera two controls on the top etc so it
opens<00:02:25.470> up<00:02:25.650> like<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.870> detecting<00:02:31.410> when

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
opens up like so and it's detecting when

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.460 
opens up like so and it's detecting when

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the case is opened and closed and it's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.230 
the case is opened and closed and it's
switching<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.160> screen<00:02:35.580> or<00:02:35.790> indeed

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
switching on the screen or indeed

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.610 
switching on the screen or indeed
turning<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> off<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> see<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.320> turned<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
turning it off so you see it's turned it

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.090 
turning it off so you see it's turned it
off<00:02:40.740> there<00:02:41.070> open<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.000> turns<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.630> back<00:02:42.660> on

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
off there open it up turns it back on

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.750 
off there open it up turns it back on
and<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.660> with<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.930> case<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.560> can<00:02:46.770> flip<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
and then with this case you can flip it

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.290 
and then with this case you can flip it
around<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.740> can<00:02:49.890> stand<00:02:50.220> up<00:02:50.490> on<00:02:50.730> a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
around like so so you can stand up on a

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.390 
around like so so you can stand up on a
desktop<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.650> can<00:02:52.770> sort<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:53.250> how

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
desktop so you can sort of see how

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.940 
desktop so you can sort of see how
that's<00:02:53.610> all<00:02:53.790> bent<00:02:54.090> round<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> kind

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
that's all bent round and you can kind

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370 
that's all bent round and you can kind
of<00:02:56.070> put<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.430> up<00:02:56.580> at<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> ideal<00:02:57.870> viewing

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
of put that up at the ideal viewing

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.700 
of put that up at the ideal viewing
angle<00:02:59.570> you<00:03:00.570> know<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> might<00:03:00.930> even<00:03:01.080> go<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.320> play

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
angle you know you might even go to play

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.440 
angle you know you might even go to play
around<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.190> like<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.300> best

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
around with it like so to get the best

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.930 
around with it like so to get the best
sort<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.840> set<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.190> yourself<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:05.820> you've
