00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 Good day, this is again Tatyana Rusina and 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.200
 we continue our video course 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.200
 getting married is easy 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.070
 in the past lessons we ourselves have already disassembled 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 what man do you want how 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.630
 attitude you aspire what underwater 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.970
 stones meet on the way to happy 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.920
 marriage you need to do to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.279
 change it we talked about why 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.329
 need to start working with yourself and 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.890
 finally we got to ourselves 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.960
 interesting is what to do with 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.660
 men what to do with men to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.700
 they wanted to marry you so he 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 I wanted to build relationships with you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.530
 let's talk about it at all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.870
 let's talk about the relationship in this video 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:49.170
 so the first thing to start is 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.650
 remember your feelings about men 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.150
 Now imagine for a moment and 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.820
 you can also close your eyes feel 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.690
 what associations do you have when 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.460
 the word man man what do you feel 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 what do you think do you like men 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.200
 do you think about how great men are to him 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.000
 strong men or do you think fu 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.430
 men there on all the same and so on 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.159
 bad this is all this all broadcast as 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.680
 we talked about it so important 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.720
 so that you initially feel respect 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.750
 to men trust me men do not 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.440
 fools they are well versed what 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.590
 woman respect them what woman like him 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.820
 include and if you are broadcasting 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.950
 disrespect to man neglect 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 the feeling that a man is just a date 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.180
 in order to provide you up to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 solve some material problems then 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.690
 why should a man not be surprised? 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 appear or appear well 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.720
 Here are the so-called not the ones that you 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.640
 are needed yes therefore I am often at trainings 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.650
 working through so exercise called 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.350
 practice respect for the masculine this 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.560
 very deep exercise and it is important to you 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.210
 it is in itself quality brings up and because 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.670
 that the legs may be different reasons we're in 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.340
 this was said there in general experience of a man 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.890
 father and so on but without respect for 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.379
 man but nothing works here first 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.150
 basic where to start 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:18.060
 further it is important for you to learn 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.659
 feel sympathy for a man 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.510
 interest because when a woman waits 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.810
 here's the mistake yes as a woman waits for some 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.849
 one man here with whom 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.909
 she will be the most perfect 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.590
 and others she just ignores them not 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.200
 thinks of men where are there any 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.400
 men movies that turns out not 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 gain effective skill 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.900
 communication that is, you do not know how to communicate with 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.970
 When do you even meet men? 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 most of all you and what to do with it 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.049
 because you don't know how to behave with him 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.750
 you need to learn to play this kitty 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.970
 knockout when our case that is 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.069
 learn to communicate with men just like 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.620
 with people like men recognize them 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.379
 interests than they live and so on what 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.079
 I can give you exercise right 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.849
 today or tomorrow until if you are in the evening 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.439
 Watch the video Well, in general, the near 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.720
 time as soon as you go out to some 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.470
 crowded place shop public 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.560
 transport 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 and your job you look at men 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.810
 now with interest and with search what 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.810
 do you like this particular person 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.090
 in any person something is beautiful 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.610
 may be interesting and shape of the face 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.190
 beautiful eyes long eyelashes 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.220
 elegant brushes or vice versa 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.190
 such confident hands how he is dressed 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:44.640
 then there like what he do not know with him 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.910
 portfolio laptop or player anyway 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.220
 men age 18 to infinity 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.850
 until then there are those not only your age 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.560
 but here's starting from 18 learn to see 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.780
 men something interesting look with 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.760
 curiously found something good in 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.550
 a man locked it will be 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.200
 postpone you well as a translator yes 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.100
 According to Math, this is indicated by the following. 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.230
 about the attitude now the so-called 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.500
 respect new format old script 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.880
 no longer work that is when you 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.790
 trying to build relationships by 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.739
 the old way the way they saw 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.320
 there at their parents in even 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.880
 used themselves about 5 years ago and this is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
 not working you probably noticed 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.030
 especially if you live in a big city 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.540
 where is the speed 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.090
 life is big where the rhythm is big high 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.919
 then here it is slowly start 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.200
 meet for a long time there to figure out something 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.760
 long time to part need not work then 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.710
 there is a speed increased relationship in 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.979
 format implies speed about 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.490
 deciding if you are slow for a long time 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.290
 think swinging all that 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.300
 competition and everyone disassembled understand 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.830
 so take into account the speed and 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.650
 speed she's like at the beginning of a relationship 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.960
 when you are just starting in the process 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.479
 and now here's the speed at break 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.130
 relationship is also there is a woman 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:04.620
 many do not understand why such 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.190
 quick break is a new attitude 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.140
 format 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.930
 the next thing in the relationship is new 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.419
 The format is an illusion of a wide choice. 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.370
 there seems to be a lot of people around with 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.590
 one side but little specifics so here 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.419
 you go to a dating site and look 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.210
 there on a million ads you start 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.950
 register and get a bunch of spam 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.510
 letters from all maniacs and then from 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.880
 all you need to choose 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.980
 but there it is therefore 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.740
 there is need to learn to choose that man 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.560
 which you still need in a relationship 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.230
 important to learn to create 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.970
 fiduciary format and close 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.450
 relationship because if you get married 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.400
 something without trust without closeness but you 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.350
 do you understand this will be no family what 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.500
 the trust 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.960
 trust is an attitude when you are still not 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.080
 believe the man is already doing well, as it were, 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.080
 upfront dollars so trust and that too 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.830
 need to practice it too slowly 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.760
 produced because if you 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.020
 initially dating a man and 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.520
 throw off on him all some problems 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.110
 which you had in previous from 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.180
 our still nothing bad did you 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.670
 don't believe him already and you're afraid already 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.310
 it is clear that it works poorly close 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.440
 relationship yes it is too 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.850
 learn to find points from contact 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.270
 contact with men yes we have 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.480
 there is 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.070
 and at least three centers are mental 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.950
 emotional sincere yes and physically 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.360
 intimate relationships if you have intimacy 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.310
 relationship only by two centers 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.260
 for example, you are well there than you can 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.940
 talk his emotions are experiencing but 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.740
 problems with sex until it doesn't work 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.570
 either you are fine with a bunch of sex 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.310
 emotions new talk nothing too 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.320
 it works at least in three centers 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.140
 you should be close now learn 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.240
 This is generally in principle with people a 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.130
 turns out to practice therefore 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.960
 my dear girls women since 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.460
 conclusion under the fourth hand that I can 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.040
 say the first exercise is 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:58.620
 broadcast interest in a man and i 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.360
 said you need to do it in 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.670
 every man try to see something 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.470
 cool attractive what you like 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.770
 do you need to configure the filter for that? 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:09.900
 man is basically around you and in 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.550
 they have something good and the second is 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.260
 work out respect third this 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.330
 take into account the attitude of the new format 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.760
 learn to trust a man to come close 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.470
 relationship when learn to be real 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.470
 sincere then men will be you 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.850
 appreciate and then you will succeed and to 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.530
 meeting in the next video 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.850
 With you was Tatiana Ruslana and our 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.850
 video course is easy
