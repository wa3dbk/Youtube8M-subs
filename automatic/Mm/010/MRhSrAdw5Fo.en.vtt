KAITLYN: Hi, I’m Kaitlyn, and I work in Marketing
here at SmartPak. I’m here to talk to you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.029
about what to expect when you’re expecting
Fly Predators in the mail.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.550
At this point, you’ve used all the tools
on our website to figure out the perfect number

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.249
of Fly Predators for your barn. So, the next
step is to open up the box that you just received

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.810
in the mail.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.810
And here they are. This particular bag is
full of 35,000 predators, so this is a pretty

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.380
large bag. It’s going to be used for a larger
boarding facility.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
There are a couple of important things to
note when you do receive your Fly Predators.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.260
One is the fact that they’re going to arrive
in the cocoon stage mixed in with a whole

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.140
bunch of shavings. When they first get here,
you might see a couple of little bugs running

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.580
around inside the package, but you don’t
want to actually start to spread these until

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.660
you see at least twelve moving around inside
the package. That’s going to take about

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.540
2-7 days.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.890
Now that you’ve seen at least twelve bugs
moving around in the Fly Predator package,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.620
it’s time to spread them. One of the areas
you’re going to want to focus on the most

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.580
is the pasture, where there’s going to be
a lot of fresh manure. So you’re going to

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.180
want to get those favorite spots where your
horses spend a lot of time and also get really

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.520
good around the fence line.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.220
You’re also going to want to focus on any
other areas on the property where you’re

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.330
storing manure, such as the manure pile, and
anywhere that you’ll find wet, damp, organic

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.979
matter, such as old hay piles, old grain piles,
anywhere there’s going to be some stagnant

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.350
water, and especially around the water trough
where it might get a little bit damp, as well.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.600
Last but not least, don’t forget to save
5-10 percent of the Fly Predators in the bag

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.619
and hang it in a place in the barn where they’d
be able to get out. Make sure you avoid any

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.170
areas where little critters could get into
the bag and eat them.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.200
One helpful hint to think about when you’re
spreading your Fly Predators is that they

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.340
can travel about up to 50 yards, which is
half a football field. So just keep that mind

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.750
when you’re spreading them around your property
so you can make sure to get full coverage.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.930
Now that we’ve talked about how to spread
Fly Predators, I want to talk a little bit

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.159
about the bugs themselves. One question that
we get pretty often is are these bugs going

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.509
to bug you, your horses, or your other animals.
Luckily, the answer is no. These bugs are

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.230
really tiny, and their sole purpose is to
target pest flies, which are the flies that

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.160
bug you and your horse, when they’re still
in the cocoon stage before they even hatch.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.670
This means that it’s really important to
start your Fly Predators early in the year,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.599
before the bugs get bad.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.480
Using Fly Predators along with good manure
management practices will keep you and your

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.230
horse worrying less about the bugs so that
you can have a great ride.
