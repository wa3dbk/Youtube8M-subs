your<00:01:21.740> data

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.430 

you're<00:01:25.760> making<00:01:26.030> squished<00:01:30.910> it's<00:01:31.910> just<00:01:32.320> hard<00:01:33.320> to

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
you're making squished it's just hard to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.760 
you're making squished it's just hard to
believe<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.490> same<00:01:34.730> animal<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.180> we<00:01:35.330> saw

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
believe it's the same animal that we saw

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.130 
believe it's the same animal that we saw
collapse<00:01:36.770> four<00:01:37.520> days<00:01:37.730> ago<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.330> look<00:01:38.870> at<00:01:39.020> them

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
collapse four days ago and look at them

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.190 
collapse four days ago and look at them
now<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.760> think<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.330> diarrhea<00:01:41.780> was<00:01:41.960> caused

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
now I think that the diarrhea was caused

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.500 
now I think that the diarrhea was caused
by<00:01:42.410> the<00:01:42.470> parasite<00:01:42.980> problem<00:01:43.490> plus<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:44.300> fact

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
by the parasite problem plus the fact

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.110 
by the parasite problem plus the fact
that<00:01:44.600> she<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:44.960> starving<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.620> dehydrated<00:01:46.340> her

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
that she was starving and dehydrated her

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.240 
that she was starving and dehydrated her
