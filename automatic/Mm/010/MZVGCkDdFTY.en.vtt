directly to the physical world for

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
directly to the physical world for
example<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> number<00:01:38.460> 3<00:01:38.759> means<00:01:39.150> 3<00:01:39.600> of

example that the number 3 means 3 of

something

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and that four means one more than three

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.719 
and that four means one more than three
because<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.290> knowledge<00:01:49.530> seemed<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.220> basic
