00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
then good luck with that now the only

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.479 
then good luck with that now the only
thing<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.930> really<00:00:52.079> do<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.309> want<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
thing you can really do if you want to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.709 
thing you can really do if you want to
be<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> dick<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.570> why<00:00:54.660> I'm

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
be a dick and I don't know why I'm

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.330 
be a dick and I don't know why I'm
telling<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.710> probably<00:00:56.039> figure

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
telling you this but you probably figure

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
telling you this but you probably figure
it<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:58.079> can't<00:00:58.590> turn<00:00:59.280> off<00:01:00.230> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
it out is that I I can't turn off the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.189 
it out is that I I can't turn off the
use<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.440> special<00:01:02.010> needs<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.840> set<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.019> as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
use of special needs so I just set it as

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.530 
use of special needs so I just set it as
concussion<00:01:04.710> here<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.390> wasn't<00:01:06.390> really

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
concussion here because I wasn't really

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
concussion here because I wasn't really
sure<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:08.040> less<00:01:08.850> annoying

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
sure of which one would be less annoying

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.539 
sure of which one would be less annoying
if<00:01:09.810> someone<00:01:10.229> was<00:01:10.380> sparing<00:01:10.650> them<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> dick

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
if someone was sparing them like a dick

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.440 
if someone was sparing them like a dick
but<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:12.119> went<00:01:12.689> with<00:01:12.840> concussion<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:15.330> will

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
but I went with concussion and you will

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.320 
but I went with concussion and you will
see<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:15.990> um<00:01:16.700> well<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.970> let<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.150> know

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
see what um well I just let you know
basically<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.920> alter<00:01:20.340> how<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.759> perks

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
basically you can alter how the perks

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
basically you can alter how the perks
work<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> did<00:01:23.610> was<00:01:23.909> edit<00:01:24.330> steady<00:01:24.930> aim<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
work and so I did was edit steady aim so

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.700 
work and so I did was edit steady aim so
they<00:01:25.860> only<00:01:26.159> had<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> five<00:01:27.330> percent<00:01:27.780> spread

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
they only had a five percent spread

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
they only had a five percent spread
which<00:01:29.400> essentially<00:01:29.759> means<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.180> no<00:01:30.450> scopes

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
which essentially means that no scopes

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.600 
which essentially means that no scopes
are<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.350> accurate<00:01:32.000> Mary<00:01:33.000> damn<00:01:33.360> accurate<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
are very accurate Mary damn accurate so

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.740 
are very accurate Mary damn accurate so

so like fakies or 360 s i'm still a good
and<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.079> could<00:02:01.200> probably<00:02:01.380> like

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and you could probably like

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.739 
and you could probably like
so<00:02:02.399> scoping<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.030> them<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.600> can

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:03.749 
so scoping with them because you can

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.330 
so scoping with them because you can
like<00:02:03.899> open<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:04.530> drag<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.829> around<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.310> bit

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
like open and then drag it around a bit

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.789 
like open and then drag it around a bit
and<00:02:05.460> probably<00:02:05.960> that's<00:02:06.960> not<00:02:07.170> one<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.409> like

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and probably that's not one of like

corrected itself from the nerfing by

corrected itself from the nerfing by
then<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:12.080> here's<00:02:13.080> me<00:02:13.230> just<00:02:13.440> setting<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.799> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
then so here's me just setting up the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.240 
then so here's me just setting up the
options<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.489> think<00:02:14.790> would<00:02:14.970> work<00:02:15.840> for<00:02:16.379> an

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
options that I think would work for an

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.789 
options that I think would work for an
open<00:02:17.549> lobby<00:02:17.640> if<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.810> have<00:02:19.080> anything<00:02:19.349> against

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
open lobby if you have anything against

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:21.559 
open lobby if you have anything against
these<00:02:20.010> options<00:02:20.370> let<00:02:20.489> me<00:02:20.580> know<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:21.360> put<00:02:21.540> a

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
these options let me know just put a

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.210 
these options let me know just put a
three<00:02:21.900> second<00:02:22.230> time<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.620> because<00:02:22.799> it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
three second time to it because it's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.320 
three second time to it because it's
probably<00:02:23.430> I'm<00:02:23.519> gonna<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.730> over<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.030> said

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
probably I'm gonna go over that I said

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.509 
probably I'm gonna go over that I said
the<00:02:24.390> bomb<00:02:24.540> timer<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.989> really<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:25.709> long<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
the bomb timer is really really long the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
diffuse the plant I was really really

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.839 
diffuse the plant I was really really
long<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.799> a<00:02:28.980> few<00:02:29.160> summers<00:02:29.430> really<00:02:29.700> really

long and a few summers really really

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:30.979 
long and a few summers really really

in playing Search and Destroy is that

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.449 
in playing Search and Destroy is that
there's<00:02:34.410> only<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.739> life<00:02:34.950> when<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.310> get

killcams<00:02:35.940> Williams<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.530> round

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
killcams Williams do that so it is round

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.619 
killcams Williams do that so it is round
so<00:02:38.040> every<00:02:38.370> round<00:02:38.549> which<00:02:38.849> is<00:02:39.030> which<00:02:39.329> I

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
so every round which is which I

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.170 
so every round which is which I
personally<00:02:39.959> think<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.379> should<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.560> online<00:02:41.180> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
personally think it should be online and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.280 
personally think it should be online and
eight<00:02:42.750> rounds<00:02:43.170> I<00:02:43.400> usually<00:02:44.400> let<00:02:44.610> people<00:02:45.290> will

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
eight rounds I usually let people will

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.729 
eight rounds I usually let people will
play<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.860> single<00:02:47.250> game<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:48.349> as<00:02:49.349> soon<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.620> one

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
play a single game so as soon as one

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.930 
play a single game so as soon as one
thing<00:02:49.920> gets<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.160> eight<00:02:50.280> rounds<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> game's

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
thing gets to eight rounds the game's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.000 
thing gets to eight rounds the game's
over<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:51.629> I<00:02:51.840> go<00:02:52.459> load<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.489> new<00:02:53.579> people<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
over and then I go load a new people in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.589 
over and then I go load a new people in
and<00:02:56.010> yet<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.640> see<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:57.060> crosshairs

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
and yet as you can see the crosshairs

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.920 
and yet as you can see the crosshairs
are<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.049> very<00:02:58.980> very<00:02:59.069> small<00:02:59.340> earlier<00:02:59.930> earlier

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
