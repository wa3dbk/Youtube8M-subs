00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.450 
for you
but<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.439> about<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.740> big<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.070> gets<00:01:56.100> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
but that's about as big as it gets and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.620 
but that's about as big as it gets and
it<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.420> looks<00:01:57.630> light<00:01:58.560> green<00:01:59.329> like<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.479> one

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
it just looks light green like that one

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.749 
it just looks light green like that one
right<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.930> looks<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.409> apple

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
right there looks like a little apple

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.800 
right there looks like a little apple
until<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.850> gets<00:02:02.969> about<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.329> size<00:02:03.570> right

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
until it gets about that size right

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.280 
until it gets about that size right
there<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.729> then<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.149> starts<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.899> turn<00:02:07.020> light

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
there and then it starts to turn light

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.109 
there and then it starts to turn light
yellow<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> goes<00:02:08.280> down<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.580> here<00:02:08.789> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
yellow and then it goes down to here so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.759 
yellow and then it goes down to here so
that<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.659> is<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> pickable<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.560> there

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
that one is a pickable one right there

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.430 
that one is a pickable one right there
and<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.629> like<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.019> because<00:02:13.110> when<00:02:13.379> you
