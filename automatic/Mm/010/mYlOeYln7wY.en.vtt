00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.410> in<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:01.949> I<00:00:02.190> want<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.399> talk

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay so in this video I want to talk

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.079 
okay so in this video I want to talk
about<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.970> circle<00:00:03.480> fourths<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.140> fifths<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:05.089 
about the circle fourths and fifths and

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.210 
about the circle fourths and fifths and
it's<00:00:06.089> pretty<00:00:06.390> much<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.660> same<00:00:06.839> thing<00:00:07.140> and<00:00:07.350> it's

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
it's pretty much the same thing and it's

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.330 
it's pretty much the same thing and it's
just<00:00:08.280> basically<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:09.300> way<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.139> you<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.410> be<00:00:11.040> going

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
just basically a way for you to be going

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.549 
just basically a way for you to be going
in<00:00:11.460> fourths<00:00:11.910> or<00:00:12.030> fifths<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.660> get<00:00:13.019> around<00:00:13.290> all

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
in fourths or fifths and get around all

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.160 
in fourths or fifths and get around all
12<00:00:14.070> keys<00:00:15.139> so<00:00:16.139> for<00:00:16.440> example<00:00:17.869> let's<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:19.020> go

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
12 keys so for example let's just go

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.480 
12 keys so for example let's just go
through<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> you'll<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:19.920> able<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.250> see

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
through it and you'll be able to see

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550 
through it and you'll be able to see
what<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> mean<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:21.960> if<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.170> go<00:00:22.289> through<00:00:22.439> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
what I mean so if we go through the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.790 
what I mean so if we go through the
circle<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> fourths<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.779> mean<00:00:25.680> that's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
circle of fourths which is I mean that's

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.679 
circle of fourths which is I mean that's
what's<00:00:25.980> most<00:00:26.130> common<00:00:26.640> really<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.150> jazz<00:00:27.390> that's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
what's most common really in jazz that's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.650 
what's most common really in jazz that's
just<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.619> I<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.070> when<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.939> say<00:00:30.420> go

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
just what I think of when I say go

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.749 
just what I think of when I say go
around<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> cycle<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> means<00:00:32.040> going

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
around the cycle that means going

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.190 
around the cycle that means going
fourths<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.829> C<00:00:35.270> -<00:00:36.270> f<00:00:36.300> -

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
fourths so this is what it is so C - f -

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.209 
fourths so this is what it is so C - f -
B<00:00:37.920> flat<00:00:38.340> these<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.450> fourths<00:00:39.920> one<00:00:40.920> two

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
B flat these are all fourths one two

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.720 

thank<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.600> going<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.079> fourth<00:00:51.690> a-flat<00:00:52.690> d-flat

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
thank you going a fourth a-flat d-flat

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:05.399 
thank you going a fourth a-flat d-flat
g-flat<00:00:55.860> e<00:00:57.269> e<00:00:58.829> a<00:01:00.329> d<00:01:01.329> g<00:01:02.309> c<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:04.629> just<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.019> happens

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
g-flat e e a d g c it just so happens

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.590 
g-flat e e a d g c it just so happens
that<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.619> piano<00:01:05.979> works<00:01:06.670> out<00:01:06.850> perfectly<00:01:07.360> like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
that the piano works out perfectly like

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.660 
that the piano works out perfectly like
that<00:01:09.149> put<00:01:10.149> another<00:01:10.450> way<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:11.560> could<00:01:11.710> just<00:01:11.770> do<00:01:12.549> it

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
that put another way we could just do it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.330 
that put another way we could just do it
like<00:01:12.789> this<00:01:12.820> C<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:14.049> F<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:14.770> then<00:01:14.830> instead<00:01:15.250> of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
like this C to F and then instead of

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.529 
like this C to F and then instead of
going<00:01:15.399> up<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.850> b-flat

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
going up to b-flat

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.050 
going up to b-flat
you<00:01:16.840> could<00:01:16.960> just<00:01:17.080> play<00:01:17.229> B<00:01:17.920> flat<00:01:17.950> down<00:01:18.280> here<00:01:18.640> so

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
you could just play B flat down here so

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:31.150 
you could just play B flat down here so
the<00:01:19.149> circle<00:01:19.539> four<00:01:19.780> could<00:01:19.990> look<00:01:20.080> like<00:01:20.170> this

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.750 

now<00:01:33.590> yeah<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:36.510> is<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:37.740> important<00:01:38.310> for

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
now yeah so this is very important for

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000 
now yeah so this is very important for
you<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.000> mastered<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.830> is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
you to have mastered because this is

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.610 
you to have mastered because this is
primarily<00:01:41.940> how<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.600> will<00:01:42.930> put<00:01:43.260> chord

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
primarily how we will put chord

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.390 
primarily how we will put chord
progressions<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.840> songs<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.290> ideas<00:01:47.190> and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
progressions and songs and ideas and

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.310 
progressions and songs and ideas and
twelve<00:01:47.670> keys<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.330> go<00:01:48.510> through<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> circle<00:01:49.230> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
twelve keys we go through the circle of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.620 
twelve keys we go through the circle of
fourths<00:01:52.610> because<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.700> mean<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.970> could<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
fourths because I mean you could put a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.870 
fourths because I mean you could put a
good<00:01:54.930> lick<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.200> twelve<00:01:55.920> keys<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.550> going

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
good lick in twelve keys just by going

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.190 
good lick in twelve keys just by going
up<00:01:57.000> in<00:01:57.150> half<00:01:57.360> steps<00:01:58.760> but<00:01:59.760> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.720> do<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.960> but

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
up in half steps but you can do that but

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
up in half steps but you can do that but
we<00:02:01.440> really<00:02:01.680> liked<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.220> get<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.550> master<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
we really liked you to get to master the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.900 
we really liked you to get to master the
circle<00:02:04.200> force<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.220> main<00:02:05.400> reason<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> just

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
circle force and the main reason is just

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.260 
circle force and the main reason is just
from<00:02:06.210> our<00:02:06.300> progression<00:02:06.870> standpoint<00:02:08.090> it's<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
from our progression standpoint it's a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.060 
from our progression standpoint it's a
really<00:02:09.600> common<00:02:11.600> way<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.660> phrase<00:02:13.170> things<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
really common way to phrase things and I

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.970 
really common way to phrase things and I
can<00:02:14.370> explain<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.820> better<00:02:14.970> through<00:02:15.300> this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
can explain that better through this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
can explain that better through this
this<00:02:16.980> will<00:02:17.250> actually<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.640> think<00:02:17.970> you'll<00:02:18.180> find

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
this will actually I think you'll find

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.210 
this will actually I think you'll find
is<00:02:18.450> pretty<00:02:18.570> cool

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
is pretty cool

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.760 
is pretty cool
many<00:02:20.220> classical<00:02:20.850> songs<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:23.310> example<00:02:23.850> use<00:02:24.660> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
many classical songs for example use the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.110 
many classical songs for example use the
circle<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.830> fourths<00:02:28.370> within<00:02:29.370> within<00:02:29.880> this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
circle of fourths within within this

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.850 
circle of fourths within within this
song<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> structure<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:31.380> here<00:02:31.620> let<00:02:31.830> me

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
song as a structure and then here let me

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.780 
song as a structure and then here let me
explain<00:02:31.950> what<00:02:32.910> I<00:02:32.940> mean<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.540> you'll<00:02:34.170> probably

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
explain what I mean so you'll probably

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
explain what I mean so you'll probably
think<00:02:35.790> yourself<00:02:36.330> as<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.630> play<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.230> I've<00:02:37.410> heard

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
think yourself as I play so I've heard

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.500 
think yourself as I play so I've heard
that<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.040> many<00:02:38.100> times<00:02:38.250> before<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.090> classical

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
that so many times before in a classical

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.840 
that so many times before in a classical
song<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.709> all<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> is<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.610> around<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
song and all it is is going around the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:48.600 
song and all it is is going around the
circle<00:02:42.060> force<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.720> it's

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.570 

you

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:07.830 

or<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:53.080> this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.059 

all<00:03:08.840> that<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.170> this<00:03:09.319> going<00:03:09.590> around<00:03:09.769> the<00:03:09.890> circle

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
all that is this going around the circle

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.080 
all that is this going around the circle
of<00:03:10.280> fourths<00:03:10.580> changing<00:03:11.540> from<00:03:11.780> major<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.409> minor

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
of fourths changing from major to minor

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:24.110 
of fourths changing from major to minor
or<00:03:14.200> dominant<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.470> know<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.680> could<00:03:15.799> be

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.480 

dominant

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.330 

so

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.790 

you<00:03:36.150> know<00:03:36.239> all<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.930> is<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.379> around<00:03:37.590> the

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
you know all that is is going around the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.369 
you know all that is is going around the
circle<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.250> fourths<00:03:39.379> so<00:03:41.930> it's<00:03:42.930> good<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.230> have

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
circle of fourths so it's good to have

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.080 
circle of fourths so it's good to have
masters<00:03:43.800> so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:43.950> recommend<00:03:44.430> pruning<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.819> 12

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
masters so I recommend pruning in 12

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.080 
masters so I recommend pruning in 12
keys<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.629> can<00:03:45.690> do<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.959> with<00:03:46.080> single<00:03:46.440> notes<00:03:46.470> and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
keys you can do it with single notes and

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.270 
keys you can do it with single notes and
then<00:03:48.170> you<00:03:49.170> know<00:03:49.879> do<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:50.910> both<00:03:51.180> ways<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:53.099> then

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
then you know do it both ways and then

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.059 
then you know do it both ways and then
come<00:03:53.610> down<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:54.780> you're<00:03:55.200> playing<00:03:55.319> in<00:03:55.500> octaves

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.750 

and<00:03:59.069> then<00:04:00.030> do<00:04:00.599> simple<00:04:01.530> chords<00:04:01.860> we'll<00:04:02.459> get<00:04:02.610> into

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
and then do simple chords we'll get into

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.360 
and then do simple chords we'll get into
more<00:04:03.180> chord<00:04:03.540> theory<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.019> future<00:04:04.860> videos<00:04:05.190> but

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
more chord theory in future videos but

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.670 
more chord theory in future videos but
for<00:04:05.519> example<00:04:05.879> you<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.209> do<00:04:06.299> a<00:04:06.330> simple<00:04:06.569> 1<00:04:07.380> 3

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
for example you can just do a simple 1 3

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:27.140 
for example you can just do a simple 1 3
5<00:04:15.979> D<00:04:16.979> flat<00:04:25.190> yeah<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.520> that's<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.729> circle<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
5 D flat yeah so that's a circle of

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.990 
5 D flat yeah so that's a circle of
fourths<00:04:27.450> now<00:04:28.410> let's<00:04:28.710> get<00:04:28.919> into<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.310> circle<00:04:29.910> of

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
fourths now let's get into the circle of

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.340 
fourths now let's get into the circle of
fifths<00:04:30.330> which<00:04:30.720> is<00:04:30.870> technically<00:04:31.200> just

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
fifths which is technically just

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:39.110 
fifths which is technically just
reversing<00:04:31.889> it<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.460> notice<00:04:32.760> how<00:04:32.910> we<00:04:32.940> ended<00:04:34.280> so

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.560 

it<00:04:40.120> went<00:04:40.330> from<00:04:40.450> G<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:41.139> C

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.730 

and<00:04:46.570> isn't<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.990> convenient<00:04:47.350> that's<00:04:47.650> a

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
and isn't that convenient that's a

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.190 
and isn't that convenient that's a
two-five<00:04:48.340> one<00:04:48.760> which<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.540> most<00:04:49.570> common

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
two-five one which is the most common

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.159 
two-five one which is the most common
chord<00:04:50.620> progression<00:04:51.130> in<00:04:51.250> jazz<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:52.080> then<00:04:53.080> the

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
chord progression in jazz and then the

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.590 
chord progression in jazz and then the
last<00:04:53.350> three<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:55.210> cycle<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.720> fourths

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
last three in the cycle of fourths

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.050 
last three in the cycle of fourths
anyway<00:04:58.860> now<00:04:59.860> we<00:04:59.919> just<00:05:00.220> reverse<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.880> instead

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
anyway now we just reverse it so instead

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.150 
anyway now we just reverse it so instead
of<00:05:01.150> going<00:05:01.450> from<00:05:02.230> G<00:05:02.710> from<00:05:03.250> D<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.910> G<00:05:03.940> to<00:05:04.389> C<00:05:05.160> we'll

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
of going from G from D to G to C we'll

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.379 
of going from G from D to G to C we'll
start<00:05:06.460> at<00:05:06.550> C<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.060> go<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.450> G<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.110> go<00:05:08.950> to<00:05:09.010> D<00:05:09.389> then

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
start at C and go to G and go to D then

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:19.450 
start at C and go to G and go to D then
go<00:05:10.540> to<00:05:10.600> a<00:05:11.700> fencing<00:05:12.700> he<00:05:13.110> me

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.269 

so<00:05:20.460> for<00:05:20.639> example<00:05:20.699> you<00:05:21.389> know<00:05:22.009> you<00:05:23.009> could<00:05:23.189> even

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:23.279 
so for example you know you could even

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.070 
so for example you know you could even
start<00:05:23.669> in<00:05:23.789> G<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.599> doesn't<00:05:24.809> really<00:05:24.899> matter

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
start in G it doesn't really matter

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.959 
start in G it doesn't really matter
where<00:05:25.319> you<00:05:25.409> go<00:05:25.589> it's<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:25.830> you<00:05:26.550> know<00:05:26.699> that<00:05:26.879> you

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
where you go it's just you know that you

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:30.019 
where you go it's just you know that you
start<00:05:27.300> by<00:05:27.619> going<00:05:28.619> in<00:05:28.830> fifths<00:05:29.219> so<00:05:29.669> if<00:05:29.729> we<00:05:29.849> start

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
start by going in fifths so if we start

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.450 
start by going in fifths so if we start
and<00:05:30.149> see<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.689> next<00:05:30.839> step<00:05:31.050> will<00:05:31.199> be<00:05:31.229> G<00:05:31.529> the<00:05:32.159> next

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
and see the next step will be G the next

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.350 
and see the next step will be G the next
note<00:05:32.639> will<00:05:32.849> be<00:05:33.059> D<00:05:33.869> a<00:05:34.229> e<00:05:38.089> otherwise<00:05:39.089> if<00:05:39.270> you

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
note will be D a e otherwise if you

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.029 
note will be D a e otherwise if you
started<00:05:39.629> in<00:05:39.749> G<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.559> next<00:05:40.800> note<00:05:40.919> would<00:05:40.949> be<00:05:41.249> D<00:05:43.039> it

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
started in G the next note would be D it

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:50.770 
started in G the next note would be D it
still<00:05:44.309> goes<00:05:44.490> in<00:05:44.520> fists

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.200 

I'll<00:05:51.780> bring<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.050> down<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:52.980> know<00:05:53.370> this<00:05:54.090> is

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
I'll bring it down so you know this is

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:06.420 
I'll bring it down so you know this is
what<00:05:54.330> it<00:05:54.420> looks<00:05:54.540> like

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.140 

and<00:06:07.870> yeah<00:06:08.870> so<00:06:09.400> it's<00:06:10.400> pretty<00:06:10.550> much<00:06:10.639> essentially

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
and yeah so it's pretty much essentially

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.640 
and yeah so it's pretty much essentially
the<00:06:11.240> same<00:06:11.389> thing<00:06:11.629> as<00:06:11.750> you<00:06:11.900> notice<00:06:12.169> it<00:06:12.379> goes

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
the same thing as you notice it goes

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.230 
the same thing as you notice it goes
through<00:06:12.919> all<00:06:13.009> the<00:06:13.159> keys<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.759> only<00:06:13.939> difference

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
through all the keys the only difference

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.749 
through all the keys the only difference
is<00:06:14.360> if<00:06:14.479> the<00:06:14.599> circle<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:15.020> fourths<00:06:15.289> and<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.639> way

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
is if the circle of fourths and the way

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.219 
is if the circle of fourths and the way
we<00:06:16.879> just<00:06:17.030> played<00:06:17.240> it<00:06:17.389> goes<00:06:17.539> down<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.870> circle

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
we just played it goes down the circle

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:26.320 
we just played it goes down the circle
will<00:06:21.319> fit<00:06:21.530> so<00:06:21.710> we<00:06:21.800> technically<00:06:22.219> go<00:06:22.460> up

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.600 

but<00:06:27.330> it's<00:06:27.660> it's<00:06:28.289> pretty<00:06:28.470> much<00:06:28.620> all<00:06:28.800> those<00:06:28.919> you

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
but it's it's pretty much all those you

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
but it's it's pretty much all those you
know<00:06:29.699> the<00:06:29.880> same<00:06:30.090> thing<00:06:31.250> and<00:06:34.160> yeah<00:06:35.160> so<00:06:35.550> but<00:06:36.449> I

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
know the same thing and yeah so but I

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.330 
know the same thing and yeah so but I
would<00:06:36.750> recommend<00:06:37.520> practicing<00:06:38.520> both<00:06:39.240> you<00:06:39.690> know

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
would recommend practicing both you know

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.620 
would recommend practicing both you know
do<00:06:41.340> the<00:06:41.460> circle<00:06:41.820> of<00:06:41.880> fifths

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:54.110 

and<00:06:47.140> that's<00:06:47.410> right<00:06:47.530> go<00:06:47.680> forth<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:53.080> yeah<00:06:53.440> and

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
and that's right go forth and yeah and

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.760 
and that's right go forth and yeah and
we<00:06:55.120> can<00:06:55.300> never<00:06:55.390> print<00:06:55.810> out<00:06:55.960> of<00:06:56.200> it<00:06:56.380> so<00:06:56.500> you<00:06:56.620> can

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
we can never print out of it so you can

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.250 
we can never print out of it so you can
visually<00:06:57.160> see<00:06:57.370> it<00:06:57.400> but<00:06:58.150> that's<00:06:58.780> essentially

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260 
visually see it but that's essentially

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.590 
visually see it but that's essentially
this<00:06:59.440> the<00:07:00.010> circle<00:07:00.400> of<00:07:00.520> fourths<00:07:00.880> and<00:07:01.060> fits<00:07:01.330> and

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
this the circle of fourths and fits and

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.400 
this the circle of fourths and fits and
it<00:07:02.470> is<00:07:02.650> essential<00:07:03.310> that<00:07:03.370> you<00:07:03.490> master<00:07:04.060> this<00:07:04.690> so

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
it is essential that you master this so

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.890 
it is essential that you master this so
play<00:07:06.310> it<00:07:06.490> so<00:07:07.030> you<00:07:07.150> can<00:07:07.300> play<00:07:07.420> with<00:07:07.540> your<00:07:07.720> eyes

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
play it so you can play with your eyes

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.350 
play it so you can play with your eyes
closed<00:07:08.350> and<00:07:09.840> hear<00:07:10.840> it<00:07:10.930> by<00:07:11.050> ear
