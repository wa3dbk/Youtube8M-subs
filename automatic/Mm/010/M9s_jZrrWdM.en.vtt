00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.910
 Welcome to the 26th 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.849
 mod conception today with an is 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.190
 station to feed mix and that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.000
 the production is 10 tons per 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.000
 hour 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.710
 The capacity is 100 tons and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.720
 the maintenance costs you twelve euro per 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.570
 Day 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 You can use mixed feed for cows and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 produce sheep and where three 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.080
 demands aimless then see later 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.230
 You will have to straw hay and silage 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.960
 rows are filled and the capacity 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.020
 lies with the three calls silos respectively 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.210
 at 50 tons 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.410
 the object costs 32 1499 euros in the shop 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 and yes as we now look the same times 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.789
 and I wish you much fun so 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 city toll from 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.530
 the measuring station and the chance now 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.699
 a bit from the outside that she gave me 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 once again that here is a red one 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 light looks that has to mean that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 a goal he is there are two more 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.619
 other lights can look 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 the yellow so the middle light the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 means that the mixing container is full 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.170
 and the lower the green means 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.549
 that everything is ok and that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.479
 is produced otherwise there is here 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.250
 still so small in general but so box 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.930
 unfortunately you can not serve it now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.030
 or you can not recognize it unfortunately 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.860
 But it is not so bad because we can 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 We already have such a display on the top left 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.439
 if you go and that with station 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.380
 One, I was only one on the map 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.950
 who else could there be 20 or too 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 another number is total emissions 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.020
 is zero because I have nothing inside 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.130
 have and nothing will 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 mixed then we still have the three 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 Charging stations I say 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.829
 there comes to a silage hay and straw 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.720
 purely because everything is zero to 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:15.060
 so extreme have the 3 sees 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.830
 keep that can be filled here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.160
 once with silage hay and straw then 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.530
 everything is mixed together and it 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.780
 So that's how they come from 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.130
 We have a big container then 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.140
 a total of 100 tons of pure and fit 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.610
 when everything is mixed then comes 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.250
 here the finished food out here and there 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.490
 you have to then with the feed mixer 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.440
 or you have to drive under it then 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.260
 and then you can open it or it 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.350
 give sheep as feed 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.060
 You can download the whole by her 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.300
 just the left as the best 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.520
 clicks and yes otherwise it was now 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.040
 with the 626 presentation 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.720
 I hope I like now shows 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.880
 It gives me a thumbs up 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.990
 or if you did not like it 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.290
 thumb down 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.910
 otherwise it was like that I hope so 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.960
 that jasmine is again seen to 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.040
 That's what makes it good 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.040
 and look
