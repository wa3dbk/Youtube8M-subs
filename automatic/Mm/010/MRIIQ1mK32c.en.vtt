00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.210
 cook with this video review of all 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.069
 frame 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.540
 tent can take the new apple iphone 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.420
 4s under the microscope 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.910
 apple iphone 4s is the last talk park 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.830
 van apple is the successor to the iphone 4 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.289
 and then we go up close 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.510
 see 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 it's what's between conceive that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.080
 looks exactly the same as 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.850
 its predecessor we have the white one here 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 variant the 460 version 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.060
 this costs around 100 euros to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.340
 the Netherlands and if you actually 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.280
 almost actions rarely look like one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.540
 just the first iphone 4 tricel design 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.329
 self tightness 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.390
 very nice and prevents glass and add one 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.190
 had octagonal wax for the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 metal bows on the side 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 aluminum that sturdy antenna 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 if this new iphone needs something better 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.660
 use it as a comparison with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.300
 the original iphone 4 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.260
 then you see a few small differences 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:03.090
 let's see such an on their me especially this way 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.439
 for this it is a small notch but 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 that you are with the iphone 4s here too 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 above but original iphone not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.040
 and also on the other hand and will offer 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.540
 notch 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.310
 not with the iphone 4s also looks here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.680
 above and not with the original iphone 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.840
 bitch experiencing the metal strip 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.820
 so also and the receiver this for that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 Belgium with WiFi signal and Bluetooth 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.290
 and call original iphone 4 where still 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.580
 a disturb if you hold it in your hand 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 professionally hand slightly damp 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.030
 was that it was so I got in kepis 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.470
 so improved, among other devices 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.229
 see and then there exactly the same 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.009
 actually not paying attention the side 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.759
 then you actually don't see any 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.020
 differences 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.670
 on the back is also just iphone 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.570
 easy that not what how a gigabyte 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.720
 in it 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 but they just said options all where i am 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.950
 live in the speed notes the iphone 4s 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.850
 has a dual core processor that is already there 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.009
 a5 processor 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.110
 this logo abyss research or abyss 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.880
 megas has n't announced there yet 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.119
 but such a me much faster than his 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.780
 pastor can see here for example 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.780
 like going on board 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:17.959
 gadget and come catch 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.959
 and 2 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 in you see that the iphone 4 is just something 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.700
 is faster to use and also with the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.190
 switch between applications 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.930
 for others that are smoother 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.360
 of course nice and important inside 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
 half an hour in addition to the quick 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.040
 processor the camera 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.480
 the camera now has 8 megapixels 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.130
 and has additionally look but we find 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.330
 you also have improvement software 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.650
 and then he can make a lot of pictures 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.650
 just inflation 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.370
 as you can see makes a whole lot of photos 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.560
 and then come on fast processor through the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.660
 car was another godfather of a camera 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.670
 is also that you get what you can from soft 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.010
 can edit reasonable levels to them 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.840
 to make it better 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.460
 Sure it's made to measure 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.070
 but goes apple would calculate how that 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.500
 of the better looking can say okay and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.780
 Well picture is about 8 to 10 times 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.050
 work better but that is not always the case 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.050
 to be 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.030
 for the rest he was five know this one 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.370
 to see a bar of course you too 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.690
 from anyway choose from what looks 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.209
 the latter all happens 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.400
 the weather notifications it does now 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.560
 not normally do this even after Week 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.110
 another notifications but different 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.940
 siri is an important improvement with four 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.440
 you can send it like a task 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.790
 driving 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.160
 this does not work well at all 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.340
 Dutch in the Netherlands will fit from 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.510
 appears when they start working early 2013 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.910
 but until then you have to be in English 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.080
 do German or French and now go for a moment 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.080
 english shows how that works 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:04.860
 do and everyone will buy tomorrow quickly 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.480
 back in the orchestra so you can too 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.520
 finding contact she also says feels 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860
 tomorrow a regions needed to mean that 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.180
 so I will rain my own tomorrow 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.040
 you know what i mean 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.229
 and then she can immediately say no if 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.910
 I'll not live example which will 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.590
 we have a content like a different city now 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.770
 say then understand that immediately 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.770
 still have and in countries 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.259
 there is one now and the orchestra 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.050
 so the weak coolness that context can do 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.000
 continue to ask 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:45.150
 of course nice and another question 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.440
 says as much as a cream and columns and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.660
 eagerly funny answers and wrote 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220
 a different answer every time 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.759
 Next can take a look how you angle 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.759
 mary with it 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.310
 so it's even more funny and stuff like that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.880
 possibly even more because of the 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.900
 and pioneers and that seems beyond good 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.800
 They admit it isn't that very special 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.539
 more 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.830
 so it is such a big heart wish 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.849
 moving forward a lot and just being real 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.860
 and drove fast 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.370
 all pages also really load 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.370
 Super fast 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.820
 he was five software is also available 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.729
 for the ipad 2 the ipad and the iphone 4 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.560
 so much change in and out 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.409
 he can simply scroll through it 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.659
 blue just got a lot faster too 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:29.130
 another website just sit 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:32.610
 very slick and we just really 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.110
 smooth the menu button 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.150
 the problems that sometimes matter a bit 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.909
 the price he's just really the so expensive 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.530
 we have four specific model that 7 or 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.500
 8 euros sorry 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.870
 is the starting price of a 16- bike model 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.760
 around 50 euros, that's quite a lot 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.770
 money and a second problem is that 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.030
 glass is very beautiful and it is 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.289
 just very sick 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.840
 only if the device is late or late 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.620
 fall then you have a good chance it 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.349
 glass will break 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.510
 therefore they become a very expensive one 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.659
 repair in the van of course not 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.500
 under the warranty with apple iphone 4s 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.270
 a very nice device 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.220
 he is not making much progress 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.000
 it just wants to be perfected 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.380
 say 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.320
 and it's just very tight that it 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.940
 just looks slick 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.920
 where certainly no bad buy does me 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.990
 need some money for over the place 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.820
 for look at this review and also view 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.940
