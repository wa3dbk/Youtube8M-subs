00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.800
 bruno company hello brno who will 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.170
 take the wheel of the new Peugeot 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.170
 2008 that with the engine hdi 92 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.320
 then you ride with an opel 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.489
 meriva and you are interested in the 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.429
 peugeot 2008 what is it 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:30.430
 aesthetically like that seduces you 2 in 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.010
 very first we will say this is where the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.670
 vehicle shape one side enough to these 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.980
 city ​​dwellers but which seems a priori 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.750
 also be suitable for family use and 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.980
 found all the characteristics of 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 this high-end version of the chrome 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.040
 everywhere up and down 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.040
 a wave shape also on the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.770
 flag 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.990
 two sides what do you think 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.080
 we will say a fairly sporty vehicle 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.940
 it's pretty nervous a pretty model 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.070
 masculine enough the back actually 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.160
 bruno we find this side a little 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.210
 raised fighter with a big back 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.910
 back massive enough 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.530
 I invite you to discover the chest is 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.400
 what this bruno volume suggest to you 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.290
 with your two children 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.690
 the trunk is spacious enough I think 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.800
 that yes yes yes largely now I 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.950
 invite you bruno go discover 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.600
 interior 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 first impressions bruno an interior 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.450
 very sober and rather rather elegant 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.119
 how do you feel at the wheel of a 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.490
 minute very well there is room then 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.080
 there the steering wheel is small and the counters 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.369
 are located above as on the 208 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.300
 it's supposed to make a display effect 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.759
 head held high 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.890
 did you go 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.000
 you see it well yeah that disturbs me 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.170
 not at all on the contrary it's true 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.259
 we have a beautiful vision 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.470
 from the road then there you are driving 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.850
 of the 92 horsepower diesel version is this 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.200
 that's enough for you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.840
 does it seem nice to you 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.930
 drive the engine is quite flexible the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 car car responds well it's very 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.649
 nice to drive wade to the level of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.600
 compromise between ride comfort 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.820
 do you like the 2008 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 road is really effective I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.340
 actually find what I can 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.780
 to have on my surely meriva with 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.709
 maybe even more flexibility 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.050
 maybe a little more pleasant to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.430
 driving is at the sound level 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.180
 does the vehicle seem pretty 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.519
 well isolated 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.890
 it is true that the vehicle where he is 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.120
 very well caulked not heard 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.110
 not the engine at a noise really 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.670
 pleasant bruno we come to the end of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.830
 this essay i 'm going to ask you a point 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.260
 negative is a bright spot on the 2008 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.959
 I did not appreciate the handbrake 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
 is hard enough and I liked the 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.470
 flexibility of driving the vehicle 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.459
