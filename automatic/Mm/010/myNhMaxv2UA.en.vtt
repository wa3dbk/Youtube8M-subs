00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 hello everybody has the best system 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.549
 operating system for games on windows 7 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.840
 We have not had our lives in a long time. 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.970
 is incompatible with directx 11 is 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 compatible with the moment is not a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:27.149
 requirement is your god 8 and the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.030
 operating system form worked 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:34.950
 is that she that flat and gualtar 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:39.149
 windows 8 is a start menu thalia one 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 way more comfortable for all of us 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:46.080
 used but display windows 8 that 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.159
 brought the directx 11 point on that nothing 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.090
 more is that an improvement of the resources 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 already existing in directx 11 it does not 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 no new feature just a better way 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.740
 to work with those resources and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.460
 with directx 8 or with windows sorry 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.959
 folks 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.380
 or windows 8 direct x 11.2 tale that 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.900
 again, it 's just a few improvements 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.570
 Of course we are seeing that it will come out too. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.950
 There, the scheidt estimate is with the 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.480
 operating system 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.090
 sting the ess for who is out there 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.150
 Do not bother buying it says it's a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.160
 computer for games but does not want 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.220
 investing in windows mac 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 out there the $ 36 200 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.220
 here comes the style is this is a system 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 free operation only until then 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.069
 was not stipulated whether it will have 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.190
 ability to use programs such as 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.769
 office and related but for us the windows 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.870
 even better because we have a 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.709
 steam application to settle in 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.140
 windows and rodosol need to have the style 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.500
 yes outside you can not use the destination 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.780
 big picture mode 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.010
 you will have the same style interface 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.700
 s therefore it is not advisable to 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.210
 steaua s linux for much less games 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:22.840
 but windows 7 or windows 8 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:26.800
 Right, but I particularly like it a lot. 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:30.340
 of windows 7 use windows 8 is because 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:35.290
 how good a professional I always do 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:39.370
 matter of ddd fix but I always 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.330
 I always use everything that's new in the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.520
 Marketplace 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.000
 I used the 2 vice would have used in 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.600
 2008 all these operating systems 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.060
 who were not so well 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.930
 I made a point of using 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.250
 all the time in their lives forever 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.070
 a step forward in general knowledge 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.890
 within all systems and resources and 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.760
 features as today also uses 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.640
 The mech is that, and today the mech is 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.920
 said the current version that the 10.9 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.580
 so the system is very good 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.090
 wheel games too and there are few 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.580
 Well, I recently picked up the mechanics. 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.820
 is the law extinguished and the games my 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.910
 library that I have until all pc 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.560
 the games they have that are compatible for 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.790
 Me, I do not have to buy one. 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.140
 second time 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.720
 It's not the same if you have a game to play. 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.970
 playstation 4 you want to play on pc has 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.430
 To Buy The Extinction Games Again 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.680
 yes compatible on any platform 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.419
 either mac or pc 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.060
 sometimes has the different version of the 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:53.290
 download right but if you already bought one 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.510
 game for the steam to pc and it is 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.169
 compatible with mac automatically you 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:03.210
 has the camec version too but I still 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:06.610
 I recommend windows for games and 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.540
 honestly i still think windows 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.370
 7 is very good even games that use the 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.349
 games for windows live 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.000
 We are having a very hard job. 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.740
 great with these games to power 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.460
 adapt and rotate to neighbors 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.440
 the zoe some failures in this activation 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.139
 okay then like this 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.990
 particularly I think windows 7 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.199
 still responds very well 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.220
 I believe that direct x 12 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:40.400
 will only be compatible with windows 95 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.750
 so it turns out that windows 8 was only with 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:48.050
 versions 11.1.2 is not believing 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.139
 I can obviously say that more 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.590
 date that microsoft promises direct x 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:58.069
 dollars and the date it promises windows 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:00.050
 9 very similar I think it will be 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:02.780
 married one thing to the other 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.659
 clear to her it is interesting attract 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:08.150
 these players to this market of 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.949
 same way I could have launched the 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:16.099
 direct x 11.11 point 2 for windows 7 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:21.830
 she did not leave something exclusive of the 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:25.400
 windows 8 but these features have not yet 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:28.419
 make it worth your while to leave the set and 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.419
 jump with eight 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.409
 a big hug
