00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.300 
if he can if he can keep his distance
and<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:57.500> think<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.620> he<00:01:58.680> comes<00:01:58.830> into<00:01:58.980> this<00:01:59.070> fight

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and I think if he comes into this fight

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.010 
and I think if he comes into this fight
is<00:01:59.490> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.850> phase<00:02:00.030> confident<00:02:00.510> in<00:02:00.570> his<00:02:00.660> yes<00:02:00.870> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is kind of phase confident in his yes in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.140 
is kind of phase confident in his yes in
the<00:02:01.080> past<00:02:01.290> couple<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.920> think<00:02:02.490> veter<00:02:02.730> away<00:02:02.940> nice

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
the past couple I think veter away nice

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.240
