like<00:03:32.410> especially<00:03:32.680> if<00:03:32.890> it's<00:03:33.040> just<00:03:33.280> documents

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
like especially if it's just documents

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.120 
like especially if it's just documents
so<00:03:34.030> i<00:03:34.299> recommend<00:03:35.260> doing<00:03:35.470> this<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:35.950> then

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
so i recommend doing this and then

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.789 
so i recommend doing this and then
backing<00:03:36.400> up<00:03:36.760> at<00:03:37.600> least<00:03:37.870> once<00:03:38.109> a<00:03:38.410> month<00:03:38.440> if

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
backing up at least once a month if

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:39.990 
backing up at least once a month if
