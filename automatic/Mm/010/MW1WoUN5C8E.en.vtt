new weapons new armor new outfit so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.900 
new weapons new armor new outfit so
basically<00:00:38.670> customize<00:00:39.480> your<00:00:39.629> character<00:00:40.910> here

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
basically customize your character here

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.459 
basically customize your character here
we<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.120> Jose<00:00:42.450> using<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> weapons

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
we have Jose using one of the weapons

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
we have Jose using one of the weapons
have<00:00:43.770> been<00:00:43.800> fully<00:00:44.070> customized<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.300> as

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.560 

so<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.610> gameplay<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.180> that<00:00:52.390> you<00:00:52.450> know

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
so the gameplay is that you know

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.720 
so the gameplay is that you know
definitely<00:00:52.870> fast<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:53.530> fluid<00:00:53.830> you<00:00:54.070> know<00:00:54.190> we're

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
definitely fast and fluid you know we're

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.850 
definitely fast and fluid you know we're
making<00:00:55.000> sure<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.810> game<00:00:55.990> was<00:00:56.140> tuned<00:00:56.440> for

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
making sure that the game was tuned for

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.420 
making sure that the game was tuned for
5<00:00:57.430> vs.<00:00:57.760> 5<00:00:57.790> gameplay<00:00:58.270> or<00:00:58.870> 8<00:00:59.500> verses<00:00:59.950> 8<00:01:00.070> however

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
5 vs. 5 gameplay or 8 verses 8 however

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.610 
5 vs. 5 gameplay or 8 verses 8 however
each<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.120> maps<00:01:01.330> support<00:01:01.840> up<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.230> 20

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
each of the maps support up to 20

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.500 
each of the maps support up to 20
players<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.220> if<00:01:03.430> need<00:01:03.670> be<00:01:03.700> you<00:01:04.120> can't<00:01:04.390> be

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
players so if need be you can't be

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.740 
players so if need be you can't be
playing<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.839> game<00:01:05.019> as<00:01:05.710> a<00:01:05.770> 10<00:01:06.310> vs<00:01:06.640> 10<00:01:06.750> team

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
playing the game as a 10 vs 10 team

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.650 
playing the game as a 10 vs 10 team
match<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.320> interesting<00:01:12.660> concepts

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
match one of the interesting concepts

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660 
match one of the interesting concepts
with<00:01:13.930> bullet<00:01:14.229> run<00:01:14.410> is<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:15.100> fact<00:01:15.369> that<00:01:15.460> we've

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
with bullet run is the fact that we've

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.430 
with bullet run is the fact that we've
introduced<00:01:16.090> abilities<00:01:16.540> into<00:01:16.780> the<00:01:16.869> games<00:01:17.050> you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
introduced abilities into the games you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.600 
introduced abilities into the games you
know<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.770> different<00:01:17.920> abilities<00:01:18.160> such

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
know you have different abilities such

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.060 
know you have different abilities such
as<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.880> neural<00:01:19.119> Fang<00:01:19.300> which<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:19.660> this<00:01:20.040> sort<00:01:21.040> of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
as the neural Fang which is this sort of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.400 
as the neural Fang which is this sort of
like<00:01:21.130> this<00:01:21.690> technological<00:01:22.690> spider<00:01:23.080> that<00:01:23.290> can

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
like this technological spider that can

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.830 
like this technological spider that can
run<00:01:23.590> around<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.270> capture<00:01:25.270> other<00:01:25.450> players

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
run around and capture other players

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.380 
run around and capture other players
that<00:01:26.140> allow<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.070> come<00:01:27.310> up<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:27.729> shoot<00:01:28.270> them

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
that allow you to come up and shoot them

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.670 
that allow you to come up and shoot them
while<00:01:28.600> they're<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.170> know<00:01:29.200> rooted<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.649> the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
while they're you know rooted to the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.480 
while they're you know rooted to the
spot<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.990> here<00:01:32.740> is<00:01:32.830> actually<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.250> neural

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
spot and here is actually the neural

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.050 
spot and here is actually the neural
Fang<00:01:33.670> right<00:01:33.970> now

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.310 

so<00:01:43.060> what<00:01:43.210> who<00:01:43.300> was<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.510> CIA<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.930> basically

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
so what who was a CIA is basically

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.010 
so what who was a CIA is basically
running<00:01:44.530> around<00:01:44.860> trying<00:01:45.430> to<00:01:45.610> find<00:01:45.880> one<00:01:46.870> of<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
running around trying to find one of the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.250 
running around trying to find one of the
enemy<00:01:47.320> players<00:01:47.650> that<00:01:48.220> he<00:01:48.520> can<00:01:48.700> ensnare<00:01:49.260> and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
enemy players that he can ensnare and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.170 
enemy players that he can ensnare and
here<00:01:50.380> we<00:01:50.410> go<00:01:50.530> here's<00:01:50.830> one<00:01:51.040> guy<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:51.850> can<00:01:52.000> get

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
here we go here's one guy so you can get

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.440 
here we go here's one guy so you can get
him<00:01:52.300> there<00:01:53.020> we<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:53.640> now<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.940> hoes<00:01:55.120> it<00:01:55.210> has<00:01:55.330> to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
him there we go now what hoes it has to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.030 
him there we go now what hoes it has to
do<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.630> basically<00:01:55.810> run<00:01:56.170> over<00:01:56.410> there<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.620> get

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
do is basically run over there and get

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.670 
do is basically run over there and get
them<00:01:57.160> before<00:01:57.670> either<00:01:58.150> he's<00:01:58.750> released<00:01:59.110> or<00:01:59.380> one

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
them before either he's released or one

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.970 
them before either he's released or one
of<00:01:59.710> his<00:01:59.890> teammates<00:02:00.100> gets<00:02:00.520> him<00:02:00.670> instead<00:02:00.970> oh<00:02:01.980> and

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
of his teammates gets him instead oh and

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.630 
of his teammates gets him instead oh and
instead<00:02:03.520> he<00:02:03.910> was<00:02:04.120> capped<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.310> one<00:02:06.460> of<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
instead he was capped so one of the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.090 
instead he was capped so one of the
interesting<00:02:06.820> things<00:02:07.210> about<00:02:07.800> bullet<00:02:08.800> run<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
interesting things about bullet run is
