last<00:00:05.490> week<00:00:05.640> on<00:00:05.790> mckinney<00:00:06.120> all<00:00:06.450> right<00:00:07.130> all

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
last week on mckinney all right all

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.650 
last week on mckinney all right all
right<00:00:08.160> now<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:08.700> reminder<00:00:08.970> you<00:00:09.480> should

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
right now as a reminder you should

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.600 
right now as a reminder you should
usually<00:00:09.840> not<00:00:10.139> draw<00:00:10.410> this<00:00:10.590> all<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.429> need<00:00:11.580> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
usually not draw this all we need is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.100 
usually not draw this all we need is
these<00:00:11.880> two<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.269> I<00:00:12.330> think<00:00:12.389> these<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.660> simpler

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
these two it I think these are simpler

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.470 
these two it I think these are simpler
you<00:00:13.290> should<00:00:13.440> usually<00:00:13.590> just<00:00:13.950> draw<00:00:14.330> parallel<00:00:15.330> to

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
you should usually just draw parallel to

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
you should usually just draw parallel to
the<00:00:15.570> axis<00:00:15.960> into<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.410> center<00:00:16.710> where<00:00:17.070> they<00:00:17.190> went

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the axis into the center where they went

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.109 
the axis into the center where they went
through<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.609> because<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.910> might<00:00:18.029> be

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
through this because you might be

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
through this because you might be
testimony<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.720> directly<00:00:19.080> if<00:00:19.289> you're<00:00:19.740> tested

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
testimony of directly if you're tested

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.410 
testimony of directly if you're tested
dog<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.369> directly<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.939> need<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.150> know<00:00:21.270> what

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
dog is directly you need to know what

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.849 
dog is directly you need to know what
happens<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> light<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.109> goes<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> focal

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
happens to light that goes to the focal

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.640 
happens to light that goes to the focal
point<00:00:23.449> but<00:00:24.449> otherwise<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.810> Louise<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.410> rates

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
point but otherwise I Louise to my rates

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:35.700 
point but otherwise I Louise to my rates
are<00:00:25.769> easier<00:00:26.099> okay

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:51.010 

so<00:00:36.309> here<00:00:36.460> we<00:00:36.550> have<00:00:36.610> a<00:00:36.730> mirror

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.200 

here<00:00:51.620> we<00:00:51.710> have<00:00:51.830> a<00:00:51.860> bowl<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.580> obviously<00:00:53.060> the

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
here we have a bowl and obviously the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.430 
here we have a bowl and obviously the
bulb<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.510> going<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:53.750> be<00:00:53.810> shooting<00:00:53.960> out<00:00:54.230> light

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
bulb is going to be shooting out light

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.680 
bulb is going to be shooting out light
rates<00:00:54.650> the<00:00:55.370> bulb<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.910> going<00:00:56.240> to<00:00:56.360> be<00:00:56.450> shooting

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
rates the bulb is going to be shooting

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:09.890 
rates the bulb is going to be shooting
out<00:00:56.990> light<00:00:57.230> rays

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.160 

I'm<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.560> bold<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.010> dot<00:01:11.870> so<00:01:12.870> here's<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
I'm going bold as a dot so here's the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.910 
I'm going bold as a dot so here's the
bulb<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.320> what's<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.470> happen<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
bulb and what's going to happen to the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.020 
bulb and what's going to happen to the
light<00:01:17.070> rays<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:17.610> they're<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.910> bounce

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
light rays where they're going to bounce

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.850 
light rays where they're going to bounce
off<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.770> here<00:01:21.860> now

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
off of here and then go out here now

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250 
off of here and then go out here now
let's<00:01:23.220> say<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.580> want<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> mirror<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:25.080> produce

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
let's say we want the mirror to produce

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.370 
let's say we want the mirror to produce
all<00:01:25.680> parallel<00:01:26.640> outgoing<00:01:27.360> light<00:01:27.540> rays<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
all parallel outgoing light rays you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:40.880 
all parallel outgoing light rays you
want<00:01:30.350> all<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> outgoing<00:01:35.570> light<00:01:36.570> rays<00:01:39.890> be

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
want all the outgoing light rays be

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
want all the outgoing light rays be
parallel<00:01:44.210> where<00:01:45.210> should<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.479> put<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.750> bolt<00:01:54.140> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
parallel where should we put the bolt so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.719 
parallel where should we put the bolt so
why<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.590> start<00:01:55.860> by<00:01:55.979> drawing<00:01:56.400> what

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
why don't you start by drawing what

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.250 
why don't you start by drawing what
would<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.940> light<00:01:57.090> rays<00:01:57.300> look<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.050> if

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
would the light rays look like here if

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.870 
would the light rays look like here if
all<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> outgoing<00:01:58.830> light<00:01:59.250> rays<00:01:59.490> would<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.729> be

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
all the outgoing light rays would you be

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.750 
all the outgoing light rays would you be
parallel<00:02:00.360> travel<00:02:01.229> through<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.410> picture<00:02:01.830> what

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
parallel travel through the picture what

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.040 
parallel travel through the picture what
would<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.940> light<00:02:03.090> guys<00:02:03.300> look<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.510> all<00:02:03.900> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
would the light guys look like all the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.750 
would the light guys look like all the
outgoing<00:02:04.200> light<00:02:04.650> ladies<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.070> parallel<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
outgoing light ladies are parallel so

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.270 
outgoing light ladies are parallel so
draw<00:02:06.270> say<00:02:06.900> dodge<00:02:07.200> incoming<00:02:07.440> light<00:02:07.830> gray<00:02:08.040> and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
draw say dodge incoming light gray and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.949 
draw say dodge incoming light gray and
the<00:02:08.310> outgoing<00:02:08.790> light<00:02:09.030> gray<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.780> should

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the outgoing light gray and then should

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:23.390 
the outgoing light gray and then should
have<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.260> go<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.380> my<00:02:13.500> frame

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.059 

okay<00:02:24.120> now<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.439> light<00:02:25.620> ray<00:02:25.799> came

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
okay now actually if the light ray came

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.149 
okay now actually if the light ray came
in<00:02:26.340> along<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.730> axis<00:02:27.239> we<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.629> bounced<00:02:27.840> off

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
in along the axis we just bounced off

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.319 
in along the axis we just bounced off
straight<00:02:29.159> over<00:02:29.549> there<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.030> why<00:02:30.120> don't<00:02:30.180> we

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
straight over there but why don't we

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.360 
straight over there but why don't we
draw<00:02:33.439> so<00:02:34.439> let's<00:02:34.799> say<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.950> could<00:02:35.189> draw<00:02:35.340> like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
draw so let's say we could draw like

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.479 
draw so let's say we could draw like
this<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:38.310> would<00:02:38.459> be<00:02:38.489> say<00:02:39.200> incoming<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.590> then

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
this this would be say incoming and then

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.309 
this this would be say incoming and then
light<00:02:41.670> rays<00:02:41.849> would<00:02:42.060> bounce<00:02:42.629> off<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.140> and

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
light rays would bounce off of it and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.509 
light rays would bounce off of it and
this<00:02:43.409> is<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> hard<00:02:43.739> question<00:02:43.859> video<00:02:44.220> games<00:02:44.400> come

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
this is a hard question video games come

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.240 
this is a hard question video games come
up<00:02:44.670> with<00:02:44.819> this<00:02:44.909> how<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:45.959> possible<00:02:46.500> so<00:02:46.890> for

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
up with this how is it possible so for

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.440 
up with this how is it possible so for
all<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.519> outputting<00:02:47.909> light<00:02:48.060> ways<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.359> be

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
all the outputting light ways to be

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.410 
all the outputting light ways to be
parallel<00:02:48.870> well<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.700> only<00:02:50.819> way<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.299> the

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
parallel well the only way that all the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.500 
parallel well the only way that all the
outgoing<00:02:51.569> light<00:02:51.900> waves<00:02:52.109> can<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.260> parallel<00:02:53.510> is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
outgoing light waves can be parallel is

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.530 
outgoing light waves can be parallel is
if<00:02:54.689> they're<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:54.930> horizontal<00:02:56.209> if<00:02:57.209> they're<00:02:57.420> all

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
if they're all horizontal if they're all

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.940 
if they're all horizontal if they're all
parallel<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.079> this<00:02:58.200> axis

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.190 

well<00:03:04.550> what<00:03:04.730> does<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.940> take<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.450> get<00:03:05.660> an<00:03:05.810> optimal

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
well what does it take to get an optimal

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.220 
well what does it take to get an optimal
I<00:03:06.379> trade<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:07.360> parallel<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.569> axis<00:03:08.959> where

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
I trade to be parallel to the axis where

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.470 
I trade to be parallel to the axis where
should<00:03:09.379> be<00:03:09.500> hidden<00:03:09.709> going<00:03:09.920> light<00:03:10.099> gray<00:03:10.480> what

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
should be hidden going light gray what

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.729 
should be hidden going light gray what
type<00:03:11.629> of<00:03:11.660> in<00:03:11.840> going<00:03:12.050> lightweight<00:03:12.379> do<00:03:12.500> we<00:03:12.590> need

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
type of in going lightweight do we need

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.680 
type of in going lightweight do we need
to<00:03:12.980> be<00:03:13.190> outgoing<00:03:13.430> light<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.910> be<00:03:14.060> parallel<00:03:14.599> to

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
to be outgoing light to be parallel to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.290 
to be outgoing light to be parallel to
the<00:03:14.780> axis<00:03:17.980> exactly<00:03:18.980> which<00:03:19.160> angle<00:03:19.610> would<00:03:20.060> so

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the axis exactly which angle would so

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.550 
the axis exactly which angle would so
think<00:03:20.599> about<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.840> different<00:03:21.110> types<00:03:21.230> of<00:03:21.380> light

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
think about the different types of light

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.199 
think about the different types of light
rays<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:21.950> we<00:03:22.099> have<00:03:22.280> we've<00:03:22.489> got<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.790> pee<00:03:23.000> that

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
rays that we have we've got to pee that

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.170 
rays that we have we've got to pee that
ever<00:03:23.360> met<00:03:24.040> yeah<00:03:25.040> we<00:03:25.400> know<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.730> f<00:03:25.880> ray<00:03:26.120> to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
ever met yeah we know that the f ray to

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.670 
ever met yeah we know that the f ray to
the<00:03:26.360> focal<00:03:26.780> point<00:03:26.810> always<00:03:27.349> comes<00:03:27.560> out

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
the focal point always comes out

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.059 
the focal point always comes out
parallel<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> axis<00:03:28.760> so<00:03:29.300> we<00:03:30.230> want<00:03:30.500> all<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
parallel to the axis so we want all the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:32.650 
parallel to the axis so we want all the
light<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.489> this<00:03:31.610> bowl<00:03:31.849> to<00:03:32.269> go<00:03:32.420> through<00:03:32.569> the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
light in this bowl to go through the

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.050 
light in this bowl to go through the
focal<00:03:32.930> point<00:03:32.959> if<00:03:33.519> all<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:34.670> light<00:03:34.819> from<00:03:34.910> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
focal point if all the light from the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.360 
focal point if all the light from the
bulb<00:03:35.269> came<00:03:35.989> into<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.500> focal<00:03:36.799> point<00:03:36.830> it<00:03:37.250> would

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
bulb came into the focal point it would

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.850 
bulb came into the focal point it would
go<00:03:37.489> out<00:03:37.610> parallel<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.239> axis<00:03:38.599> but<00:03:39.349> how<00:03:39.799> did

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
go out parallel to the axis but how did

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.800 
go out parallel to the axis but how did
we<00:03:40.040> get<00:03:40.190> all<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.610> length<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.000> ball<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.660> go

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
we get all the length in the ball to go

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.240 
we get all the length in the ball to go
through<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.049> focal<00:03:42.349> point<00:03:42.380> usually<00:03:42.739> only

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
through the focal point usually only

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.470 
through the focal point usually only
some<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.579> the<00:03:43.700> light<00:03:43.819> goes<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.209> focal

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
some of the light goes to the focal

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.759 
some of the light goes to the focal
point<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.750> all<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.959> pictures<00:03:45.230> we've<00:03:45.380> seen<00:03:45.560> so

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
point and all the pictures we've seen so

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.890 
point and all the pictures we've seen so
far<00:03:45.910> just<00:03:46.910> one<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.299> Rays<00:03:47.450> length<00:03:47.720> of<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
far just one of the Rays length of the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.710 
far just one of the Rays length of the
focal<00:03:48.170> points<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:49.040> only<00:03:49.459> way<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.670> get<00:03:50.120> all<00:03:50.329> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
focal points the only way to get all the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.839 
focal points the only way to get all the
lights<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.380> go<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.709> focal<00:03:52.010> point<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.459> to

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
lights to go to the focal point is to

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.710 
lights to go to the focal point is to
put<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.269> bowl<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.690> focal<00:03:54.410> point<00:03:54.790> if<00:03:55.790> you

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
put the bowl on the focal point if you

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.150 
put the bowl on the focal point if you
actually<00:03:56.840> put<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.410> bulb<00:03:57.590> on<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.769> focal<00:03:58.130> point

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
actually put the bulb on the focal point

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.430 
actually put the bulb on the focal point
then<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:59.030> light<00:03:59.239> as<00:03:59.450> automatically<00:04:00.110> coming

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
then the light as automatically coming

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.809 
then the light as automatically coming
from<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.620> focal<00:04:00.920> point<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.280> if<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.489> is<00:04:01.640> F

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
from the focal point so if this is F

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.910 
from the focal point so if this is F
over<00:04:02.120> here<00:04:02.360> all<00:04:02.599> of<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.170> incoming<00:04:03.500> light<00:04:03.709> rays

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
over here all of the incoming light rays

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.530 
over here all of the incoming light rays
are<00:04:04.190> coming<00:04:04.310> through<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.700> focal<00:04:05.000> point<00:04:05.030> so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
are coming through the focal point so

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.910 
are coming through the focal point so
now<00:04:07.540> they<00:04:08.540> all<00:04:08.690> bounced<00:04:08.959> off<00:04:09.200> parallel<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.799> the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
now they all bounced off parallel to the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.530 
now they all bounced off parallel to the
axis<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.459> doesn't<00:04:10.700> matter<00:04:10.760> they're<00:04:11.150> coming<00:04:11.389> in

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
axis it doesn't matter they're coming in

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.710 
axis it doesn't matter they're coming in
I<00:04:15.280> have<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> steep<00:04:16.609> angle<00:04:16.820> or<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> shallow<00:04:17.450> angle

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
I have a steep angle or a shallow angle

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.659 
I have a steep angle or a shallow angle
because<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.620> bulb<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.919> actually<00:04:19.310> at<00:04:19.459> the

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
because the bulb is actually at the

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.729 
because the bulb is actually at the
focal<00:04:20.000> point<00:04:20.030> all<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.810> light<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.079> produces<00:04:21.560> is

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
focal point all the light it produces is

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.180 
focal point all the light it produces is
coming<00:04:22.160> through<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.520> focal<00:04:22.820> point<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:24.190> so

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
coming through the focal point and so

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.620 
coming through the focal point and so
all<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.490> ways<00:04:25.639> come<00:04:25.880> out<00:04:26.030> parallel<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
all the ways come out parallel to the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.879 
all the ways come out parallel to the
axis<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.950> was<00:04:28.070> pretty<00:04:28.250> tough<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:29.389> right<00:04:29.889> but

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
axis that was pretty tough all right but

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.040 
axis that was pretty tough all right but
again<00:04:31.460> these<00:04:32.030> are<00:04:32.090> kind<00:04:32.389> of<00:04:32.419> more<00:04:32.600> typical<00:04:32.990> of

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
again these are kind of more typical of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.629 
again these are kind of more typical of
the<00:04:33.200> exam<00:04:33.470> type<00:04:33.710> questions<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.460> then<00:04:34.580> you

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
the exam type questions and then you

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.860 
the exam type questions and then you
might<00:04:34.820> see<00:04:35.060> they're<00:04:35.240> not<00:04:35.419> just<00:04:35.570> going<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.780> be

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
might see they're not just going to be

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.510 
might see they're not just going to be
plugging<00:04:36.139> shut<00:04:36.440> with<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.680> lens<00:04:37.280> mirror

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
plugging shut with the lens mirror

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.519 
plugging shut with the lens mirror
equation<00:04:38.030> all<00:04:38.630> right<00:04:38.750> that's<00:04:38.870> kind<00:04:39.169> of

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:39.529 
equation all right that's kind of

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.799 
equation all right that's kind of
application<00:04:40.129> but<00:04:40.249> anyway<00:04:40.549> again<00:04:40.789> we<00:04:40.909> saw<00:04:41.089> and

00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:41.809 
application but anyway again we saw and

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.449 
application but anyway again we saw and
remembered<00:04:41.959> again<00:04:42.319> one<00:04:42.529> more<00:04:42.619> time<00:04:42.679> most

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:43.459 
remembered again one more time most

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:44.799 
remembered again one more time most
problems<00:04:43.849> we<00:04:43.939> don't<00:04:44.089> bother<00:04:44.269> drawing<00:04:44.629> the

00:04:44.799 --> 00:04:44.809 
problems we don't bother drawing the

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:46.299 
problems we don't bother drawing the
separate<00:04:45.259> no<00:04:45.499> bother<00:04:45.709> drawing<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.129> rate<00:04:46.279> of

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:46.309 
separate no bother drawing the rate of

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.889 
separate no bother drawing the rate of
the<00:04:46.489> focal<00:04:46.789> point<00:04:46.849> but<00:04:47.269> we<00:04:47.359> need<00:04:47.539> that<00:04:47.689> for

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:47.899 
the focal point but we need that for

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:49.089 
the focal point but we need that for
some<00:04:48.049> problems<00:04:48.409> when<00:04:48.529> the<00:04:48.649> problems<00:04:48.979> caused

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
some problems when the problems caused

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.979 
some problems when the problems caused
it<00:04:49.219> to<00:04:49.279> be<00:04:49.399> focusing<00:04:49.849> on<00:04:49.969> that<00:04:50.149> usually<00:04:50.929> you

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:50.989 
it to be focusing on that usually you

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:52.659 
it to be focusing on that usually you
should<00:04:51.139> draw<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.349> P<00:04:51.559> in<00:04:51.679> the<00:04:51.769> embrace<00:04:52.099> pero<00:04:52.609> a

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
should draw the P in the embrace pero a

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.309 
should draw the P in the embrace pero a
lot<00:04:52.819> of<00:04:52.939> the<00:04:52.999> axis<00:04:53.419> that<00:04:53.629> goes<00:04:53.689> out<00:04:54.079> through

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:54.319 
lot of the axis that goes out through

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.749 
lot of the axis that goes out through
the<00:04:54.439> focal<00:04:54.739> point<00:04:54.949> and<00:04:55.129> through<00:04:55.459> the<00:04:55.579> best

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
the focal point and through the best

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.899 
the focal point and through the best
center<00:04:55.969> of<00:04:56.059> the<00:04:56.149> mirror<00:04:56.359> okay<00:04:57.759> there<00:04:58.759> we<00:04:58.789> go

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
center of the mirror okay there we go

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.439 
center of the mirror okay there we go
guess<00:04:59.599> we're<00:04:59.719> at<00:04:59.779> a<00:04:59.809> time<00:05:00.999> you<00:05:01.999> might<00:05:02.299> want<00:05:02.419> to

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
guess we're at a time you might want to

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.029 
guess we're at a time you might want to
try<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.599> review<00:05:02.929> and<00:05:03.259> over<00:05:03.439> so<00:05:03.589> you<00:05:03.649> have<00:05:03.859> some

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
try to review and over so you have some

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:05.769 
try to review and over so you have some
time<00:05:04.159> to<00:05:04.309> really<00:05:04.459> go<00:05:04.669> over<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:05.269> optics<00:05:05.629> I

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:05.779 
time to really go over the optics I

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:06.879 
time to really go over the optics I
think<00:05:05.929> we<00:05:05.989> need<00:05:06.109> some<00:05:06.199> pretty<00:05:06.289> hard<00:05:06.529> problems

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
think we need some pretty hard problems

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.709 
think we need some pretty hard problems
but<00:05:07.429> again<00:05:07.669> they're<00:05:07.999> typical<00:05:08.359> of<00:05:08.449> exam

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
but again they're typical of exam

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.359 
but again they're typical of exam
problems<00:05:09.079> that's<00:05:09.229> good<00:05:09.469> a<00:05:09.709> lot<00:05:10.039> of<00:05:10.069> the<00:05:10.189> time

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:10.369 
problems that's good a lot of the time

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:12.039 
problems that's good a lot of the time
when<00:05:10.699> I'm<00:05:10.789> working<00:05:10.909> with<00:05:11.059> students<00:05:11.479> we<00:05:11.959> don't

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:12.049 
when I'm working with students we don't

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:13.839 
when I'm working with students we don't
get<00:05:12.199> time<00:05:12.379> to<00:05:12.409> do<00:05:12.619> the<00:05:12.739> realistic<00:05:13.279> problems<00:05:13.489> on

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
get time to do the realistic problems on

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:15.129 
get time to do the realistic problems on
the<00:05:13.969> ends<00:05:14.209> and<00:05:14.329> realistic<00:05:14.569> problems<00:05:14.869> today

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
the ends and realistic problems today

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.639 
the ends and realistic problems today
okay<00:05:15.649> good<00:05:15.979> thank<00:05:16.489> you
