it<00:01:59.330> stock<00:01:59.600> see<00:01:59.960> if<00:02:00.050> I<00:02:00.110> had<00:02:00.260> any<00:02:00.500> more<00:02:00.680> issues

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
it stock see if I had any more issues

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.070 
it stock see if I had any more issues
with<00:02:01.220> it<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.910> on<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.270> forth<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:02.720> there<00:02:02.990> was

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
with it so on and so forth and there was

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.110 
with it so on and so forth and there was
nothing<00:02:03.410> it<00:02:03.560> continued<00:02:04.190> to<00:02:04.310> work<00:02:04.460> perfectly

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
nothing it continued to work perfectly

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.559 
nothing it continued to work perfectly
the<00:02:05.390> rest<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.140> Monday<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:06.710> all<00:02:07.010> day<00:02:07.220> Tuesday

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
the rest of Monday and all day Tuesday

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.630 
the rest of Monday and all day Tuesday
Wednesday<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.869> went<00:02:09.170> ahead<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.440> retail<00:02:10.280> broken

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
Wednesday I went ahead and retail broken

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.590 
Wednesday I went ahead and retail broken
on<00:02:10.819> 4.3.3<00:02:11.750> using<00:02:12.740> red<00:02:12.920> snow<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:14.270> figured<00:02:14.540> I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
on 4.3.3 using red snow and I figured I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.850 
on 4.3.3 using red snow and I figured I
would<00:02:14.720> rock<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.200> way<00:02:15.380> for<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.620> day<00:02:15.710> or<00:02:15.830> two

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
would rock it that way for a day or two

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.630 
would rock it that way for a day or two
see<00:02:16.190> if<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> had

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
see if I had

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.730 
see if I had
more<00:02:16.760> problems<00:02:17.210> before<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.960> did<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.620> video

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
more problems before I did this video

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.590 
more problems before I did this video
and<00:02:19.220> let<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.640> guys<00:02:19.819> knew<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.060> was<00:02:20.270> going<00:02:20.510> on

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
and let you guys knew what was going on

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.340 
and let you guys knew what was going on
so<00:02:21.640> sure<00:02:22.640> enough<00:02:22.790> last<00:02:23.750> night<00:02:23.900> rolls<00:02:24.260> around

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
so sure enough last night rolls around

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.260 
so sure enough last night rolls around
Thursday<00:02:25.040> night<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.370> rocket<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.790> Wednesday

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
Thursday night of rocket of Wednesday

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.230 
Thursday night of rocket of Wednesday
into<00:02:26.959> Thursday<00:02:27.170> Thursday<00:02:27.950> late<00:02:28.670> afternoon

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
into Thursday Thursday late afternoon

into Thursday Thursday late afternoon
ish<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:31.100> know<00:02:31.190> would<00:02:31.459> messing<00:02:31.730> around<00:02:31.819> at

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
ish I you know would messing around at

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.640 
ish I you know would messing around at
trying<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.569> little<00:02:32.720> bit<00:02:32.840> again<00:02:33.020> I<00:02:33.260> don't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
trying it a little bit again I don't

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.680 
trying it a little bit again I don't
actually<00:02:33.890> make<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.430> lot<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.700> phone<00:02:34.970> calls<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:35.510> my

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
actually make a lot of phone calls on my

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.330 
actually make a lot of phone calls on my
phone<00:02:35.870> but<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.380> was<00:02:36.500> testing<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.950> once<00:02:37.160> in<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
phone but I was testing it once in a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.710 
phone but I was testing it once in a
while<00:02:37.550> just<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.209> see<00:02:38.360> if<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:38.510> was<00:02:38.630> still

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
while just to see if it was still

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.340 
while just to see if it was still
working

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
working

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.410 
working
and<00:02:39.650> sure<00:02:39.860> enough<00:02:39.890> Thursday<00:02:40.580> again<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and sure enough Thursday again it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.199 
and sure enough Thursday again it
stopped<00:02:41.900> working<00:02:42.280> Thursday<00:02:43.280> afternoon<00:02:43.880> ish

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
stopped working Thursday afternoon ish

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.170 
stopped working Thursday afternoon ish
so<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.230> went<00:02:45.620> ahead<00:02:45.739> restored<00:02:46.489> my<00:02:46.670> phone<00:02:46.910> last

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
so I went ahead restored my phone last

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.060 
so I went ahead restored my phone last
night<00:02:47.390> again<00:02:48.020> back<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.860> stock<00:02:49.480> 4.3.3<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:51.070> go

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
night again back to stock 4.3.3 and go

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.770 
night again back to stock 4.3.3 and go
ahead<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.580> show<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.850> guys<00:02:53.120> here<00:02:53.330> that<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.660> is

ahead and show you guys here that it is

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.070 
ahead and show you guys here that it is
in<00:02:53.930> fact<00:02:54.110> working<00:02:54.730> perfectly<00:02:55.730> once<00:02:56.690> again

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
in fact working perfectly once again

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.640 
in fact working perfectly once again
there<00:02:57.950> we<00:02:58.040> go<00:02:58.160> we're<00:02:58.340> making<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.640> call<00:02:59.560> as<00:03:00.560> you

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
there we go we're making a call as you

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.970 
there we go we're making a call as you
can<00:03:00.769> see<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.130> proximity<00:03:01.310> sensor<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.090> again

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
can see the proximity sensor is again

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.620 
can see the proximity sensor is again
working<00:03:03.980> perfectly<00:03:04.459> so<00:03:04.790> there<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.600> guys

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
working perfectly so there you go guys

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.990 
working perfectly so there you go guys
that<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:06.410> much<00:03:06.590> tells<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.760> right<00:03:07.790> there

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
that pretty much tells you right there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.990 
that pretty much tells you right there
that<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.920> know<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.550> seems<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.820> be<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
that you know there seems to be a

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.009 
that you know there seems to be a
jailbreak<00:03:11.570> bug<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.230> red<00:03:12.890> snow<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:14.540> seems<00:03:14.840> to

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
jailbreak bug in red snow that seems to

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.460 
jailbreak bug in red snow that seems to
affect<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.650> proximity<00:03:16.100> sensor<00:03:16.430> sensitivity

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
affect the proximity sensor sensitivity

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.720 
affect the proximity sensor sensitivity
if<00:03:18.470> you<00:03:18.560> color<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:18.950> screen<00:03:19.190> shield<00:03:19.459> or<00:03:19.580> you're

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
if you color the screen shield or you're

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.220 
if you color the screen shield or you're
not<00:03:19.850> using<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.269> screen<00:03:20.540> shield<00:03:20.750> it<00:03:20.900> seems<00:03:21.110> to

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
not using a screen shield it seems to

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.729 
not using a screen shield it seems to
work<00:03:21.380> perfectly<00:03:23.110> but<00:03:24.110> if<00:03:24.200> you<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.440> screen

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
work perfectly but if you have a screen

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.680 
work perfectly but if you have a screen
shield<00:03:25.010> on<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.459> seems<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.209> reduce<00:03:26.510> the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
shield on it seems to reduce the

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.810 
shield on it seems to reduce the
sensitivity<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.680> proximity<00:03:28.100> sensor<00:03:28.430> on

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
sensitivity of the proximity sensor on

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.190 
sensitivity of the proximity sensor on
at<00:03:29.780> least<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.290> white<00:03:30.500> iPhone<00:03:30.950> 4<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:32.200> makes

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
at least on the white iPhone 4 and makes

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.530 
at least on the white iPhone 4 and makes
it<00:03:33.350> not<00:03:33.530> really<00:03:33.680> work<00:03:33.950> very<00:03:34.190> well<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:35.329> seems

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
it not really work very well so it seems

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.949 
it not really work very well so it seems
to<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:35.690> some<00:03:35.900> sort<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.200> firmware<00:03:36.880> bug<00:03:37.880> there<00:03:38.720> in

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
to be some sort of firmware bug there in

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.860 
to be some sort of firmware bug there in
the<00:03:39.709> jailbreak<00:03:40.130> firmware<00:03:40.670> program<00:03:41.600> or

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
the jailbreak firmware program or

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.500 
the jailbreak firmware program or
software<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:43.130> reduces<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.850> sensitivity<00:03:44.480> of

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
software that reduces the sensitivity of

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.170 
software that reduces the sensitivity of
the<00:03:44.690> proximity<00:03:45.049> sensor<00:03:45.380> with<00:03:45.709> red<00:03:45.920> snow<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:46.850> I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
the proximity sensor with red snow so I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.850 
the proximity sensor with red snow so I
guess<00:03:47.420> I'm<00:03:47.660> gonna<00:03:47.780> be<00:03:47.870> staying<00:03:48.170> stocked<00:03:48.590> guys

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
guess I'm gonna be staying stocked guys

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.410 
guess I'm gonna be staying stocked guys
because<00:03:49.160> I'm<00:03:49.459> not<00:03:49.610> gonna<00:03:49.760> rock<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.090> iPhone

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
because I'm not gonna rock the iPhone

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.750

must-have jailbreak apps which is the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.660 
must-have jailbreak apps which is the
same<00:04:22.850> way<00:04:23.030> I<00:04:23.060> was<00:04:23.390> running<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.039> Sunday

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
same way I was running it on Sunday

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.730 
same way I was running it on Sunday
Monday<00:04:26.210> morning<00:04:26.540> when<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.080> was<00:04:27.320> having<00:04:27.470> trouble

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
Monday morning when I was having trouble

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.430 
Monday morning when I was having trouble
so<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.670> everything<00:04:29.030> was<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.390> same<00:04:29.420> except<00:04:30.170> I

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
so like everything was the same except I

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.580 
so like everything was the same except I
guess<00:04:30.800> some<00:04:31.130> day<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.310> was<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.520> for<00:04:31.730> 2.3<00:04:32.720> or<00:04:32.750> 4.3.2

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
guess some day I was on for 2.3 or 4.3.2

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.670 
guess some day I was on for 2.3 or 4.3.2
and<00:04:34.040> then<00:04:34.610> Monday<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.910> upgraded<00:04:35.330> 4.3.3<00:04:36.140> but

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
and then Monday I upgraded 4.3.3 but

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.900 
and then Monday I upgraded 4.3.3 but
other<00:04:37.280> than<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.670> was<00:04:37.700> the<00:04:37.880> only

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
other than that that was the only

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.870 
other than that that was the only
variable<00:04:38.720> there<00:04:38.900> but<00:04:39.110> again<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.740> did<00:04:40.430> jailbreak

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
variable there but again I did jailbreak

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.610 
variable there but again I did jailbreak
it<00:04:41.000> again<00:04:41.240> on<00:04:41.480> when<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.900> state<00:04:42.110> had<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.320> same

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
it again on when the state had the same

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.330 
it again on when the state had the same
problem<00:04:43.070> on<00:04:43.160> 4.3.3<00:04:44.200> so<00:04:45.200> there<00:04:45.830> you<00:04:45.980> go<00:04:46.160> it

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
problem on 4.3.3 so there you go it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.870 
problem on 4.3.3 so there you go it
seems<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.270> a<00:04:47.540> red<00:04:47.810> snow<00:04:48.080> bug<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:49.490> there

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
seems like it is a red snow bug so there

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.490 
seems like it is a red snow bug so there
you<00:04:49.970> go<00:04:50.090> guys<00:04:50.300> that's<00:04:50.330> my<00:04:50.660> quick<00:04:50.840> update<00:04:51.320> video
