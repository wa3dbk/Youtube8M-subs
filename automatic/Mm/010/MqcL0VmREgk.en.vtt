00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.879
 there is a time in the history of ideas 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.969
 what a series 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.819
 they started thinking 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:13.840
 as a lieutenant 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.019
 because thus the first human beings 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.019
 with your selection 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.170
 tomÃ¡s jobs 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.440
 I imagine them mired in a continuous search for selfish pleasure 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.930
 this takes soon 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.230
 to a state of war of all against all 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.540
 in which men live with no other security than the one they provide their 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.540
 own strength and its own inventiveness 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.350
 in such condition 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.030
 there is no place for industry 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 because the fruit of it is insecure 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.980
 and therefore 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.520
 neither cultivation of the earth 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.480
 nor navigation 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.530
 no use of goods that can be imported for more 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.040
 no comfortable construction 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.130
 instruments to move and remove objects that need a lot of force 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.510
 my knowledge of the face of the earth 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.130
 nor counting time 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.610
 my art 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.090
 no lyrics 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.880
 in society 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.250
 but what is worse than all 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.740
 grandson continues 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 and danger of violent death 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.429
 soon 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:24.359
 reasons of urgency to imagine our ancestors has not given up 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.799
 organized in families and groups 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.799
 therefore its relation to the natural law 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.339
 Algiers 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:42.879
 the sr being the divine creatures equal independent 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.709
 no loses every year was another in his life 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:50.279
 a business 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:51.959
 but whenever someone 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.200
 bankruptcy and that this winter is everyone's responsibility 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 oltra lamented 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:20.179
 its partners its pool image was the original humans as wild crisis 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.479
 associating in order 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.109
 appeasing his set on the first roll 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:30.019
 and allan do the fact at the foot of the same tree that has caused the director 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.059
 she and her needs met 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.059
 between the functions he exercises in his heart 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.019
 Martin 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.649
 of tubes 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.649
 you said of one necessary sex to the other 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.169
 terrible passion that defies all dangers 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.979
 destroy all obstacles 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.019
 more like a boy 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.619
 own to annihilate the human race 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 that not intended to preserve 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.319
 so yes 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.629
 the three authors trust the crisis of what hypothetical situations like 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.989
 those described 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.830
 It makes necessary the restoration of political power in societies 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.830
 human 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.379
 He proposes that it be through a pact through which all people 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.379
 subordinate a ruler who will watch over the common good 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.059
 it is necessary for a man to be ready 

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:45.800
 among others, they are also like him 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.250
 to renounce their right at all costs the pro of peace and self-defense that 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.409
 consider necessary 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:57.239
 and be content with so much freedom with other men as consulting others 

00:04:57.239 --> 00:05:00.239
 men against himself 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.720
 considers that it is best to establish a police force 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.479
 assumes the obligation well 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.839
 joan gestal society constitute 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.629
 wish to be determined if the majority 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.629
 and he said he has restricted 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.240
 russo on the other hand 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.460
 will propose that not just one or even a few who have the 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.439
 power 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.550
 if not the whole community 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.550
 this is achieved through a social contract 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.569
 this type of agreement establishes among citizens such equality 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:46.789
 that all force under the same conditions and should enjoy some 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:47.589
 equal rights
