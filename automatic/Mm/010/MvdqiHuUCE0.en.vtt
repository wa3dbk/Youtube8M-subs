00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
run forever but I mean in my opinion

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.719 
run forever but I mean in my opinion
they<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:16.950> make<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> where<00:01:17.490> every

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
they should make it where every

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.999 
they should make it where every
character<00:01:18.210> has<00:01:18.420> maritime<00:01:19.229> pro<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.650> actually

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
character has maritime pro I actually

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
character has maritime pro I actually
would<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.430> cool<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> but<00:01:21.810> uh<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:22.890> know

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
would be cool with that but uh you know

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
would be cool with that but uh you know
so<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:25.680> from<00:01:26.040> illicit<00:01:26.430> things<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.790> looking

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so I is from illicit things it's looking

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
so I is from illicit things it's looking
like<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.990> get<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> stream

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
like all you get is a stream

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.810 
like all you get is a stream
conditioning<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.250> know<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> could<00:01:29.610> probably

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
conditioning you know you could probably

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
conditioning you know you could probably

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
maybe I'll run that I mean not to be

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
maybe I'll run that I mean not to be
cool<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.650> pick<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.070> perks<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
cool and you could pick for perks so you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.880 
cool and you could pick for perks so you
