00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
actually need to be an electric car that

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.630 
actually need to be an electric car that
there's<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.840> fuel<00:00:28.560> meter<00:00:29.279> or

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
there's going to be a fuel meter or

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
there's going to be a fuel meter or
natural<00:00:30.449> vehicles<00:00:31.579> which<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.910> gonna<00:00:33.300> say<00:00:33.630> or

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
natural vehicles which I'm gonna say or

natural vehicles which I'm gonna say or
I<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.460> think<00:00:35.520> will<00:00:35.940> happen<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.570> all

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
I do not think will happen at all

I never played about mafia 2 I believe
at<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.610> flopped<00:00:56.610> I've

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
at it and it just kind of flopped I've

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.590 
at it and it just kind of flopped I've
played<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.649> vice<00:00:59.579> city<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> mod<00:01:00.329> ones

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
played it on vice city on a mod ones

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.959 
played it on vice city on a mod ones
where<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> feel<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> works<00:01:02.609> bought

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
where I feel which kind of works bought

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.649 
where I feel which kind of works bought
it<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.899> takes<00:01:04.350> too<00:01:04.559> long<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.830> worm<00:01:05.420> top<00:01:06.420> back

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
it just takes too long to worm top back

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.670 
it just takes too long to worm top back
up<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> hill<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.210> pointless<00:01:09.750> having<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
up the hill so pointless having it in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.359 
up the hill so pointless having it in
there<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.979> whole<00:01:14.189> point

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
there but what I think the whole point

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.100 
there but what I think the whole point
of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> oven<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.970> electric<00:01:15.420> car<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of the oven the electric car is is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.160 
of the oven the electric car is is
because<00:01:16.920> as<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> may<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:19.909> electric<00:01:20.909> cars

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
because as you may know electric cars

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.210 
because as you may know electric cars
have<00:01:22.170> no<00:01:22.200> noise<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> engine<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:26.090> basically

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
have no noise so the engine so basically

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.179 
have no noise so the engine so basically
when<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> buy<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.549> electric<00:01:29.729> car<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:31.189> you

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
when you buy an electric car if you

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.460 
when you buy an electric car if you
choose<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.850> no<00:01:33.090> engine<00:01:33.479> noise<00:01:33.630> ill<00:01:34.229> just

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
choose to have no engine noise ill just

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.880 
choose to have no engine noise ill just
run<00:01:34.680> silent<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.140> usually<00:01:37.380> get<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
run silent but then you usually get like

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.530 
run silent but then you usually get like
a<00:01:37.950> program<00:01:38.579> set<00:01:38.850> about<00:01:39.090> three<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.450> four

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
a program set about three or four

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.200 
a program set about three or four
engines<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.040> there's<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> brand<00:01:41.700> new<00:01:41.939> worm

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
engines but there's a brand new worm

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.490 
engines but there's a brand new worm
sports<00:01:43.020> cars<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.500> come<00:01:43.710> out<00:01:43.829> recently<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
sports cars just come out recently and

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.069 
sports cars just come out recently and
you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.740> choose<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.880> classic<00:01:48.390> range<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you can choose from a classic range of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.639 
you can choose from a classic range of
all<00:01:49.680> these<00:01:50.009> sports<00:01:50.340> cars<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:52.200> control

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
all these sports cars in the control

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.190 
all these sports cars in the control
line<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> brand<00:01:54.259> made-up<00:01:55.259> sports<00:01:55.380> car<00:01:55.890> so

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
line of the brand made-up sports car so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.630 
line of the brand made-up sports car so
I'm<00:01:58.200> thinking<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.490> an

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I'm thinking that it's going to be an

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.310 
I'm thinking that it's going to be an
extra<00:02:00.000> customization<00:02:01.009> customization<00:02:02.009> abul

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
extra customization customization abul

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.859 
extra customization customization abul
option<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.189> custom<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:06.210> virtual

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
option so you could custom what virtual

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.219 
option so you could custom what virtual
sound<00:02:07.469> you'll<00:02:07.680> need<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.069> make<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> maybe<00:02:09.869> like

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
sound you'll need to make so maybe like

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.500 
sound you'll need to make so maybe like
chameleons<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.190> sound<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.849> infinite

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
chameleons can sound like the infinite

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.790 
chameleons can sound like the infinite
or<00:02:12.780> maybe<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> super

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
or maybe the super

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.620 
or maybe the super
t<00:02:13.950> or<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.280> bullet<00:02:14.520> GT<00:02:16.520> etc<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.210> on<00:02:18.300> saying

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
t or the bullet GT etc you see on saying

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.200 
t or the bullet GT etc you see on saying
so<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.830> it's<00:02:20.160> not<00:02:20.430> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> thing

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
so I think it's not going to be a thing

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.860 
so I think it's not going to be a thing
like<00:02:23.990> fuel<00:02:24.990> or<00:02:25.740> battery<00:02:26.280> life<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.790> car<00:02:27.030> or

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
like fuel or battery life in the car or

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.780 
like fuel or battery life in the car or
maybe<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.620> bachelors<00:02:28.800> look<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.580> doubt

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
maybe all the bachelors look up I doubt

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.520
