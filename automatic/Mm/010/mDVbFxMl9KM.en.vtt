00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello constant people and welcome to

 this new video this time to start 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.260
 vary a bit and do new things 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.300
 I thought why not open something new like 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.070
 can see here and only in the title 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.430
 of the video I found some new 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 headphones and let's do a boxing 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.090
 right now in this video but before 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 maybe some small tribute to my 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 old headphones 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.820
 I do not have a toque who accompanied me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 for a long time after 2 minutes of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.480
 my videos are pretty damaged and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 I want you to see 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.090

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 they suffered a lot of damage throughout 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 this time as no longer see what 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.940
 is the fabric that goes to the sides too 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.910
 difficulties arose like which of 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.629
 I can only hear from the left side and 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.309
 to be able to hear having to be ten 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.530
 minutes turning the cable until it 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:06.560
 listen something so 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.750
 friends they arrived the hour they accompanied me 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.280
 for a long time 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.280
 and I wish you the best luck in the world 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.500

 Well now we are going to what is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.690
 new good let's proceed open the box 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.970
 good better we will proceed to open 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.970
 in a more rustic way 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.960
 ah 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.130
 we'll see 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.619
 but before 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.980
 let me bring so that the camera 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.680
 so we can see both what it brings 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.460
 this well 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:24.990
 While we will proceed to open well 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:28.010
 look just those colors to see we take the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.010
 cardboard paper 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 ready and here are the helmets for 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.200
 course as always with a microphone 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.290
 integrated is not easy to do with a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.290
 hand believe me and less when three a cut 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.330
 look 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.430
 well they can well 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 they look pretty good I like to see 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.780
 Of 2 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.780
 up to the microphone 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.060
 now let's proceed to read what we 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.060
 bring this 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.790
 are the children who go headsets ps3 the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.700
 rating microphone 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:42.610
 hs 400 model 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.150
 comfortable feeling when using them 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.150
 it's true 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.340
 it became quite co2 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.879
 As you can see remember the whole ear 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.879
 no no no 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.370
 and I hear absolutely nothing of what 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.680
 what's going on outside could very well 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.710
 have a fire and I burn here 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.200
 in 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.200
 EU 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.129
 although more the microphone is this let's 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.129
 compare it with the previous ones 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.300
 how do they see where are the ears are it looks 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.390
 that cover a larger area have the 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.970
 pads this would be a fabric which 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:31.110
 makes them more comfortable the microphone is more 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.300
 small as you can see the comparison 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.710
 I hope it sounds better and what 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.050
 we will see in the next videos of the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.050
 gays can come back talking here 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.340
 I can also see that just like my 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.639
 old headphones these have 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.280
 integrated volume controls you 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.500
 turn the wheel and go up and down the 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.850
 volume 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.850
 instead of doing it from the computation 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.190
 so well I guess it's like going 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.390
 saying goodbye I will go and try the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.390
 headphones to see how they sound 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:21.470
 It is very hot and it is for the 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:23.210
 rule raining rather it started to rain 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.160
 perfect excuse to be checking 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.350

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.750
