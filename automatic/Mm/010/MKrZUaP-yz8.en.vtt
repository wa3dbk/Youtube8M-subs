object buffers this scene ought to look
pretty<00:00:18.240> familiar<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.400> what<00:00:20.400> I've<00:00:20.490> got

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
pretty familiar to you what I've got

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.970 
pretty familiar to you what I've got
here<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.939> three<00:00:21.330> Tauruses<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.230> sphere<00:00:22.740> and

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
here is three Tauruses and a sphere and

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.320 
here is three Tauruses and a sphere and
I've<00:00:23.310> got<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> light<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.970> scene<00:00:24.180> that's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I've got a light in the scene that's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.870 
I've got a light in the scene that's
casting<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.900> shadow<00:00:25.160> now<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:26.789> as

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
casting a shadow now I want to have as

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.870 
casting a shadow now I want to have as
much<00:00:27.090> control<00:00:27.660> over<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.890> scene<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> get

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
much control over this scene when I get

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.299 
much control over this scene when I get
it<00:00:30.000> into<00:00:30.150> my<00:00:30.380> compositing<00:00:31.380> program<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.219> I'm

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it into my compositing program so I'm

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
it into my compositing program so I'm
going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.669> multi<00:00:33.090> pass<00:00:33.300> rendering<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going to use multi pass rendering so we

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.410 
going to use multi pass rendering so we
go<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.800> our<00:00:34.829> render<00:00:35.190> settings<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:36.000> we

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
go up to our render settings and we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.799 
go up to our render settings and we
enable<00:00:36.930> multi<00:00:37.380> pass<00:00:37.649> rendering<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:39.360> if

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
enable multi pass rendering here now if

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.209 
enable multi pass rendering here now if
you<00:00:39.899> open<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.710> see<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you open this up you can see that you

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.760 
you open this up you can see that you
can<00:00:41.399> control<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.600> multitude<00:00:43.469> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
can control just a multitude of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
can control just a multitude of
different<00:00:43.890> things<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.300> example<00:00:45.719> we're

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
different things for this example we're

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.470 
different things for this example we're
going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.289> turn<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.620> diffuse<00:00:48.680> specular<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
going to turn on diffuse specular and

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.580 
going to turn on diffuse specular and
shadows<00:00:53.149> you<00:00:54.149> need<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.539> make<00:00:54.809> sure<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.320> you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
shadows you need to make sure that you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.290 
shadows you need to make sure that you
have<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.280> multi<00:00:56.730> pass<00:00:58.190> selected<00:00:59.300> checked

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
have your multi pass selected checked

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.330 
have your multi pass selected checked
and<00:01:00.570> give<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.440> path<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.949> where<00:01:02.100> it's<00:01:02.219> going

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and give it a path to where it's going

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.990 
and give it a path to where it's going
to<00:01:02.399> render<00:01:03.110> your<00:01:04.110> scene<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.589> -<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.280> I've<00:01:05.820> also

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to render your scene out - and I've also

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
to render your scene out - and I've also
got<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.540> set<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.409> going<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.590> render<00:01:07.770> an

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
got it set up so just going to render an

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.280 
got it set up so just going to render an
RGB<00:01:10.790> sequence<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.350> path<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
RGB sequence out to this path as well so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
RGB sequence out to this path as well so
after<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.380> get<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.680> set<00:01:16.950> up<00:01:17.009> we'll<00:01:17.880> just

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
after we get that set up we'll just

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.080 
after we get that set up we'll just
click<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> render<00:01:19.520> it's<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.729> overwrite

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
click on render it's going to overwrite

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
click on render it's going to overwrite
the<00:01:21.119> files<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.630> used<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.080> previous<00:01:22.259> tutorial

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the files I used in a previous tutorial

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.840 
the files I used in a previous tutorial
and<00:01:23.600> it<00:01:24.600> renders<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> scene<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and it renders out the scene so now in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.929 
and it renders out the scene so now in
After<00:01:27.330> Effects<00:01:27.689> we'll<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
After Effects we'll go in here and it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.899 
After Effects we'll go in here and it
creates<00:01:30.270> an<00:01:30.420> AE<00:01:30.600> C<00:01:31.020> file<00:01:31.290> for<00:01:31.619> us<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> we'll

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
creates an AE C file for us so we'll

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.679 
creates an AE C file for us so we'll
just<00:01:33.150> open<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:35.850> creates<00:01:36.150> two

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just open that up and it creates two

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
just open that up and it creates two
folders<00:01:37.079> for<00:01:37.320> us<00:01:37.470> one<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> those<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.400> them

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
folders for us one of those one of them

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.999 
folders for us one of those one of them
has<00:01:38.820> our<00:01:39.030> comp<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.650> we've<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.920> our

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
has our comp in it so we've got our

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.649 
has our comp in it so we've got our
scene<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.320> creates<00:01:44.750> these<00:01:45.979> three

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
scene and it also creates these three

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.660 
scene and it also creates these three
object<00:01:48.659> buffers<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.070> shadow<00:01:50.310> one

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
object buffers one is for shadow one

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
object buffers one is for shadow one
spur<00:01:50.909> specular<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:51.930> diffuse

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
spur specular and one is for diffuse

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.440 
spur specular and one is for diffuse
I'll<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.250> delete<00:01:53.430> these<00:01:53.759> lights<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.299> don't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
I'll just delete these lights we don't

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.580 
I'll just delete these lights we don't
need<00:01:54.630> them<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.180> we<00:01:57.390> came<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.899> now<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
need them so if we came in here now and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
need them so if we came in here now and
we<00:01:58.979> put<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.250> curves<00:01:59.610> adjustment<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.630> on

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
we put a curves adjustment on this on

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.950 
we put a curves adjustment on this on
the<00:02:01.469> shadow<00:02:01.770> layer<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.149> see<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.750> we

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
the shadow layer you can see that we

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.050 
the shadow layer you can see that we
have<00:02:04.579> full<00:02:05.579> control<00:02:06.649> just<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.890> these<00:02:08.039> shadows

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.089 

same<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.480> specular<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:16.099> return

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
same with the specular you can return

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.460 
same with the specular you can return
the<00:02:17.310> specular<00:02:17.909> here<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> curves

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the specular here but a curves

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.089 
the specular here but a curves
adjustment<00:02:19.620> net<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.799> see<00:02:23.870> the

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
adjustment net and you can see the
