00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
to do this too not sure why yet but

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.819 
to do this too not sure why yet but
Maddock<00:00:50.309> stuff<00:00:51.140> didn't<00:00:52.140> quite<00:00:52.289> turn<00:00:52.500> green

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
Maddock stuff didn't quite turn green

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
Maddock stuff didn't quite turn green
turns<00:00:53.670> green<00:00:53.820> if<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> exactly<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
turns green if you get it exactly the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.520 
turns green if you get it exactly the
same<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.350> whatever<00:00:55.590> reason<00:00:55.890> there<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
same for whatever reason there it is so

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
same for whatever reason there it is so
we<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.649> go<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.399> add<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> new<00:01:00.000> title<00:01:00.270> i'm

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we can go here and add a new title i'm

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319 
we can go here and add a new title i'm
just<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.590> my<00:01:02.329> default

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just going to go and use my default

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.920 
just going to go and use my default
picture<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> sort<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
picture there and so this is sort of the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
picture there and so this is sort of the
main<00:01:07.170> interface<00:01:07.680> what<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> need<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.820> have

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
main interface what you need is to have

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.730 
main interface what you need is to have
some<00:01:09.299> text<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
some text to go with this so this is the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.039 
some text to go with this so this is the
metadata<00:01:11.100> as<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.210> see<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.960> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
metadata as you can see here when you

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.810 
metadata as you can see here when you
hit<00:01:13.200> ok<00:01:13.590> you've<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:15.200> your<00:01:16.200> book<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.549> open

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.520 
been thinking about pulling all this
stuff<00:01:36.329> together<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.869> point<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
stuff together at some point so this is

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.649 
stuff together at some point so this is
a<00:01:37.560> good<00:01:37.770> example<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.340> hit<00:01:38.880> save<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.540> going

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
a good example I hit save as I'm going

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.319 
a good example I hit save as I'm going
to<00:01:39.720> say<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:39.990> is<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> text<00:01:40.560> file<00:01:40.799> go<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.939> here
