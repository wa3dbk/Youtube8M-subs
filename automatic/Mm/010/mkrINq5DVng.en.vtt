is<00:02:53.400> kind<00:02:53.819> of<00:02:53.970> weak<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.359> mean<00:02:54.510> this

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.360 
is kind of weak I mean this
cross-section<00:02:56.189> here

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370

even the waistcoat they are separate

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.839 
even the waistcoat they are separate
pieces<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.829> slide<00:02:59.219> them<00:02:59.400> upwards<00:02:59.700> and

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
pieces so you can slide them upwards and

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.849 
pieces so you can slide them upwards and
there's<00:03:00.239> even<00:03:00.569> a<00:03:00.629> cut<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.439> side<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.799> the

there's even a cut in the side of the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
that's as far as he's gonna kick forward

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.890 
that's as far as he's gonna kick forward
that<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.849> that's<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.419> weak

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
that and that's just weak
