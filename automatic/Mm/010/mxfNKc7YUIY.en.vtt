00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 good ordering here to make a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.849
 100's movie is over 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.320
 the last video was still with the grid 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.750
 white temporary 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.540
 now we found a grid of zero 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.310
 degree of zero for bumper shock 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.289
 aligned and three doses in the field 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.260
 were missing 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 This is where we ended up 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.289
 arrive from lindóia bringing back the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.970
 two cars which was a water problem 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.610
 of lindóia is the 171 double cabin eooo 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 dodge dart hang ten 74 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.590
 the two winners there because they have the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.020
 respective trophies to take the photo right 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.079
 it 's always back to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 she won the letters dodge in the hood 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 the new chrome grille of a good visual 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 different from what was with that grid 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:55.199
 White gives a more umar good girl image 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 né the chrome grille gets more aggressive 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 it is not here on the side the badges were 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 completed are also completed with the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.830
 what I was missing was 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:13.920
 the steppe is not 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 and the inside of the panel is 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 was placed the radio was still 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.200
 the cigarette lighter and the cigarette 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.560
 the panel we found out that in the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 luxury and is this sixth hole was a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.950
 clock is not 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 we ended up doing it like that 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.560
 was all the spinning of the account 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.400
 people ended up doing the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.899
 even in the same instrument standard 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.610
 out of other earlier right of it we 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.259
 He had already shown right 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.329
 then it was paid in dollar returned to 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 lindóia ended up running a lot and went 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.579
 at least one fuel media tank 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:02:00.869
 And that's it, now you can say that 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:03.600
 effectively she primes called enough 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.630
 attention for being a different car which 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.590
 few people have seen many people 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.090
 asking will be an adaptation and it is not 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.220
 really is a project that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.890
 was 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.030
 started and then ended 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.540
 leaving behind, right? 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.510
 It is the background has the next challenge that is 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.180
 another 100 double cabin is this 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.220
 standard that we are going to start doing 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.720
 make a project a little bit different 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 unlike green it was fine 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.710
 original with mechanics all original well 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.760
 little disassembled in this was already well 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.970
 More stirred diesel engine with 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.360
 adaptation to mechanical and we are 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.959
 to begin restoring it is the most 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.930
 right there as soon as possible within the 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.209
 our priority queue is good there 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.970
 another dollar winner is this dodge 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.330
 dart hang ten is the ranking has a series 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:03.020
 that was presented in the 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.560
 chicago 1973 as a concept car 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.270
 it has all the surf reasons such 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.209
 remembers that we were at the beginning in the 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.330
 first half of the 1970s, 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.650
 he has a look he is half hip surfer 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.110
 especially in the interior that we go 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.760
 show soon but this would not be 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.340
 a body that the house did not use here 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 in brazil, it's not the dodge's body 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.690
 dart but this is fastback version is the 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.760
 rear window he only scales is and has 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.550
 this bring different we 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.790
 ended up not having not here for 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.310
 other side if the rear completely 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.370
 different is the front uses the same nozzle 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:47.600
 which was used in the gifts of national art 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:54.019
 of 79 81 still with the old grid ne 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:56.690
 so hang up there at 74 and 75 the 74 have 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.549
 this grid the 75 already has the grid equal to 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.600
 which was used to help us out of 79 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:06.739
 Brazilian scale could be 210 type 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.920
 of motor 2 5 318 1 366 has the option 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.590
 intermediary that the taxpayer has 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.299
 all the factory painting is a single go 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.760
 He went to the United States this year. 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.359
 and he is here 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.360
 here is interesting in the glass 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.840
 back has a copy of the dolce card 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.390
 Is this car costing new 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.000
 3756 95229 and 4 né 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.900
 here his charm is what are the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.620
 banks right? 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.890
 the previous white is with this material 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.340
 colored both in the door lining and 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.560
 in the middle of the banks, and what's more 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.780
 difficult will restore the car of these 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.640
 car has not been restored nor will it be 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.440
 is the orange carpet that came out only in this 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.480
 in this version 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.240
 the panel is the same as the art line in 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.590
 74 it 's just that with the panel there later 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.210
 the instruments also painted from 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.550
 matching orange with the rest of the car 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.740
 it is an interesting option that this 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.640
 car tinho the majority of the inhabitants 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.640
 had is the backseat 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.500
 death a vacancy for you to fit an 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.960
 surf board né 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.270
 It's that part that knocks too, and you're done. 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.400
 with almost one a pickup here to 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.380
 you read your surfboard 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.919
 the most interesting is that the first 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.050
 owner of this car but he hoped to 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.240
 younger buyers, right? 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.180
 the first owner of this car that bought 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.840
 this car in the city of croatia or stir 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:46.740
 he was 75 years old at the time he bought the 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.210
 car is or was not at all is the 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.800
 What was I waiting for with the 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.360
 his buyer 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.030
 It's a very interesting interesting car. 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:59.940
 also say that all items were from the 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:03.300
 same color that is and is called action 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.580
 haiti is not the white egg shell is with 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.580
 those with these adhesive strips 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.920
 I'm tired of rallying the 10 tires of the show I 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:19.380
 had to give a finish gives a look 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.770
 cool in the car, that's it 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.950
 ending the video there with the two 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.720
 cars that we took to the beach and 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.490
 who are now returning to the 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.490
 museum 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.490
 soon
