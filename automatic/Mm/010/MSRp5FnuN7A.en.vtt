00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
hat cake this is my second fondant cake

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.660 
hat cake this is my second fondant cake
ever<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.210> first<00:00:18.480> one<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:19.350> spongebob<00:00:20.160> cake

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
ever the first one was a spongebob cake

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
ever the first one was a spongebob cake
and<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.689> thought<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.260> difficult<00:00:22.859> but

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
and I thought that was difficult but

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.580 
and I thought that was difficult but
this<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.550> was<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> little<00:00:24.300> bit<00:00:24.689> challenging<00:00:25.320> as

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
this one was a little bit challenging as

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.490 
this one was a little bit challenging as
well<00:00:25.970> if<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.300> look<00:00:27.689> around<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:28.140> three

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
well if you look around there's three

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.020 
well if you look around there's three
cakes<00:00:28.769> underneath<00:00:29.369> here<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.349> I<00:00:31.700> used<00:00:32.700> box

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
cakes underneath here and I used box

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
cakes underneath here and I used box
cakes<00:00:33.559> for<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
cakes for this and I think that was a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
cakes for this and I think that was a
really<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.809> bad<00:00:37.110> idea<00:00:37.320> because<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> was<00:00:37.980> really

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
really a bad idea because it was really

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.389 
really a bad idea because it was really
soft<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> when<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.969> went<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:40.010> to<00:00:41.010> cut<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
soft and when I went to go to cut the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.200 
soft and when I went to go to cut the
cake<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:43.670> disintegrated<00:00:44.670> kind

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
cake it just kind of disintegrated kind

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.610 
cake it just kind of disintegrated kind
of<00:00:45.329> fell<00:00:45.450> apart<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:45.930> bit<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
of fell apart a little bit not that I

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.000 
of fell apart a little bit not that I
could<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.070> throw<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.489> fondant<00:00:47.940> over<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
could just throw the fondant over it and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
could just throw the fondant over it and
make<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.489> nice<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.030> pretty<00:00:51.090> and

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
make it look all nice and pretty and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.760 
make it look all nice and pretty and
that<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> case<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.230> pan<00:00:55.500> around

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that was not the case when I pan around

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.709 
that was not the case when I pan around
so<00:00:56.870> anyways<00:00:57.870> um<00:00:59.000> like<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> said<00:01:00.149> there's<00:01:00.449> three

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
so anyways um like I said there's three

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
so anyways um like I said there's three
cakes<00:01:00.989> underneath<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:05.090> raspberry

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
from another youtuber I love YouTube and
this<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.119> also<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.810> first<00:01:16.080> time

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this was also to my first time

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.730 
this was also to my first time
experimenting<00:01:17.189> or<00:01:17.909> trying<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.689> use<00:01:18.930> dust<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
experimenting or trying to use dust of

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.999 
experimenting or trying to use dust of
any<00:01:19.979> nature<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:21.049> I'm<00:01:22.049> realizing<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.830> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
any nature and I'm realizing that I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.160 
any nature and I'm realizing that I
don't<00:01:23.280> understand<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> dynamics<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.600> dust<00:01:24.869> I

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
don't understand the dynamics of dust I

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.859 
don't understand the dynamics of dust I
don't<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.590> how<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> use<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.340> dust<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.869> once

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
don't know how to use the dust and once

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.830 
don't know how to use the dust and once
it<00:01:28.110> was<00:01:28.229> already<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:29.400> top<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.820> my<00:01:29.970> hat<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.450> seems

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
it was already on top of my hat it seems

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
it was already on top of my hat it seems
as<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.979> pretty<00:01:32.939> committed<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:34.820> doing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
as if I was pretty committed to doing

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
as if I was pretty committed to doing
something<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.540> dust<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
something with that dust because I

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.890 
something with that dust because I
certainly<00:01:37.799> could<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.250> wipe<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.119> off<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.780> if

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
certainly could not wipe it off so if

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.109 
certainly could not wipe it off so if
anybody<00:01:40.259> has<00:01:40.439> any<00:01:40.470> suggestions<00:01:41.220> tips<00:01:41.820> or

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
would be great I also tried to use a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
would be great I also tried to use a
little<00:01:48.180> shimmer<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.689> some<00:01:49.049> kind<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> San

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
Francisco which really could have done

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.100 
Francisco which really could have done
without<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.890> took<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.640> opportunity<00:01:57.110> with

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
