00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.930 

so<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.550> start<00:00:17.730> off<00:00:17.880> by

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
so do you want to start off by

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.599 
so do you want to start off by
explaining<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:19.320> exactly<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> refrigerator

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
explaining what exactly a refrigerator

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
explaining what exactly a refrigerator
does<00:00:21.210> there's<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.230> no<00:00:22.470> such<00:00:22.680> thing<00:00:22.980> as

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
does there's really no such thing as

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.910 
does there's really no such thing as
cold<00:00:23.430> cold<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> absence<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.109> heat<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
cold cold is the absence of heat and the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.580 
cold cold is the absence of heat and the
way<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.510> refrigerator<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> freezer

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
way a refrigerator and or a freezer

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.389 
way a refrigerator and or a freezer
works<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.539> it<00:00:30.539> removes<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.470> heat<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
works is it removes the heat from the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.600 
works is it removes the heat from the
box<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.989> you're<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.230> creating<00:00:34.890> you're<00:00:35.399> not

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
box so you're not creating you're not

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
box so you're not creating you're not
creating<00:00:36.210> cold<00:00:36.450> you're<00:00:36.690> removing<00:00:37.050> heat<00:00:37.440> okay

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
creating cold you're removing heat okay

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.479 
creating cold you're removing heat okay
that's<00:00:38.910> what<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> tried<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> say<00:00:40.160> that's<00:00:41.160> why

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that's what I tried to say that's why

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's what I tried to say that's why
it's<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.390> important<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.350> maintain<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> good

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it's very important to maintain a good

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.779 
it's very important to maintain a good
door<00:00:44.910> seal<00:00:45.469> because<00:00:46.469> if<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.129> door<00:00:47.399> seal<00:00:47.640> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
door seal because if your door seal is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.080 
door seal because if your door seal is
broken<00:00:48.079> not<00:00:49.079> sealing<00:00:49.410> properly<00:00:49.800> also<00:00:50.760> doing

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
broken not sealing properly also doing

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.290 
broken not sealing properly also doing
is<00:00:51.210> sucking<00:00:51.750> warm<00:00:52.020> air<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.770> into<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.399> causing

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
is sucking warm air back into it causing

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.900 
is sucking warm air back into it causing
the<00:00:54.420> unit<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> run<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:56.129> than<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.489> should<00:00:56.520> run

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
the unit to run more than it should run

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.959 
the unit to run more than it should run
okay<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.390> your<00:01:01.609> seal<00:01:02.609> is

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
okay so how do you know if your seal is

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
okay so how do you know if your seal is
not<00:01:03.270> working<00:01:03.690> properly<00:01:04.070> because<00:01:05.070> you'll<00:01:05.430> see

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
not working properly because you'll see

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.359 
not working properly because you'll see
tears<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.390> okay<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.350> through<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> lining

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
tears in it okay in through the lining

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.320 
tears in it okay in through the lining
here<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.299> see<00:01:09.479> tears<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:11.330> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
here you can see tears in it and it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.370 
here you can see tears in it and it
could<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.720> falling<00:01:13.140> off<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> usually<00:01:15.840> when

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
could be falling off and usually when

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
could be falling off and usually when
it's<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> replace<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.369> door<00:01:17.729> seal<00:01:18.090> it's

go about doing that and the different

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.039 
go about doing that and the different
types<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.369> gasket<00:01:35.939> sure<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.659> along<00:01:36.869> with

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
types of gasket sure right go along with

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.100 
types of gasket sure right go along with
insurance<00:01:37.700> there's<00:01:38.700> three<00:01:38.939> different<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
insurance there's three different the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.859 
insurance there's three different the
major<00:01:40.320> three<00:01:40.979> styles<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> gaskets<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> push

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
major three styles of gaskets are a push

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.810 
major three styles of gaskets are a push
in<00:01:43.049> style<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:46.009> push<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.189> part<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
in style this is the push in part of it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.120 
in style this is the push in part of it
and<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.509> actually<00:01:48.659> has<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> wider<00:01:49.350> slot<00:01:49.829> then

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and it actually has a wider slot then

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.389 
and it actually has a wider slot then
the<00:01:50.250> dart<00:01:50.490> style<00:01:50.850> does<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:52.290> pushes<00:01:52.979> into

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the dart style does and it pushes into

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.670 
the dart style does and it pushes into
it<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:53.850> fairly<00:01:54.180> these<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.990> really<00:01:55.259> easy<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
it as fairly these are really easy to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.149 
it as fairly these are really easy to
replace<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.420> screw<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> style<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> can

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
replace a screw in style and as you can

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
replace a screw in style and as you can
see<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.460> get<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> flap<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.420> at<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> bottom

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
see is get the flap here at the bottom

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.740 
see is get the flap here at the bottom
and<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:02.100> usually<00:02:02.219> uses<00:02:02.549> retainer<00:02:03.180> strips<00:02:03.600> to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and it usually uses retainer strips to

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
and it usually uses retainer strips to
hold<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.530> literally<00:02:04.890> screwed<00:02:05.340> in

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
hold it in and it's literally screwed in

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
hold it in and it's literally screwed in
all<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.969> way<00:02:06.090> around<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.540> door<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:08.009> snap

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
all the way around the door and a snap

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.460 
all the way around the door and a snap
in<00:02:08.520> style<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.209> can<00:02:09.360> see<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> dart<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.200> the

minutes you lay it out and you let it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.440 
minutes you lay it out and you let it
cool<00:02:37.650> off<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.280> flattens<00:02:38.639> itself<00:02:39.000> out<00:02:39.239> and

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
push in you just push it right in back

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.899 
push in you just push it right in back
into<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.609> slot<00:02:48.650> okay<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.129> say<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.669> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
you have like a snapping gasket that you

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.679 
you have like a snapping gasket that you
need<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> replace<00:02:53.340> do<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.150> need<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.510> figure

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
need to replace do you need to figure

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.050 
need to replace do you need to figure
out<00:02:54.930> what<00:02:55.500> model<00:02:56.010> number<00:02:56.280> your<00:02:56.430> refrigerators

out what model number your refrigerators
before<00:02:57.480> ordering<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.109> or<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.680> measure

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
before ordering it or can you measure

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.059 
before ordering it or can you measure
you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.209> determine<00:03:00.659> do<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.079> two<00:03:01.260> ways<00:03:01.290> model

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
you can determine do it two ways model

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.059 
you can determine do it two ways model
and<00:03:02.189> serial<00:03:02.310> numbers<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:03.000> best<00:03:03.209> way<00:03:03.450> if<00:03:04.230> you

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
and serial numbers the best way if you

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.709 
and serial numbers the best way if you
cannot<00:03:05.459> get<00:03:05.669> them<00:03:05.819> own<00:03:05.939> serial<00:03:06.359> number<00:03:06.569> if

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
cannot get them own serial number if

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.509 
cannot get them own serial number if
it's<00:03:06.870> been<00:03:07.079> washed<00:03:07.349> off<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.950> unit's<00:03:08.280> very

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it's been washed off as the unit's very

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.059 
it's been washed off as the unit's very
old<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.659> measure<00:03:10.049> your<00:03:10.319> gaskets<00:03:10.889> from

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
old then measure your gaskets from

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.429 
old then measure your gaskets from
outside<00:03:11.609> edge<00:03:11.969> to<00:03:12.299> outside<00:03:12.750> edge<00:03:13.079> of<00:03:13.379> the

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
outside edge to outside edge of the

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.610 
outside edge to outside edge of the
gasket<00:03:13.980> top<00:03:14.189> and<00:03:14.430> bottom<00:03:14.819> side<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.269> side<00:03:15.620> okay

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
gasket top and bottom side to side okay

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.490 
gasket top and bottom side to side okay
and<00:03:16.799> then<00:03:17.209> call<00:03:18.209> up<00:03:18.449> and<00:03:18.599> say<00:03:18.780> hey<00:03:18.989> I've<00:03:19.169> got<00:03:19.349> to

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and then call up and say hey I've got to

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.569 
and then call up and say hey I've got to
push<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:19.889> gaskets<00:03:20.400> for<00:03:20.780> whatever<00:03:21.780> unit<00:03:22.199> it<00:03:22.379> is

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
push in gaskets for whatever unit it is

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.250 
push in gaskets for whatever unit it is
because<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.760> brand<00:03:24.030> name<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.510> very<00:03:24.750> important

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
because the brand name is very important

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.929 
because the brand name is very important
so<00:03:25.560> if<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.889> can<00:03:26.040> get<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> brand<00:03:26.579> name<00:03:26.729> that's

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:26.939 
so if you can get the brand name that's

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.140 
so if you can get the brand name that's
important<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.510> then<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.109> size<00:03:28.349> okay

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
important and then the size okay

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.109 
important and then the size okay
absolutely<00:03:30.150> okay
