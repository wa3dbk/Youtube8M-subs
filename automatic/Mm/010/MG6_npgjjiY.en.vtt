this<00:01:47.179> that's<00:01:48.179> basically<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.749> way<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> nature

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this that's basically the way the nature

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.819 
this that's basically the way the nature
works<00:01:49.859> because<00:01:51.049> they'll<00:01:52.049> lay<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.289> multiple

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
works because they'll lay a multiple

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
works because they'll lay a multiple
number<00:01:52.859> of<00:01:53.159> eggs<00:01:53.459> that<00:01:53.609> we<00:01:54.359> sometimes<00:01:54.630> say

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
number of eggs that we sometimes say

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
number of eggs that we sometimes say
well<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.399> very<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.329> reason<00:01:57.630> they

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
well or you know very the reason they

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
well or you know very the reason they
would<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.259> many<00:01:58.409> young<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:59.009> because

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
would have so many young is because

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.309 
would have so many young is because
they're<00:02:00.209> they're<00:02:00.450> feeding<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.929> lot<00:02:01.109> of<00:02:01.259> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.050 
flicking okay and they have a forked
tongue<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.130> reason<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.670> whether

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
tongue and the reason for that whether

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.030 
tongue and the reason for that whether
they're<00:02:15.450> sampling<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.020> molecules<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.830> air

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
they're sampling the molecules of air

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.610 
they're sampling the molecules of air
and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:18.030> they're<00:02:18.180> touching<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> organ<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
and then they're touching the organ and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.690 
and then they're touching the organ and
the<00:02:19.680> roof<00:02:19.830> their<00:02:20.069> mouth<00:02:20.250> called<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
the roof their mouth called the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.110 
the roof their mouth called the
Jacobson's<00:02:21.240> organ<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.880> they<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
Jacobson's organ and because they have a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.270 
Jacobson's organ and because they have a
forked<00:02:24.480> tongue<00:02:24.690> they<00:02:25.349> can<00:02:25.560> sense<00:02:25.860> what's<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
forked tongue they can sense what's on

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.059 
forked tongue they can sense what's on
the<00:02:26.430> right<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.910> what's<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> left<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.870> them

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
the right and what's on the left of them

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.710 
the right and what's on the left of them
well<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.220> some<00:02:29.700> people<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.090> snakes<00:02:30.420> can't

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
well the some people think snakes can't

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.580 
well the some people think snakes can't
see<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:31.050> can't<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.500> but<00:02:31.710> they're<00:02:31.860> pretty

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
see they can't see but they're pretty

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.759 
see they can't see but they're pretty
to<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> ground<00:02:33.129> so<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:34.720> Jacobson's<00:02:35.590> organ

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
to the ground so this Jacobson's organ

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.100 
to the ground so this Jacobson's organ
enables<00:02:36.370> them<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.550> sense<00:02:37.510> what's<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.930> their

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
enables them to sense what's in their

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.860 
enables them to sense what's in their
environment<00:02:38.879> but<00:02:39.879> have<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> very<00:02:40.480> very<00:02:40.750> very

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
environment but have a very very very

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.580 
environment but have a very very very
keen<00:02:41.459> sense<00:02:42.459> they<00:02:42.670> can<00:02:42.819> detect<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.590> minuscule

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
keen sense they can detect the minuscule

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.040 
keen sense they can detect the minuscule
amounts<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.390> items<00:02:46.390> it's<00:02:46.569> actually<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:46.989> a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
amounts of items it's actually like a

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.440 
amounts of items it's actually like a
chemical<00:02:47.319> analyzer<00:02:47.849> see<00:02:48.849> this<00:02:49.090> there's<00:02:49.360> an

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
chemical analyzer see this there's an

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.180 
chemical analyzer see this there's an
old<00:02:49.569> saying<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.140> Carl<00:02:50.379> snaky<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.860> coral<00:02:51.160> snake
