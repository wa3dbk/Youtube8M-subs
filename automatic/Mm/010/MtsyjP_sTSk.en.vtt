there's<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> small<00:03:10.270> tweak<00:03:10.720> its<00:03:11.020> that<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
there's a small tweak its that you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.240

launcher has changed to legal for locker

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.150 
launcher has changed to legal for locker

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
so basically it's tribution with evil

so basically it's tribution with evil
bunny<00:03:19.170> morning<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.320> some<00:03:20.980> features<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.580> the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
bunny morning of some features and the

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.110 
bunny morning of some features and the
performance<00:03:22.590> there<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.800> a<00:03:23.830> kayo<00:03:24.130> scheduler<00:03:24.910> so

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
performance there is a kayo scheduler so

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.690 
performance there is a kayo scheduler so
you<00:03:25.209> can<00:03:25.360> change<00:03:25.630> that<00:03:25.959> as<00:03:26.200> well<00:03:26.470> which<00:03:27.130> i<00:03:27.400> have

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
you can change that as well which i have

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.420 
you can change that as well which i have
said<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.300> PF<00:03:28.690> g<00:03:28.930> which<00:03:29.410> in<00:03:29.650> my<00:03:29.739> opinion<00:03:29.920> it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
said to PF g which in my opinion it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.300 
said to PF g which in my opinion it
seems<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.880> best<00:03:31.060> for<00:03:31.269> me<00:03:32.010> what<00:03:33.010> more

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
seems the best for me what more

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.870 
seems the best for me what more

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.890 

this<00:03:50.160> quick<00:03:50.520> lag<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.180> saw<00:03:51.390> here<00:03:51.660> does

this quick lag that you saw here does

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.470 
this quick lag that you saw here does
have<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.620> not<00:03:52.860> too<00:03:53.100> often<00:03:53.520> but<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:54.270> does

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
have it is not too often but it does

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.170 
have it is not too often but it does
happen<00:03:54.780> once<00:03:55.230> in<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.440> while<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.880> not<00:03:56.970> gonna

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
happen once in a while so it's not gonna

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
happen once in a while so it's not gonna
cause<00:03:57.390> much<00:03:57.630> issues<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:58.350> gotta<00:03:58.680> wait<00:03:58.800> about
