the outside you can i maybe onyx that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.330 
the outside you can i maybe onyx that
gets<00:02:50.330> rid<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.050> battery<00:02:51.920> will<00:02:52.160> turn

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
gets rid of that and battery will turn

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.300 
gets rid of that and battery will turn
off<00:02:52.490> all<00:02:52.760> your<00:02:53.000> electronic<00:02:53.510> instruments<00:02:54.310> like

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
off all your electronic instruments like

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.250 
off all your electronic instruments like
so<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.920> quite<00:02:58.190> enough<00:02:58.370> d<00:02:58.810> i'm<00:02:59.810> gonna

chance of making a mistake I will just

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.450 
chance of making a mistake I will just
put<00:03:15.790> my<00:03:16.790> visibility<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.420> full<00:03:17.780> my<00:03:18.770> one<00:03:18.980> turn<00:03:19.190> on

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
put my visibility a full my one turn on

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
outside of the plane as well obviously

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.080
