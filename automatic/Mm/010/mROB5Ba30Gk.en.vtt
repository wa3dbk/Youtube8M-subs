belt so let's try that I grabbed I don't
have<00:01:59.010> a<00:01:59.040> way<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.400> think<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.640> white<00:01:59.790> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
have a way that I think a white that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.250 
have a way that I think a white that
would<00:02:00.000> look<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.180> good<00:02:00.540> maybe<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.869> turquoise

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
would look really good maybe a turquoise

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.219 
would look really good maybe a turquoise
one<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.190> had<00:02:02.460> an<00:02:02.760> off<00:02:03.540> late<00:02:03.780> cream<00:02:04.049> one

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
one but I had an off late cream one

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.710 
one but I had an off late cream one
which<00:02:04.440> didn't<00:02:04.770> work<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.010> then<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> had<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.400> me

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
which didn't work and then I had this me

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.770 
which didn't work and then I had this me
and<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.520> think<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:07.820> helps<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.390> makes<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.660> look

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and I think this helps it makes it look

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.410 
and I think this helps it makes it look
better<00:02:09.080> it's<00:02:09.560> just<00:02:09.710> not<00:02:10.610> me<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:11.030> it's<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.210> shame

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
better it's just not me and it's a shame

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.270 
better it's just not me and it's a shame
because<00:02:11.570> I've<00:02:12.020> really<00:02:12.290> been<00:02:12.410> thinking<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.950> have

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
because I've really been thinking I have

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.560 
because I've really been thinking I have
lots<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.580> white<00:02:13.730> t-shirts<00:02:14.090> I've<00:02:14.270> been<00:02:14.390> wearing

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
lots of white t-shirts I've been wearing

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.180 
lots of white t-shirts I've been wearing
them<00:02:14.630> almost<00:02:14.780> every<00:02:15.140> day<00:02:15.170> like<00:02:15.800> I<00:02:15.890> could<00:02:16.040> use<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
them almost every day like I could use a

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.970 
them almost every day like I could use a
nicer<00:02:16.670> white<00:02:16.850> blouse<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.650> isn't<00:02:18.770> it

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
nicer white blouse but this one isn't it

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.520 
nicer white blouse but this one isn't it
so<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.790> one's<00:02:20.030> going<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.420> dress<00:02:21.320> number
