00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
nice and each of your clones have

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.570 
nice and each of your clones have
separate<00:01:10.200> inventories<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:11.130> they<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.400> they

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.870 
of stuff if you if you have a different
skin<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.270> your<00:01:16.200> clone<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.670> skin

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
skin then your clone will have the skin

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.310 
skin then your clone will have the skin
that<00:01:18.000> used<00:01:18.210> before<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.900> actually<00:01:19.020> set

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that used before so you can actually set

that used before so you can actually set
up<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.710> clones<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> have<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.850> all

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
up all your clones to have you know all

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.850 
up all your clones to have you know all
at<00:01:21.210> each<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.869> them<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> different<00:01:22.380> skin<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.740> it's

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
there we go so what I can find you what

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.490 
there we go so what I can find you what
I<00:01:51.060> feel<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.750> useful<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.140> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I feel like this is useful for for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.899 
I feel like this is useful for for
example<00:01:52.890> obviously<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.400> nether<00:01:53.610> that's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
example obviously the nether that's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.200 
example obviously the nether that's
really<00:01:54.150> good<00:01:54.300> but<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.970> go<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.000> other

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
really good but you can also go to other

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.200 
really good but you can also go to other
dimensions<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.140> example<00:01:58.200> galacticraft

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
dimensions like for example galacticraft

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.000 
dimensions like for example galacticraft
you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.960> Moon<00:02:01.170> or<00:02:01.380> Mars<00:02:01.440> at<00:02:01.860> will

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
you can go to the Moon or Mars at will

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.430 
you can go to the Moon or Mars at will
back<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.420> Moon<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.750> Mars<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.320> your

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
back from the Moon or Mars back to your

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.100 
back from the Moon or Mars back to your
base<00:02:04.590> pretty<00:02:05.340> quickly<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.910> easily<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.479> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
base pretty quickly and easily and you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
base pretty quickly and easily and you
can<00:02:07.290> also<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:08.340> know<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.670> any<00:02:08.880> other

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
can also you know go to any other

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.480 
can also you know go to any other
dimensions<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.020> let's<00:02:10.560> let's<00:02:10.709> uh<00:02:10.979> let's<00:02:11.130> check

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
dimensions so let's let's uh let's check

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.270 
dimensions so let's let's uh let's check
out<00:02:11.640> another<00:02:11.910> location<00:02:12.360> here<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.170> let's<00:02:13.350> go<00:02:14.220> to

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
out another location here so let's go to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.210 
out another location here so let's go to
the<00:02:14.760> overworld<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:16.320> then<00:02:16.800> i'm<00:02:16.950> going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> show

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
minutes just go from one side other it's

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.840 
minutes just go from one side other it's
ridiculous<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.600> let's<00:02:51.750> go<00:02:51.870> ahead<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.640> grab<00:02:53.640> a

ridiculous so let's go ahead and grab a
bunch<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.299> stuff<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.690> we<00:02:54.810> need<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.890> we

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
bunch of stuff that we need so we

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.560 
bunch of stuff that we need so we
actually<00:02:56.280> need<00:02:58.220> say<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.280> let's<00:02:59.970> grab<00:03:00.299> some

actually need say so let's grab some

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.910 
actually need say so let's grab some
more<00:03:00.720> stuff<00:03:00.989> here<00:03:01.230> she'll<00:03:03.470> once<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
more stuff here she'll once we have a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.590 
more stuff here she'll once we have a
shell<00:03:05.160> constructor<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.940> let's<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> shell

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
shell constructor so let's get a shell

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.069 
shell constructor so let's get a shell
storage<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:07.350> then<00:03:08.070> let's<00:03:08.310> also<00:03:08.489> get<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.630> wolf

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
storage and then let's also get a wolf

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.190 
storage and then let's also get a wolf
so<00:03:11.060> pretty<00:03:12.060> much<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.450> only<00:03:12.480> items<00:03:13.049> you're

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
so pretty much the only items you're

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.729 
so pretty much the only items you're
going<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.470> need<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.660> this<00:03:15.660> thing<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
going to need for this this thing is the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.140 
going to need for this this thing is the
items<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.130> have<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.370> my<00:03:17.459> inventory<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:18.120> now

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
items I have in my inventory right now

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.080 
items I have in my inventory right now
so<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:18.900> need<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> shell<00:03:19.650> shell<00:03:20.400> constructor<00:03:20.940> a

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
so you need a shell shell constructor a

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.490 
so you need a shell shell constructor a
shell<00:03:21.510> storage<00:03:21.870> let's<00:03:22.079> go<00:03:22.170> ahead<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.320> place

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
shell storage let's go ahead and place

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.060 
shell storage let's go ahead and place
these<00:03:22.650> down<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:24.079> then<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.560> can<00:03:25.799> either<00:03:25.920> use

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
these down and then you can either use

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.830 
these down and then you can either use
wolf<00:03:26.489> or<00:03:26.760> pigs<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.269> treadmills<00:03:29.540> each<00:03:30.540> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
wolf or pigs and treadmills each of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.569 
wolf or pigs and treadmills each of
these<00:03:30.930> things<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.560> either<00:03:31.680> use<00:03:31.799> one

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
these things you can either use one

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:33.740 
these things you can either use one
treadmill<00:03:32.970> or<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.420> use<00:03:33.450> multiple

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
treadmill or you can use multiple

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.350 
treadmill or you can use multiple
treadmills<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.530> usually<00:03:35.130> like<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.640> two<00:03:36.209> or

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
treadmills I usually like to do two or

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.449 
treadmills I usually like to do two or
three<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.350> do<00:03:37.470> three<00:03:37.799> then<00:03:37.980> really<00:03:38.250> speeds

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
three if you do three then really speeds

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.180 
three if you do three then really speeds
up<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.700> process<00:03:39.739> for<00:03:40.739> something<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.130> this

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
up the process for something like this

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.670 
up the process for something like this
though<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.579> only<00:03:41.820> really<00:03:42.060> need<00:03:42.180> one<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.500> let's

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
though you only really need one so let's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.470 
though you only really need one so let's
go<00:03:43.799> ahead<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.070> actually<00:03:44.760> does<00:03:45.150> this<00:03:45.269> even

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
go ahead and actually does this even

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
go ahead and actually does this even
need<00:03:45.660> power<00:03:45.890> no<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.920> don't<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.370> even

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
need power no I don't think this even

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.600 
need power no I don't think this even
needs<00:03:47.790> power<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.470> don't<00:03:49.470> know<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.769> output<00:03:50.489> power

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
needs power I don't know I output power

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.060 
needs power I don't know I output power
on<00:03:50.820> anyways<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.750> let's<00:03:51.900> go<00:03:52.019> ahead<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.290> put<00:03:53.040> our

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
on anyways so let's go ahead and put our

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.220 
on anyways so let's go ahead and put our
stuff<00:03:53.400> here<00:03:53.549> so<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.299> more<00:03:54.570> treadmills<00:03:55.019> this

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
stuff here so the more treadmills this

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.590 
stuff here so the more treadmills this
has<00:03:55.410> let's<00:03:56.250> go<00:03:56.370> into<00:03:56.790> survival<00:03:57.150> here<00:03:57.570> again

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
has let's go into survival here again

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.700 
has let's go into survival here again
game<00:03:59.430> mode<00:04:00.430> s<00:04:00.820> and<00:04:01.300> then<00:04:02.020> let's<00:04:02.500> right<00:04:02.680> click

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
game mode s and then let's right click

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.230 
game mode s and then let's right click
this<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.250> see<00:04:03.460> it<00:04:03.550> takes<00:04:03.730> a<00:04:03.850> little<00:04:04.000> bit<00:04:04.180> of

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
this so you see it takes a little bit of

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.360 
this so you see it takes a little bit of
your<00:04:04.450> blood<00:04:04.660> or<00:04:04.720> DNA<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:05.470> then<00:04:05.860> like<00:04:06.160> it

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
your blood or DNA and then like it

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.030 
your blood or DNA and then like it
atomically<00:04:07.000> reconstructs<00:04:07.990> you<00:04:08.140> now<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.770> can

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
atomically reconstructs you now this can

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.880 
atomically reconstructs you now this can
take<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.490> little<00:04:09.790> while<00:04:11.010> it's<00:04:12.690> probably<00:04:13.690> about

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
take a little while it's probably about

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.710 
take a little while it's probably about
10<00:04:14.890> minutes<00:04:15.100> maybe<00:04:15.430> with<00:04:16.120> all<00:04:16.360> three<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.600> these

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
10 minutes maybe with all three of these

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.870 
10 minutes maybe with all three of these
maybe<00:04:17.020> less<00:04:17.230> maybe<00:04:17.440> like<00:04:17.770> five<00:04:17.950> minutes<00:04:18.160> with

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
maybe less maybe like five minutes with

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.490 
maybe less maybe like five minutes with
one<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.150> these<00:04:19.209> it<00:04:19.480> could<00:04:19.630> take<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.989> longer

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
one of these it could take a longer

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.800 
one of these it could take a longer
though<00:04:20.650> probably<00:04:20.920> like<00:04:21.100> 10-15<00:04:21.640> minutes<00:04:21.940> but

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
though probably like 10-15 minutes but

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.880 
though probably like 10-15 minutes but
what<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.080> have<00:04:23.230> this<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.410> know<00:04:23.650> it's<00:04:23.800> pretty

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
what you have this you know it's pretty

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.080 
what you have this you know it's pretty
much<00:04:24.070> there<00:04:24.250> whenever<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.640> die<00:04:24.820> you're<00:04:25.000> going

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
much there whenever you die you're going

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.880 
much there whenever you die you're going
to<00:04:25.150> automatically<00:04:25.570> go<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:26.080> next<00:04:26.230> clone

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
to automatically go to your next clone

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.150 
to automatically go to your next clone
or<00:04:27.100> self<00:04:27.430> so<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.120> suggest<00:04:28.960> if<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.770> want<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.040> use

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
or self so I suggest if you want to use

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.160 
or self so I suggest if you want to use
this<00:04:30.340> for<00:04:30.610> easy<00:04:30.940> transportation<00:04:31.450> over

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.170 
this for easy transportation over

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.500 
this for easy transportation over
dimensions<00:04:32.590> I<00:04:32.980> suggest<00:04:33.640> making<00:04:33.850> an<00:04:34.180> ender

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
dimensions I suggest making an ender

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.970 
dimensions I suggest making an ender
chest<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:35.080> storing<00:04:35.380> all<00:04:35.500> your<00:04:35.530> stuff<00:04:35.830> in<00:04:35.950> the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
chest and storing all your stuff in the

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.070 
chest and storing all your stuff in the
ender<00:04:36.250> chest<00:04:36.280> before<00:04:36.610> you<00:04:37.450> go<00:04:37.660> to<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.870> different

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
ender chest before you go to a different

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.630 
ender chest before you go to a different
place<00:04:38.380> because<00:04:38.680> like<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.070> said<00:04:39.130> they<00:04:39.370> all<00:04:39.490> have

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
place because like I said they all have

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.700 
place because like I said they all have
separate<00:04:40.110> storage<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.380> stuff<00:04:41.530> like<00:04:41.650> that

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
separate storage and stuff like that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.590 
separate storage and stuff like that
yeah<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:42.640> is<00:04:42.760> going<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.030> atomically

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
yeah so this is going to atomically

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.990 
yeah so this is going to atomically
reconstruct<00:04:44.410> me<00:04:44.590> and<00:04:44.820> then<00:04:47.760> yeah<00:04:48.760> it'll

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
reconstruct me and then yeah it'll

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.390 
reconstruct me and then yeah it'll
actually<00:04:49.240> then<00:04:50.020> after<00:04:50.620> reconstructs<00:04:51.220> me<00:04:51.310> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
actually then after reconstructs me it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.590 
actually then after reconstructs me it
will<00:04:51.490> actually<00:04:51.610> have<00:04:51.850> my<00:04:51.940> skin<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.300> stuff<00:04:52.450> too

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
will actually have my skin and stuff too

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.650 
will actually have my skin and stuff too
pretty<00:04:53.440> pretty<00:04:53.590> cool<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.760> then<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.390> guy<00:04:55.600> you

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
pretty pretty cool and then this guy you

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.870 
pretty pretty cool and then this guy you
actually<00:04:56.080> need<00:04:56.230> a<00:04:56.260> lever<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.620> turn<00:04:57.130> him<00:04:57.370> on<00:04:57.550> so

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
actually need a lever to turn him on so

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.740 
actually need a lever to turn him on so
he's<00:04:58.120> actually<00:04:58.330> usable<00:04:59.970> let's<00:05:00.970> let's<00:05:01.450> get<00:05:01.660> us

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
he's actually usable let's let's get us

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.230 
he's actually usable let's let's get us
somewhere<00:05:01.990> else<00:05:02.220> where<00:05:03.220> have<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.490> not<00:05:03.820> been<00:05:03.880> yet

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
somewhere else where have I not been yet

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.550 
somewhere else where have I not been yet
I<00:05:04.480> see<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.050> did<00:05:05.290> have<00:05:05.500> what<00:05:06.370> is<00:05:06.490> oh<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:08.320> still

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
I see I did have what is oh it's still

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.380 
I see I did have what is oh it's still
not<00:05:08.680> constructed<00:05:09.430> yeah<00:05:09.550> yeah<00:05:10.030> we've<00:05:10.210> already

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390
