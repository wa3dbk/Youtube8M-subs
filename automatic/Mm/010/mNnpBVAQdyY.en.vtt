00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.529 
battle as you will see I don't know why
I'm<00:04:10.379> foreshadowing<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.489> whatnot<00:04:11.789> but<00:04:12.090> he's

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:12.539 
I'm foreshadowing and whatnot but he's

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:14.270 
I'm foreshadowing and whatnot but he's
going<00:04:12.689> to<00:04:12.750> switch<00:04:12.900> out<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.769> predicted<00:04:14.159> him

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
going to switch out and I predicted him

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.409 
going to switch out and I predicted him
to<00:04:14.370> switch<00:04:14.549> out<00:04:14.759> so<00:04:14.879> I'm<00:04:14.939> gonna<00:04:15.060> go<00:04:15.209> for<00:04:15.359> the

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
to switch out so I'm gonna go for the

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.120 
to switch out so I'm gonna go for the
earthquake<00:04:15.810> but<00:04:16.440> what<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.709> should<00:04:16.979> have<00:04:17.009> done

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
earthquake but what I should have done

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.189 
earthquake but what I should have done
was<00:04:17.370> get<00:04:17.549> my<00:04:17.729> own<00:04:17.909> stealth<00:04:18.209> rocks<00:04:18.449> up<00:04:18.659> I<00:04:18.810> really

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
was get my own stealth rocks up I really

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.009 
was get my own stealth rocks up I really
don't<00:04:19.320> know<00:04:19.469> why<00:04:19.739> I<00:04:19.769> didn't<00:04:20.219> but<00:04:21.060> um<00:04:21.239> yeah<00:04:21.750> at

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
don't know why I didn't but um yeah at

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.209 
don't know why I didn't but um yeah at
least<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.229> predicted<00:04:22.650> him<00:04:22.800> to<00:04:22.889> switch<00:04:23.070> out

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
least I predicted him to switch out

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.090 
least I predicted him to switch out
correctly<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.300> that's<00:04:24.599> good

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
correctly so that's good

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.350 
correctly so that's good
so<00:04:25.280> I'm<00:04:25.340> going<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.520> send<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:25.760> my<00:04:25.850> show<00:04:26.030> from<00:04:26.240> now

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
so I'm going to send in my show from now

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.390 
so I'm going to send in my show from now

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
because I'm in charge apparently he goes

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.920

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
whip is going to do more than aerial ace

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.660 
whip is going to do more than aerial ace
