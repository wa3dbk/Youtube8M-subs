very much more authentic and kids find
it<00:00:29.689> much<00:00:29.930> more<00:00:29.989> difficult<00:00:30.680> because<00:00:30.770> we're

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
it much more difficult because we're

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.580 
it much more difficult because we're
asking<00:00:31.399> them<00:00:31.520> to<00:00:32.090> not<00:00:32.329> learn<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:32.989> procedure<00:00:33.380> and

asking them to not learn a procedure and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.319 
asking them to not learn a procedure and
spit<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:33.980> back<00:00:34.100> out<00:00:34.280> again<00:00:34.460> but<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.880> understand

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
spit it back out again but to understand

thought-provoking stuff in rigorous and
intellectual<00:01:38.390> ways<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.380> if<00:01:39.439> we're<00:01:39.590> doing

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
intellectual ways so if we're doing

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.700 
intellectual ways so if we're doing
exhibitions<00:01:40.880> first<00:01:41.780> obviously<00:01:42.200> we<00:01:42.320> work<00:01:42.500> on

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
exhibitions first obviously we work on

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.999 
exhibitions first obviously we work on
essential<00:01:43.610> question<00:01:43.909> thesis<00:01:44.590> outline<00:01:45.590> but

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
essential question thesis outline but

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.260 
essential question thesis outline but
then<00:01:46.159> they<00:01:46.310> write<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.579> first<00:01:46.789> argument<00:01:46.969> then

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
then they write the first argument then

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.060 
then they write the first argument then
we<00:01:47.360> revise<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.780> first<00:01:47.990> argument<00:01:48.200> till<00:01:48.950> it's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
we revise the first argument till it's

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.039 
we revise the first argument till it's
ready<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.310> go<00:01:49.399> second<00:01:50.270> argument<00:01:50.420> third

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
ready to go second argument third

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:52.719 
ready to go second argument third
argument<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:51.859> at<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> end<00:01:52.219> of<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.430> year

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
argument and then at the end of the year

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.789 
argument and then at the end of the year
you<00:01:53.479> obviously<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:53.990> whole<00:01:54.229> paper<00:01:54.409> and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
you obviously have the whole paper and

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.440 
you obviously have the whole paper and
in<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:54.979> same<00:01:55.189> way<00:01:55.399> if<00:01:55.460> we're<00:01:55.729> doing<00:01:55.850> graphic

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
in the same way if we're doing graphic

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.830 
in the same way if we're doing graphic
novels<00:01:56.810> first<00:01:57.770> they'll<00:01:58.310> write<00:01:58.579> a<00:01:58.850> story<00:01:59.479> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
novels first they'll write a story and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.050 
novels first they'll write a story and
then<00:02:00.140> they<00:02:00.289> turn<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.770> into<00:02:00.829> a<00:02:01.520> script<00:02:01.939> so

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
then they turn that into a script so

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.459 
then they turn that into a script so
they<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.390> all<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.600> dialogue<00:02:02.960> ready<00:02:03.170> and

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
they have all the dialogue ready and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.709 
they have all the dialogue ready and
then<00:02:03.890> they<00:02:04.009> do<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> storyboard<00:02:04.759> and<00:02:05.149> then<00:02:05.630> they

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
then they do a storyboard and then they

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.499 
then they do a storyboard and then they
