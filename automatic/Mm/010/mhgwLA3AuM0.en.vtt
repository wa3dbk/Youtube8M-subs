SmartWatch<00:00:13.050> out<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.740> Switzerland<00:00:14.340> let's

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
SmartWatch out of Switzerland let's

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.590 
SmartWatch out of Switzerland let's
check<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.240> interesting

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
check it out so the first interesting

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.000 
check it out so the first interesting
differentiator<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.560> watch<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:22.920> you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
differentiator about this watch is you

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.650 
differentiator about this watch is you
can<00:00:23.130> actually<00:00:23.430> pop<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> its<00:00:24.270> cradle

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
can actually pop it out of its cradle

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.510 
can actually pop it out of its cradle
and<00:00:25.020> leave<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> band<00:00:25.590> separate<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:26.520 
and leave the band separate and this

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.939 
and leave the band separate and this
unit<00:00:26.850> is<00:00:26.939> entirely<00:00:27.330> self-contained<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.770> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
unit is entirely self-contained it is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.299 
unit is entirely self-contained it is
not<00:00:29.130> immersive<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.710> water-resistant<00:00:31.769> but

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
not immersive it is water-resistant but

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.889 
not immersive it is water-resistant but
so<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.120> know<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.480> wash<00:00:33.630> dishes

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
so you can you know you can wash dishes

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.510 
so you can you know you can wash dishes
within<00:00:34.260> things<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.130> can't

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
within things like that but you can't

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.490 
within things like that but you can't
exactly<00:00:35.760> take<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.079> first<00:00:37.200> win<00:00:37.470> but

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
exactly take it with you first win but

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.110 
exactly take it with you first win but
that's<00:00:37.649> okay<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.790> put<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> in

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that's okay because you can put it in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.340 
that's okay because you can put it in
your<00:00:39.149> pocket<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.630> leave<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.050> bag<00:00:40.200> or

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
whatever use your power standby button

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
whatever use your power standby button
volume<00:00:42.210> rocker<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.170> micro<00:00:43.469> USB

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
volume rocker there this is micro USB

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.979 
volume rocker there this is micro USB
it's<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> charges<00:00:44.629> microphones<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's how it charges microphones on this

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
it's how it charges microphones on this
side<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.100> side<00:00:47.370> we've<00:00:47.879> got

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
side on the other side we've got

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.940 
side on the other side we've got
probably<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.719> noise<00:00:48.930> cancelling<00:00:49.379> mic<00:00:49.590> not<00:00:49.800> sure

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
probably a noise cancelling mic not sure

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.229 
probably a noise cancelling mic not sure
about<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.820> speakerphone

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
about that but this is the speakerphone

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.750 
about that but this is the speakerphone
so<00:00:51.960> yes<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.980> take<00:00:53.129> calls<00:00:53.430> right

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
so yes you can make and take calls right

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.130 
so yes you can make and take calls right

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
which are across the booth at the moment

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.069 
which are across the booth at the moment
so<00:01:14.249> we<00:01:14.279> can't<00:01:14.850> show<00:01:14.969> them<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.359> immediately

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:16.079 
so we can't show them to you immediately

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.469 
so we can't show them to you immediately
but<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.459> go<00:01:17.609> ahead<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> turn<00:01:17.969> the<00:01:18.119> unit<00:01:18.359> on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
but if we go ahead and turn the unit on

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.260 
but if we go ahead and turn the unit on
you<00:01:18.749> can<00:01:18.899> see<00:01:19.109> they're<00:01:19.979> using<00:01:20.399> a<00:01:20.609> resistive

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you can see they're using a resistive

if<00:01:23.819> we<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.090> blow<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.020> frame<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
if we can blow the frame there there we

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.649 
if we can blow the frame there there we
go<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.999> setting<00:01:27.240> screen<00:01:27.509> but<00:01:27.599> if

the watch we're just looking at a price
of<00:02:11.600> about<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:12.020> hundred<00:02:12.470> and<00:02:12.500> twenty<00:02:12.860> nine<00:02:13.040> euro

on<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.880> model<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.330> believe<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:15.080> earlier

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
on this model I believe the earlier

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.490 
on this model I believe the earlier
models<00:02:15.709> are<00:02:15.890> down<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.370> 269<00:02:17.180> these<00:02:17.600> days<00:02:17.840> but

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
models are down to 269 these days but

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.560 
models are down to 269 these days but
it's<00:02:18.709> interesting<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.250> see<00:02:19.520> another<00:02:20.000> take<00:02:20.330> on

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
it's interesting to see another take on

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's interesting to see another take on
