hi everyone John here from techie review

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.190 
hi everyone John here from techie review
comm<00:00:02.550> in<00:00:02.909> some<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.600> videos<00:00:03.629> you<00:00:03.959> probably

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
comm in some of my videos you probably

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.900 
comm in some of my videos you probably
noticed<00:00:04.620> I've<00:00:04.710> gotten<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> reef<00:00:05.160> aquarium<00:00:05.759> in

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
noticed I've gotten a reef aquarium in

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.639 
noticed I've gotten a reef aquarium in
the<00:00:05.970> background<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:06.930> today<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.470> going<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
the background so today we're going to

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.780 
the background so today we're going to
do<00:00:07.740> something<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> little<00:00:08.099> different<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.670> we

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
do something a little different and we

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.000 
do something a little different and we
can<00:00:08.910> take<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.179> look<00:00:09.450> at<00:00:09.570> this<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.740> semi

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
can take a look at this this is the semi

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.520 
can take a look at this this is the semi
reef<00:00:11.519> monitor<00:00:12.059> essentially<00:00:12.960> what<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.290> does

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
reef monitor essentially what this does

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.010 
reef monitor essentially what this does
is<00:00:13.710> monitors<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.610> water<00:00:14.969> temperature<00:00:15.420> pH

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
is monitors the water temperature pH

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.250 
is monitors the water temperature pH
levels<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.590> nh3<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> let's<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.720> open<00:00:18.810> take

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
levels and nh3 so let's get it open take

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:34.020 
levels and nh3 so let's get it open take
a<00:00:19.320> look<00:00:19.500> inside

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.180 

once<00:00:34.570> atop<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.200> seller<00:00:35.530> grief<00:00:35.800> will<00:00:36.040> allow

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
once atop the seller grief will allow

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.190 
once atop the seller grief will allow
you<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.370> monitor<00:00:36.790> and<00:00:36.940> track<00:00:37.270> your<00:00:37.990> water

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
you to monitor and track your water

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.830 
you to monitor and track your water
temperature<00:00:38.500> your<00:00:39.220> ph<00:00:39.580> level<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.180> your<00:00:40.510> nh3

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
temperature your ph level and your nh3

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.010 
temperature your ph level and your nh3
level<00:00:41.560> it<00:00:42.430> also<00:00:42.580> includes<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.120> light<00:00:43.360> meter<00:00:43.600> so

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
level it also includes a light meter so

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.990 
level it also includes a light meter so
if<00:00:44.260> you've<00:00:44.380> got<00:00:44.500> any<00:00:44.559> sort<00:00:44.890> of<00:00:44.980> cars<00:00:45.730> that<00:00:45.760> need

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
if you've got any sort of cars that need

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.850 
if you've got any sort of cars that need
to<00:00:46.090> be<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.270> certain<00:00:46.720> light<00:00:46.900> whatever<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:47.680> can

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
to be a certain light whatever you can

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.770 
to be a certain light whatever you can
use<00:00:48.040> this<00:00:48.220> to<00:00:48.489> better<00:00:48.670> gauge<00:00:48.880> where<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.600> place

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
use this to better gauge where to place

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.100 
use this to better gauge where to place
those<00:00:49.960> curls<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:51.129> quick<00:00:51.340> look<00:00:51.520> around<00:00:51.580> the<00:00:51.760> box

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
those curls so quick look around the box

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.740 
those curls so quick look around the box
so<00:00:53.110> on<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.320> front<00:00:53.440> obviously<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:55.059> have<00:00:55.210> versa

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
so on the front obviously you have versa

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.740 
so on the front obviously you have versa
to<00:00:55.930> count<00:00:56.140> fish<00:00:56.970> although<00:00:57.970> what<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.420> sensor

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
to count fish although what the sensor

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
to count fish although what the sensor
looks<00:00:58.870> like<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.550> then<00:01:01.360> on<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.750> back

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
looks like and then on the back

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.130 
looks like and then on the back
basically<00:01:03.250> you<00:01:03.580> get<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.790> web<00:01:04.119> interface<00:01:04.420> which

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
basically you get a web interface which

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.870 
basically you get a web interface which
allows<00:01:05.199> you<00:01:05.710> to<00:01:05.830> you<00:01:06.070> know<00:01:06.130> look<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.430> all<00:01:06.520> data

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
allows you to you know look at all data

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.270 
allows you to you know look at all data
look<00:01:07.390> at<00:01:07.479> current<00:01:07.840> data<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.530> sort<00:01:08.860> see<00:01:09.070> how

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
look at current data and sort see how

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.330 
look at current data and sort see how
your<00:01:09.820> tank<00:01:10.090> has<00:01:10.300> been<00:01:10.509> performing<00:01:10.960> for<00:01:11.110> nh3

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
your tank has been performing for nh3

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.859 
your tank has been performing for nh3
and<00:01:12.600> also<00:01:13.600> pH<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.950> get<00:01:15.070> a<00:01:15.509> picture<00:01:16.509> of<00:01:16.660> what

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
and also pH you get a picture of what

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.230 
and also pH you get a picture of what
the<00:01:16.960> sensor<00:01:17.259> looks<00:01:17.440> like<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:18.160> a<00:01:18.910> little<00:01:19.119> bit

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
the sensor looks like and a little bit

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.040 
the sensor looks like and a little bit
of<00:01:19.300> information<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.430> parameters<00:01:22.050> the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
of information of what parameters the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.840 
of information of what parameters the
sensor<00:01:23.470> will<00:01:23.649> actually<00:01:23.950> monitor<00:01:24.580> for<00:01:24.789> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
sensor will actually monitor for you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.889 
sensor will actually monitor for you
okay<00:01:27.850> let's<00:01:28.030> get<00:01:28.119> it<00:01:28.240> open<00:01:28.450> it's<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.720> quick

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
okay let's get it open it's on a quick

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.570 
okay let's get it open it's on a quick
look<00:01:33.690> okay<00:01:34.920> inside<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.190> a<00:01:36.250> bit<00:01:36.399> more

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
look okay inside have a bit more

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.710 
look okay inside have a bit more
information

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.280 

Najim<00:01:42.140> sensor<00:01:42.530> itself<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:43.070> there<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:48.020> that's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
Najim sensor itself is there and that's

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.130 
Najim sensor itself is there and that's
all<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.560> also<00:01:48.770> get<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.640> one<00:01:50.090> month<00:01:50.330> free

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140

all you also get one one month free
slide<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.400> basically<00:01:52.760> what<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:52.940> need<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.120> do

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
slide and basically what you need to do

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.050 
slide and basically what you need to do
when<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.020> first<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.470> this<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:55.010> for<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.820> first

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
when you first get this is for the first

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.240 
when you first get this is for the first
24<00:01:56.480> hours<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:56.840> soak<00:01:57.260> you<00:01:57.410> slide<00:01:57.650> in<00:01:57.800> some<00:01:57.980> tank

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
24 hours you soak you slide in some tank

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.670 
24 hours you soak you slide in some tank
water<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.060> then<00:01:59.420> once<00:01:59.600> that's<00:01:59.750> done<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.650> can

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
water and then once that's done you can

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.340 
water and then once that's done you can
place<00:02:01.010> it<00:02:01.160> in<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:02.240> cell<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:02.810> probe<00:02:03.110> and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
place it in the the cell I probe and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.460 
place it in the the cell I probe and
then<00:02:04.070> get<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.520> working<00:02:04.670> in<00:02:04.910> your<00:02:05.060> tank<00:02:05.470> all

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
then get it working in your tank all

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.870 
then get it working in your tank all
right<00:02:06.620> let's<00:02:06.860> open<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.280> box<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.640> let's<00:02:07.820> have

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
right let's open the box and let's have

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.590 
right let's open the box and let's have
a<00:02:07.940> look<00:02:08.030> at<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.300> core<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.170> get<00:02:09.350> inside<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.860> box

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
a look at the core we get inside the box

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.670 
a look at the core we get inside the box
so<00:02:11.600> they've<00:02:11.720> got<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.960> contents<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.530> box

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
so they've got the contents of the box

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.500 
so they've got the contents of the box
not<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> great<00:02:13.610> deal<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.060> but<00:02:14.270> then<00:02:14.420> I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
not a great deal to it but then I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.030 
not a great deal to it but then I
suppose<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.870> doesn't<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.140> need<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.560> be<00:02:18.040> so

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
suppose it doesn't really need to be so

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.490 
suppose it doesn't really need to be so
there's<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> sensor<00:02:19.730> itself<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.230> here

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
there's the sensor itself you have here

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.060 
there's the sensor itself you have here
the<00:02:21.620> slide<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:23.440> underneath<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.709> also<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
the slide and underneath is also a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:40.360 
the slide and underneath is also a
suction<00:02:25.580> cup<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:39.260> line<00:02:39.560> here<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:40.220> need

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
suction cup so this line here you need

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.390 
suction cup so this line here you need
to<00:02:40.430> soak<00:02:40.730> for<00:02:41.170> 24<00:02:42.170> hours<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.860> some<00:02:43.160> of<00:02:43.250> your

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
to soak for 24 hours in some of your

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.010 
to soak for 24 hours in some of your
tank<00:02:43.640> water<00:02:43.790> get<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.090> clean<00:02:44.360> couple<00:02:44.690> of<00:02:44.870> that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
tank water get a clean couple of that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 
tank water get a clean couple of that
submerge<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.459> 24<00:02:46.790> hours<00:02:47.000> once<00:02:47.480> that's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
submerge this for 24 hours once that's

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.540 
submerge this for 24 hours once that's
done<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:50.360> goes<00:02:50.570> inside<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.800> probe<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.400> then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
done it goes inside this probe and then

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.220 
done it goes inside this probe and then
this<00:02:52.670> probe<00:02:52.880> will<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.150> sits<00:02:53.780> inside<00:02:53.959> your

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
this probe will see sits inside your

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.810 
this probe will see sits inside your
tank<00:02:54.380> water<00:02:54.590> there<00:02:54.980> is<00:02:55.040> a<00:02:55.070> little<00:02:55.280> suction<00:02:55.459> cup

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
tank water there is a little suction cup

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.310 
tank water there is a little suction cup
and<00:02:56.470> then<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.620> get<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.830> idea<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:59.050> on<00:03:00.050> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
and then you get the idea so on the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.440 
and then you get the idea so on the
front<00:03:00.440> here<00:03:00.709> we'll<00:03:00.860> talk<00:03:00.980> power<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.640> think

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
front here we'll talk power I think

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.910 
front here we'll talk power I think
that's<00:03:02.720> a<00:03:02.780> warning<00:03:03.140> don't<00:03:03.290> tell<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:03.650> there<00:03:03.800> is

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
that's a warning don't tell you there is

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.800 
that's a warning don't tell you there is
something<00:03:04.130> wrong

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
something wrong

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.979 
something wrong
and<00:03:05.810> then<00:03:06.709> your<00:03:06.860> temperature<00:03:07.340> nh3<00:03:07.989> pH

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
and then your temperature nh3 pH

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.650 
and then your temperature nh3 pH
indicators<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.890> bottom<00:03:10.820> there<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.420> bottom

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
indicators that bottom there that bottom

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.360 
indicators that bottom there that bottom
indicator<00:03:11.989> there<00:03:12.230> will<00:03:12.680> light<00:03:12.830> up<00:03:13.010> obviously

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
indicator there will light up obviously

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.020 
indicator there will light up obviously
when<00:03:13.519> your<00:03:13.700> slide<00:03:14.600> needs<00:03:15.019> changing<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:16.430> the

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
when your slide needs changing on the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.830 
when your slide needs changing on the
back<00:03:17.239> there<00:03:18.760> it<00:03:19.760> better<00:03:20.030> your<00:03:20.269> light<00:03:20.630> meter

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
back there it better your light meter

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.160 
back there it better your light meter
and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:21.799> you<00:03:21.890> can<00:03:22.010> use<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.420> obviously<00:03:23.420> take

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
and then you can use that obviously take

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.620 
and then you can use that obviously take
some<00:03:24.290> light<00:03:24.500> readings<00:03:24.920> of<00:03:25.130> your<00:03:26.000> tank<00:03:26.299> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
some light readings of your tank and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.140 
some light readings of your tank and
like<00:03:27.019> Sedalia<00:03:27.500> what<00:03:28.459> this<00:03:28.640> will<00:03:28.760> allow<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
like Sedalia what this will allow you to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.500 
like Sedalia what this will allow you to
do<00:03:29.360> is<00:03:30.370> place<00:03:31.370> better<00:03:31.700> corals<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.330> have

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
do is place better corals that have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.570 
do is place better corals that have
specific<00:03:32.989> lighting<00:03:33.320> requirements<00:03:36.580> and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
specific lighting requirements and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.820 
specific lighting requirements and
really<00:03:37.820> that's<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.410> now<00:03:39.410> what<00:03:39.560> I'm<00:03:39.650> going<00:03:39.769> to
