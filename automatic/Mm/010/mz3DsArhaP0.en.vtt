out in there now I did some pretty good
modification<00:00:21.869> on<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.750> lighting

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
modification on this to get the lighting

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.880 
modification on this to get the lighting
that<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.930> liked<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.350> there<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.590> there's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
that I liked in there I think there's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.320 
that I liked in there I think there's
some<00:00:26.039> nice<00:00:26.189> natural-looking<00:00:26.820> light<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.240> there

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
some nice natural-looking light in there

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.750 
some nice natural-looking light in there
and<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.599> see<00:00:27.810> I've<00:00:28.470> got<00:00:28.680> my<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.980> 350

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
and you can see I've got my little 350

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.840 
and you can see I've got my little 350
scale<00:00:31.279> crewman<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.550> there's<00:00:32.790> a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
scale crewman in there there's a

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
warm white SMDs I've got two of them up

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.850 
warm white SMDs I've got two of them up
there<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> roof<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> are<00:00:55.469> shining<00:00:55.710> down

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
there in the roof that are shining down

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
there in the roof that are shining down
and<00:00:56.190> I've<00:00:56.250> got<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.579> pointing<00:00:56.940> towards<00:00:57.210> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
little part that goes above the shuttle

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.009 
little part that goes above the shuttle
bay<00:01:01.469> doors<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:02.010> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> back<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.019> I've

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
bay doors there at the back and I've

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
bay doors there at the back and I've
also<00:01:04.260> got<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> outside<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
also got one on the outside of the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480 
also got one on the outside of the
shuttle<00:01:06.000> bay<00:01:06.119> facing<00:01:06.600> towards<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> windows

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
shuttle bay facing towards the windows

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
shuttle bay facing towards the windows
there<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> rear<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.110> are<00:01:10.320> lit<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there at the rear so those are lit up

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
there at the rear so those are lit up
and<00:01:11.010> once<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.909> put<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> side<00:01:12.420> SMD<00:01:12.990> Zin<00:01:13.200> over

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and once I put the side SMD Zin over

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.530 
and once I put the side SMD Zin over
here<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:14.010> side<00:01:14.310> windows<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> shuttle<00:01:15.390> bay

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here our side windows in the shuttle bay

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
here our side windows in the shuttle bay
are<00:01:16.170> gonna<00:01:16.409> light<00:01:16.619> too<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.520> once<00:01:17.880> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
are gonna light too when it's once I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
are gonna light too when it's once I
like<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.299> outer<00:01:18.570> windows<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> I'll<00:01:19.140> do

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
like these outer windows and I'll do

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
like these outer windows and I'll do
that<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.560> before<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> seal<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.369> but<00:01:20.729> I

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that just before I seal it all up but I

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
that just before I seal it all up but I
just<00:01:21.840> thought<00:01:21.930> I'd<00:01:22.080> show<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.350> guys<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
just thought I'd show you guys that and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.990 
just thought I'd show you guys that and
I<00:01:22.950> think<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> lighting<00:01:23.430> looks<00:01:23.640> pretty<00:01:23.880> nice

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I think the lighting looks pretty nice

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.370 
I think the lighting looks pretty nice
and<00:01:24.240> natural<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> see

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and natural in there and you can see

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.630 
and natural in there and you can see
we've<00:01:25.500> got<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.890> lighting<00:01:26.250> coming<00:01:26.520> out

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
we've got a little lighting coming out

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.840 
we've got a little lighting coming out
of<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.409> door<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.130> shuttlecraft

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of the door on the shuttlecraft

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.499 
of the door on the shuttlecraft
so<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.900> looks<00:01:31.110> pretty<00:01:31.170> cool<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.210> then<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
so that looks pretty cool and then up in

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.749 
so that looks pretty cool and then up in
here<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.990> did<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> bridge<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> added<00:01:35.640> some
