00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.940
 in the seventh form 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.279
 let's see what I consider to be the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.390
 most important signal to teach 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.640
 immediately to our dog the call 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 I mean that when he called the dog 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.010
 whatever he's playing 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.030
 with another dog that is distracted 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.579
 by smells or whatever I mean 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.399
 is doing to my recall must 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.910
 absolutely rushing towards 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.310
 of method how do you set this up 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.590
 what we had already seen 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.070
 previously as the instinct to follow 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.800
 we are comfortable so we will see now 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:05.860
 as in a field I really am 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.320
 around and my dog ​​calls too 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.659
 the faster I make sure dog 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.890
 when it arrives it is reinforced immediately 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.659
 from food 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:22.090
 the hotel the invasive dir router must 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.609
 to be immediately in my hand but to 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.340
 be the first thing the dog feels 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.020
 then I also have to cheer them up 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.990
 this world but no one came towards 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 of me he voted but the thing more 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:41.100
 important is that as such it comes towards 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 find me waiting for food right away 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.130
 in this case we have a puppy with 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.960
 the predisposition to follow and the thing 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 it becomes easier later 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.610
 we will see how to set the recall as 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.180
 an already adult dog that has not been 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:04.670
 previously set this way 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.670
 then puppy and immediately food 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.180
 Note 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.350
 in the case of an adult dog that does not have 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.570
 still well learned the recall is useful 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.510
 use a leash or long also 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.820
 ten meters and to always have control 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.670
 of the dog and then set it up 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.810
 always in the same way I call 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.390
 the dear I call the dog is as soon as it arrives 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 the prize with food 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.440
 this way i'm sure in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.030
 any time and at any time of the 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.860
 dog is doing to my call 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.860
 will quickly return to me
