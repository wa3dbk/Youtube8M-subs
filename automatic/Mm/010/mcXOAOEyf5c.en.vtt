use it as a keyring knife family it's
got<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.610> while<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.210> you'll<00:00:39.360> hold<00:00:39.510> on

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
got a little while then you'll hold on

got a little while then you'll hold on
the<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.840> which<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.020> could<00:00:40.230> put<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> keyring

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the back which you could put a keyring

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.600 
the back which you could put a keyring
through

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
through

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.700 
through
bilenda<00:00:42.149> hole<00:00:42.300> itself<00:00:42.510> won't<00:00:42.809> take<00:00:43.110> 550

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
bilenda hole itself won't take 550

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680 
bilenda hole itself won't take 550
paracord<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.370> probably<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.420> probably

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
paracord it probably well I probably

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.330 
paracord it probably well I probably
should<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> paracord

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
should take it if you get the paracord

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
should take it if you get the paracord
but<00:00:47.550> normal<00:00:47.820> flight<00:00:47.969> 50<00:00:48.239> cooler<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> won't<00:00:48.750> go

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
but normal flight 50 cooler it won't go

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
but normal flight 50 cooler it won't go
through<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.350> think<00:00:49.829> it'd<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.010> quite<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> good

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
through I think it'd be quite a good

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
them a little bit dearer than that in

them a little bit dearer than that in
this<00:01:06.869> model<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.590> everything<00:01:07.860> else<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
this model but everything else is the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
this model but everything else is the
same<00:01:08.810> as<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.140> here<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> lock

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
same as you can see here it's the lock

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.679 
same as you can see here it's the lock
back<00:01:10.770> design<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:12.330> running<00:01:12.540> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
back design and it's running a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
back design and it's running a
drop-point<00:01:13.500> hollow<00:01:13.950> ground<00:01:14.250> blade<00:01:14.430> I'm<00:01:14.880> just

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
drop-point hollow ground blade I'm just

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.249 
drop-point hollow ground blade I'm just
bringing<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.420> camera<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.080> closer

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
bringing up the camera a bit of a closer

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
bringing up the camera a bit of a closer
look<00:01:16.380> at<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> idea<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
look at it I really like the idea that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.550 
look at it I really like the idea that
for<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.659> knife<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.110> size<00:01:19.320> it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
for a little knife of this size it's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080 
for a little knife of this size it's
running<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.890> locking<00:01:20.430> mechanism<00:01:20.460> rather<00:01:20.970> than

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
running a locking mechanism rather than

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.310 
running a locking mechanism rather than
just<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.330> slip<00:01:21.509> joint<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.869> think<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
just a slip joint I think that just

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.050 
just a slip joint I think that just
gives<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.950> added<00:01:23.100> security<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.939> use

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
gives you that added security and use

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.310 
gives you that added security and use
that<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> close<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that it's not going to close up on you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.450 
that it's not going to close up on you
and<00:01:26.420> while<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.570> length<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.460> from

really meant to be to hang out or not if

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.300 
really meant to be to hang out or not if
you<00:03:18.840> are<00:03:19.050> desperate<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.590> be<00:03:19.680> tactical<00:03:20.160> with

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
your case menu icon

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.940 
your case menu icon
you<00:03:22.650> could<00:03:22.980> pinch<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.000> blade<00:03:24.120> like<00:03:24.420> saved<00:03:24.950> and

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you could pinch the blade like saved and

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.830 
you could pinch the blade like saved and
flick<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.430> out<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.820> then<00:03:27.450> spin<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.780> around

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
flick it out and then spin it around

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.390 
flick it out and then spin it around
hopefully<00:03:28.140> without<00:03:28.530> cutting<00:03:28.920> your<00:03:29.070> finger

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
hopefully without cutting your finger

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
cutting board test on it but you can get

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.710 
cutting board test on it but you can get
your<00:04:22.950> software<00:04:23.250> some<00:04:23.430> paracord<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:24.030> even

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
your software some paracord so even

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.880 
your software some paracord so even
though<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.990> small<00:04:25.289> knife<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.800> it's

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
though it's a small knife and it's

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.320 
though it's a small knife and it's
lightweight<00:04:26.130> everything<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.760> does<00:04:27.090> give<00:04:27.270> you

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
lightweight everything it does give you

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.710 
lightweight everything it does give you
that<00:04:27.390> you

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
that you

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360 
that you
to<00:04:27.990> get<00:04:28.140> through<00:04:28.320> some<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.620> those<00:04:28.680> tasks<00:04:29.160> I

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
to get through some of those tasks I

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.300 
to get through some of those tasks I
think<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.030> overall<00:04:30.330> quality<00:04:30.630> on<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.310> it's

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
think the overall quality on it is it's

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.550 
think the overall quality on it is it's
good<00:04:32.570> I've<00:04:33.570> got<00:04:33.720> no<00:04:33.840> complaints<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
good I've got no complaints of it and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.660 
good I've got no complaints of it and
the<00:04:34.680> value<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:35.010> think<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.250> really<00:04:35.460> quite<00:04:35.610> a

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
the value I think is really quite a

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.190 
the value I think is really quite a
steam<00:04:35.940> you<00:04:36.060> can<00:04:36.180> pick<00:04:36.300> these<00:04:36.480> things<00:04:36.750> up

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
steam you can pick these things up

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.620 
steam you can pick these things up
certainly<00:04:37.590> online<00:04:37.950> around<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.850> traps<00:04:39.480> around

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
certainly online around the traps around

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.880 
certainly online around the traps around

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
we up $13 us I think for its purpose use

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.100 
we up $13 us I think for its purpose use
which<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.160> mainly<00:04:44.580> see<00:04:44.790> is<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:45.270> small<00:04:45.570> EDC

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110
