we<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.050> see<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.679> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> honeycomb

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
we can see that this is the honeycomb

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.509 
we can see that this is the honeycomb
three-point<00:01:00.149> all<00:01:00.710> interface<00:01:01.710> basically<00:01:02.339> it's

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
three-point all interface basically it's

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.010 
three-point all interface basically it's
not<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> much<00:01:03.210> different<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:06.020> user

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
not that much different from the user

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
not that much different from the user
experience<00:01:07.320> solely<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.549> will<00:01:08.700> take

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
experience solely you will take

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.110 
experience solely you will take
sometimes<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.630> used<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:24.310 

here<00:01:16.120> we<00:01:16.300> had<00:01:16.450> to

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.480 

issues<00:01:25.320> whatever

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
issues whatever

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.440 
issues whatever
we<00:01:28.490> can<00:01:28.670> see<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:28.969> there's<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.240> line<00:01:29.420> between

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
we can see that there's a line between

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
we can see that there's a line between
so<00:01:30.319> it's<00:01:30.499> easier<00:01:30.829> for<00:01:30.859> us<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.130> track

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
so it's easier for us to track

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.350 
so it's easier for us to track
the<00:01:33.090> country<00:01:33.450> from<00:01:33.660> each

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
