that down so you can take a look at the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.789 
that down so you can take a look at the
traction<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:14.720> I'm<00:01:14.990> gonna<00:01:15.080> compare<00:01:15.470> it<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.680> the

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
traction and I'm gonna compare it to the

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.440 
traction and I'm gonna compare it to the
next<00:01:16.070> one<00:01:16.250> in<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.369> line<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:16.729> is<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.909> venture

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
next one in the line this is the venture

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.840 
next one in the line this is the venture
so<00:01:17.869> we're<00:01:18.049> moving<00:01:18.140> up<00:01:18.380> one<00:01:18.590> step<00:01:19.369> in<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.579> tubs

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
so we're moving up one step in the tubs

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.969 
so we're moving up one step in the tubs
line<00:01:20.119> up<00:01:20.329> and<00:01:20.509> first<00:01:21.320> thing<00:01:21.439> you'll<00:01:21.590> notice<00:01:21.710> a

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
line up and first thing you'll notice a

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.770 
line up and first thing you'll notice a
little<00:01:22.220> more<00:01:22.340> traction<00:01:22.670> so<00:01:23.360> here<00:01:23.600> you're

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
tail drops when you take your foot when

and<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.850> idea<00:03:15.150> here<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.660> can<00:03:15.900> kind<00:03:16.080> of

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
and the idea here is you can kind of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.140 
and the idea here is you can kind of
step<00:03:16.290> over<00:03:16.560> obstacles<00:03:16.710> a<00:03:17.340> little<00:03:17.880> easier

step over obstacles a little easier

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.710 
step over obstacles a little easier
perhaps<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:19.410> just<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.740> different<00:03:20.040> philosophy

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
perhaps it's just a different philosophy

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.880 
perhaps it's just a different philosophy
but<00:03:21.720> one<00:03:21.870> thing<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.170> certainly<00:03:22.380> does<00:03:22.680> is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
but one thing that certainly does is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.010 
but one thing that certainly does is
give<00:03:23.040> great<00:03:23.430> articulation<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.600> binding

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
give great articulation on that binding

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.840 
give great articulation on that binding
you<00:03:25.200> can<00:03:25.350> see<00:03:25.560> how<00:03:25.980> your<00:03:26.220> foot<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:26.610> to

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
you can see how your foot is going to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.690 
you can see how your foot is going to
sort<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.540> naturally<00:03:28.260> land<00:03:28.470> as<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.310> turning

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
sort of naturally land as a turning

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.780

frame<00:03:33.030> nice<00:03:33.600> soft<00:03:33.930> decking<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.530> it's<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.710> pretty

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
frame nice soft decking so it's a pretty

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.040

appropriate for you obviously you know
men's<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:20.820> women's<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.180> pretty

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
men's and women's is pretty

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.969 
men's and women's is pretty
straightforward<00:04:21.840> but<00:04:22.229> when<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.590> comes<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.890> the

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
straightforward but when it comes to the

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.190 
straightforward but when it comes to the
size<00:04:23.190> consider<00:04:23.790> what<00:04:24.000> you

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
size consider what you

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.140 
size consider what you
on<00:04:24.530> your<00:04:24.650> back<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.130> how<00:04:25.430> your<00:04:25.580> overall<00:04:25.940> weight

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
on your back and how your overall weight

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.320 
on your back and how your overall weight
to<00:04:26.600> determine<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.020> right<00:04:27.170> size<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.790> last<00:04:29.090> two

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
to determine the right size the last two

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.770 
to determine the right size the last two
snowshoes<00:04:29.870> are<00:04:30.490> molded<00:04:31.490> so<00:04:32.000> one<00:04:32.240> difference

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
snowshoes are molded so one difference

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.210 
snowshoes are molded so one difference
you'll<00:04:32.960> notice<00:04:33.320> there<00:04:33.710> are<00:04:33.770> sort<00:04:34.100> of<00:04:34.130> a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
you'll notice there are sort of a

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.940 
you'll notice there are sort of a
plastic<00:04:34.670> material<00:04:34.790> versus<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.900> sort<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.590> more

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
plastic material versus the sort of more

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.530 
plastic material versus the sort of more
traditional<00:04:37.030> frame<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.240> decking<00:04:38.510> material

traditional frame and decking material

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.440 
traditional frame and decking material
design<00:04:39.230> I'll<00:04:40.190> start<00:04:40.520> with<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.700> MSR<00:04:41.150> they<00:04:41.390> were

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
design I'll start with the MSR they were

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.210 
design I'll start with the MSR they were
the<00:04:41.660> first<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.080> we've<00:04:42.260> carried<00:04:42.560> at<00:04:42.710> least<00:04:42.860> to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
the first that we've carried at least to

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.160 
the first that we've carried at least to
offer<00:04:43.400> this<00:04:43.670> and<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.240> idea<00:04:44.540> is<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:44.810> shoe<00:04:45.020> has

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
offer this and the idea is that shoe has

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.530 
offer this and the idea is that shoe has
a<00:04:45.200> ton<00:04:45.500> of<00:04:45.530> twist<00:04:46.070> and<00:04:46.270> articulation<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.390> as

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
a ton of twist and articulation so as

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.960 
a ton of twist and articulation so as
you're<00:04:47.780> moving<00:04:48.320> along<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:49.040> shoe<00:04:49.400> can<00:04:49.640> sort<00:04:49.880> of

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
you're moving along the shoe can sort of

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.700 
you're moving along the shoe can sort of
you<00:04:50.750> know<00:04:50.870> mold<00:04:51.170> to<00:04:51.560> shape<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.250> terrain<00:04:52.580> and

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
you know mold to shape the terrain and

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.260 
you know mold to shape the terrain and
