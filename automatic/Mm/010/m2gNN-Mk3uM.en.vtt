00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.689
 Zugspitze 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.559
 Around half a million tourists climb the highest mountain each year 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.290
 Germany 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.910
 At just under 3000 meters, it weighs one of the most popular ski resorts in the country 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.810
 Skiing is still the classic winter trend sport 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.930
 I have to admit, I'm probably one of the last 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 People who can not ski but are said to be not too late for that 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.960
 and that's why I do not know unearthed while found over again 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.960
 bring 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.399
 Martin Harris ski instructor from Grainau the place directly at the foot of the Zugspitze 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
 At the age of three, Trier was on skis for the first time 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 why should I still continue to start skiing? 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.479
 In any case, it's fun and everyone can start 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.819
 OTP does not matter if the sixties will be one of the oldest that is the 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.990
 three key things that are important when skiing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 how he rates that »upper body goes forward 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.770
 and so that the knees are always bent forward 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.960
 and the arms laterally in front of a treasure trove of fits 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.340
 I should be able to learn skiing very easily at the age of thirty 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.500
 No explains Victor 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 it's hard to run here 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 Martin Heine not only teaches skiing to children and young people 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.650
 but also seniors she actively calls herself the whole then and the departures 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 are limited to rather flat slopes 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.580
 I start on a light track 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.039
 Trierweiler Werder 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.039
 we will try our percent 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.229
 ask 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.769
 I have some difficulties with the corners and that though 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.709
 today's carving-skis are much shorter than the classic alpine ski and themselves 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.209
 easier to control 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.629
 ca in one 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.249
 that's all exceeded where is a jerk go and visit 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 normal 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.879
 and only when Martin played the steam loco works well with the runners 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.339
 14 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:01.749
 get hurt 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.179
 this met 43 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.569
 one refers 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.569
 Langenfelds are 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.419
 March on the one hand, we take a little break 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.819
 the ski area at the Zugspitze is right with 22 kilometers of track length 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.459
 Small but scenic one of the most beautiful in the Alps region 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 and then I'm ready for the first descent 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.169
 this is a blue piste so the easiest category 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 for beginners they me 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.960
 the athlete he pushes has made career Philipp Löpfe 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.520
 he used responsible doctor in love he thinks it makes sense 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.179
 to choose from 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.179
 and closures quarter of the money 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.659
 spö and övp can and must do this in the right direction 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.369
 they could have shepherd me 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:09.529
 a question still really fun i will not be honest i have 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.569
 some of the show already that my niece's winter sports are 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.519
 not bad 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.799
 but after training I have some soreness 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.160
 at lunchtime for the last departure of the day the trailed
