have to face this first base I'm look at

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.410 
have to face this first base I'm look at
this<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> first<00:01:17.939> thing<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.150> notice<00:01:18.360> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this one and the first thing I notice is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.539 
this one and the first thing I notice is
the<00:01:18.570> mortars<00:01:18.930> outside<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.830> mortars<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> only

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the mortars outside the mortars the only

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
the mortars outside the mortars the only
thing<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> these<00:01:21.000> early<00:01:21.180> bartsch<00:01:21.600> raids

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
thing in these early bartsch raids

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.660 
thing in these early bartsch raids
that's<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> problem<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that's really going to be a problem so I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.800 
that's really going to be a problem so I
throw<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> barbs<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.330> actually<00:01:24.630> shouldn't

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
throw the barbs out actually shouldn't

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.570 
throw the barbs out actually shouldn't
have<00:01:24.960> thrown<00:01:25.170> those<00:01:25.350> archers<00:01:25.740> yet<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.400> does

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
have thrown those archers yet it does

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.980 
have thrown those archers yet it does
get<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:26.970> shot<00:01:27.210> off<00:01:27.390> right<00:01:27.600> there<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.869> it's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
get one shot off right there but it's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
get one shot off right there but it's
just<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.320> five<00:01:28.560> archers<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.400> think

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
just like five archers that it's I think

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.880 
just like five archers that it's I think
six<00:01:29.850> maybe<00:01:30.060> max<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> don't<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.710> any

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
six maybe max and now I don't see any

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.410 
six maybe max and now I don't see any
other<00:01:32.040> Splash<00:01:32.430> Damage<00:01:32.460> buildings<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.299> this

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
other Splash Damage buildings of this

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
other Splash Damage buildings of this
entire<00:01:33.750> base<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.009> drop<00:01:35.220> all<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.579> our

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
entire base so we can drop all of our

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980 
entire base so we can drop all of our
barbs<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.060> all<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> our<00:01:36.390> archers<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.840> one

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
barbs and all of our archers in one

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.300 
barbs and all of our archers in one
place<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.530> they're<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.950> okay

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
place and they're going to be okay

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.960 
place and they're going to be okay
because<00:01:39.860> yeah<00:01:40.860> nothing<00:01:41.220> splash<00:01:41.460> damage<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because yeah nothing splash damage the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
because yeah nothing splash damage the
only<00:01:42.270> thing<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.540> could<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.780> splash<00:01:43.170> damage

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
only thing that could be splash damage

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
only thing that could be splash damage
would<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> trap<00:01:44.130> however<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:44.700> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
would be a trap however it looks like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
would be a trap however it looks like
the<00:01:45.000> base<00:01:45.180> was<00:01:45.390> recently<00:01:45.780> attacked<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.560> there

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
the base was recently attacked and there

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
the base was recently attacked and there
are<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.610> very<00:01:47.640> many<00:01:47.909> gaps<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> base<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
are not very many gaps in the base so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.690 
are not very many gaps in the base so
we're<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.439> going<00:01:49.680> for<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> one<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.310> again

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

a few days it's time to just redo this

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.350 
a few days it's time to just redo this
base<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.160> when<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:51.580> comes<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.850> this<00:02:51.970> base<00:02:52.180> here

that<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.390> can<00:02:55.450> build<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.320> I'm<00:02:56.500> kind<00:02:56.920> of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
that I can build but this is I'm kind of

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.320 
that I can build but this is I'm kind of
looking<00:02:57.160> at<00:02:57.430> these<00:02:57.550> because<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.820> haven't<00:02:58.030> seen

enjoyed this speed build uh it's nothing

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.720 
enjoyed this speed build uh it's nothing
too<00:04:23.630> crazy<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.710> was<00:04:24.830> my<00:04:24.950> first<00:04:25.190> attempt<00:04:25.640> with

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
too crazy it was my first attempt with

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.460 
too crazy it was my first attempt with
this<00:04:25.880> number<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.300> walls<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:27.050> see<00:04:27.230> what<00:04:27.350> i<00:04:27.380> could

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
this number of walls to see what i could

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.080 
this number of walls to see what i could
build<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.010> i<00:04:28.040> kind<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.370> started<00:04:28.490> with<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.790> core

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
build so i kind of started with a core

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.460 
build so i kind of started with a core
that<00:04:29.240> i<00:04:29.330> would<00:04:29.480> have<00:04:29.570> used<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.960> normal<00:04:30.200> base

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
that i would have used in a normal base

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.680 
that i would have used in a normal base
I<00:04:30.710> just<00:04:30.920> had<00:04:31.310> less<00:04:31.550> walls<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.120> it<00:04:32.480> kind<00:04:32.660> of

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
I just had less walls and it kind of

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.200 
I just had less walls and it kind of
worked<00:04:32.750> out<00:04:33.020> all<00:04:33.260> my<00:04:33.380> defenses<00:04:33.830> are<00:04:34.210> somewhat

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
worked out all my defenses are somewhat

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.550
