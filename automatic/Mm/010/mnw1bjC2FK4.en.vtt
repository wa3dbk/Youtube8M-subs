this guitar this does have the rear

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.100 
this guitar this does have the rear
shifted<00:04:42.930> x<00:04:44.180> adirondack<00:04:45.180> braces<00:04:45.750> in<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:45.990> that

shifting<00:04:48.000> on<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.480> believe<00:04:48.510> adds<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.110> little

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
shifting on this I believe adds a little

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.430 
shifting on this I believe adds a little
bit<00:04:49.380> more<00:04:49.500> butt<00:04:49.890> end<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.430> guitar<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.750> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
bit more butt end to this guitar the the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.200 
bit more butt end to this guitar the the
bass<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.890> very<00:04:53.190> impressive<00:04:53.640> out<00:04:53.940> of<00:04:54.060> this

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
bass is very impressive out of this

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.000 
bass is very impressive out of this
guitar<00:04:54.390> but<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.050> got<00:04:55.230> equally<00:04:55.650> impressive

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
guitar but it's got equally impressive

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.540 
guitar but it's got equally impressive
top-end<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:57.270> believe<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.290> VTS<00:04:58.890> treatment

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
top-end I believe that the VTS treatment

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.520 
top-end I believe that the VTS treatment
as<00:04:59.640> well<00:04:59.790> as<00:04:59.850> just<00:05:00.240> Martin's<00:05:00.660> craftsmanship

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
as well as just Martin's craftsmanship

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.470 
as well as just Martin's craftsmanship
has<00:05:01.740> really<00:05:02.040> alleviated<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:03.000> lot<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.330> the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
has really alleviated a lot of the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.230 
has really alleviated a lot of the
initial<00:05:04.440> tightness<00:05:05.070> and<00:05:05.400> brightness<00:05:06.030> that

initial tightness and brightness that

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.580 
initial tightness and brightness that
you<00:05:06.300> tend<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.690> get<00:05:06.810> out<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.080> a<00:05:07.140> brand-new
