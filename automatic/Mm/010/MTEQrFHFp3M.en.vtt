00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.550 

the<00:00:15.950> dimensions<00:00:16.400> of<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.609> case<00:00:16.789> are<00:00:17.380> 390<00:00:18.380> by

the dimensions of the case are 390 by

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.400 
the dimensions of the case are 390 by
403<00:00:19.279> by<00:00:19.430> a<00:00:19.460> 265<00:00:20.210> millimeter<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:21.140> is<00:00:21.289> the

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
403 by a 265 millimeter this is the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.140 
403 by a 265 millimeter this is the
front<00:00:21.619> of<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.770> case<00:00:21.949> the<00:00:22.279> front<00:00:22.550> is<00:00:22.759> a<00:00:22.789> really

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
front of the case the front is a really

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.200 
front of the case the front is a really
nice<00:00:23.330> metal<00:00:23.900> mesh<00:00:24.369> backed<00:00:25.369> by<00:00:25.669> a<00:00:25.700> dust<00:00:26.029> filter

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
nice metal mesh backed by a dust filter

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.600 
nice metal mesh backed by a dust filter
the<00:00:26.630> front<00:00:26.869> is<00:00:26.960> easily<00:00:27.320> removable<00:00:27.770> but<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
the front is easily removable but the

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.159 
the front is easily removable but the
dust<00:00:28.820> filter<00:00:29.119> is<00:00:29.180> built<00:00:29.360> into<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.720> front<00:00:29.960> so

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
dust filter is built into the front so

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.929 
dust filter is built into the front so
cleaning<00:00:31.039> it's<00:00:31.189> going<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.460> be<00:00:31.520> a<00:00:31.550> little<00:00:31.820> bit

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
cleaning it's going to be a little bit

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.790 
cleaning it's going to be a little bit
of<00:00:32.029> a<00:00:32.090> headache<00:00:32.270> but<00:00:32.630> because<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.380> front<00:00:33.649> is

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
of a headache but because the front is

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.950 
of a headache but because the front is
so<00:00:33.950> easily<00:00:34.370> removable<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.360> not<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:35.870> that

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
so easily removable it's not really that

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.979 
so easily removable it's not really that

two and a half inch drive bays this size

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.800 
two and a half inch drive bays this size
is<00:01:25.340> pretty<00:01:25.610> nondescript<00:01:25.880> there's<00:01:26.510> not<00:01:26.630> really

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
is pretty nondescript there's not really

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.810 
is pretty nondescript there's not really
a<00:01:26.900> lot<00:01:27.080> going<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.440> with<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.680> it's<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.580> blank

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
a lot going on with it it's just a blank

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.060 
a lot going on with it it's just a blank
side<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:29.990> let's<00:01:30.170> take<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.350> look<00:01:30.500> at<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.710> inside

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
side so let's take a look at the inside

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.520 
side so let's take a look at the inside
as<00:01:31.370> I<00:01:32.180> take<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.480> side<00:01:32.660> panel<00:01:33.020> off<00:01:33.110> one<00:01:33.380> thing

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
as I take the side panel off one thing

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.260 
as I take the side panel off one thing
that<00:01:33.680> I<00:01:33.740> noticed<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.700> build<00:01:34.970> quality

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
that I noticed is that the build quality

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.290 
that I noticed is that the build quality
on<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.750> thing<00:01:35.990> is<00:01:36.200> is<00:01:36.380> pretty<00:01:36.890> crazy

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
on this thing is is pretty crazy

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.110 
on this thing is is pretty crazy
there<00:01:38.630> are<00:01:38.840> rivets<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.590> screws<00:01:40.120> everywhere

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
there are rivets and screws everywhere

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.450 
there are rivets and screws everywhere
and<00:01:41.420> within<00:01:42.110> taking<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.620> side<00:01:42.770> off<00:01:42.980> normally

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
and within taking the side off normally

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.430 
and within taking the side off normally
you<00:01:43.580> feel<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.210> case<00:01:44.450> flex<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.080> little<00:01:45.290> bit

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
you feel that the case flex a little bit

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.830 
you feel that the case flex a little bit
this<00:01:45.920> case<00:01:46.160> did<00:01:46.400> not<00:01:46.430> flex<00:01:46.790> at<00:01:46.940> all<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:47.300> don't

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
this case did not flex at all I don't

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.240 
this case did not flex at all I don't
know<00:01:47.930> if<00:01:48.020> that's<00:01:48.170> because<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.740> handles<00:01:49.130> on

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
know if that's because of the handles on

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.770 
know if that's because of the handles on
top<00:01:49.460> they're<00:01:49.700> actually<00:01:49.940> made<00:01:50.090> out<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.300> plastic

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
top they're actually made out of plastic

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.330 
top they're actually made out of plastic
but<00:01:51.050> they're<00:01:51.230> screwed<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.740> mounted<00:01:52.100> directly

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
but they're screwed and mounted directly

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.420 
but they're screwed and mounted directly
into<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.090> end<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.510> case<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.830> I'm<00:01:55.190> not

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
into the end of the case so I'm not

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.190 
into the end of the case so I'm not
really<00:01:55.550> sure<00:01:55.790> but<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.450> side<00:01:56.630> panel<00:01:56.960> really

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
really sure but the side panel really

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.600 
really sure but the side panel really
did<00:01:57.380> not<00:01:57.470> want<00:01:57.650> to<00:01:57.680> let<00:01:57.830> go<00:01:57.980> but<00:01:58.220> that's<00:01:58.400> what's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
did not want to let go but that's what's

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.300 
did not want to let go but that's what's
something<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:59.030> like<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.570> case<00:01:59.810> now<00:02:00.800> inside

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
something I like about a case now inside

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.030 
something I like about a case now inside
this<00:02:01.940> layout<00:02:02.420> looks<00:02:02.780> familiar<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:03.920> know

this layout looks familiar and you know
astute<00:02:04.400> observers<00:02:04.910> may<00:02:05.090> recognize<00:02:05.570> this

layout<00:02:06.110> from<00:02:06.380> another<00:02:06.800> case<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
layout from another case this is the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.600 
layout from another case this is the

motherboard tray the motherboard tray

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.320 
motherboard tray the motherboard tray
will<00:02:10.849> hold<00:02:11.060> micro<00:02:11.540> ATX<00:02:11.720> or<00:02:12.290> mini<00:02:12.620> ITX<00:02:13.330> there's

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
will hold micro ATX or mini ITX there's

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.850

actually<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.720> lot<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.959> room<00:02:15.140> in<00:02:15.319> here<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> didn't

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
actually a lot of room in here I didn't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.470 
actually a lot of room in here I didn't
think<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.430> would<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.940> lot<00:02:17.180> of<00:02:17.209> room

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
think that there would be a lot of room

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.479 
think that there would be a lot of room
with<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> micro<00:02:18.230> ATX<00:02:18.319> motherboard<00:02:18.980> for<00:02:19.159> cable

with a micro ATX motherboard for cable

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.190 
with a micro ATX motherboard for cable
routing<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.849> things<00:02:20.030> like<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.360> but<00:02:20.989> the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
routing and things like that but the

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.370 
routing and things like that but the
cable<00:02:21.560> routing<00:02:21.709> inside<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.400> case<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.879> genius

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
cable routing inside this case is genius

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.750 
cable routing inside this case is genius
there's<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.440> 5<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.800> 1/4<00:02:24.950> inch<00:02:25.190> by<00:02:25.340> in<00:02:25.460> the<00:02:25.550> top

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
the top I don't think you would have any

the top I don't think you would have any

you know of course there H 100 I
something<00:02:36.760> like<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.120> in<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.110> bottom<00:02:38.230> we've

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
something like that in the bottom we've

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.630 
something like that in the bottom we've
got<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> tool<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.069> three<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.370> half<00:02:39.490> inch

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
got the tool is three and a half inch

bays and the mount for the power supply
now<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> power<00:02:42.490> supply<00:02:42.790> also<00:02:43.180> has<00:02:43.420> these<00:02:43.780> four

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
now the power supply also has these four

you want to call them which is another
nice<00:02:49.480> added<00:02:50.020> touch<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> know<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.940> kind

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
nice added touch now I know this is kind

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.880 
nice added touch now I know this is kind
of<00:02:52.180> dark<00:02:52.420> but<00:02:52.840> that's<00:02:53.170> because<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.650> thing<00:02:53.860> is

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
of dark but that's because this thing is

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.800 
of dark but that's because this thing is
powder<00:02:54.220> coated<00:02:54.640> everywhere<00:02:55.150> with<00:02:55.390> some<00:02:55.570> sort

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
of crazy photon absorbing paint so we're

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.760 
of crazy photon absorbing paint so we're
going<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.780> take<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.020> other<00:02:59.050> side<00:02:59.350> off<00:02:59.560> so<00:02:59.739> that

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
going to take the other side off so that

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.930 
going to take the other side off so that
you<00:02:59.950> can<00:03:00.100> get<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.250> better<00:03:00.430> look

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
you can get a better look

drive bay this is what we saw when we
looked<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.700> back<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.180> really<00:03:10.540> nice

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
looked at the back this is really nice

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360 
looked at the back this is really nice
because<00:03:11.019> you've<00:03:11.290> got<00:03:11.410> good<00:03:11.620> airflow<00:03:11.860> over

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
because you've got good airflow over

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.600 
because you've got good airflow over
those<00:03:12.820> drives<00:03:13.360> there's<00:03:14.170> two<00:03:14.530> there<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.400> feel

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
those drives there's two there I feel

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
those drives there's two there I feel
like<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.850> probably<00:03:15.880> could<00:03:16.300> have<00:03:16.390> fit<00:03:16.600> a

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
like they probably could have fit a

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.140 
like they probably could have fit a
third<00:03:16.989> or<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> fourth<00:03:17.410> one<00:03:17.620> in<00:03:17.769> there<00:03:17.920> maybe<00:03:18.280> but

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
third or a fourth one in there maybe but

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.360 
third or a fourth one in there maybe but
there's<00:03:19.450> two<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:19.959> cable<00:03:20.440> routing<00:03:20.800> is<00:03:20.980> not

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
there's two so cable routing is not

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.880 
there's two so cable routing is not
really<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> big<00:03:21.850> deal<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.900> area<00:03:23.470> where<00:03:23.800> the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
really a big deal in this area where the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.830 
really a big deal in this area where the
cardboard<00:03:24.280> box<00:03:24.459> is<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:24.940> actually<00:03:25.360> really<00:03:25.600> good

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
cardboard box is is actually really good

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.350 
cardboard box is is actually really good
cable<00:03:26.350> routing<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:26.950> stashing<00:03:27.760> areas<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:28.269> you

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
cable routing and stashing areas so you

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.580 
cable routing and stashing areas so you
get<00:03:28.480> all<00:03:28.600> those<00:03:28.810> wires<00:03:29.050> that<00:03:29.320> come<00:03:29.440> off<00:03:29.560> the

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
get all those wires that come off the

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.620 
get all those wires that come off the
power<00:03:29.860> supply<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.550> all<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> wires<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.570> go

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
power supply and all the wires that go

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.539 
power supply and all the wires that go
to<00:03:31.780> your<00:03:31.930> drives<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.890> can<00:03:33.070> mount<00:03:33.190> your<00:03:33.280> hard

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
to your drives you can mount your hard

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.789 
to your drives you can mount your hard
drive<00:03:33.760> so<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.299> the<00:03:34.450> cables<00:03:35.140> are<00:03:35.320> at<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> back

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
drive so that the cables are at the back

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.470 
drive so that the cables are at the back
here<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.579> front<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.910> your<00:03:37.030> drive<00:03:37.209> is<00:03:37.420> on

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
here and the front of your drive is on

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.270 
here and the front of your drive is on
the<00:03:37.600> other<00:03:37.720> side<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.680> same<00:03:38.890> with<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.130> two

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
the other side and the same with the two

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.039 
the other side and the same with the two
and<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> half<00:03:39.579> inch<00:03:39.790> drives<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.360> so<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:40.810> this

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
and a half inch drives and so all this

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.170 
and a half inch drives and so all this
area<00:03:41.380> ends<00:03:41.980> up<00:03:42.070> being<00:03:42.310> your<00:03:42.579> cable<00:03:42.970> management

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
area ends up being your cable management

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.390 
area ends up being your cable management
area<00:03:43.780> which<00:03:44.230> gives<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.650> lot<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.040> room<00:03:45.370> for

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
area which gives you a lot of room for

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.039 
area which gives you a lot of room for
cable<00:03:45.910> management<00:03:45.940> which<00:03:46.480> is<00:03:46.600> really<00:03:46.900> nice

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
cable management which is really nice

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.600 
cable management which is really nice
and<00:03:47.320> will<00:03:47.470> help<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.709> keep<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.040> inside<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.549> the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
and will help you keep the inside of the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.699 
and will help you keep the inside of the
case<00:03:48.790> really<00:03:49.090> tidy<00:03:49.480> just<00:03:50.110> like<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.410> front<00:03:50.560> of

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
case really tidy just like the front of

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.729 
case really tidy just like the front of
the<00:03:50.799> case<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.610> top<00:03:51.880> also<00:03:52.239> has<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.260> metal

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
the case the top also has this metal

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.850 
the case the top also has this metal
mesh<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.820> dust<00:03:55.299> filter<00:03:55.690> behind<00:03:56.049> it<00:03:56.230> now

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
mesh with the dust filter behind it now

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.130 
mesh with the dust filter behind it now
the<00:03:57.310> one<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.850> top<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.360> held<00:03:58.930> in<00:03:59.049> place

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
the one on top is held in place

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.660 
the one on top is held in place
magnetically<00:03:59.860> so<00:03:59.980> it's<00:04:00.100> really<00:04:00.220> easily

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
magnetically so it's really easily

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.580 
magnetically so it's really easily
removable<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.780> big<00:04:01.930> silver<00:04:02.140> thing<00:04:02.440> is

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
removable and the big silver thing is

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.530 
removable and the big silver thing is
the<00:04:02.709> power<00:04:02.860> button<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:04.000> power<00:04:04.209> button

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the power button the power button

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180 
the power button the power button
unfortunately<00:04:05.140> doesn't<00:04:05.350> click<00:04:05.799> very

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
unfortunately doesn't click very

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.610 
unfortunately doesn't click very
satisfyingly<00:04:07.060> but<00:04:07.450> I<00:04:07.690> don't<00:04:08.290> think<00:04:08.440> that's

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
satisfyingly but I don't think that's

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.319 
satisfyingly but I don't think that's
really<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.920> big<00:04:09.130> deal<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.610> is<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.850> really<00:04:10.180> nice

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
really a big deal it is a really nice

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.479 
really a big deal it is a really nice
texture<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.140> it's<00:04:11.620> got<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> little<00:04:12.100> divot<00:04:12.310> for

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
texture and it's got a little divot for

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.970 
texture and it's got a little divot for
making<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.420> easy<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.780> remove<00:04:14.079> because<00:04:14.829> it's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
making it easy to remove because it's

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.640 
making it easy to remove because it's
magnetic<00:04:15.130> it'll<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.880> pop<00:04:16.150> out<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.470> that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
magnetic it'll just pop out so that

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.960 
magnetic it'll just pop out so that
one's<00:04:17.829> going<00:04:17.979> to<00:04:18.039> be<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.190> lot<00:04:18.370> easier<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.700> clean

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
one's going to be a lot easier to clean

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.400 
one's going to be a lot easier to clean
than<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.180> one<00:04:19.299> on<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.510> front<00:04:19.630> although<00:04:20.289> I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
than the one on the front although I

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.509 
than the one on the front although I
think<00:04:20.530> most<00:04:20.680> people<00:04:21.100> would<00:04:21.190> have<00:04:21.370> this

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
think most people would have this

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.730 
think most people would have this
configured<00:04:22.030> as<00:04:22.240> an<00:04:22.360> exhaust<00:04:22.720> now<00:04:23.260> with<00:04:23.590> the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
configured as an exhaust now with the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.080 
configured as an exhaust now with the
top<00:04:23.890> removed<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.430> can<00:04:24.460> really<00:04:24.850> see<00:04:25.060> that

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
top removed you can really see that

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.940 
top removed you can really see that
you've<00:04:25.390> got<00:04:25.510> a<00:04:25.539> lot<00:04:25.720> of<00:04:25.780> room<00:04:26.020> here<00:04:26.050> for<00:04:26.289> a<00:04:26.470> 120

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
you've got a lot of room here for a 120

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.490 
you've got a lot of room here for a 120
140<00:04:27.340> millimeter<00:04:27.850> radiator<00:04:28.330> although<00:04:29.110> if<00:04:29.410> you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
140 millimeter radiator although if you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.050 
140 millimeter radiator although if you
did<00:04:29.650> install<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.010> fan<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.430> radiator<00:04:30.490> it's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
did install a fan and radiator it's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.279 
did install a fan and radiator it's
going<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.270> block<00:04:31.510> your<00:04:31.750> five<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.140> quarter

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
going to block your five and a quarter

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.840 
going to block your five and a quarter
inch<00:04:32.440> Bay<00:04:32.800> one<00:04:33.310> of<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:33.460> really<00:04:33.669> impressive

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
inch Bay one of the really impressive

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.640 
inch Bay one of the really impressive
things<00:04:34.240> about<00:04:34.419> this<00:04:34.570> case<00:04:34.810> is<00:04:35.050> that<00:04:35.080> even

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
things about this case is that even

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.500 
things about this case is that even
though<00:04:35.770> it's<00:04:35.950> small<00:04:36.099> you<00:04:36.280> can<00:04:36.700> still<00:04:36.970> fit<00:04:37.300> a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
though it's small you can still fit a

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.860 
though it's small you can still fit a
