free trial and you can try it out and it
works<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.180> bit<00:04:23.210> different<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.659> your<00:04:23.779> normal

cell<00:04:24.229> our<00:04:24.320> navigation<00:04:24.830> software

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
cell our navigation software

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.060 
cell our navigation software
the<00:04:26.960> maps<00:04:27.169> are<00:04:27.320> stored<00:04:27.620> on<00:04:27.680> your<00:04:27.830> memory<00:04:28.040> card

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
the maps are stored on your memory card

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.620 
the maps are stored on your memory card
so<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.460> don't<00:04:28.490> need<00:04:28.699> a<00:04:28.760> huge<00:04:28.910> memory<00:04:29.300> card<00:04:29.510> to

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
so you don't need a huge memory card to

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.379 
so you don't need a huge memory card to
use<00:04:29.840> it<00:04:30.050> but<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:31.100> do<00:04:31.310> need<00:04:31.520> kind<00:04:32.330> of

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
use it but you do need kind of

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.290 
use it but you do need kind of
all-you-can-eat<00:04:33.260> package<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:33.770> your<00:04:33.800> on<00:04:34.190> your

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
all-you-can-eat package on your on your

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.930 
all-you-can-eat package on your on your
GPRS<00:04:35.300> radio<00:04:35.720> a<00:04:35.780> 3G<00:04:36.260> connection<00:04:36.290> because<00:04:37.040> the

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
GPRS radio a 3G connection because the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.430 
GPRS radio a 3G connection because the
maps<00:04:38.120> are<00:04:38.270> still<00:04:38.419> essentially<00:04:38.840> on<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.169> kind<00:04:39.380> of

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
maps are still essentially on a kind of

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.219 
maps are still essentially on a kind of
orange<00:04:39.650> server<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:41.240> as<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:41.479> plan<00:04:41.660> a<00:04:41.690> route<00:04:41.900> it

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
orange server and as you plan a route it

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.840 
orange server and as you plan a route it
basically<00:04:42.590> calls<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.979> maps<00:04:43.190> as<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.699> need

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
basically calls the maps as you need

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.520 
basically calls the maps as you need
them<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.360> don't<00:04:44.510> need<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.169> whole<00:04:45.320> of<00:04:45.470> the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
them so you don't need the whole of the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.010 
them so you don't need the whole of the
UK<00:04:45.680> for<00:04:46.010> example<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.669> be<00:04:46.790> able<00:04:46.880> to<00:04:47.090> to<00:04:47.810> plan<00:04:47.990> a

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
UK for example to be able to to plan a

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.480 
UK for example to be able to to plan a
route<00:04:48.199> but<00:04:48.500> just<00:04:48.800> grab<00:04:49.010> the<00:04:49.130> maps<00:04:49.310> that<00:04:49.430> you

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
route but just grab the maps that you

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.460 
route but just grab the maps that you
require<00:04:49.850> quite<00:04:50.690> a<00:04:50.750> clever<00:04:50.870> solution<00:04:51.320> that

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
require quite a clever solution that

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.420 
require quite a clever solution that
means<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.680> they<00:04:51.770> can<00:04:51.889> update<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.280> maps

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
means that they can update the maps

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.680 
means that they can update the maps
whenever<00:04:52.699> they<00:04:52.820> want<00:04:53.000> without<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.389> having<00:04:53.600> to

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
whenever they want without you having to

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.240 
whenever they want without you having to
kind<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.960> download<00:04:54.500> a<00:04:54.530> whole<00:04:54.590> new<00:04:54.830> set<00:04:55.010> of<00:04:55.040> maps

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
kind of download a whole new set of maps

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.310 
kind of download a whole new set of maps
and<00:04:55.460> so<00:04:55.580> on<00:04:55.729> but<00:04:56.419> as<00:04:56.540> I<00:04:56.660> say<00:04:56.810> it<00:04:56.930> really<00:04:57.080> does

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
and so on but as I say it really does

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.800 
and so on but as I say it really does
kind<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.620> live<00:04:57.770> and<00:04:57.919> die<00:04:58.040> by<00:04:58.479> by<00:04:59.479> having<00:04:59.750> a

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
kind of live and die by by having a

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.510 
kind of live and die by by having a
decent<00:04:59.990> kind<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.500> data<00:05:00.680> tariff<00:05:01.100> you<00:05:01.190> haven't

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
decent kind of data tariff you haven't

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.370 
decent kind of data tariff you haven't
got<00:05:01.639> one<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.360> can't<00:05:02.720> see<00:05:02.840> anyone<00:05:03.050> using

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
got one I just can't see anyone using

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.690 
got one I just can't see anyone using
this<00:05:03.440> really<00:05:03.680> because<00:05:04.040> it<00:05:04.220> cost<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.550> an<00:05:04.639> arm

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
this really because it cost you an arm

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.100 
this really because it cost you an arm
and<00:05:04.880> I<00:05:04.910> laid<00:05:05.060> down<00:05:05.210> over<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.570> maps<00:05:05.720> every<00:05:05.870> two

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
and I laid down over the maps every two

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.520 
and I laid down over the maps every two
seconds<00:05:06.940> okay<00:05:07.940> seems<00:05:08.750> to<00:05:08.810> be<00:05:08.870> taking<00:05:09.169> its<00:05:09.320> time

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
seconds okay seems to be taking its time

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.680 
seconds okay seems to be taking its time
I'll<00:05:10.310> get<00:05:10.430> out<00:05:10.550> for<00:05:10.820> ice<00:05:10.970> 3G<00:05:11.450> but<00:05:11.720> hey<00:05:13.419> just<00:05:14.419> let

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
I'll get out for ice 3G but hey just let

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.100 
I'll get out for ice 3G but hey just let
up<00:05:14.840> again<00:05:15.550> okay<00:05:16.550> room<00:05:16.790> so<00:05:17.539> yeah<00:05:17.690> anyway<00:05:17.990> they

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
as port rate so yeah it works really

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.840 
as port rate so yeah it works really
well

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:09.850

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:24.320 
a whole range of things and the GPS is

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.470 
a whole range of things and the GPS is
just<00:07:24.710> just<00:07:25.070> takes<00:07:25.280> the<00:07:25.430> SPV<00:07:25.700> range<00:07:26.030> one<00:07:26.270> step

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
just just takes the SPV range one step

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.230 
just just takes the SPV range one step
further<00:07:26.630> really<00:07:27.430> it's<00:07:28.430> the<00:07:28.490> first<00:07:28.700> SPV<00:07:29.120> to

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
further really it's the first SPV to

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.840 
further really it's the first SPV to
have<00:07:29.390> GPS<00:07:30.380> built<00:07:30.620> into<00:07:30.890> it<00:07:31.040> and<00:07:31.550> it<00:07:31.670> works

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:31.850 
have GPS built into it and it works

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.490 
have GPS built into it and it works
really<00:07:32.060> well<00:07:32.150> as<00:07:32.360> well<00:07:32.510> kind<00:07:32.780> of<00:07:32.930> good<00:07:33.260> quick
