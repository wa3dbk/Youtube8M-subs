 is to clean purify the skin always 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.180
 dry it is worth mixed fat skins and with 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 tendency to make up 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 if there are also people who have acne 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 well I for a long time of the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.660
 adolescence I had enough arne in the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.430
 back 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.290
 they have told me that they have 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.190
 recommended that this is pretty 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.880
 good and this one has 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.360
 750 milliliters comes with your applicator 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.610
 perfume smells good is a smell 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.300
 pretty cool smells a lot a lot 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.410
 with menthol habit returns very well 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.970
 then the moisturizer is for 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.390
 Hydrate the skin intensively 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:22.080
 immediate and prolonged 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.080
 has this format 30 milliliters 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.200
 well in an applicator 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.909
 let's apply it 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.740
 with a white texture without perfume 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.320
 It's also worth to the people who have the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.539
 sensitive or allergic skin look now 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.190
 we totally go is that there is no 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.980
 nothing remains nothing 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.710
 of totally matt appearance and salt 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.050
 about super fast for the skins in 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.000
 The whole line is the same for skins 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.130
 mixed fats continence aneca 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.660
 this is the normal moisturizer and 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.090
 current there is another that the more 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 protective that that's a little bit more more 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.240
 strong more for facials 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.090
 aggressive for example you get some 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.430
 peeling or something for the skin because this is 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.340
 as a more hydrated is more intensive 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.340
 than the normal moisturizer 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.850
 the format is the same 30 milliliters 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.160
 80 milliliters during the 12 months the 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.620
 texture is exactly the same as 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.720
 Moisturizing cream is whitish worth 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.940
 it absorbs just as fast as it is more 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.840
 moisturizing the protective adelma that 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.680
 normal moisturizer is absorbed 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:59.120
 well the skin after this kit is worth 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.950
 that is the soap that is this and this 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.370
 is the moisturizer balance that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.530
 comes in the two formats as you can see 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.350
 it's tiny is the cream of so much and it 's 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.610
 that gel has 150 milliliters 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.170
 and this one has 50 good is clean in 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.570
 Depth the skin of the face without 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.790
 resect the also helps to eliminate 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.380
 small, light scars 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.450
 the little scars you have from 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.910
 acne that helps little by little good to the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.440
 long 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.440
 I'm touching it a little bit but 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.750
 well, I still have quite a 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.270
 long help here those scars like 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.700
 I'm losing the color and go 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.370
 losing a little texture so life does not 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.650
 and then the moisturizer 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.200
 balancing this is softer than the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.990
 moisturizer that teaches you donor 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.940
 then we have the makeup is the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.250
 liquid makeup fluid worth 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.230
 matifying the truth is that it stays 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.160
 super good on the skin the only thing is that the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.990
 color I have more dark period 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.970
 It's dark dark but I have left 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.500
 orange and I am very white like 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.830
 you can see but in addition to white I have 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.260
 the pink skin then but I 'm telling you 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.020
 there are three colors is very clear skins 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.080
 clear skins that is this that is for 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.660
 normal skins blanquita but rather 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.090
 Orange sallow and then to the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.910
 darker than not it is very dark 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.230
 but right now then the truth that 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.160
 it's very funny because it comes with its 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.390
 own sponge 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.100
 soft as you can see 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.460
 and the only thing to do is shake a 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.460
 bit 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.790
 and it comes with the applicator to me it seems 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.240
 I like vale has this applicator already 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.240
 you see 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.640
 what happens is that he did not use the 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.310
 sponge because I already have many of those 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:59.700
 successes that come then I feel sorry 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.550
 use it good I'm dark 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.440
 that could give the hit the truth is that 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.170
 yes and I really like a lot 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.790
 very much because the skin is matt 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.370
 effect you want like the baby's 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:16.320
 cream that stays the skin like as 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.350
 painted you do not notice the makeup you do not 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.080
 you wear it but it gives you color and it's 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.570
 covering a lot a lot is not because 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.610
 to be very very fluid the only thing is that 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.680
 you have to hurry to extend it if 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.520
 one is your color as it happens 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.470
 with me what 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.330
 you do not notice much but you see that it shows 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.120
 there is a little the blotch you have to 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.789
 hurry to extend it because it 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.550
 they dry very fast I'm here 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:45.789
 Cascardo could not and I can not 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.069
 extend it stays and the mansurrÃ³n that 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.080
 I think that if it were my color, 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.690
 nothing would happen either I do not say either 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.879
 you go running your rectors there 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.289
 everywhere but in the good that 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:59.009
 it has is that it dries very fast because 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.780
 it's like the skin absorbs it and 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:04.900
 ratifies all day long the only thing is 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:07.000
 the only downside that I see is that they do not last 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.349
 a lot and I for example is a person 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.060
 that little makeup lasts for me because 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.370
 I always keep my hand here rubbing 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.280
 the face that I do not know that with allergies 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.259
 it's all day with the handkerchiefs then 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.270
 I do not have much makeup and 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.979
 this last bit 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.930
 it's true that it lasts a little bit that you'll have 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:26.380
 to give you some retouching but the positive 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.980
 is that as it is absorbed so fast in 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.500
 any time you can touch up what 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.900
 let's go that comes in handy for 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.120
 take it in the format is not to carry 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.400
 in the bag but hey he's tiny he's 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.620
 of 35 milliliters comes a little bit more 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.350
 than the rest of normal makeups and 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.420
 currents 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.210
 and the truth is that I liked it a lot 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.190
 see if when I finish this because 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.990
 I will not use for the day because 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.090
 really at night I notice a lot 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.630
 more the color change but by day 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:59.180
 I will use it because I like it a lot already 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:02.540
 I say that the effect is totally matte 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.060
 but in healthy mate not the typical mate 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.930
 as powder has its brightness but a 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.090
 brightness 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.480
 this is satin maybe what would have 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.670
 Missing is having sunscreen 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.650
 I'm going to close in the first box 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.510
 I have not had sun protection for myself 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.830
 Taste because it is already what he lacked 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:23.630
 to be super good the makeup is worth 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.790
 so you can see all this line is 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.480
 available in pharmacy is absorbed very 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:31.930
 quick maybe the gel for my skin that 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:35.880
 happens my skin is normal and I say that 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:38.700
 except several 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.950
 in moments because I have skin a little 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.300
 great seriously to me this leaves me a 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.370
 little skin tightening improves skin 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.110
 when rise came with glycerine or is 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.020
 which is good for the skins really 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.490
 for the feet a skin is oily 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.990
 I think you have to dry the granites 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.570
 because I had one on my back and 

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.000
 after two or three days using it 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.100
 he looked at me and he had around like 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.460
 skin like it was drying 

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.170
 I recommend this granite 

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.630
 because I liked it a lot this has 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.430
 been all girls I hope that I have 

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:10.920
