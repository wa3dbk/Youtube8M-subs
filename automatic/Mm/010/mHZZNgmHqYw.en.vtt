 as for payment service and now 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.160
 let's look at a specific example 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.580
 how does it work click on the tab 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.810
 text activation 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.720
 let's say i need to register in 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.010
 such a social network as classmates 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.760
 Of course this service as you see 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.530
 asks me 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.750

 service classmates and click the tab 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.270
 get the number now awaiting issue 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.130
 number waiting time issue 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.310
 can be different from a minute to 10-15 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.990
 minutes well, here's the service provided to us as 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.750
 you see the Russian phone number 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.970
 Copy this number and paste into the window 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.790
 on the service classmates click 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.800
 send and now expect and the most with 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.530
 confirmation code click here on this 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.010
 tick timeout with can also be 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.500
 different 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.380
 here are minutes and even half an hour waiting for 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.510
 we copy it and paste it into the window 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.110
 on the service classmates and push 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.300
 activate 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.060
 as you see the system writes us what our 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.560
 profile has been successfully activated now 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.720
 we need to confirm completion 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.000
 operations clicked on this checkbox 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.520
 thereby we let the system know so 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.410
 say what is the phone number given to us 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.180
 we approached and we safely them 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.190
 took advantage after what will 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.009
 made to write off for 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.869
 the service provided to us 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.360
 I want to add that the nuances yet 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:03.309
 happen but their frequency is minimal 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.649
 for example, waiting can be delayed 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.599
 answer if you have not received a reply 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:09.759
 service within 20 minutes or received 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.589
 in half an hour, the probability that 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.629
 registration will be less successful 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:15.129
 in other words if something went wrong 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:16.930
 you can always refuse 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.089
 provided number reported it 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.639
 service for this need to click here 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:22.990
 This tab but situations are similar to this. 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.569
 happen very rarely 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.110
 I think that the service principle is 99 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.729
 percent works without any failures 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.039
 the only inconvenience though probably 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.610
 correct to say no inconvenience 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.319
 and working moments is to expect 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.899
 waiting for slim to answer or waiting for 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.330
 while the system is looking for us suitable 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:45.339
 free room but that's all 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.680
 here's a friend 

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:49.680

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.729
