difference it made no look at that
that's<00:02:41.920> actually<00:02:42.160> kind<00:02:42.460> of<00:02:42.490> funny

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
that's actually kind of funny

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
around of flow rates not really caring I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.940 
around of flow rates not really caring I
just<00:02:52.990> wanted<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> get<00:02:53.320> it<00:02:53.410> run<00:02:53.530> through<00:02:53.560> it

for<00:03:19.450> $8.00<00:03:20.230> from<00:03:21.010> princess<00:03:21.370> Auto<00:03:21.550> so<00:03:21.880> I'm<00:03:22.540> just

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
for $8.00 from princess Auto so I'm just

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.470 
for $8.00 from princess Auto so I'm just
going<00:03:22.870> to<00:03:22.900> show<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.410> action<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:24.070> and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
going to show you it in action here and

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.350 
going to show you it in action here and
let<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.600> see<00:03:25.750> how<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:25.930> works<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:27.360> generally

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
let you see how it works so generally

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.790 
let you see how it works so generally
what<00:03:28.480> I<00:03:28.540> would<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.870> is<00:03:28.989> just<00:03:29.019> crank<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:29.590> on

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
what I would do is just crank this on

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.250 
what I would do is just crank this on
full<00:03:30.660> but<00:03:31.660> what<00:03:31.870> I'm<00:03:31.959> gonna<00:03:32.110> do<00:03:32.410> instead<00:03:32.590> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
full but what I'm gonna do instead is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.780 
full but what I'm gonna do instead is
I'll<00:03:35.260> show<00:03:35.620> you<00:03:35.680> what<00:03:35.920> happens<00:03:36.340> when<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.580> use

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
I'll show you what happens when I use

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.750 
I'll show you what happens when I use
the<00:03:36.970> valve<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.540> can<00:03:37.840> see<00:03:38.190> it's<00:03:39.190> running<00:03:39.580> great

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the valve you can see it's running great

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.360 
the valve you can see it's running great
here<00:03:41.250> but<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.400> can<00:03:42.580> see<00:03:43.110> see<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.230> bit<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.650> V

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
here but you can see see the bit of a V

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.750 
here but you can see see the bit of a V
here<00:03:45.850> that's<00:03:46.269> that's<00:03:46.720> what<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.989> want<00:03:47.640> for<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
here that's that's what you want for the

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.759 
here that's that's what you want for the
optimal<00:03:49.209> setup<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:49.660> I<00:03:49.870> can<00:03:50.200> adjust<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.709> with

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
optimal setup now I can adjust that with

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.770 
optimal setup now I can adjust that with
the<00:03:50.950> water<00:03:51.160> flow<00:03:51.459> rate<00:03:51.489> how<00:03:51.880> long<00:03:52.120> that<00:03:52.360> V<00:03:52.570> is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
the water flow rate how long that V is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.720 
the water flow rate how long that V is
and<00:03:53.050> how<00:03:53.110> deep<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.560> water<00:03:53.590> is<00:03:53.860> but<00:03:54.280> I'm

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
and how deep the water is but I'm

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.360 
and how deep the water is but I'm
processing<00:03:55.090> very<00:03:55.630> fine<00:03:56.050> flower<00:03:56.590> gold<00:03:56.920> here<00:03:57.190> so

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
processing very fine flower gold here so

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.830 
processing very fine flower gold here so
I<00:03:57.400> don't<00:03:57.610> want<00:03:57.760> too<00:03:57.940> high<00:03:58.120> flow<00:03:58.420> rates<00:03:58.660> I'd

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
I don't want too high flow rates I'd

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.830 
I don't want too high flow rates I'd
rather<00:03:58.989> take<00:03:59.230> my<00:03:59.410> time<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.800> do<00:03:59.920> it<00:04:00.570> so<00:04:01.570> you<00:04:01.630> can

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
rather take my time and do it so you can

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
rather take my time and do it so you can
see<00:04:02.050> here<00:04:02.260> just<00:04:02.380> for<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> valve<00:04:02.920> for<00:04:03.250> example

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
see here just for the valve for example

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.110 
see here just for the valve for example
that<00:04:04.360> I'll<00:04:05.230> just<00:04:05.560> slowly<00:04:05.890> turn<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.400> off<00:04:06.550> but

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
that I'll just slowly turn it off but

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.120 
that I'll just slowly turn it off but
you<00:04:07.360> can<00:04:07.540> see<00:04:07.750> how<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:07.959> water<00:04:08.230> starts<00:04:08.709> to<00:04:08.860> slow

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
you can see how the water starts to slow

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.220 
you can see how the water starts to slow
down<00:04:09.310> but<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:10.030> actually<00:04:10.360> pressurizing<00:04:11.110> it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
down but it's actually pressurizing it

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.890 
down but it's actually pressurizing it
because<00:04:11.560> of<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.860> way<00:04:12.310> this<00:04:12.489> valve<00:04:12.820> works<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.660> I

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
because of the way this valve works so I

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.990 
because of the way this valve works so I
can<00:04:14.410> keep<00:04:14.590> adjusting<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:15.430> all<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.640> way<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:15.760> off

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
can keep adjusting it all the way to off

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.319 
can keep adjusting it all the way to off
and<00:04:16.870> then<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.290> can<00:04:17.320> slowly<00:04:17.709> turn<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.190> back<00:04:18.370> on

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
and then I can slowly turn it back on

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.920 
and then I can slowly turn it back on
depending<00:04:19.989> how<00:04:20.079> much<00:04:20.259> water<00:04:20.560> pool<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:20.859> want<00:04:21.190> so

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
depending how much water pool I want so

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.420 
depending how much water pool I want so
it's<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.050> nice<00:04:23.169> addition<00:04:23.410> until<00:04:23.979> you<00:04:24.069> get<00:04:24.220> to

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
it's a nice addition until you get to

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.610 
it's a nice addition until you get to
about<00:04:24.639> that<00:04:24.970> halfway<00:04:25.539> point<00:04:25.810> there<00:04:26.319> where<00:04:26.530> it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
about that halfway point there where it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.260 
about that halfway point there where it
starts<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:26.949> have<00:04:27.039> a<00:04:27.069> lot<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.250> pressure<00:04:27.580> then

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
starts to have a lot of pressure then

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.460 
starts to have a lot of pressure then
you're<00:04:28.449> better<00:04:28.629> off<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.960> almost<00:04:29.110> have<00:04:29.289> it<00:04:29.379> on

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
you're better off to almost have it on

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.969 
you're better off to almost have it on
full<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.599> and<00:04:31.599> have<00:04:31.870> it<00:04:31.900> lower<00:04:32.139> at<00:04:32.349> the<00:04:32.379> top<00:04:32.680> or

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
full and and have it lower at the top or

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.700 
full and and have it lower at the top or
else<00:04:33.220> have<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.639> almost<00:04:34.240> closed<00:04:34.690> and<00:04:35.020> have<00:04:35.530> it<00:04:35.650> a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
else have it almost closed and have it a

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.300 
else have it almost closed and have it a
lot<00:04:35.919> higher<00:04:36.789> flow<00:04:37.180> rate<00:04:37.560> at<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.740> top<00:04:38.949> so

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
lot higher flow rate at the top so

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.629 
lot higher flow rate at the top so
anyways<00:04:40.680> what<00:04:41.680> I'll<00:04:41.800> do<00:04:41.919> here<00:04:42.099> is<00:04:42.220> just<00:04:42.250> turn

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
anyways what I'll do here is just turn

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.930 
anyways what I'll do here is just turn
this<00:04:43.110> this<00:04:44.110> back<00:04:44.560> massager<00:04:44.949> on<00:04:45.250> I<00:04:45.460> don't<00:04:45.879> know

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
this this back massager on I don't know

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.279 
this this back massager on I don't know
if<00:04:46.000> you<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.210> see<00:04:46.449> it<00:04:46.509> in<00:04:46.569> the<00:04:46.629> video<00:04:46.870> here<00:04:47.139> but

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
if you can see it in the video here but

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.990 
if you can see it in the video here but
it<00:04:47.409> is<00:04:47.530> agitating<00:04:48.129> this<00:04:48.280> thing<00:04:48.460> not<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.729> lot

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
it is agitating this thing not a lot

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.820 
it is agitating this thing not a lot
because<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:49.479> is<00:04:49.659> a<00:04:49.690> fairly<00:04:50.139> lightweight

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
because this is a fairly lightweight

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.620 
because this is a fairly lightweight
setup<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:52.599> I'll<00:04:52.720> just<00:04:52.900> take<00:04:53.080> a<00:04:53.139> scoop<00:04:53.470> here<00:04:53.830> I

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
setup and I'll just take a scoop here I

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.730 
setup and I'll just take a scoop here I
know<00:04:55.630> there's<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:55.930> lot<00:04:56.050> of<00:04:56.110> videos<00:04:56.409> online<00:04:56.560> of

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
know there's a lot of videos online of

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.100 
know there's a lot of videos online of
this<00:04:56.949> thing<00:04:57.190> in<00:04:57.819> action<00:04:58.060> so<00:04:58.569> I<00:04:58.599> don't<00:04:58.810> need<00:04:58.930> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
this thing in action so I don't need to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.040 
this thing in action so I don't need to
do<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.800> lot<00:04:59.949> of<00:05:00.099> demo<00:05:00.280> but<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.849> promise<00:05:01.659> I<00:05:01.780> haven't

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
do a lot of demo but I promise I haven't

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.159 
do a lot of demo but I promise I haven't
rigged<00:05:02.319> it<00:05:02.500> all<00:05:02.650> or<00:05:03.159> somehow<00:05:03.430> added<00:05:04.389> gold<00:05:04.720> into

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
rigged it all or somehow added gold into

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.200 
rigged it all or somehow added gold into
this<00:05:05.319> like<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.830> say<00:05:06.039> if<00:05:06.550> anything<00:05:06.819> this<00:05:07.030> is<00:05:07.090> a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
this like I say if anything this is a

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.870 
this like I say if anything this is a

very bad test to be doing a review on

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.939 
very bad test to be doing a review on
because<00:05:10.479> I'm<00:05:11.050> using<00:05:11.319> stuff<00:05:11.680> that<00:05:11.710> I've

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
because I'm using stuff that I've

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.459 
because I'm using stuff that I've
already<00:05:12.130> processed<00:05:12.960> but<00:05:13.960> I'm<00:05:14.110> just<00:05:14.319> gonna

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
like I say because it's flower gold I'm

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.890 
like I say because it's flower gold I'm
just<00:05:18.490> adding<00:05:18.699> it<00:05:18.789> very<00:05:18.969> slowly<00:05:19.389> because<00:05:19.659> I've

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
just adding it very slowly because I've

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.709 
just adding it very slowly because I've
got<00:05:20.080> very<00:05:20.259> slow<00:05:20.699> flow<00:05:21.699> rates<00:05:21.969> turned<00:05:22.330> on<00:05:22.539> right

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719 
got very slow flow rates turned on right

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:23.159 
got very slow flow rates turned on right
now

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
bottom there but it does make a

bottom there but it does make a
difference<00:05:46.810> I<00:05:46.930> notice<00:05:47.229> right<00:05:47.380> when<00:05:47.529> I<00:05:47.560> turned

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
difference I notice right when I turned

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.709 
difference I notice right when I turned
it<00:05:47.979> on<00:05:48.039> I<00:05:48.310> could<00:05:48.699> see<00:05:48.729> the<00:05:49.029> gold<00:05:49.150> from<00:05:49.330> the<00:05:49.479> top

the<00:05:52.659> through<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.080> sand<00:05:53.380> so<00:05:53.979> it's<00:05:54.310> not<00:05:54.490> a

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
the through the sand so it's not a

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.850 
the through the sand so it's not a
necessity<00:05:54.789> but<00:05:55.509> it<00:05:55.659> is<00:05:55.779> a<00:05:55.810> nice<00:05:56.050> eight<00:05:56.560> dollar

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
addition and I'm sure that people from

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.769 
addition and I'm sure that people from
California<00:06:00.310> sluice<00:06:00.880> box<00:06:01.120> have<00:06:01.300> already<00:06:01.569> tried

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:01.779 
California sluice box have already tried

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.899 
California sluice box have already tried
things<00:06:02.050> like<00:06:02.229> this<00:06:02.380> I'm<00:06:02.620> not<00:06:02.800> sure<00:06:03.009> but<00:06:03.310> I'm

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
things like this I'm not sure but I'm

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:05.129 
things like this I'm not sure but I'm
sure<00:06:04.150> there's<00:06:04.360> a<00:06:04.389> lot<00:06:04.509> of<00:06:04.630> creative<00:06:04.960> people

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
sure there's a lot of creative people

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.290 
sure there's a lot of creative people
out<00:06:05.380> there<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:05.949> I<00:06:06.190> just<00:06:06.520> wanted<00:06:06.969> to<00:06:07.120> show<00:06:07.270> you

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
out there so I just wanted to show you

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.350 
out there so I just wanted to show you
my<00:06:07.449> idea<00:06:07.870> for<00:06:08.199> returning<00:06:08.979> left<00:06:09.310> agitate<00:06:10.240> it

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
my idea for returning left agitate it

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.610 
my idea for returning left agitate it
because<00:06:10.569> it<00:06:10.659> makes<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:10.930> bit<00:06:11.050> of<00:06:11.139> a<00:06:11.229> patting

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
because it makes a bit of a patting

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.950 
because it makes a bit of a patting
motion<00:06:11.979> by<00:06:12.219> doing<00:06:12.490> that<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:12.669> you<00:06:12.880> can<00:06:13.029> see<00:06:13.240> as

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
motion by doing that and you can see as

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.899 
motion by doing that and you can see as
we<00:06:14.080> get<00:06:14.199> further<00:06:14.380> down<00:06:14.680> here<00:06:15.009> I<00:06:15.190> actually

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
we get further down here I actually

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.370 
we get further down here I actually
don't<00:06:16.180> see<00:06:16.300> any<00:06:16.569> gold<00:06:16.750> down<00:06:16.810> here<00:06:17.080> but<00:06:17.199> off<00:06:17.289> the
