which<00:00:53.399> depletes<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.940> testosterone<00:00:54.390> and

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
which depletes your testosterone and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
which depletes your testosterone and
your<00:00:55.500> training<00:00:55.710> performance<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.489> muscle

your training performance and muscle

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
your training performance and muscle
building<00:00:56.840> or<00:00:57.840> they<00:00:57.960> go<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> low<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.440> fat

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
building or they go to the low in fat

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.049 
building or they go to the low in fat
which<00:00:58.890> also<00:00:59.280> depletes<00:00:59.520> your<00:00:59.670> testosterone
