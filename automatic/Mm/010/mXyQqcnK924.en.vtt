a<00:01:22.950> higher<00:01:23.250> attack<00:01:23.729> they've<00:01:24.450> got<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> lower

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
a higher attack they've got a lower

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
defense than the armored hoplites so in

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.100 
defense than the armored hoplites so in
the<00:01:27.119> difference<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> difference<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
the difference and the difference is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.890 
the difference and the difference is
about<00:01:28.259> even<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.329> there<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.450> two<00:01:30.630> sort<00:01:30.840> of

about even so there are two sort of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.569 
about even so there are two sort of
