00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.980
 but a great match of Monterrey 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.040
 different shapes first a second 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.720
 time if the truth I say beyond the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.039
 victory you have to be aware that the 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.679
 first time we ran with luck 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.419
 and study more goal opportunities not 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.429
 concretized and I think the second time 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:24.079
 it was completely different it was more 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.449
 even we had an arrival too 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.759
 we goal and we stop well 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.219
 last gave double a great play is born and 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.290
 I think it's completely from him they make 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.239
 some modifications especially you what 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.239
 you thought through the center you go to a 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.280
 side adjust well yes yes I think we 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.460
 He served at halftime and 0-0 we 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.809
 it served to correct because beyond 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.550
 my function of attacking was also 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.470
 wait for the lateral because it is not damaged 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.970
 a lot of banging for the bands but I have 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.129
 I think the team behaved well in 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.479
 the second time the first one we leave 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.739
 Much to be desired but it is a good 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.470
 victory is better to correct this 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.199
 way and with perfect step in two hours 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.059
 yes yes yes the truth to see that way 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.799
 we have mentioned that we want to be 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.460
 protagonists but we also have things 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.920
 what to correct 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.229
 jonathan what party did 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.060
 very interesting modifications and it 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.979
 they carry the three points of this court yes 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.180
 the truth is that we have to admit that the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.310
 match in the first half was 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 back is a very dynamic team very 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.000
 fast with young people who have to 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.590
 It has a lot of quality we hold well and in 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.490
 the second part I think the team 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.170
 he started to grab the rhythm 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.390
 and good with some breasts we go calm 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.479
 to monterrey you have a great performance 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.740
 especially the first time cut 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.030
 very important to keep zero and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.210
 after the entry of the turkey not that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.500
 closes with a great play if you follow the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.970
 dorlan income I think it was the 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.439
 key 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.200
 a great goal an impressive power 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.880
 the truth I think that the school and what 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.500
 important is what the whole group did 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.820
 not all of us continue with their work 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 we were solvent in the back and 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.539
 I think it's the most important thing they get 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.340
 the perfect start no six six 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.570
 yes and the idea is to continue on that path not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.190
 continue to maintain a rhythm follow 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.299
 keeping an order and I think the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.100
 team is aware of this and what 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.209
 we are achieving we had a first 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 very complicated part where they generated us 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:11.250
 Clear opportunities of goal in domain 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.840
 they are on us if the second time 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.130
 It improved and that gives you a lot of tranquility 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 the team was able to overcome that 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.470
 adversity 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.310
 then there are many things I repeat there is 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.310
 recompose any 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.220
 our dissatisfaction 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.190
 at the end of accounts 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.930
 and during the first time we made a 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:51.090
 first time good I think but then it 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.849
 started the second half we're going to lose 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:58.069
 balls to control bad not to have a 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.069
 combination and that's the reason 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.160
 the defeat
