00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it's a little different with the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's a little different with the
flat-footed<00:00:16.859> head<00:00:17.190> down<00:00:18.439> set<00:00:19.439> up<00:00:20.210> trying<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
flat-footed head down set up trying to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.330 
flat-footed head down set up trying to
really<00:00:21.600> improve<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.199> my<00:00:22.769> next<00:00:23.010> full<00:00:23.189> meet

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
that I'm going to be doing is AUSA PL
and<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.230> there's<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.500> little<00:00:25.590> bit<00:00:25.710> more<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and so there's a little bit more of a

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.730 
and so there's a little bit more of a
standard<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> lifts<00:00:29.750> on<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:31.050> day<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> had

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
a belief 475 for four doubles and then I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
a belief 475 for four doubles and then I
did<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> set<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> five<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.770> intention<00:00:41.520> with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
did a set of five but my intention with

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
did a set of five but my intention with

focusing on trying to cut out some of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.360 
focusing on trying to cut out some of
the<00:00:53.449> excessive<00:00:54.590> forward<00:00:55.590> lean<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> tend

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.020 
minute it happened between these sets
and<00:02:00.080> after<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.500> first<00:02:01.950> i<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.490> i<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.789> at

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
and after the first i know i did at

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
and after the first i know i did at
least<00:02:03.209> four<00:02:03.929> doubles<00:02:04.289> maybe<00:02:04.590> five<00:02:04.830> doubles

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
least four doubles maybe five doubles

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
least four doubles maybe five doubles
and<00:02:05.459> on<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.729> last<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.179> I<00:02:07.369> hold<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.840> four<00:02:09.840> or

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and on this last one I hold it four or

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.920 
and on this last one I hold it four or
five<00:02:10.080> times<00:02:13.580> not<00:02:14.580> my<00:02:14.850> best<00:02:15.030> set<00:02:15.299> by<00:02:15.569> any<00:02:15.750> means

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
five times not my best set by any means

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.580 
five times not my best set by any means
but<00:02:16.319> i<00:02:17.040> am<00:02:18.030> still<00:02:18.299> kind<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.930> getting<00:02:19.080> used<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
but i am still kind of getting used to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.520 
but i am still kind of getting used to
the<00:02:20.250> volume<00:02:20.790> again<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.540> know<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.200> training

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the volume again I know the training

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.699 
the volume again I know the training
shako<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.660> really<00:02:24.660> tough<00:02:24.840> on<00:02:24.959> my<00:02:25.080> body<00:02:25.260> volume

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
shako is really tough on my body volume

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.229 
shako is really tough on my body volume
wise<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.620> readapting<00:02:29.580> i<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> going

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
wise and so readapting i think is going

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.309 
wise and so readapting i think is going
to<00:02:30.330> make<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.480> big<00:02:30.660> difference<00:02:30.840> i<00:02:31.110> didn't

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
to make a big difference i didn't

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.259 
to make a big difference i didn't
realize<00:02:31.530> how<00:02:31.680> bad<00:02:31.709> my<00:02:32.700> conditioning<00:02:33.150> had

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
realize how bad my conditioning had

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.880 
realize how bad my conditioning had
gotten<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.019> last<00:02:34.200> meet<00:02:34.440> prep<00:02:34.680> where<00:02:34.859> I

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
gotten from that last meet prep where I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.150 
gotten from that last meet prep where I
just<00:02:35.130> kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.340> got<00:02:35.609> a<00:02:36.090> little<00:02:36.150> lazy<00:02:36.859> so<00:02:37.859> this

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
just kind of got a little lazy so this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.870 
just kind of got a little lazy so this
is<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.670> next<00:02:38.820> squat<00:02:39.120> workout<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.980> took<00:02:41.040> 475

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
is the next squat workout and I took 475

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.140 
is the next squat workout and I took 475
for<00:02:42.950> four<00:02:43.950> triples<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:44.459> time<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:44.790> i<00:02:44.850> added<00:02:45.000> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
for four triples this time so i added a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.210 
for four triples this time so i added a
rep<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.329> each<00:02:45.510> set<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:46.109> this<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:46.890> felt

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
rep to each set and this actually felt

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.300 
rep to each set and this actually felt
pretty<00:02:47.280> good<00:02:48.140> and<00:02:49.140> then<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.829> fifth<00:02:49.980> set<00:02:50.280> i

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
pretty good and then on the fifth set i

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.000 
pretty good and then on the fifth set i
threw<00:02:50.820> on<00:02:50.970> 495<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.079> did<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> triple

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
threw on 495 and did that for a triple

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.710 
threw on 495 and did that for a triple
honestly<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.220> sets<00:02:56.519> got<00:02:57.090> better<00:02:57.329> all<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> way

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
honestly my sets got better all the way

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.870 
honestly my sets got better all the way
up<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.109> one<00:02:58.350> all<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.769> 475<00:02:59.280> felt<00:02:59.700> pretty

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
up to this one all the 475 felt pretty

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.520 
up to this one all the 475 felt pretty
solid<00:03:00.239> they<00:03:00.329> were<00:03:00.420> moving<00:03:00.600> well<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.109> i<00:03:01.410> was

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
solid they were moving well and i was

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.050 
solid they were moving well and i was
having<00:03:01.680> an<00:03:01.890> easier<00:03:02.190> time<00:03:02.220> keeping<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:02.790> back

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
having an easier time keeping my back

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.370 
having an easier time keeping my back
tight<00:03:04.130> at<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.310> bottom<00:03:05.609> of<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.819> reps<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.299> so<00:03:06.959> I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
tight at the bottom of the reps and so I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.690 
tight at the bottom of the reps and so I
know<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.430> it's<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.329> improving<00:03:09.780> slowly<00:03:10.700> at

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
know that it's it's improving slowly at

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.970 
know that it's it's improving slowly at
the<00:03:11.790> at<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.420> full<00:03:12.720> meet<00:03:12.900> its<00:03:13.290> no<00:03:13.560> knee<00:03:13.620> wraps

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
the at the full meet its no knee wraps

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.770 
the at the full meet its no knee wraps
and<00:03:15.109> pretty<00:03:16.109> spaced<00:03:17.100> out<00:03:17.280> command<00:03:17.700> time<00:03:18.480> frame

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and pretty spaced out command time frame

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.640 
and pretty spaced out command time frame
so<00:03:19.680> I'm<00:03:19.799> trying<00:03:20.100> to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
so I'm trying to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.340 
so I'm trying to
practice<00:03:23.210> you<00:03:24.210> know<00:03:24.330> holding<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.020> at<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.170> top

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
practice you know holding it at the top

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.170 
practice you know holding it at the top
making<00:03:25.530> sure<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:26.010> I'm<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.670> rushing<00:03:26.850> through

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
making sure that I'm not rushing through

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.030 
making sure that I'm not rushing through
the<00:03:27.240> lift<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:28.050> making<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> as<00:03:28.770> hard<00:03:28.950> as

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
the lift and just making it as hard as

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.550 
the lift and just making it as hard as
possible<00:03:29.100> hopefully<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.180> there<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.780> they

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
possible hopefully I get there and they

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.810 
possible hopefully I get there and they
tell<00:03:31.710> me<00:03:31.740> I'm<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.190> lower<00:03:32.400> than<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.670> need

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
tell me I'm going way lower than I need

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.370 
tell me I'm going way lower than I need
to<00:03:32.850> I<00:03:33.180> don't<00:03:33.390> anticipate<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:34.050> being<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
to I don't anticipate that being the

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:41.600 
to I don't anticipate that being the
case<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:36.050> had<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.080> took<00:03:38.480> 3054<00:03:39.480> some<00:03:40.610> loser

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
case I had I took 3054 some loser

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.320 
case I had I took 3054 some loser
triples<00:03:42.090> did<00:03:42.960> five<00:03:43.620> or<00:03:43.830> six<00:03:44.100> of<00:03:44.220> them<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.930> am

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
of reps look like because the intention

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.630 
of reps look like because the intention
