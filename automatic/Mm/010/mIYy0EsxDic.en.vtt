you I feel like it's show-and-tell
that's<00:00:13.320> what<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.530> want<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> say<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.780> we

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
that's what I want to say so we have we

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040 
that's what I want to say so we have we
had<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> framework<00:00:16.139> produced<00:00:16.789> for<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.750> sedan

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
had a framework produced for the sedan

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.679 
had a framework produced for the sedan
Sheila's<00:00:19.260> case<00:00:19.880> we<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.029> four<00:00:21.300> implants

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
Sheila's case we have four implants

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.630 
Sheila's case we have four implants
place<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.140> blog<00:00:22.500> about<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.949> few<00:00:22.980> times

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
place to blog about this a few times

external<00:00:24.359> hex<00:00:24.570> random<00:00:25.170> no<00:00:26.010> well<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.880> are

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
external hex random no well these are

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
external hex random no well these are
actually<00:00:27.090> brand<00:00:27.420> mark<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.900> then<00:00:28.890> we'll

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
actually brand mark and then we'll

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.040 
actually brand mark and then we'll
Biocare<00:00:29.900> internal<00:00:30.900> hex<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.000> what<00:00:33.270> we

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
Biocare internal hex so this is what we

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.389 
Biocare internal hex so this is what we
sent<00:00:34.410> away<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> our<00:00:35.370> lab<00:00:35.700> script<00:00:36.210> sort<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
sent away with our lab script sort of a

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.639 
sent away with our lab script sort of a
basic<00:00:38.399> wax<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.690> contour<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.530> we're

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
basic wax up the contour that we're

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.920 
basic wax up the contour that we're
looking<00:00:40.770> for

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
looking for

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.299 
looking for
no<00:00:43.309> guidance<00:00:44.309> whatsoever<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.270> strictly

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
no guidance whatsoever so just strictly

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.010 
no guidance whatsoever so just strictly
function<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> had

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
function and this is what we had

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
function and this is what we had
returned<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.969> had<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> frame<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.539> didn't

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
returned so we had a frame we didn't

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
returned so we had a frame we didn't
have<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> teeth<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.559> we<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.920> had<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
have the teeth on it we just had the the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549 
have the teeth on it we just had the the
framework<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> things<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.320> wanted

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
framework so one of the things I wanted

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
framework so one of the things I wanted
to<00:00:55.649> talk<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.129> morning<00:00:56.430> this

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
to talk to you this morning this

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.979 
to talk to you this morning this
afternoon<00:00:56.940> about<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.469> Sheffield<00:00:59.010> test

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
afternoon about is the Sheffield test

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.330 
afternoon about is the Sheffield test
where<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> framework<00:01:02.010> like

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
where when you have a framework like

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.210 
where when you have a framework like
this<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.390> go<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.660> try<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:07.010> what<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.100> do

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
this you go to try it in and what you do

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
this you go to try it in and what you do
is<00:01:08.310> instead<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.640> torquing<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.180> five<00:01:09.780> screws

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
is instead of torquing all five screws

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
is instead of torquing all five screws
down<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> giving<00:01:11.369> her<00:01:11.430> what<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
down and giving her what you do is you

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.980 
down and giving her what you do is you
try<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:15.650> torque<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.920> screw<00:01:17.220> down

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.420 

because<00:01:20.650> what<00:01:20.770> we're<00:01:20.890> looking<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.370> a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
because what we're looking for is a

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.320 
because what we're looking for is a
passive<00:01:21.940> fit<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.850> hand<00:01:24.850> torque<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.180> one

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
passive fit so hand torque that one

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.870 
passive fit so hand torque that one
screw<00:01:25.540> down<00:01:25.659> and<00:01:25.840> take<00:01:25.930> a<00:01:25.960> radiograph<00:01:26.260> and<00:01:26.880> if

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
screw down and take a radiograph and if

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.600 
screw down and take a radiograph and if
you<00:01:28.150> if<00:01:28.510> there's<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:29.050> gap<00:01:29.409> anymore<00:01:29.950> which<00:01:30.400> there

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
you if there's a gap anymore which there

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.480 
you if there's a gap anymore which there
was<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.119> case<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:33.009> may<00:01:33.159> have<00:01:33.369> to

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
was in this case then you may have to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.740 
was in this case then you may have to
think<00:01:33.700> about<00:01:33.820> either<00:01:34.150> not<00:01:34.390> using<00:01:34.720> that

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
think about either not using that

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.870 
think about either not using that
implant<00:01:35.200> or<00:01:36.780> sectioning<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.100> resaw<00:01:39.100> during<00:01:39.310> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
or soldering in this case this the

or soldering in this case this the
internal<00:01:44.320> hex<00:01:44.619> fixture<00:01:45.159> did<00:01:45.399> not<00:01:45.550> fit

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
internal hex fixture did not fit

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.670 
internal hex fixture did not fit
actually<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.509> wack<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:46.869> the<00:01:46.990> framework

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.790 
oppression technique issue online part
I'll<00:01:53.830> take<00:01:54.039> the<00:01:54.160> blame

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
I'll take the blame

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.840 
I'll take the blame
however<00:01:56.800> there<00:01:57.009> may<00:01:57.280> been<00:01:57.460> a<00:01:57.520> few<00:01:57.729> other

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
however there may been a few other

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.570 
however there may been a few other
factors<00:01:58.119> so<00:01:58.990> instead<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.410> soldering<00:02:00.250> this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
factors so instead of soldering this

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.139 
factors so instead of soldering this
framework<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:02.009> potentially<00:02:03.009> distorting<00:02:04.000> the

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
framework and potentially distorting the

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.450 
framework and potentially distorting the
framework<00:02:04.479> again<00:02:04.840> we'd<00:02:05.530> liked<00:02:05.710> it<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:05.950> use

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
framework again we'd liked it to use

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.669 
framework again we'd liked it to use
three<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.850> the<00:02:07.179> four<00:02:07.750> implants<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.500> just

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
three of the four implants and just

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.109 
three of the four implants and just
we're<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.310> place<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.459> healing<00:02:09.789> cap<00:02:09.940> on

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
we're going to place a healing cap on

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.110 
we're going to place a healing cap on
this<00:02:10.300> healing<00:02:10.780> screw<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.230> just<00:02:11.380> leave<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.680> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this healing screw and just leave it to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.449 
this healing screw and just leave it to
sleep<00:02:13.260> okay<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.320> we<00:02:14.560> did<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
sleep okay so we did that so the

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.210 
sleep okay so we did that so the
Sheffield<00:02:15.880> tests<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> then<00:02:17.709> what<00:02:17.830> I<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.130> I

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
Sheffield tests so then what I do is I

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.650 
Sheffield tests so then what I do is I
try<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.430> my<00:02:18.640> framework<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:21.400> it<00:02:22.150> fit<00:02:22.450> well

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
try to my framework and then it fit well

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.150 
try to my framework and then it fit well
so<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:25.260> took<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.350> out<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.590> patient's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
so then I took it out of the patient's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.449 
so then I took it out of the patient's
mouth<00:02:28.110> patient<00:02:29.110> fell<00:02:29.290> asleep<00:02:29.620> for<00:02:29.890> about<00:02:30.220> an

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
mouth patient fell asleep for about an

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.470 
mouth patient fell asleep for about an
hour<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.959> do<00:02:32.049> a<00:02:32.110> wax<00:02:32.320> up<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.480> here's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
hour and I want to do a wax up so here's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.780 
hour and I want to do a wax up so here's
what<00:02:34.600> we<00:02:34.660> have<00:02:34.690> here<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.730> that

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
what we have here this is the one that

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.220 
what we have here this is the one that
we're<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.060> put<00:02:37.239> to<00:02:37.329> sleep<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:38.079> was

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
we're going to put to sleep so I it was

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
this and now I've moved it off and then

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.680 
this and now I've moved it off and then
what<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:46.900> did<00:02:46.989> was<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.380> picked<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.829> bunch<00:02:48.130> of<00:02:48.250> teeth

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
what I did was I picked a bunch of teeth

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.289 
what I did was I picked a bunch of teeth
selected<00:02:49.690> denture<00:02:50.410> teeth<00:02:50.640> wash<00:02:51.640> them<00:02:51.880> in<00:02:52.030> and

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
selected denture teeth wash them in and

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.729 
selected denture teeth wash them in and
then<00:02:52.420> tried<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.170> that's<00:02:53.350> what<00:02:53.500> we<00:02:53.590> had

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
then tried it in and that's what we had

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.630 
then tried it in and that's what we had
so<00:02:55.320> here<00:02:56.320> we<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:58.000> we're<00:02:58.180> gonna<00:02:58.329> do<00:02:58.570> here

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
is the wax up we try try an inch or Li

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.110 
is the wax up we try try an inch or Li
and<00:03:07.720> we're<00:03:07.810> happy<00:03:08.580> assumingly<00:03:09.580> happy<00:03:09.850> we<00:03:09.970> have

and we're happy assumingly happy we have

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.080 
and we're happy assumingly happy we have
no<00:03:10.680> guidance<00:03:11.680> whatsoever<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.850> hand

no guidance whatsoever and on hand

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.070 
no guidance whatsoever and on hand
articulating<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:14.850> on<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.060> anterior<00:03:16.450> segment

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
articulating it on the anterior segment

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.110 
articulating it on the anterior segment
so<00:03:17.740> therefore<00:03:18.130> what<00:03:18.400> we're<00:03:18.490> going<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.820> is

so therefore what we're going to do is
we're<00:03:19.450> going<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.840> now<00:03:20.620> flask<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.570> yours<00:03:22.570> I'm

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
we're going to now flask this yours I'm

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.270 
we're going to now flask this yours I'm
going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.900> show<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.110> just<00:03:23.740> how<00:03:23.890> we're<00:03:24.160> going

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
going to show you just how we're going

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.870 
going to show you just how we're going
to<00:03:24.370> do<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:25.000> start<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.500> idea<00:03:26.800> is<00:03:26.950> I'm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
to do that to start so the idea is I'm

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.240 
to do that to start so the idea is I'm
sure<00:03:28.120> Labs<00:03:28.420> do<00:03:28.600> this<00:03:28.750> every<00:03:29.020> day<00:03:29.050> I<00:03:29.970> don't<00:03:32.250> so

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
sure Labs do this every day I don't so

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.630 
sure Labs do this every day I don't so
we<00:03:33.340> use<00:03:33.520> a<00:03:33.580> denture<00:03:33.790> flat<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:36.310> good<00:03:36.459> old

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
we use a denture flat it's good old

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.040 
we use a denture flat it's good old
friend<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:41.170> make<00:03:41.320> sure<00:03:41.350> that<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:43.050> don't

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
friend and to make sure that we don't

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.380 
friend and to make sure that we don't
get<00:03:44.230> wax<00:03:44.620> or<00:03:44.920> stone<00:03:45.160> into<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> at<00:03:45.880> into<00:03:46.239> our

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
get wax or stone into the at into our

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.270 
get wax or stone into the at into our
access<00:03:46.750> holes<00:03:46.989> we're<00:03:47.890> going<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.130> take

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
access holes we're going to take

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:59.770 
access holes we're going to take
impression<00:03:49.090> coping<00:03:49.480> or<00:03:49.660> lab<00:03:50.290> analogs

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.850 

you<00:04:00.350> go

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
you go

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.390 
you go
so<00:04:02.460> screw<00:04:02.880> all<00:04:03.060> these<00:04:03.270> down

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.440 

that's<00:04:07.400> what<00:04:07.550> that's<00:04:07.730> gonna<00:04:07.909> do<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.150> it's

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
that's what that's gonna do is it's

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.610 
that's what that's gonna do is it's
gonna<00:04:08.659> block<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.200> then<00:04:09.290> we're<00:04:09.379> going<00:04:09.470> to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
gonna block and then we're going to

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.390 
gonna block and then we're going to
block<00:04:09.830> out<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:12.620> access<00:04:12.950> hole

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
block out the the access hole

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.680 
block out the the access hole
excuse<00:04:13.700> me<00:04:13.879> and<00:04:14.060> then<00:04:14.180> we're<00:04:14.299> going<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.450> place

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
excuse me and then we're going to place

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.930 
excuse me and then we're going to place
polyvinyl<00:04:15.620> siloxane<00:04:15.680> just<00:04:16.370> to<00:04:16.519> make<00:04:16.760> sure

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
polyvinyl siloxane just to make sure

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.349 
polyvinyl siloxane just to make sure
that<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.660> don't<00:04:17.750> get<00:04:17.900> any<00:04:18.430> stone<00:04:19.430> or<00:04:19.729> grit<00:04:19.970> into

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
that we don't get any stone or grit into

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.909 
that we don't get any stone or grit into
the<00:04:20.650> implant<00:04:22.300> hex<00:04:25.960> okay<00:04:26.960> so<00:04:27.020> here<00:04:27.410> we<00:04:27.500> go<00:04:27.620> with

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
the implant hex okay so here we go with

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.650 
the implant hex okay so here we go with
the<00:04:28.270> now<00:04:29.270> way<00:04:29.389> of<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.600> lab<00:04:30.470> analogs<00:04:31.389> onto<00:04:32.389> the

the now way of the lab analogs onto the

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.750 
the now way of the lab analogs onto the
framework<00:04:33.260> and<00:04:33.710> we're<00:04:33.949> just<00:04:34.100> going<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.430> place

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
framework and we're just going to place

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.780 
framework and we're just going to place
that<00:04:34.790> in<00:04:35.000> here<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:35.570> then<00:04:35.930> flask<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.949> we're

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.610 
that in here and then flask this we're
going<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:38.000> flask<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:38.660> also<00:04:39.110> on<00:04:39.260> top<00:04:39.289> we're

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
going to flask it and also on top we're

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.140 
going to flask it and also on top we're

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
going to place probably bono siloxane

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.360 
going to place probably bono siloxane
into<00:04:41.479> the<00:04:41.570> access<00:04:41.930> holes<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.440> then<00:04:43.250> we're

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
into the access holes and then we're
