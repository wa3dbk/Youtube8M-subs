00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.200
 hi guys another quickie 28 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 other days that have not yet arrived and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.570
 has more than 40 days 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:20.990
 good here a lot of little things 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.990
 pencil pen office 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:33.690
 I bought 6 with this seller too anyway 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:35.630
 to see the product in the right way and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:42.530
 That China is very full 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.530
 Little thing, I made the party. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.180
 I love these little things 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.590
 I do not know if I see what I asked for 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.340
 that does not 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.920
 And if from here it's a train 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.230
 I think that was not the one, but I think 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.910
 that the suggestion would also be this one here 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:23.350
 hello kitty 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:26.740
 So you pull the time you pull and it's a 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.410
 trena there locked to unlock only 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.540
 tighten little nose that returns to normal 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.540
 because my brother had a sock 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:49.840
 Rosinha looked prettier on the site 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.170
 but it's ok I went and I asked and the other half 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 from here it 's hotter it's thicker 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.840
 I'm from here I could not choose 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:14.200
 It's just the same as it's a game in which 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.160
 the three years of teaching and the duckling this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.739
 here to put you in the key 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.550

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.959
 There were four of these to a tin 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.070
 with wine since comes a use since 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.420
 stronger wines but had just had 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:56.200
 mouth put says the teacher does not stay 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:00.950
 thinking of things to put jes 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.970
 that I teach so I bought with 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.440
 this intention but in a lot of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:14.470
 adhesive nus 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.470
 I also liked the sardine 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:27.490
 read the sardine is okay 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.490
 yes now the pretty set 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:45.430
 I think it came thing missing 2 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.280
 mark texts 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.810
 I'll look into the relationship that I 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.160
 I bought because I think something came. 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.320
 missing 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:59.610
 Look, I think I bought two of these. 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.610
 kit here which is the mark text too 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.860
 I'm sure I bought two that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.490
 I even thought one is mine and another as a gift. 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.160
 I'll see the performance and then I'll tell 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:19.170
 I really bought it or it's missing. 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:26.890
 things here one I do not know if to cancel 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:35.590
 visor does not have pen with a giraffe 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:44.020
 end at the end more cute 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:48.010
 had quite liked that it is sometimes 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.580
 How do we not understand the language? 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:55.710
 in the middle of the times that's what people are 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:01.200
 a pen that we ask thinking 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:10.450
 It's 13 really, it's just a beautiful one I liked 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:13.800
 and two with the face of a bell too 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.800
 very good tip 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.680
 I liked bee fininha 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.390
 liked it 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.570
 I'll see if it really came. 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.780
 I asked I'm not sure I had to 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:44.330
 impression that not for me I bought 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:50.960
 a kit of yours here and not only the two 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:54.860
 colors for me I bought two kits of themselves 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:00.470
 not only one that I'll confirm even for 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.890
 power is is to evaluate the seller right 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:08.300
 was fast but I'm noticing these 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:11.950
 these little details are on it stays 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.950
