00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
go and attack this zombie so and you can

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.410 
go and attack this zombie so and you can
see<00:02:14.060> will<00:02:15.060> go<00:02:15.269> and<00:02:15.450> attack<00:02:15.720> them<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.120> seems

that<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.660> don't<00:02:18.989> tend<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.069> attack<00:02:20.430> golems<00:02:20.819> for

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
that I don't tend to attack golems for

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.150 
that I don't tend to attack golems for
some<00:02:21.239> reason<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.870> golem<00:02:22.860> should<00:02:23.040> be

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
some reason so golem should be

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.319 
some reason so golem should be
reasonably<00:02:23.519> safe<00:02:23.849> there

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:38.230
