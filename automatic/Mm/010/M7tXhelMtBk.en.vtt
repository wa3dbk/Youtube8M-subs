it's<00:01:19.470> literally<00:01:20.100> took<00:01:20.220> me<00:01:20.400> five<00:01:20.549> minutes<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it's literally took me five minutes to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's literally took me five minutes to
get<00:01:21.000> set<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
get set up and then you can see the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
get set up and then you can see the
finished<00:01:22.590> product<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.100> top<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> PVR

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
finished product right on top of the PVR

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
finished product right on top of the PVR
and<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.900> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> jump<00:01:25.259> into

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
and right now we're going to jump into

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.890 
and right now we're going to jump into
actually<00:01:25.979> what<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.280> looks<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
actually what it looks like on what the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
actually what it looks like on what the
capture<00:01:28.200> device<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.799> puts<00:01:29.220> out<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.759> is

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
capture device actually puts out this is

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.950 
capture device actually puts out this is
a<00:01:29.909> little<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.270> snippet<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.780> playing

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
a little bit of snippet of me playing

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.219 
a little bit of snippet of me playing
free-for-all<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.680> black<00:01:32.579> ops<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
free-for-all in black ops but as you can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
free-for-all in black ops but as you can
see<00:01:34.290> it's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.710> quite<00:01:35.009> HD<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.299> quite<00:01:36.540> as

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
see it's not quite HD it's not quite as

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569 
see it's not quite HD it's not quite as
crisp<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.170> an<00:01:37.290> HD<00:01:37.590> PVR<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> does<00:01:38.400> look

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
crisp as an HD PVR but it does look

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.170 
crisp as an HD PVR but it does look
pretty<00:01:38.610> good

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
pretty good

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
pretty good
I<00:01:39.210> mean<00:01:39.720> I've<00:01:39.840> seen<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.200> HD<00:01:40.650> capture<00:01:40.979> cards

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
I mean I've seen on HD capture cards

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
I mean I've seen on HD capture cards
that<00:01:41.400> look<00:01:41.430> pretty<00:01:41.820> bad<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
that look pretty bad and this is

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.389 
that look pretty bad and this is
actually<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.170> looks<00:01:43.380> pretty<00:01:43.560> good<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.920> there

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
actually it looks pretty good and there

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
actually it looks pretty good and there
are<00:01:44.460> only<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.640> few<00:01:44.700> complaints<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.360> have

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
are only a few complaints that I have

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.149 
are only a few complaints that I have
about<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> Roxio<00:01:46.350> device<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.040> get

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
about the Roxio device and I will get

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
about the Roxio device and I will get
into<00:01:47.280> those<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> second<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.180> right<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:48.780> I'm

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
into those in a second but right now I'm

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.270 
into those in a second but right now I'm
just<00:01:48.930> showcasing<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> looks<00:01:50.159> like

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and and then I'm gonna switch over to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.920 
and and then I'm gonna switch over to
some<00:01:52.979> footage<00:01:53.280> from<00:01:53.430> my<00:01:53.549> PVR<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.329> let's<00:01:54.780> get

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
some footage from my PVR but let's get

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.480 
some footage from my PVR but let's get
some<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> some<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> basic<00:01:56.100> things<00:01:56.130> out

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
some of the some of the basic things out

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.969 
some of the some of the basic things out
of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.700> about<00:01:56.939> this<00:01:57.090> capture<00:01:57.420> device<00:01:57.979> one

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
of the way about this capture device one

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.990 
of the way about this capture device one
thing<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.189> might<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.369> noticed<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> was

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
thing you might have noticed when I was

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.940 
thing you might have noticed when I was
plugging<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.719> cords<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> does

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
plugging in all the cords that it does

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
plugging in all the cords that it does
take<00:02:02.159> component<00:02:02.700> cables<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.509> was<00:02:03.689> playing

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
take component cables and I was playing

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.050 
take component cables and I was playing
I'm<00:02:04.110> playing<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.740> 720p<00:02:05.189> on<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:05.790> television

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
I'm playing it in 720p on my television

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.600 
I'm playing it in 720p on my television
and<00:02:06.360> my<00:02:06.840> xbox<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> set<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> 720p<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.459> does

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and my xbox is set to 720p so it does

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.200 
and my xbox is set to 720p so it does
allow<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> play<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.450> HD

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
allow you to play in HD

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.940 
allow you to play in HD
but<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:10.660> doesn't<00:02:11.020> capture<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.500> HD<00:02:11.770> which<00:02:11.920> is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
but it doesn't capture in HD which is

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.470 
but it doesn't capture in HD which is
kind<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.220> confusing<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.670> me<00:02:12.760> I'm<00:02:12.940> not<00:02:13.090> sure<00:02:13.150> why

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
kind of confusing to me I'm not sure why

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.720 
kind of confusing to me I'm not sure why
they<00:02:14.170> kind<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.560> skipped<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> step<00:02:15.070> there<00:02:15.430> but

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
they kind of skipped the step there but

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.220 
they kind of skipped the step there but
as<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.300> can<00:02:16.420> see<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:16.780> switched<00:02:16.960> over<00:02:17.140> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
as you can see I just switched over to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.780 
as you can see I just switched over to
my<00:02:17.320> PVR<00:02:17.680> it<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.220> bit<00:02:18.310> brighter<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
my PVR it is a little bit brighter and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.920 
my PVR it is a little bit brighter and
crisper<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.480> PVR

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
crisper with the PVR

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.240 
crisper with the PVR
but<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:20.560> sure<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.920> tweak<00:02:21.100> those

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
but I'm sure you can tweak those

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.530 
but I'm sure you can tweak those
settings<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.730> your<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.060> your<00:02:22.090> rendering

which<00:02:24.850> I'll<00:02:25.000> show<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.390> second<00:02:25.810> but<00:02:25.960> one<00:02:26.620> of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
which I'll show in a second but one of

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
which I'll show in a second but one of
the<00:02:26.800> things<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.310> did<00:02:27.550> notice<00:02:27.790> with<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
of bad I mean I plug the Xbox in by

of bad I mean I plug the Xbox in by
itself<00:02:36.160> without<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.760> through<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.970> capture

Sony Vegas and I'm more comfortable in
that<00:03:51.820> program<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.300> that's<00:03:52.450> what<00:03:52.570> I<00:03:52.600> use<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
that program so that's what I use to

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.870 
that program so that's what I use to
render<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.350> out<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:54.220> as<00:03:54.340> you<00:03:54.430> can<00:03:54.550> see<00:03:54.610> it's
