00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.470
 hello everyone today let's learn how 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.410
 see the content of series or in our 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.700
 smart tv without having to connect the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.450
 download the videos and all 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 get up 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.330
 we're just going to need three things a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.970
 smartphone and two applications that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.189
 we will have to install the first application 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.800
 it's called the cast and we can download it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.410
 clicking here 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.629
 the second application will give access to everything 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.199
 the content of that slip and we can 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.309
 download by clicking here or directly 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.930
 looking for it with our browser 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.510
 phone and downloading the directly 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.699
 in our terminal 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.219
 the simplest thing would be that I opened 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.769
 this video with your phone and you 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.059
 downloads and these two applications 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.070
 clicking on the links that left the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.829
 description of which below having the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.500
 two applications in our device 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.800
 we will proceed with its installation 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.700
 first we will start climbing your slip 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.320
 we will introduce our user and 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.320
 password and ready 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.659
 we will proceed in the same way with the cast 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.640
 and after the installation will ask us to link 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.030
 our device with a smart tv 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.920
 google tv or line render for it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 we will only have to have connected 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.430
 to the same network and not esther martin 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.990
 our device and select 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.580
 our television as we have seen in the 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.350
 previous menu at the time of 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.909
 installation may give us an error like 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.520
 this one so we'll have to go to 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.530
 security settings and accept the box 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.570
 of unknown origins after having the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.520
 two installed applications we open the 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.580
 light series application we choose the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.050
 content that we want to see 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.240
 and we simply click on the chapter 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:49.120
 we select what we want to see and here 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.920
 starts what so only 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.510
 we will have to choose one of the links 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.730
 video in 'streaming' that we were 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.820
 show on the screen and then 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.880
 Press to open with another player 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 and we press the can search our 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.650
 television and we will click on the first 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.020
 will ask us if we want to have it 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.340
 as predefined so if it's our 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 home and it's a regular TV 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.300
 we will accept immediately we will appear 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.920
 a text on our screen which 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 we must accept to send 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.750
 videos from our mobile phone to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.560
 be able to accept we will use the command to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.020
 distance by pressing ok on allow 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.370
 below and immediately we are 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.590
 will show the content that we have 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.030
 chosen in the application on the screen 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.070
 from our smartphone we will see a 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 menu with which we can rewind or 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.220
 move forward but what's really interesting is 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.380
 to be able to turn off the screen of our 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.480
 smartphone and enjoy the content without 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.070
