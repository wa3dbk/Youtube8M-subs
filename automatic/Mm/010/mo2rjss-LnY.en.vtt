00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.299 
barometer and compass watch that they
released<00:00:11.000> pretty<00:00:12.000> much<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.300> month<00:00:13.099> it<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.160> a

released pretty much this month it is a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
break from norm in that it shows an

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.349 
break from norm in that it shows an

down<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.080> at<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> bottom<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.550> not

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
down here at the bottom this is not

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.939 
down here at the bottom this is not
typical<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> their<00:00:25.019> ABC<00:00:25.439> watches<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
typical of their ABC watches and I

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.370 
typical of their ABC watches and I
believe<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:27.300> second<00:00:27.930> or<00:00:28.019> third<00:00:28.050> one

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
believe this is the second or third one

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
believe this is the second or third one
they've<00:00:28.560> done<00:00:28.769> like<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.390> definitely

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
they've done like this but definitely

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
they've done like this but definitely
this<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> most<00:00:30.960> unique<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:32.009> terms<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
this is the most unique in terms of the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
this is the most unique in terms of the
movement<00:00:33.559> because<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.950> see<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.250> does

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
movement because as you can see it does

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.630 
movement because as you can see it does
have<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:36.180> tough<00:00:36.420> movement<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.950> will<00:00:38.160> auto

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
have the tough movement so it will auto

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.780 
have the tough movement so it will auto
adjust<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.270> hands<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:40.500> 55<00:00:41.040> minutes<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> 5

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
adjust the hands from 55 minutes to 5

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.479 
adjust the hands from 55 minutes to 5
minutes<00:00:42.120> after<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.540> hour<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.739> make<00:00:44.160> sure<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
minutes after the hour to make sure that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.560 
minutes after the hour to make sure that
they're<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:44.940> line<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> where<00:00:45.450> they

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
they're all in line and where they

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.340 
they're all in line and where they
belong<00:00:47.000> if<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.149> watch<00:00:48.329> takes<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> hard<00:00:48.899> hit<00:00:48.960> or

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
belong if this watch takes a hard hit or

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.389 
belong if this watch takes a hard hit or
a<00:00:49.910> strong<00:00:50.960> magnetic<00:00:51.960> source<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:53.100> can<00:00:53.250> throw

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
a strong magnetic source it can throw

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.450 
a strong magnetic source it can throw
the<00:00:53.550> hands<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.750> thing<00:00:54.930> will

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the hands off but this thing will

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
the hands off but this thing will
readjust<00:00:56.460> them<00:00:56.789> back<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.120> belong<00:00:57.829> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
readjust them back where they belong so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.340 
readjust them back where they belong so
again<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> PA<00:01:00.230> w15<00:01:01.230> I'm<00:01:01.410> sorry<00:01:01.620> 5000

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
again this is the PA w15 I'm sorry 5000

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.230 
again this is the PA w15 I'm sorry 5000
and<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.250> this

pretty big watch
compared<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.640> 2000<00:02:14.269> here<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.470> can<00:02:15.590> see

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
compared to the 2000 here you can see

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.040 
compared to the 2000 here you can see
that<00:02:15.920> there's<00:02:16.099> a<00:02:16.160> pretty<00:02:17.050> distinct

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
that there's a pretty distinct

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.350 
that there's a pretty distinct
difference<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.530> it's<00:02:18.890> probably<00:02:19.670> one<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
difference it it's probably one and a

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.180 
difference it it's probably one and a
half<00:02:20.540> times<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.349> size<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.849> two<00:02:23.180> thousand

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
half times the size of the two thousand

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.830 
half times the size of the two thousand
and<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.400> buttons<00:02:25.670> are<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.569> know<00:02:26.660> these

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
and the buttons are you know these

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.660 
and the buttons are you know these
plastic<00:02:27.349> have<00:02:27.709> textured<00:02:28.160> buttons<00:02:28.430> where<00:02:28.610> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
plastic have textured buttons where the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.030 
plastic have textured buttons where the
mm<00:02:29.209> get<00:02:29.299> these<00:02:29.510> nice<00:02:29.720> shiny<00:02:30.940> shiny<00:02:31.940> buttons

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
mm get these nice shiny shiny buttons

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.309 
mm get these nice shiny shiny buttons
and<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:37.370> overall<00:02:38.030> watch<00:02:38.360> face<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.930> about<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
and the overall watch face is about the

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.420 
and the overall watch face is about the
same<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.769> one<00:02:39.860> thing<00:02:40.099> that's<00:02:40.250> interesting

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
same the one thing that's interesting

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.229 
same the one thing that's interesting
and<00:02:40.879> one<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.489> complaints<00:02:43.940> about<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
and one of the the complaints about the

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.300 
and one of the the complaints about the
mm<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.230> crystal<00:02:45.709> is<00:02:45.769> pretty<00:02:45.980> flush

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
mm is that the crystal is pretty flush

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.370 
mm is that the crystal is pretty flush
with<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.790> bezel<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.810> can<00:02:47.959> see<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
with the bezel and you can see that the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.470 
with the bezel and you can see that the
two<00:02:48.530> thousand<00:02:49.010> or<00:02:49.130> five<00:02:49.280> thousand<00:02:49.730> has<00:02:49.849> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
two thousand or five thousand has a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.690 
two thousand or five thousand has a
raised<00:02:51.049> bezel<00:02:51.349> to<00:02:51.680> give<00:02:52.069> that<00:02:52.220> crystal<00:02:52.670> a

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
raised bezel to give that crystal a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.059 
raised bezel to give that crystal a
little<00:02:52.880> more<00:02:53.000> protection<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.739> that's<00:02:54.890> one

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
little more protection so that's one

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.720 
little more protection so that's one
thing<00:02:55.220> they're<00:02:56.829> they're<00:02:57.829> both<00:02:57.920> multi<00:02:58.280> bed<00:02:58.430> six

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
thing they're they're both multi bed six

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.789 
thing they're they're both multi bed six
and<00:02:59.090> they're<00:02:59.480> both<00:02:59.569> water-resistant<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.620> 10

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
and they're both water-resistant to 10

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:07.619 
and they're both water-resistant to 10
meters<00:03:01.099> or<00:03:01.489> 7<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.910> 10<00:03:02.150> bar<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.959> 100<00:03:03.260> meters<00:03:03.500> and

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.699 

get<00:03:08.629> a<00:03:08.660> real<00:03:08.870> quick<00:03:09.079> and<00:03:09.319> you<00:03:09.410> see<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
get a real quick and you see the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.410 
get a real quick and you see the
thickness<00:03:09.920> they're<00:03:10.280> two<00:03:10.430> really<00:03:10.459> really

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
thickness they're two really really

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.009 
thickness they're two really really
different

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
different

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.960 
different
okay<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:14.180> does<00:03:14.450> fit<00:03:14.720> under<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.670> cup<00:03:16.670> of<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
okay this does fit under a cup of a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.750 
okay this does fit under a cup of a
button-down<00:03:17.450> shirt<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.220> I'll<00:03:19.310> compare<00:03:19.609> that

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
button-down shirt so I'll compare that

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.160 
button-down shirt so I'll compare that
to<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:20.319> sixty<00:03:21.319> nine<00:03:21.470> hundred<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:23.329> it's<00:03:23.389> it's<00:03:24.109> a

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
to a sixty nine hundred so it's it's a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.400 
to a sixty nine hundred so it's it's a
little<00:03:24.319> bit<00:03:24.500> bigger<00:03:24.799> than<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.100> 6900<00:03:29.410> trusty

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
little bit bigger than the 6900 trusty

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.180 
little bit bigger than the 6900 trusty
frogman<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.120> this<00:03:33.079> in<00:03:33.260> fact<00:03:33.290> is<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.650> front<00:03:34.010> and

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
frogman so this in fact is the front and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.330 
frogman so this in fact is the front and
that<00:03:34.280> was<00:03:34.370> run<00:03:34.549> over<00:03:34.670> by<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.940> car<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:36.250> seems<00:03:37.250> to

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
that was run over by a car and seems to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.940 
that was run over by a car and seems to
work<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.489> fine

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
work just fine

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.890 
work just fine
so<00:03:39.950> there<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.099> go<00:03:40.340> it's<00:03:40.790> just<00:03:41.569> leaving<00:03:41.870> a

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
so there you go it's just leaving a

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.030 
so there you go it's just leaving a
little<00:03:41.930> bit<00:03:42.109> bigger<00:03:42.349> than<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.530> fragment

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
little bit bigger than that fragment

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.069 
little bit bigger than that fragment
isn't<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:44.120> not<00:03:44.299> quite<00:03:44.480> as<00:03:44.599> thick<00:03:44.840> as<00:03:44.959> the

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
isn't it it's not quite as thick as the

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.909 
isn't it it's not quite as thick as the
Frog<00:03:45.319> that<00:03:47.079> still<00:03:48.079> pretty<00:03:48.290> big

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.740 

get<00:03:51.919> it<00:03:52.010> on<00:03:52.099> my<00:03:52.220> wrist<00:03:52.459> here<00:03:52.700> and<00:03:52.849> see<00:03:53.030> they

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
get it on my wrist here and see they

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.900 
get it on my wrist here and see they
compared<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.549> square

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.910 

you<00:03:59.420> can<00:03:59.570> see<00:03:59.810> its<00:04:00.740> comparison<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.550> that<00:04:02.920> it's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
you can see its comparison to that it's

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.550 
you can see its comparison to that it's
a<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:04.490> believe<00:04:04.940> that's<00:04:05.210> its<00:04:05.420> cousin<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:05.960> the

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
a I believe that's its cousin right the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.510 
a I believe that's its cousin right the
GW<00:04:07.040> 5000<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.990> PA<00:04:09.410> W<00:04:09.830> 5000<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.700> GW<00:04:11.210> 5000

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
GW 5000 so the PA W 5000 and the GW 5000

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.509 
GW 5000 so the PA W 5000 and the GW 5000
hanging<00:04:13.520> out<00:04:13.610> there<00:04:13.790> so<00:04:15.190> that's<00:04:16.190> it

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
hanging out there so that's it

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.390 
hanging out there so that's it
that<00:04:16.730> concludes<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.239> review<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.380> PA<00:04:19.070> W

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
that concludes the review of the PA W

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.270 
that concludes the review of the PA W
5000<00:04:20.030> it's<00:04:20.780> some<00:04:21.080> pretty<00:04:21.620> new<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.920> don't<00:04:22.070> think

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
5000 it's some pretty new I don't think

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.530 
reading the MSRP is gonna be in the four
to<00:04:37.310> five<00:04:37.490> hundred<00:04:37.520> dollar<00:04:37.880> range<00:04:37.970> which<00:04:38.390> is

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
to five hundred dollar range which is

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.010 
to five hundred dollar range which is
pretty<00:04:38.990> hefty<00:04:40.000> but<00:04:41.000> like<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.450> say<00:04:41.630> it's<00:04:41.810> pretty

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
pretty hefty but like I say it's pretty

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.750 
pretty hefty but like I say it's pretty
cool<00:04:42.170> watch<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:43.040> does<00:04:43.220> have<00:04:43.400> that<00:04:43.520> tough

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
cool watch it does have that tough

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000 
cool watch it does have that tough
movement<00:04:44.030> which<00:04:44.300> has<00:04:44.420> been<00:04:44.800> driving<00:04:45.800> the

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
movement which has been driving the

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.780 
movement which has been driving the
price<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.510> these<00:04:47.510> guys<00:04:47.720> up<00:04:48.460> every<00:04:49.460> model<00:04:49.700> it's

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
price of these guys up every model it's

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.730 
price of these guys up every model it's
come<00:04:49.940> out<00:04:50.000> on<00:04:50.180> so<00:04:50.330> far<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:50.810> I'm<00:04:51.350> sure<00:04:51.560> with<00:04:51.710> time

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
come out on so far so I'm sure with time

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.980 
come out on so far so I'm sure with time
that<00:04:52.160> will<00:04:52.310> come<00:04:52.460> down<00:04:52.640> but<00:04:52.880> it's<00:04:53.360> definitely

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
that will come down but it's definitely

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.980 
that will come down but it's definitely
new<00:04:54.440> new<00:04:55.400> technology<00:04:56.000> right<00:04:56.150> now<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.510> it's

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
new new technology right now and it's

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.750 
new new technology right now and it's
kind<00:04:57.140> of<00:04:57.230> how<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.410> goes<00:04:57.560> so<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.490> see<00:04:58.640> the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
kind of how it goes so you can see the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.860 
kind of how it goes so you can see the
minute<00:04:58.940> hand<00:04:59.060> moved<00:04:59.240> out<00:04:59.360> of<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.510> way<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.690> can

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
minute hand moved out of the way you can

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.840 
minute hand moved out of the way you can
see<00:05:00.020> the

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
see the

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.520 
see the
analog<00:05:01.850> display<00:05:02.000> pretty<00:05:02.450> easily<00:05:02.600> now<00:05:02.780> one

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
analog display pretty easily now one

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.780 
analog display pretty easily now one
thing<00:05:03.650> as<00:05:03.770> nice<00:05:03.950> as<00:05:04.130> these<00:05:04.340> hands<00:05:04.610> are

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
thing as nice as these hands are

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.090 
thing as nice as these hands are
skeletonized<00:05:05.450> and<00:05:05.720> they're<00:05:05.930> pretty<00:05:06.530> open<00:05:06.920> so

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
skeletonized and they're pretty open so

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.470 
skeletonized and they're pretty open so
that<00:05:07.250> even<00:05:07.430> when<00:05:07.610> it<00:05:07.700> is<00:05:07.790> over<00:05:07.970> top<00:05:08.240> of<00:05:08.390> that

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
that even when it is over top of that

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.420 
that even when it is over top of that
number<00:05:08.720> it<00:05:09.530> doesn't<00:05:09.680> show<00:05:09.890> up<00:05:09.950> quite<00:05:10.130> as<00:05:10.310> good

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
number it doesn't show up quite as good

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.360 
number it doesn't show up quite as good
on<00:05:10.580> video<00:05:10.760> but<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:12.260> really<00:05:12.500> isn't<00:05:12.710> not<00:05:13.250> all

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
on video but it really isn't not all

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.580 
on video but it really isn't not all
that<00:05:13.460> bad<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.790> read<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.630> I<00:05:14.810> find<00:05:15.230> that<00:05:15.320> graph

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
that bad to read and I find that graph

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.010 
that bad to read and I find that graph
pretty<00:05:15.890> easy<00:05:16.070> to<00:05:16.190> read<00:05:16.310> as<00:05:16.430> well<00:05:16.580> when<00:05:16.940> I'm<00:05:17.060> you

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
pretty easy to read as well when I'm you

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.720 
pretty easy to read as well when I'm you
know<00:05:18.140> walking<00:05:18.830> walking<00:05:19.310> around<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:19.520> can<00:05:19.669> look

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
know walking walking around I can look

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.430 
know walking walking around I can look
at<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:19.970> graph<00:05:20.180> and<00:05:20.360> I<00:05:20.390> can<00:05:20.540> tell<00:05:20.720> pretty

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
at that graph and I can tell pretty

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.870 
at that graph and I can tell pretty
easily<00:05:21.680> what<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.040> trend<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:22.430> there's<00:05:22.730> not

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
easily what the trend is there's not

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.600 
easily what the trend is there's not
really<00:05:23.090> any<00:05:23.650> dispute<00:05:24.650> as<00:05:24.830> to<00:05:24.860> that's<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.520> the

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
really any dispute as to that's and the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.110 
really any dispute as to that's and the
barometers<00:05:26.060> dropping<00:05:26.480> there<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:27.970> so<00:05:28.970> that's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
barometers dropping there so so that's

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.520 
barometers dropping there so so that's
about<00:05:29.300> it<00:05:29.450> it<00:05:29.540> has<00:05:29.690> this<00:05:29.840> nice<00:05:30.020> textured

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
about it it has this nice textured

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:38.440 
about it it has this nice textured
textured<00:05:31.340> dial<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:35.620> that's<00:05:36.620> pretty<00:05:36.919> much<00:05:37.100> it

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
textured dial and that's pretty much it

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.710 
textured dial and that's pretty much it
and<00:05:38.600> turn<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.680> lights<00:05:39.830> off<00:05:39.980> here<00:05:43.450> see<00:05:44.450> what<00:05:44.600> we

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
and turn the lights off here see what we

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.920 
and turn the lights off here see what we
got<00:05:44.990> for<00:05:45.460> sure<00:05:46.460> I<00:05:46.490> got<00:05:46.730> my<00:05:46.790> thumb<00:05:47.660> on<00:05:47.810> the

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
got for sure I got my thumb on the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.260 
got for sure I got my thumb on the
button<00:05:48.170> here<00:05:49.300> okay<00:05:50.300> so<00:05:50.570> it's<00:05:50.690> clearly<00:05:50.930> dark

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
button here okay so it's clearly dark

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.800 
button here okay so it's clearly dark
and<00:05:53.270> there<00:05:53.480> you<00:05:53.600> go<00:05:53.860> that's<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.960> illumination

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
and there you go that's the illumination

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:06.250 
and there you go that's the illumination
as<00:05:59.810> typical<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:02.330> can't<00:06:02.570> see<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:02.810> darn<00:06:03.110> thing<00:06:05.260> on

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
as typical you can't see a darn thing on

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.280 
as typical you can't see a darn thing on
the<00:06:07.240> LCD<00:06:08.240> as<00:06:08.300> well<00:06:08.510> you<00:06:08.630> can<00:06:08.840> there<00:06:09.110> you<00:06:09.230> go

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
the LCD as well you can there you go

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.930 
the LCD as well you can there you go
three<00:06:09.590> two<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.860> can<00:06:10.010> see<00:06:10.190> it<00:06:11.170> not<00:06:12.170> well<00:06:12.410> but

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
three two you can see it not well but

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.900 
three two you can see it not well but
you<00:06:13.940> can<00:06:14.120> see<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.360> I<00:06:15.520> don't<00:06:16.520> know<00:06:16.610> if<00:06:16.730> you<00:06:16.820> could

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
you can see it I don't know if you could

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.960 
you can see it I don't know if you could
see<00:06:18.040> anything<00:06:19.040> else<00:06:19.220> in<00:06:19.400> there<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.700> actually

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970 
see anything else in there and actually

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.100 
see anything else in there and actually
with<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:22.390> according<00:06:23.390> to<00:06:23.480> the<00:06:23.570> manual<00:06:23.900> you<00:06:24.020> can

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.110 
with the according to the manual you can

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.170 
with the according to the manual you can
see<00:06:24.260> the<00:06:24.350> hands<00:06:24.580> excellently<00:06:25.580> I<00:06:25.760> mean<00:06:25.910> there's

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
see the hands excellently I mean there's

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.700 
see the hands excellently I mean there's
really<00:06:26.750> no<00:06:26.930> problem<00:06:27.050> reading<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:27.530> time

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
really no problem reading the time

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.920 
really no problem reading the time
there's<00:06:27.980> is<00:06:28.220> it's<00:06:29.000> not<00:06:29.150> quite<00:06:29.420> as<00:06:29.540> bright<00:06:29.690> as

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
there's is it's not quite as bright as

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.200 
there's is it's not quite as bright as
the<00:06:30.110> that's<00:06:31.010> super<00:06:31.370> illuminator<00:06:31.790> the<00:06:32.030> dive

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
the that's super illuminator the dive

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.620 
the that's super illuminator the dive
watch<00:06:32.480> that<00:06:32.780> Casio<00:06:33.440> has<00:06:33.470> but<00:06:34.480> it's<00:06:35.480> pretty

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
watch that Casio has but it's pretty

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.620 
watch that Casio has but it's pretty
bright<00:06:35.870> for<00:06:36.110> sure<00:06:36.380> I<00:06:36.920> do<00:06:37.790> believe<00:06:38.180> that<00:06:38.210> the

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
bright for sure I do believe that the

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.920 
bright for sure I do believe that the
manual<00:06:38.990> tells<00:06:39.170> you<00:06:39.350> that<00:06:39.470> the<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.880> lights<00:06:41.120> the

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
manual tells you that the the lights the

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.370 
manual tells you that the the lights the
late<00:06:42.640> LED<00:06:43.640> light<00:06:43.790> is<00:06:43.910> actually<00:06:44.210> disabled<00:06:44.840> when

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
late LED light is actually disabled when

you get up in the middle of the night to

go water a tree you're gonna have a hard

time finding your way back because you

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.720 
time finding your way back because you
won't<00:06:57.590> bill<00:06:57.800> see<00:06:57.980> your<00:06:58.100> watch<00:06:58.250> unless<00:06:58.490> there's

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:58.730 
won't bill see your watch unless there's

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.970 
won't bill see your watch unless there's
a<00:06:58.790> good<00:06:58.820> moon<00:06:59.120> out<00:06:59.470> because<00:07:00.470> you<00:07:00.620> can't<00:07:00.830> see

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
a good moon out because you can't see

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.280 
a good moon out because you can't see
the<00:07:01.100> watch<00:07:01.250> with<00:07:01.460> the<00:07:01.550> light<00:07:01.730> and<00:07:02.290> these

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
the watch with the light and these

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.540 
the watch with the light and these
functions<00:07:03.740> won't<00:07:03.950> work<00:07:04.130> if<00:07:05.440> so<00:07:06.440> that's<00:07:07.400> one

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
functions won't work if so that's one

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.580 
functions won't work if so that's one
thing<00:07:07.700> that<00:07:07.760> that's<00:07:08.630> sort<00:07:08.870> of<00:07:08.900> a<00:07:08.990> downside<00:07:09.440> of

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
thing that that's sort of a downside of

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.410 
thing that that's sort of a downside of
that<00:07:09.710> but<00:07:09.920> I<00:07:09.950> guess<00:07:10.130> it's<00:07:10.310> they<00:07:10.910> got<00:07:11.090> to<00:07:11.240> make

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 
that but I guess it's they got to make

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.380 
that but I guess it's they got to make
some<00:07:12.160> sacrifices<00:07:13.160> for<00:07:13.790> battery<00:07:14.750> power

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
some sacrifices for battery power

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.790 
some sacrifices for battery power
although<00:07:17.390> you<00:07:18.230> know<00:07:18.350> I've<00:07:18.470> been<00:07:18.650> messing

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 
although you know I've been messing

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.320 
although you know I've been messing
around<00:07:19.010> with<00:07:19.160> this<00:07:19.340> for<00:07:19.700> the<00:07:19.760> last<00:07:19.880> two<00:07:20.120> days

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
around with this for the last two days

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.990 
around with this for the last two days
and<00:07:20.570> it's<00:07:21.290> been<00:07:21.410> on<00:07:21.530> my<00:07:21.620> wrist<00:07:22.120> one<00:07:23.120> day<00:07:24.220> and<00:07:25.220> it

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
and it's been on my wrist one day and it

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.490 
and it's been on my wrist one day and it
wasn't<00:07:26.420> all<00:07:26.600> that<00:07:26.630> Sonny<00:07:26.960> had<00:07:27.110> been<00:07:27.170> pretty

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
wasn't all that Sonny had been pretty

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.500 
wasn't all that Sonny had been pretty
much<00:07:27.590> rainy<00:07:27.830> today<00:07:28.160> and<00:07:28.400> it<00:07:28.880> stayed<00:07:29.150> high<00:07:29.450> the

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
much rainy today and it stayed high the

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.960 
much rainy today and it stayed high the
whole<00:07:29.690> time<00:07:29.960> so<00:07:30.290> I'd<00:07:31.190> say<00:07:31.340> that's<00:07:31.430> pretty<00:07:31.790> good

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970 
whole time so I'd say that's pretty good

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.080 
whole time so I'd say that's pretty good
I'd<00:07:32.900> say<00:07:33.050> that's<00:07:33.140> pretty<00:07:33.350> good

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.090 
I'd say that's pretty good

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.070 
I'd say that's pretty good
so<00:07:35.440> that's<00:07:36.440> it<00:07:36.680> that<00:07:36.890> concludes<00:07:37.840> the<00:07:38.840> phase

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:39.080 
so that's it that concludes the phase

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.549 
so that's it that concludes the phase
two<00:07:39.320> of<00:07:39.350> my<00:07:39.500> are<00:07:39.800> with<00:07:39.980> you

00:07:42.549 --> 00:07:42.559 

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:45.009 

if<00:07:43.369> I<00:07:43.459> have<00:07:43.609> anything<00:07:43.819> else<00:07:43.999> to<00:07:44.239> show<00:07:44.689> you<00:07:44.749> I'll

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:45.019 
if I have anything else to show you I'll

00:07:45.019 --> 00:07:48.639 
if I have anything else to show you I'll
be<00:07:45.379> sure<00:07:45.529> to<00:07:45.559> flip<00:07:46.039> the<00:07:46.129> camera<00:07:46.279> back<00:07:46.519> on
