now if you have a food processor that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.699 
now if you have a food processor that
would<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.090> even<00:02:35.569> better<00:02:35.599> but<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.230> don't<00:02:36.319> have

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
just want to put water into the blender

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.729 
just want to put water into the blender
and<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.620> want<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.859> strain<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:51.530> want

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
and then you want to strain it you want

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
moment I use 5 cups and I'm going to go

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.629 
moment I use 5 cups and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.200> put<00:03:00.379> some<00:03:00.620> water<00:03:00.829> in<00:03:01.159> it<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:01.340> let

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
ahead and put some water in it and let

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.199 
ahead and put some water in it and let
it<00:03:01.790> steam<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.689> once<00:03:03.680> it's<00:03:03.950> done<00:03:04.129> steaming<00:03:05.000> and

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
it steam and once it's done steaming and

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:12.700 
it steam and once it's done steaming and
gotten<00:03:05.750> pretty<00:03:06.170> soft

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.450 

I'm<00:03:13.250> going<00:03:13.550> to<00:03:13.610> use<00:03:13.850> a<00:03:13.880> potato<00:03:14.450> masher<00:03:15.460> and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
I'm going to use a potato masher and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
I'm going to use a potato masher and
start<00:03:17.420> mashing<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:18.110> up<00:03:21.760> two<00:03:22.760> hands<00:03:23.150> would<00:03:23.450> be

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
start mashing it up two hands would be

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.530 
start mashing it up two hands would be
so<00:03:23.990> much<00:03:24.290> better<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.300> want<00:03:26.480> to

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
so much better and you just want to

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.200 
so much better and you just want to
continue<00:03:26.870> mashing<00:03:27.460> until<00:03:28.460> you<00:03:28.580> get<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
continue mashing until you get it to the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.150 
continue mashing until you get it to the
consistency<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.320> like

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.570 

and<00:03:37.310> then<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.060> want<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.300> add<00:03:38.480> in<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.400> quarter<00:03:40.400> of
