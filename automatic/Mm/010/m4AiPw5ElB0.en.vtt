from fresh and it's my sister's but I
wanted<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.289> use<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.679> so<00:02:06.890> we're<00:02:07.009> going<00:02:07.069> to<00:02:07.220> use

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
wanted to use it so we're going to use

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.080 
wanted to use it so we're going to use
this<00:02:07.520> darker<00:02:08.060> brown<00:02:08.330> color<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.940> don't

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this darker brown color and you don't

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.130 
this darker brown color and you don't
want<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> get<00:02:11.360> too<00:02:11.540> much<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:11.870> on<00:02:12.110> your

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
want to get too much of that on your

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.720 
want to get too much of that on your
brush<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.590> want<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.799> tap<00:02:12.980> off<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.160> excess<00:02:13.310> and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
brush you want to tap off the excess and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.430 
brush you want to tap off the excess and
then<00:02:14.000> we're<00:02:14.180> just<00:02:14.209> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> work<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.170> right

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
then we're just going to work that right

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.180 
then we're just going to work that right
into<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.799> crease<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.830> don't<00:02:18.950> want<00:02:19.040> to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
into the crease and we don't want to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.830 
into the crease and we don't want to
work<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.459> too<00:02:19.730> far<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.239> just<00:02:20.390> really<00:02:20.660> want

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
work this too far up we just really want

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.010 
work this too far up we just really want
to<00:02:20.870> blend<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.290> in

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.440 

it's<00:02:32.020> do<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.380> have<00:02:32.560> that<00:02:32.880> bunt<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.060> little<00:02:34.330> bit

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
it's do we have that bunt a little bit

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:51.120 
it's do we have that bunt a little bit
more

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.490 

you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.970> go<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> little<00:02:52.450> bit<00:02:52.720> under<00:02:52.900> die<00:02:53.050> if<00:02:53.350> you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
you can go a little bit under die if you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.350 
you can go a little bit under die if you
want

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.030 

so<00:03:00.960> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.350> I<00:03:01.530> went<00:03:01.740> further<00:03:01.920> than

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so you can see that I went further than

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.200 
so you can see that I went further than
I<00:03:02.280> normally<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.760> um<00:03:03.210> I<00:03:04.970> guess<00:03:05.970> that's<00:03:06.150> just

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
I normally would um I guess that's just

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.660 
I normally would um I guess that's just
something<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:07.050> mean<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.040> want<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.430> blend

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
something I I mean I just want to blend

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.820 
something I I mean I just want to blend
because<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.420> makes<00:03:09.600> her<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:09.780> look<00:03:10.110> longer<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
because that makes her I look longer and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.110 
because that makes her I look longer and
more<00:03:11.100> open<00:03:11.520> um<00:03:12.590> so<00:03:13.590> next<00:03:13.890> we're<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> take

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
more open um so next we're going to take

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.200 
more open um so next we're going to take
a<00:03:15.510> mixture<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.050> two<00:03:16.290> blues<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.970> because

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
a mixture of two blues and just because

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.530 
a mixture of two blues and just because
I<00:03:18.330> didn't<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:20.130> blue<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.580> she<00:03:20.880> use<00:03:21.180> so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
I didn't have the blue that she use so

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.180 
I didn't have the blue that she use so
if<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.960> have<00:03:22.140> something<00:03:22.380> similar<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:22.860> just

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
if you have something similar then just

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.150 
if you have something similar then just
use<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.700> kind<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.540> like<00:03:24.870> well<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.830> very

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
use that kind of like well it's very

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.290 
use that kind of like well it's very
similar<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.910> blue<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:29.640> between<00:03:30.120> these

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
similar to this blue like between these

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.820 
similar to this blue like between these
two<00:03:30.510> actually<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.350> would<00:03:31.590> be<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
two actually is like would be the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.800 
two actually is like would be the
perfect<00:03:32.070> blow<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.209> since<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.570> don't<00:03:33.600> have

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
perfect blow but since we don't have

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.500 
perfect blow but since we don't have
that<00:03:34.370> we're<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.490> going<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.760> use<00:03:35.940> these<00:03:36.209> two

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
that we're just going to use these two

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.140 
that we're just going to use these two
um<00:03:36.930> after<00:03:37.680> cleaning<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.489> brush<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:38.910> used

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.900 

see<00:04:00.830> how<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.070> gave<00:04:01.250> us<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.490> little<00:04:01.610> bit<00:04:01.820> of

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
see how that gave us a little bit of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.590 
see how that gave us a little bit of
blue<00:04:03.160> we're<00:04:04.160> also<00:04:04.340> going<00:04:04.580> to<00:04:04.640> take<00:04:04.880> this<00:04:05.150> and

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
blue we're also going to take this and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:18.129 
blue we're also going to take this and
go<00:04:06.590> underneath<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.220> eye

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.860 

so<00:04:19.129> now<00:04:19.249> we<00:04:19.340> have<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.519> little<00:04:19.699> bit<00:04:19.789> of<00:04:19.879> blue<00:04:20.090> next

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
so now we have a little bit of blue next

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.070 
so now we have a little bit of blue next
we're<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.169> take<00:04:21.319> this<00:04:21.590> is<00:04:22.659> pompous<00:04:23.659> blue

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
we're going to take this is pompous blue

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.709 
we're going to take this is pompous blue
and<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.770> just<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:25.129> I<00:04:25.430> don't<00:04:25.669> know<00:04:25.759> if<00:04:25.819> Mac<00:04:26.479> has

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719 
and it's just a I don't know if Mac has

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:31.260 
and it's just a I don't know if Mac has
this<00:04:26.960> anymore<00:04:27.439> but<00:04:28.090> it's<00:04:29.090> just<00:04:29.240> like<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.419> powder

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
this anymore but it's just like a powder

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.550 
this anymore but it's just like a powder
like<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> deeper<00:04:32.659> blue<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.139> so<00:04:33.229> we're<00:04:33.349> going<00:04:33.439> to

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
like a deeper blue and so we're going to

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.769 
like a deeper blue and so we're going to
take<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.830> 22<00:04:34.279> again<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.639> we<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.419> want<00:04:35.659> a

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:35.779 
take that 22 again and we just want a

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.749 
take that 22 again and we just want a
tiny<00:04:36.110> tiny<00:04:36.529> bit<00:04:36.710> because<00:04:37.129> we're<00:04:37.430> just<00:04:37.610> going

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
tiny tiny bit because we're just going

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:50.519 
tiny tiny bit because we're just going
to<00:04:37.789> blend<00:04:37.999> that<00:04:38.210> into<00:04:38.449> this

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:50.529 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.289 

and<00:04:51.099> I<00:04:51.189> feel<00:04:51.369> like<00:04:51.399> that<00:04:51.639> gives<00:04:51.849> us<00:04:52.029> more<00:04:52.239> of

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:52.299 
and I feel like that gives us more of

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:54.059 
and I feel like that gives us more of
the<00:04:52.419> blue<00:04:52.599> that<00:04:52.629> we're<00:04:52.959> looking<00:04:53.139> for<00:04:53.349> me<00:04:53.949> and

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
the blue that we're looking for me and

open I guess cuz they're just a little
deeper<00:06:34.040> so<00:06:34.880> no<00:06:35.030> that's<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.930> shadow<00:06:36.169> and<00:06:36.560> we're
