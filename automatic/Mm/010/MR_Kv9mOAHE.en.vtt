00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
well I haven't really thought about it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.820 
well I haven't really thought about it
it's<00:03:12.890> just<00:03:13.190> I've<00:03:14.000> always<00:03:14.300> wondered<00:03:15.020> why<00:03:15.590> we're

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's just I've always wondered why we're

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.300 
it's just I've always wondered why we're
here<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.760> island<00:03:17.500> if<00:03:18.500> there<00:03:18.950> are<00:03:19.100> any

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
here on this island if there are any

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.210 
here on this island if there are any
other<00:03:19.520> worlds<00:03:19.850> out<00:03:19.970> there<00:03:20.530> why<00:03:21.530> did<00:03:21.710> we<00:03:21.920> end<00:03:22.100> up

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
other worlds out there why did we end up

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.050 
other worlds out there why did we end up
on<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.580> one<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:24.340> suppose<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.550> are<00:03:25.760> other

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
on this one and suppose there are other

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.970 
on this one and suppose there are other
worlds<00:03:28.660> then<00:03:29.660> ours<00:03:29.960> is<00:03:30.080> just<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.410> little<00:03:30.770> piece

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
worlds then ours is just a little piece

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
worlds then ours is just a little piece
of<00:03:31.010> something<00:03:31.430> much<00:03:31.850> greater<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:35.350> we<00:03:36.350> could

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
of something much greater so we could

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.020 
of something much greater so we could
have<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.920> as<00:03:37.070> easily<00:03:37.100> ended<00:03:37.640> up<00:03:37.790> somewhere

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
have just as easily ended up somewhere

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.810 
have just as easily ended up somewhere
else<00:03:38.300> right<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:39.250> don't<00:03:40.250> know<00:03:41.050> exactly<00:03:42.820> that's

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
else right I don't know exactly that's

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.670 
else right I don't know exactly that's
why<00:03:44.060> we<00:03:44.240> need<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.510> go<00:03:44.600> out<00:03:44.630> there<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:45.050> find<00:03:45.470> out

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680
