00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:09.390
 two 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.390
 a little 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.370
 Y 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.110
 food is a factor 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.169
 very important and you will wonder why 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.180
 because the ferret has some requirements 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:30.059
 nutritional supplements and a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.500
 little different from the rest of the animals 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.480
 the little animals that we usually have 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.940
 at home first of all tell you that the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 ferret is a strict carnivore is a 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.730
 animal that only feeds 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.010
 Meat and meat can be also 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 small portions of fish but about 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.900
 all of protein of animal origin 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 we recommend and we usually use 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.989
 the feed that is made based on 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.170
 chicken proteins therefore 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.230
 we will use those feed we will use 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 raw materials that are meat meat 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.119
 fresh if possible with a treatment 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.549
 of extrusion that makes it conserve 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.460
 much more easily and packed in 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 packaging in atmosphere bags 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.990
 modified to endure in the greatest 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.000
 closed time in other chapters os 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.090
 we had commented 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 let's say how bad it was extrusion ar by 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 how bad it was that the animals 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.550
 herbivores will be fed with food 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.100
 that are 100% extruded here changes 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.680
 a little the movie or the version because 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.260
 really the extrusion for the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.260
 omnivores carnivores or some species 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.650
 of monogastric goes well because it facilitates 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.170
 the digestion to a great extent to have 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.050
 made a strong heat treatment 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.210
 previous that denatures quite all 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.479
 the raw materials of which it is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.160
 composed therefore the majority the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.229
 most would tell you one hundred percent of the 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.600
 feed that you will find in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.970
 market for ferrets are feed that already 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.410
 they are extruded where where the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.680
 cereal that by the way the cereal has 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.050
 to be the minimum possible even if it 's 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.459
 possible also to be free 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.440
 of cereal because the truth that the 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.620
 carbohydrates in ferrets 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.300
 they have to be as little as possible what 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.880
 happens is that yes we need that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.010
 are present for the process 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 formation of the feed is to say this 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.600
 I think it has that shape thanks to 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.430
 is extruded 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.930
 passes a heat treatment as 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 explained how it happens in popcorn 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.580
 when we subject it to heat it explodes and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.520
 that's the reaction that the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.830
 starch with heat 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.810
 Most feed from the market 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.540
 you will find that they have references 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 for ferret baby and adult ferret and is that 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.280
 the requirements are quite 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.220
 different the one that we have here the willy 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.300
 this has exactly two now 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.820
 months and a half 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.690
 therefore the food that is taking 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.580
 It is a food Babys difference and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.070
 I think baby of the adult then you will see the 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.080
 baby is a think that is more powerful 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.390
 as really wheel since in this case 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.210
 has to grow is a feed that has 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.660
 more protein that has more fat than 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.460
 has more calcium and that is one that has 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.460
 a little more vitamins 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.720
 However feed as an adult is 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.070
 reduces the level of protein since they are 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.320
 animals that do not have to grow are 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
 feed and more light a little more than 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.930
 maintenance and on the other hand the fats 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.140
 it is important to provide an extra 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.900
 Essential fatty acids are some fats 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.370
 specials that goes very well for hair 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.740
 for the shine of the hair and to avoid 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.480
 problems also and even in the 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.430
 intestinal transit of ferrets 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.800
 you know that ferrets tend to eat everything 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.980
 kind of things that are then 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.690
 these fats and even the malt that is 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.270
 the same one that we give to cats is going 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.670
 very well so that everything runs fast 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.590
 by the intestine plus the levels of 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.900
 fat that they need are great 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.140
 they secrete their own fat in the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.760
 hair that protects them waterproofs them 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.860
 somehow also and that is 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.860
 market as you see here 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.819
 in drinkable fats such as acids 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.620
 polyunsaturated fatty acids are liquid and 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.290
 they usually like it is usually used 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.750
 salmon oil or some oils 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.810
 vegetables and let's see if the friend here 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.030
 he wants to try it because the little ones 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.580
 we started to give more or less with this 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.830
 old you see that fatty acids 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.139
 essentials really love a 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.389
 once they are tested they are necessary 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.979
 you should not abuse them too much and 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.540
 they do very well when you see them that they have 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.360
 swallowed also anything times 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.430
 playing at home they will comment and bite 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.500
 stories because this makes all the 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.139
 digestive system be like more 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.020
 slippery and you can defecate better 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.570
 besides being fundamental in your diet and 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.710
 is the most beneficial fat for your 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.550
 Health 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.470
 also vitamins as optional they are 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.050
 they can supplement and then it's okay 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.450
 have some kind of prize prizes 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.660
 They are usually made based also on 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.860
 meat you do not have to abuse them but you 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.390
 They can offer you about 10 or 12 a day and 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.240
 they are also called as you see them called 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.050
 a lot of attention because they have 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.880
 an extra an extra flavor that calls them 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.130
 the attention is good we use them 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.170
 for when we get the ferrets 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.180
 do things well do the loads in your 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.010
 site they even get to do some 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.840
 tricks can be taught to give the 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.840
 turn or stand up
