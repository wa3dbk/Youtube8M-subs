00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.709
 wins today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 Let's continue our recording of the test. 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.410
 of enem in 2013 yellow notebook 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.740
 Good chemistry issues look at this 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.839
 issue here in this treatment step 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.990
 which he cites in the question 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:30.480
 we perceive by the two equilibria 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 chemicals that are here that there is a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.820
 predominance of hydrogen generating the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.570
 acid medium as the preferred medium for 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.440
 that the reaction happens the announced also 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.770
 makes it clear that acid and populous 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.270
 of greater disinfection action 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.700
 so if the subject on landing is the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.280
 which has greater disinfection power and 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.190
 the acid medium is what proliferates a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.409
 equilibrium displacement capable of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.940
 increase the production of chlorogenic acid 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:13.980
 the ph 5 which is the pH below 7 and therefore 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.550
 characterizing acid medium is what will 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.860
 to determine an equilibrium displacement 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.830
 by increasing the concentration of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.159
 hydrogen in the sense of producing more 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.159
 acid and populous and thereby improve the 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.950
 disinfection process because I do not 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.010
 I opted for ph zero which would be another 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.130
 possible acidic option because 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.040
 when ph is very extreme 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.450
 in this case it will proliferate training 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.570
 chlorine gas and not porous acid 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 therefore the only possible answer would be 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.479
 which determines pH 5 and there also 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.479
 until the next a big hug 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.110
