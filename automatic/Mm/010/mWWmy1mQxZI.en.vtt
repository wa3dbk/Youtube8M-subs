00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.331
 Take the wheelchair bus to Quebec City? 

00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:04.800
 It's possible ! 

00:00:05.728 --> 00:00:08.804
 If you move in a manual or electric wheelchair, 

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:14.695
 you can board Ã‰colobus and articulated buses on routes 800, 801 and 802. 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:21.011
 To be able to take the bus at a stop, the stop zone must be accessible. 

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:24.857
 A pictogram on the stop sign allows you to check it. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.054
 When the bus is near, be clearly visible and signal to the driver to know you want to get on. 

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:39.851
 The pictogram displayed at the bus door indicates that the bus has a ramp. 

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.036
 You go up? 

00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:43.904
 Stand back from the sidewalk so the ramp can open. 

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:47.247
 Once it is fully deployed, you can then climb. 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.238
 The anti-tip system of your chair must be in place. 

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:56.536
 At any given time, there can only be one person in a wheelchair on a bus. 

00:00:56.944 --> 00:01:03.010
 If you have difficulty paying your right of way, you can ask for assistance from the driver. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.492
 &lt;i&gt; I need help please. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:05.758
 &lt;i&gt; Yes, for a moment, I'll help you. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:08.498
 &lt;i&gt; That's it! &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:08.498 --> 00:01:09.284
 &lt;i&gt; Thank you very much. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:10.702
 &lt;I&gt; Welcome. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:20.628
 To get into the priority space, walk down the aisle and back so you always look back 

00:01:20.932 --> 00:01:24.093
 until your backrest is resting on the cushion. 

00:01:25.437 --> 00:01:30.629
 Once installed, make sure your backrest is upright and apply the brakes. 

00:01:30.982 --> 00:01:36.703
 If you are using a walker, you can also ask the driver to deploy the ramp. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.378
 However, scooters and scooters are not allowed on board. 

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:52.914

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.730
 When approaching your destination, press the stop button.

 If you can not do it yourself, tell the driver where to stop when you board the bus. 

00:02:14.143 --> 00:02:19.533
 The driver will check that the requested stop is accessible before deploying the ramp. 

00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:27.296
