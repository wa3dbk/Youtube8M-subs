but I didn't want to tie up my money as
to<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.820> moment<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.650> did<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.680> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> moment

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to at the moment I did not at the moment

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.580 
to at the moment I did not at the moment
at<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.880> moment<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.570> didn't<00:01:36.930> think<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
at that moment I didn't think that it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550 
at that moment I didn't think that it
was<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:38.100> worth<00:01:38.310> spending<00:01:39.530> over<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
was gonna be worth spending over a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.450 
was gonna be worth spending over a
gianna<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.570> figures<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.009> wasn't<00:01:44.340> worth

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
gianna on two figures so it wasn't worth

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.539 
gianna on two figures so it wasn't worth
for<00:01:44.820> me<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.570> moment<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.860> biker<00:01:47.070> girl

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
for me at the moment but the biker girl

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
for me at the moment but the biker girl
I<00:01:47.640> did<00:01:48.119> have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.500> got<00:01:49.770> her<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
I did have to get and I got her a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
I did have to get and I got her a
motorcycle<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.210> not<00:01:51.360> exactly<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.869> same

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
motorcycle which is not exactly the same

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.280

one<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> she<00:01:52.649> has<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> movie<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:55.079> this

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
one that she has in the movie but this

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
one that she has in the movie but this
is<00:01:55.439> close<00:01:55.710> enough<00:01:55.890> because<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.549> has<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
is close enough because it has the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.850 
is close enough because it has the
yellow<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.509> little<00:01:57.750> souped<00:01:57.930> up<00:01:58.140> so
