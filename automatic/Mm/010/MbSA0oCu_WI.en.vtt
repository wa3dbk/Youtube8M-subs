00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.600 

okay<00:00:00.960> so<00:00:01.020> this<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.380> how<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.589> zoom<00:00:01.890> works<00:00:02.190> in<00:00:02.520> a

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay so this is how the zoom works in a

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.090 
okay so this is how the zoom works in a
multiple<00:00:03.000> burial<00:00:03.360> situation<00:00:04.049> these<00:00:05.040> are

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
multiple burial situation these are

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.559 
multiple burial situation these are
pretty<00:00:05.790> rare<00:00:06.029> and<00:00:06.330> they're<00:00:06.420> always

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
pretty rare and they're always

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.259 
pretty rare and they're always
complicated<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> deal<00:00:07.529> with<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.069> wouldn't<00:00:09.059> get

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
complicated to deal with I wouldn't get

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.160 
complicated to deal with I wouldn't get
too<00:00:09.690> worked<00:00:10.139> up<00:00:10.940> with<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.150> complexity<00:00:12.900> here

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
too worked up with the complexity here

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.990 
too worked up with the complexity here
any<00:00:13.500> transceivers<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> be<00:00:14.460> difficult

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
any transceivers going to be difficult

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.790 
any transceivers going to be difficult
and<00:00:16.940> here<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.180> exactly<00:00:18.510> where<00:00:18.810> practice<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
and here is exactly where practice and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.310 
and here is exactly where practice and
preparation<00:00:20.070> makes<00:00:20.640> all<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.000> difference

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
preparation makes all the difference

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.290 
preparation makes all the difference
okay<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.380> I've<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> imaginary<00:00:23.699> situation

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
okay so I've got the imaginary situation

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.279 
okay so I've got the imaginary situation
two<00:00:25.109> transceivers<00:00:25.740> buried<00:00:27.289> both

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
two transceivers buried both

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.169 
two transceivers buried both
approximately<00:00:28.949> 40<00:00:29.250> 50<00:00:29.609> meters<00:00:29.910> away<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
approximately 40 50 meters away at the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.830 
approximately 40 50 meters away at the
moment<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> I'll<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.640> into<00:00:32.940> search<00:00:33.420> mode<00:00:33.690> on

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
moment so I'll go into search mode on

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.389 
moment so I'll go into search mode on
the<00:00:33.930> transceiver<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:37.680> does<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> quick<00:00:38.129> search

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the transceiver it does a quick search

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.660 
the transceiver it does a quick search
around<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.450> can't<00:00:39.690> find<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.989> signal<00:00:40.489> to<00:00:41.489> work

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
around if it can't find a signal to work

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.880 
around if it can't find a signal to work
on<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> gives<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.629> good<00:00:43.050> pattern<00:00:43.320> search<00:00:43.649> like

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
on it gives a good pattern search like

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.970 
on it gives a good pattern search like
this<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:45.289> that's<00:00:46.289> often<00:00:46.469> what<00:00:46.680> you'll<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:46.890> at

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
this so that's often what you'll get at

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
this so that's often what you'll get at
the<00:00:47.039> site<00:00:47.250> search<00:00:47.550> which<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.850> fine<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.690> means

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the site search which is fine it means

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
the site search which is fine it means
basically<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:50.640> doing<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.910> good<00:00:51.090> search

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
basically start doing the good search

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
basically start doing the good search
and<00:00:51.629> cover<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> ground<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
and cover the ground so I'm going to do

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.000 
and cover the ground so I'm going to do
that<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.510> fairly<00:00:54.750> quickly<00:00:55.010> walking

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
that you know fairly quickly walking

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.209 
that you know fairly quickly walking
down<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.610> imaginary<00:00:57.170> grid<00:00:58.170> line<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.739> guess<00:00:59.039> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
down my imaginary grid line I guess in

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.789 
down my imaginary grid line I guess in
the<00:00:59.280> middle<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.579> Avalanche<00:00:59.760> path

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:22.120 

here<00:01:08.799> we<00:01:08.890> go<00:01:10.950> moving<00:01:11.950> fast

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.010 

I<00:01:23.470> care<00:01:24.470> now<00:01:24.590> got<00:01:24.710> my<00:01:24.799> first<00:01:25.009> signal<00:01:25.430> now

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.080 

there<00:01:30.020> we<00:01:30.110> go<00:01:30.229> forty<00:01:30.680> meters<00:01:31.009> that<00:01:31.159> way<00:01:31.369> so

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
there we go forty meters that way so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.820 
there we go forty meters that way so
I'll<00:01:32.390> follow<00:01:32.600> what<00:01:32.810> it<00:01:32.900> says<00:01:33.880> okay<00:01:35.619> now<00:01:36.619> what's

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
I'll follow what it says okay now what's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.030 
I'll follow what it says okay now what's
happened<00:01:37.189> is<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:37.759> worked<00:01:38.420> out<00:01:39.040> its

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
happened is it's worked out its

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.999 
happened is it's worked out its
receiving<00:01:40.520> two<00:01:40.729> signals<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:42.619> tell<00:01:42.890> that

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
receiving two signals you can tell that

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.999 
receiving two signals you can tell that
by<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.960> two<00:01:44.960> personal<00:01:45.470> icon<00:01:45.710> here<00:01:45.890> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
by this two personal icon here the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.149 
by this two personal icon here the
lights<00:01:46.190> come<00:01:46.460> on<00:01:47.350> means<00:01:48.350> means<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.890> can<00:01:49.070> be

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
lights come on means means you can be

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.710 
lights come on means means you can be
definitely<00:01:49.520> wary<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.149> there's<00:01:50.299> two<00:01:50.509> people

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
definitely wary that there's two people

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.010 
definitely wary that there's two people
buried<00:01:51.310> but<00:01:52.310> what<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:52.549> does<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.970> kind<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.450> just

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
buried but what it does it kind of just

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.690 
buried but what it does it kind of just
shows<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.440> direction<00:01:55.009> to<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.220> nearest

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
shows you the direction to the nearest

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.870 
shows you the direction to the nearest
person<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.740> it's<00:01:58.009> kind<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.280> masking<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.819> a

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
person so it's kind of masking of a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.070 
person so it's kind of masking of a
person<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.270> moment<00:01:59.569> is<00:01:59.630> showing<00:01:59.840> you<00:01:59.960> that

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
person that moment is showing you that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.690 
person that moment is showing you that
there's<00:02:00.259> two<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.009> showing<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.550> way

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
there's two but it's showing you the way

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.570 
there's two but it's showing you the way
to<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.060> first<00:02:02.300> person<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.869> nearest<00:02:03.259> person

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
to the first person the nearest person

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.480 
to the first person the nearest person
so<00:02:04.580> we<00:02:04.700> follow<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:06.950> bits<00:02:07.220> just

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so we follow that and this bits just

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.160 
so we follow that and this bits just
like<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.819> single<00:02:08.030> person<00:02:08.539> search<00:02:08.780> from<00:02:09.019> now

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
like the single person search from now

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.449 
like the single person search from now
on<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.640> follow<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.180> arrow<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.950> Dutch<00:02:13.190> the

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
on you follow the arrow the Dutch the

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.360 
on you follow the arrow the Dutch the
distance<00:02:13.819> is<00:02:13.910> going<00:02:14.030> down<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:16.010> know<00:02:16.069> you're

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
distance is going down you know you're

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.330 
distance is going down you know you're
in<00:02:16.519> takes<00:02:16.790> it<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.890> as<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.950> comes<00:02:19.250> around

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
in takes it as it as it comes around

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.759 
in takes it as it as it comes around
like<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:21.640> okay<00:02:22.640> six<00:02:22.970> meters<00:02:23.709> started<00:02:24.709> to

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
like that okay six meters started to

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.000 
like that okay six meters started to
slow<00:02:24.980> down<00:02:25.010> cuz<00:02:25.459> I'm<00:02:25.519> getting<00:02:25.730> quite<00:02:25.850> near<00:02:26.269> it

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
slow down cuz I'm getting quite near it

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.910 
slow down cuz I'm getting quite near it
three<00:02:28.010> meters<00:02:28.810> real<00:02:29.810> intake<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.500> three

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
three meters real intake there three

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.830 
three meters real intake there three
meters<00:02:31.959> 2.8<00:02:32.959> 2.2<00:02:33.940> gets<00:02:34.940> below<00:02:35.090> two<00:02:35.360> meters

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
meters 2.8 2.2 gets below two meters

meters 2.8 2.2 gets below two meters
tone<00:02:36.769> increases<00:02:37.690> tells<00:02:38.690> me<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.989> do<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:42.549> pinpoint

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
tone increases tells me to do a pinpoint

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.160 
tone increases tells me to do a pinpoint
search<00:02:43.790> at<00:02:43.970> this<00:02:44.030> point<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.900> get<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
search at this point so I get the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.410 
search at this point so I get the
transceiver<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:45.920> ground<00:02:46.160> do<00:02:46.850> my<00:02:47.000> pinpoint

low point one point one is now going
back<00:02:56.150> up<00:02:56.299> again<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:56.989> back<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> low<00:02:57.829> point

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
back up again so back to the low point

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.810 
back up again so back to the low point
and<00:02:58.489> then<00:02:58.880> search<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.650> perpendicular<00:03:01.040> axes

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
and then search and a perpendicular axes

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.520 
and then search and a perpendicular axes
there<00:03:02.060> go<00:03:02.209> one<00:03:02.420> point<00:03:02.660> seven<00:03:02.989> one<00:03:03.049> point<00:03:03.109> three

there go one point seven one point three

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.370 
there go one point seven one point three
one<00:03:04.090> point<00:03:05.090> eight<00:03:05.299> well<00:03:06.019> that's<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.260> good

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
one point eight well that's a good

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.990 
one point eight well that's a good
enough<00:03:06.620> point<00:03:06.890> five<00:03:07.100> there<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.489> go<00:03:07.670> I'll<00:03:07.880> be

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
enough point five there we go I'll be

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.640 
enough point five there we go I'll be
digging<00:03:08.180> there<00:03:08.480> or<00:03:08.690> probing<00:03:09.200> then<00:03:09.350> dig<00:03:09.530> in

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
digging there or probing then dig in

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.900 
digging there or probing then dig in
here<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:11.390> basically<00:03:11.660> you're<00:03:12.049> gonna<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.320> to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
here so basically you're gonna have to

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.599 
here so basically you're gonna have to
uncover<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.810> person

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
uncover this person

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.410 
uncover this person
there's<00:03:16.609> no<00:03:16.700> point<00:03:16.940> unless<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.299> need<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
there's no point unless you need a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.490 
there's no point unless you need a
really<00:03:17.630> big<00:03:17.660> group<00:03:17.840> there's<00:03:18.079> no<00:03:18.170> point<00:03:18.380> trying

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
really big group there's no point trying

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.259 
really big group there's no point trying
to<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:18.890> pick<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.459> out<00:03:19.640> trying<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.090> search

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
to just pick the out trying to search

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.970 
to just pick the out trying to search
the<00:03:20.390> other<00:03:20.510> person<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.140> guys<00:03:21.709> are<00:03:21.890> just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
the other person you guys are just

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.630 
the other person you guys are just
thickness<00:03:22.310> but<00:03:22.459> not<00:03:22.670> first<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.780> do<00:03:24.109> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
thickness but not first so you do that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.800 
thickness but not first so you do that
dig<00:03:25.640> them<00:03:25.790> up<00:03:25.910> uncover<00:03:26.870> their<00:03:27.049> transceiver

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
dig them up uncover their transceiver

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.729 
dig them up uncover their transceiver
put<00:03:29.810> their<00:03:29.959> trans<00:03:30.199> Eve<00:03:30.350> into<00:03:30.500> search<00:03:30.829> mode

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.660 

now<00:03:34.739> then<00:03:36.560> means<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.950> zoom<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.580> now

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
now then means that the zoom can now

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.199 
now then means that the zoom can now
focus<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:39.300> second<00:03:39.630> transceiver<00:03:40.050> and

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
focus on the second transceiver and

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.940 
focus on the second transceiver and
again<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.450> like<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.319> second<00:03:43.680> part<00:03:43.709> to

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
again it's just like the second part to

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.370 
again it's just like the second part to
search<00:03:44.190> there<00:03:44.580> 20<00:03:45.300> 21<00:03:45.630> meters<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.200> just

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
search there 20 21 meters you just

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:55.030 
search there 20 21 meters you just
follow<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.830> says<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.980> off<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.400> go

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:19.039 

little<00:03:56.040> prompt<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:56.670> orientate<00:04:16.700> search<00:04:17.900> get<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
little prompt we orientate search get to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:25.850 
little prompt we orientate search get to
the<00:04:19.139> ground<00:04:21.200> 1.3<00:04:22.200> 1.4<00:04:23.690> 0.6<00:04:24.690> so<00:04:25.020> 1.3<00:04:25.560> using<00:04:25.770> my

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
the ground 1.3 1.4 0.6 so 1.3 using my

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.360 
the ground 1.3 1.4 0.6 so 1.3 using my
low<00:04:26.040> point<00:04:26.720> giveaway<00:04:30.560> so<00:04:31.560> my<00:04:31.919> low<00:04:32.040> point<00:04:32.070> was

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
low point giveaway so my low point was

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.180 
low point giveaway so my low point was
there<00:04:32.639> so<00:04:33.000> then<00:04:33.350> getting<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.440> AXYZ<00:04:34.919> is

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
there so then getting that AXYZ is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.850 
there so then getting that AXYZ is
getting<00:04:35.520> worse<00:04:38.210> okay<00:04:39.210> point<00:04:39.990> 6<00:04:40.260> point<00:04:40.440> 5<00:04:40.650> that

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
getting worse okay point 6 point 5 that

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.310 
getting worse okay point 6 point 5 that
means<00:04:40.890> I'm<00:04:41.160> just<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.460> top<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:43.289> know

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
means I'm just on top of it so you know

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.190 
means I'm just on top of it so you know
that's<00:04:43.650> why<00:04:43.800> I'd<00:04:43.919> probe<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.340> start<00:04:44.520> digging

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
that's why I'd probe and start digging

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.700 
that's why I'd probe and start digging
so<00:04:46.200> that's<00:04:46.350> it

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
so that's it

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.550 
so that's it
that's<00:04:47.580> how<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:47.820> do<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.150> multiple<00:04:48.539> search<00:04:48.780> we

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
that's how you do the multiple search we

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.180 
that's how you do the multiple search we
resume<00:04:49.919> that's<00:04:50.640> 2<00:04:50.850> transceivers<00:04:52.190> they're

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
resume that's 2 transceivers they're

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.670 
resume that's 2 transceivers they're
probably<00:04:54.000> 10<00:04:54.300> meters<00:04:54.539> apart<00:04:57.380> both<00:04:58.380> found

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
probably 10 meters apart both found

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.730 
probably 10 meters apart both found
quite<00:04:58.950> easily

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
quite easily

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.130 
quite easily
yeah<00:05:01.740> that's<00:05:01.950> it
