00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
happened and we're gonna skip into the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.680 
happened and we're gonna skip into the
fourth<00:06:37.280> quarter<00:06:37.520> not<00:06:37.880> a<00:06:37.910> lot<00:06:38.120> of<00:06:38.150> happening

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
between that because I got fouled a lot

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.270
