you can see i'm here near a beach i'm

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:37.600 
you can see i'm here near a beach i'm
having<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> great<00:00:26.900> country<00:00:27.900> side

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.950 

it's<00:00:38.210> very<00:00:38.450> huge<00:00:38.900> test<00:00:39.410> trees<00:00:39.920> attest<00:00:40.520> some

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
it's very huge test trees attest some

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.660 
it's very huge test trees attest some
basic<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.790> our<00:00:43.790> generation<00:00:44.510> algorithms<00:00:45.670> for

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
basic and our generation algorithms for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.400 
basic and our generation algorithms for
example<00:00:47.360> it<00:00:48.110> places<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.860> trees<00:00:49.520> on<00:00:50.150> grass<00:00:50.720> us

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
example it places the trees on grass us

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.150 
example it places the trees on grass us
and<00:00:52.150> not<00:00:53.150> on<00:00:53.390> stone<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.460> can<00:00:56.500> stick<00:00:57.500> around<00:00:57.530> I'm

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
and not on stone I can stick around I'm

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.060

you're<00:00:58.580> in<00:00:58.700> bowling<00:00:59.180> mode<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:02.650> last<00:01:03.650> week<00:01:03.920> I

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
you're in bowling mode and last week I

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.060 
you're in bowling mode and last week I
did<00:01:04.129> some<00:01:06.160> optimization<00:01:07.160> on<00:01:07.460> loading<00:01:08.060> and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
did some optimization on loading and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.320 
did some optimization on loading and
yeah<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.250> works<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:12.080> you<00:01:12.590> go<00:01:12.800> until<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
yeah it works like this you go until the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.140 
yeah it works like this you go until the
end<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.290> level<00:01:15.650> enter<00:01:16.100> where<00:01:16.610> generator

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
end of the level enter where generator

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.530 
end of the level enter where generator
creates<00:01:17.900> new<00:01:19.240> parts<00:01:20.240> of<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.690> world<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:24.280> it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
creates new parts of the world and it's

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.430 
creates new parts of the world and it's
technically<00:01:26.540> unlimited<00:01:27.410> world<00:01:27.770> sighs<00:01:28.070> and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
technically unlimited world sighs and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.410 
technically unlimited world sighs and
yes<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.619> will<00:01:30.800> have<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> lot<00:01:31.970> of<00:01:32.000> fun

yes you will have a lot of fun
discovering<00:01:32.960> new<00:01:33.830> places<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.810> awkward<00:01:35.810> and

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
discovering new places of awkward and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.210 
discovering new places of awkward and
and<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.790> will<00:01:38.000> continue<00:01:38.330> working<00:01:38.840> on<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.860> board

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
and I will continue working on the board

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.240 
and I will continue working on the board
generator<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:41.750> creates<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.409> very<00:01:42.979> cool

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
generator that it creates a very cool

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.090 
generator that it creates a very cool
countryside<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.680> yeah<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.460> will<00:01:47.080> have<00:01:49.780> yes

cool discovering experiences with what

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.340 
cool discovering experiences with what
word<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.500> yes<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.369> must<00:01:58.520> say<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.960> first

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
word and yes I must say it's the first

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.370 
word and yes I must say it's the first
pocket<00:02:01.310> sandbox<00:02:02.210> game<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.780> supports

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
pocket sandbox game that supports

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.219 
pocket sandbox game that supports
unlimited<00:02:03.920> words<00:02:04.220> with<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.240> variety<00:02:05.930> of

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
unlimited words with that variety of

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.810 
unlimited words with that variety of
them<00:02:06.770> yes<00:02:07.430> features<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.920> seems<00:02:10.220> like<00:02:10.519> I'm

and<00:02:42.860> discover<00:02:43.370> some<00:02:44.860> underwater<00:02:45.860> wolves

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.020 

this<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.310> actually<00:03:19.820> very<00:03:19.850> cool<00:03:24.880> we<00:03:25.880> have<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
this is actually very cool we have a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.320 
this is actually very cool we have a
very<00:03:27.070> far<00:03:28.070> distant<00:03:28.960> countryside<00:03:29.960> you<00:03:30.410> can

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
very far distant countryside you can

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.890 
very far distant countryside you can
view<00:03:32.330> very<00:03:32.810> far<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.800> if<00:03:34.730> you<00:03:35.450> have<00:03:35.600> some

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
view very far and if you have some

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.550 
view very far and if you have some
different<00:03:36.650> geometries<00:03:37.520> and<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:39.170> looking

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
different geometries and it's looking

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.740 
different geometries and it's looking
very<00:03:39.880> natural<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:42.340> also<00:03:43.340> am<00:03:43.580> saving<00:03:44.030> works

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
very natural and also am saving works

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.530 
very natural and also am saving works
very<00:03:45.080> fast<00:03:45.260> now<00:03:46.930> as<00:03:47.930> I<00:03:48.170> can<00:03:48.790> build<00:03:49.790> something

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:12.190 

example<00:03:53.540> oh<00:03:55.120> I'm<00:03:56.120> taking<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:56.750> here

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.449 

okay<00:04:14.200> now<00:04:15.200> choosing<00:04:15.800> them<00:04:16.130> safe<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:17.810> did

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
okay now choosing them safe you did

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.590 
okay now choosing them safe you did
unloading<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:20.060> know<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:21.320> wat<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:22.600> after

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
unloading you know that wat it after

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.810 
unloading you know that wat it after
saving<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:24.230> rebuilds<00:04:25.010> whole<00:04:25.430> geometry

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
saving it rebuilds whole geometry

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.020 
saving it rebuilds whole geometry
because<00:04:27.010> it's<00:04:28.010> some<00:04:28.450> technical<00:04:29.450> issue<00:04:31.030> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
because it's some technical issue and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.310 
because it's some technical issue and
reloading<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.889> board<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:35.180> now<00:04:35.960> i<00:04:35.990> can

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
reloading the board and now i can

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:46.180 
reloading the board and now i can
continue<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:44.300> first<00:04:44.600> time<00:04:44.870> ethnicity<00:04:45.560> needs

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
continue the first time ethnicity needs

00:04:46.190 --> 00:05:00.700 
continue the first time ethnicity needs
a<00:04:46.370> little<00:04:46.580> bit<00:04:52.900> come<00:04:53.900> on

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.920 

it<00:05:01.430> also<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:01.910> be<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.090> bug<00:05:02.360> maybe<00:05:04.150> but<00:05:05.150> I'm<00:05:05.450> sure

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
it also can be a bug maybe but I'm sure
