00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 It will be safe to keep close to her, but when she starts shooting, leave. However, bear in mind that her bullets can rebound in you. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.120
 Just move to the right and then the top when you're out at the corner. 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.360
 Reimu: Grandfather, something stinks. 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 Ganji: Madam, look over there. 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.220
 ??: Still noticed ... 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.600
 Meira: My name is Meira. I came to take hakurey. 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.120
 Reimu: Hey, hey, slow down! 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.600
 Reimu: Well, I guess I don’t mind, but ... 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.220
 Meira:? In any case, if the victory is for me, the power of Hakurey is mine! 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.100
 Reimu: Um ... Do we have to fight? Because I would not want to. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.320
 Hmm He seems to be a little different. Meir:!? 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.440
 Reimu: Well, what's the matter? 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.420
 Meira: Stupid girl !! I want not YOU !! 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.640
 Meira: And your POWER !! 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.380
 Ganji: ... 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.720
 Reimu: My strength? I do not understand. 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.220
 Meira: I'm a woman, damn it !! What is wrong with you?! 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.760
 Reimu: That is, if I win ... ... well, it took me a long time to upload this video, and during that time, they changed the translation ... fine -_- 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.180
 Reimu: let’s assume that this is how things will turn out ... (but my translation hasn’t changed except for a translator) 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.500
 Meira: Do you listen to me at all !? 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.120
 Reimu: Of course, of course. Fight, fight! 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.760
 Meira: And you also know such old references ... 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.660
 Reimu: I asked if you agree, silly. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.460
 Meira: Wow, I don't want to lose ... 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.960
 Stay just to her right. This will make her go to the right. Then slowly keep your way up to the right. 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.340
 If she attacks like now, move down to the corner to dodge bullets. 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:36.220
 You should now be under it as quickly as you can and move slightly to the right when it attacks. Repeat to end of level 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.620
 When she attacks like this, move down a bit. You dodge everything 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.640
 Move to the corner as fast as you can. This is the safest zone on this attack. However, try to move to the middle of the screen to dodge her subsequent bullets, moving slightly to the side 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.460
 As before, a little to the right. This will make her move to the right, then go to the left corner. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.880
 In the last phase, the balls will be fired across the entire screen. Stay away from it and pay attention to how the balls move 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.620
 Dumb red ball ... 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.080
 Reimu: I did it! 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.860
 Reimu: Eh? ... 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.100
 Reimu: Un-oh ... she's not moving. 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.860
 Reimu: Well, it's time to conduct the burial rite ... 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.540
 Ganji: Wait a minute 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.680
 Meira: I can't take it anymore ... 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.440
 Reimu: Damn, run away !! 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.100
 Ganji: (sigh) 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.100
 Reimu: Hmm, interesting, but what, after all, did Mrs. Meira want? 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.640
 Ganji: You didn't listen to her at all, did you? 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.700
 Reimu: Yeah ... 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.420
