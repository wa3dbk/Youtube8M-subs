hi this is Richard gila watts here with

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.039 
hi this is Richard gila watts here with
d'addario<00:00:02.729> strings<00:00:02.790> and<00:00:03.269> Planet<00:00:03.600> Waves<00:00:03.689> I'd

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
d'addario strings and Planet Waves I'd

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.920 
d'addario strings and Planet Waves I'd
like<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.320> talk<00:00:04.530> with<00:00:04.590> you<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> little<00:00:05.100> bit<00:00:05.430> about

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
like to talk with you a little bit about

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.660 
like to talk with you a little bit about
probably<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.020> most<00:00:07.320> asked<00:00:07.800> question<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.460> get

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
probably the most asked question I get

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.370 
probably the most asked question I get
which<00:00:08.850> has<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.480> with<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.780> right<00:00:10.050> hand

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
which has to do with this right hand

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.990 
which has to do with this right hand
tapping<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.220> used<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.760> in<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
tapping and how I used it in a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.660 
tapping and how I used it in a
composition<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:13.830> create<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.160> little<00:00:14.340> bit<00:00:14.550> of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
composition to create a little bit of

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.490 
composition to create a little bit of
not<00:00:15.000> just<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> melody<00:00:15.750> but<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.139> guess<00:00:16.320> I<00:00:16.440> could

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
not just a melody but I guess I could

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.310 
not just a melody but I guess I could
more<00:00:16.770> say<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> mood<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.270> right<00:00:18.690> now<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.140> this

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
more say a mood so right now I have this

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.310 
more say a mood so right now I have this
guitar<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.890> open<00:00:20.160> G<00:00:20.460> tuning<00:00:20.490> which<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.449> dgdg

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
guitar and open G tuning which is dgdg

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.550 
guitar and open G tuning which is dgdg
BD<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.400> I'll<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> second<00:00:24.869> string<00:00:27.560> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
BD and I'll take the second string and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.870 
BD and I'll take the second string and
I'll<00:00:28.650> bring<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.980> down<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> b-flat<00:00:31.880> and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
I'll bring it down to a b-flat and

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.150 
I'll bring it down to a b-flat and
whenever<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
whenever you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
whenever you
whenever<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.059> flat<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.870> third<00:00:37.109> in<00:00:37.289> the<00:00:37.379> triad

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
whenever you flat the third in the triad

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.569 
whenever you flat the third in the triad
you<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> minor's<00:00:38.699> so<00:00:40.010> so<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.190> have<00:00:41.460> an

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you get a minor's so so now I have an

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.580 
you get a minor's so so now I have an
open<00:00:41.850> G<00:00:42.059> minor<00:00:42.390> tuning

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
open G minor tuning

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.950 
open G minor tuning
with<00:00:45.160> my<00:00:45.700> G<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.090> the<00:00:46.150> base<00:00:46.330> would<00:00:46.510> be<00:00:46.600> at<00:00:46.810> my

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
with my G and the base would be at my

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.870 
with my G and the base would be at my
fifth<00:00:47.290> string<00:00:47.650> it<00:00:47.830> doesn't<00:00:48.130> mean<00:00:48.280> I<00:00:48.310> can't<00:00:48.700> hit

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
fifth string it doesn't mean I can't hit

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.020 
fifth string it doesn't mean I can't hit
my<00:00:49.090> sixth<00:00:49.600> but<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:50.260> try<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.190> target<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.790> fifth

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
my sixth but I try and target the fifth

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080 
my sixth but I try and target the fifth
string<00:00:52.330> right<00:00:52.600> there<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.460> what<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.670> did<00:00:54.910> is

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
string right there and so what I did is

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.700 
string right there and so what I did is
when<00:00:55.270> I<00:00:55.300> was<00:00:55.540> coming<00:00:55.900> up<00:00:56.020> with<00:00:56.200> this<00:00:56.350> too<00:00:56.590> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
when I was coming up with this too and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.190 
when I was coming up with this too and
it<00:00:56.830> was<00:00:57.010> totally<00:00:57.580> trial<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.150> error<00:00:58.330> initially

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
it was totally trial and error initially

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.710 
it was totally trial and error initially
so<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.040> put<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.460> in<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.670> tuning<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.150> had<00:01:01.300> never<00:01:01.480> used

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
so I put it in a tuning I had never used

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.720 
so I put it in a tuning I had never used
before<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.380> then<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.590> threw<00:01:02.890> down<00:01:02.920> an<00:01:03.310> E<00:01:03.490> major

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
before and then I threw down an E major

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.970 
before and then I threw down an E major
chord<00:01:03.910> which<00:01:04.570> did<00:01:04.870> not<00:01:05.050> sound<00:01:05.380> good<00:01:05.530> at<00:01:05.800> all

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
chord which did not sound good at all

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.320 
chord which did not sound good at all
but<00:01:06.880> when<00:01:07.030> I<00:01:07.060> slid<00:01:07.480> it<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:07.720> one<00:01:07.990> fret<00:01:08.380> I<00:01:09.330> got

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
but when I slid it up one fret I got

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.270 
but when I slid it up one fret I got
kind<00:01:10.600> of<00:01:10.690> an<00:01:10.780> ominous<00:01:11.170> sound<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:15.010> from

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
kind of an ominous sound and then from

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.340 
kind of an ominous sound and then from
there<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.520> went<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.940> B<00:01:16.210> 7th<00:01:16.720> chord<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.320> that

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
there I went to a B 7th chord and that

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.560 
there I went to a B 7th chord and that
didn't<00:01:17.740> work<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.160> I<00:01:18.220> lifted<00:01:18.550> my<00:01:18.610> index<00:01:19.119> and<00:01:19.420> my

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
didn't work and I lifted my index and my

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.380 
didn't work and I lifted my index and my
pinky<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:21.760> that<00:01:21.910> was<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.030> little<00:01:22.180> more

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
pinky and that was a little more

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.700 
pinky and that was a little more
interesting<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:22.990> I<00:01:23.140> noticed<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.619> the

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
interesting and I noticed that the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.120 
interesting and I noticed that the
transition<00:01:24.460> from<00:01:24.700> one<00:01:24.820> to<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.240> other

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.370 

it<00:01:28.549> was<00:01:28.729> kind<00:01:29.180> of<00:01:29.270> an<00:01:29.360> ominous<00:01:29.689> thing<00:01:30.079> and<00:01:30.320> I

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
it was kind of an ominous thing and I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.410 
it was kind of an ominous thing and I
tried<00:01:30.649> this<00:01:30.829> tapping<00:01:31.460> technique<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:32.060> friend<00:01:32.299> of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
tried this tapping technique a friend of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.200 
tried this tapping technique a friend of
mine<00:01:32.600> Richard<00:01:33.590> Leo<00:01:33.979> Johnson<00:01:34.579> had<00:01:34.729> showed<00:01:35.000> me

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
mine Richard Leo Johnson had showed me

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.569 
mine Richard Leo Johnson had showed me
and<00:01:35.420> normally<00:01:36.409> you<00:01:36.560> would<00:01:36.740> want<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.100> target

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
and normally you would want to target

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.090 
and normally you would want to target
say<00:01:38.360> your<00:01:38.570> harmonics<00:01:39.170> at<00:01:39.350> frets<00:01:39.590> say<00:01:39.829> five

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
say your harmonics at frets say five

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.550 
say your harmonics at frets say five
seven<00:01:40.579> or<00:01:40.670> twelve<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.899> you<00:01:41.990> would<00:01:42.140> think<00:01:42.380> with

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
seven or twelve so you would think with

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.380 
seven or twelve so you would think with
me<00:01:42.710> playing<00:01:43.009> this<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.579> I<00:01:43.610> might<00:01:43.880> go<00:01:44.060> all<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
me playing this here I might go all the

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.230 
me playing this here I might go all the
way<00:01:44.420> up<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.259> area<00:01:45.710> but<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.549> for<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.030> more

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
way up to this area but just for a more

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.389 
way up to this area but just for a more
trial<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.750> error<00:01:47.899> I<00:01:48.229> started<00:01:48.799> tapping<00:01:49.069> at<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
trial and error I started tapping at the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.999 
trial and error I started tapping at the
seventh<00:01:49.880> fret<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.960> see<00:01:51.140> if<00:01:51.229> I<00:01:51.319> could<00:01:51.500> get<00:01:51.679> some

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
seventh fret to see if I could get some

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.120 
seventh fret to see if I could get some
natural<00:01:52.759> or<00:01:53.210> even<00:01:53.689> unnatural<00:01:54.319> harmonics<00:01:54.890> and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
natural or even unnatural harmonics and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.120 
natural or even unnatural harmonics and
I<00:01:55.759> used<00:01:55.939> my<00:01:56.149> middle<00:01:56.479> finger<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.590> target<00:01:58.009> the

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
I used my middle finger to target the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.460 
I used my middle finger to target the
melody<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:58.850> used<00:01:59.149> my<00:01:59.299> index<00:01:59.689> finger<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.229> try

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
melody and I used my index finger to try

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.710 
melody and I used my index finger to try
and<00:02:00.590> target<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.340> bass<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.149> go<00:02:02.360> back<00:02:02.509> and

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
and target the bass so I go back and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.080 
and target the bass so I go back and
forth<00:02:02.810> melody<00:02:03.530> bass<00:02:03.709> melody<00:02:03.979> bass

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.750 

and<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.959> notice<00:02:10.259> if<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.800> generally<00:02:11.489> target

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and I notice if I can generally target

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
and I notice if I can generally target
the<00:02:12.120> area<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.900> second<00:02:13.349> string<00:02:14.630> for<00:02:15.630> one

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
the area of the second string for one

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.510 
the area of the second string for one
part<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> melody<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:16.950> sort<00:02:17.430> of

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
part of the melody and then sort of

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.430 
part of the melody and then sort of
target<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> first<00:02:18.300> string<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.930> almost<00:02:22.200> don't

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
target the first string you almost don't

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.410 
target the first string you almost don't
have<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.770> be<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.130> precise<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.970> nice<00:02:24.150> thing

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
have to be so precise and the nice thing

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.449 
have to be so precise and the nice thing
about<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.900> tune<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.349> every<00:02:25.590> time<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:25.860> play<00:02:26.250> it

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
about this tune is every time I play it

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.089 
about this tune is every time I play it
just<00:02:27.060> by<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.810> nature<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.500> tapping<00:02:28.950> it's

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
just by the nature of the tapping it's

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.009 
just by the nature of the tapping it's
going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> come<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.910> slightly<00:02:30.360> different

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
going to come out slightly different

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.630 
going to come out slightly different
although<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.410> do<00:02:31.530> try<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.040> get<00:02:32.190> sort<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
although I do try and get sort of a

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.910 
although I do try and get sort of a
melody<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:34.019> after<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.349> play<00:02:34.650> those

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
melody with it then after I play those

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250 
melody with it then after I play those
two<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.519> go<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.880> what<00:02:36.569> looks<00:02:36.780> like<00:02:36.870> an<00:02:37.140> eighth

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
two I go to what looks like an eighth

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.430 
two I go to what looks like an eighth
seventh<00:02:37.739> chord<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.569> this<00:02:39.720> particular

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
seventh chord and on this particular

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.220 
seventh chord and on this particular
case<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.920> where<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.100> start<00:02:41.989> stepping<00:02:42.989> away<00:02:43.110> from

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
case is where I start stepping away from

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.860 
case is where I start stepping away from
the<00:02:43.650> ominous<00:02:44.400> trial-and-error<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.660> for

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the ominous trial-and-error and I go for

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
the ominous trial-and-error and I go for
a<00:02:45.930> little<00:02:45.989> bit<00:02:46.170> more<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.620> melody<00:02:49.670> I'm<00:02:50.670> trying

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
a little bit more of a melody I'm trying

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.190 
a little bit more of a melody I'm trying
to<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:54.269> sound

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.830 

like<00:02:59.770> that<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:00.880> with<00:03:01.060> my<00:03:01.270> pairs<00:03:01.599> of

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
like that and then with my pairs of

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.720 
like that and then with my pairs of
fingers<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.470> had<00:03:02.590> mentioned<00:03:02.950> before<00:03:02.980> about

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
fingers I had mentioned before about

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.330 
fingers I had mentioned before about
using<00:03:04.180> open<00:03:04.510> tunings<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.200> two<00:03:05.950> finger

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
using open tunings and two finger

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.280 
using open tunings and two finger
positions<00:03:06.940> I'll<00:03:07.150> use<00:03:07.300> my<00:03:07.569> middle<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.110> ring

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
positions I'll use my middle and ring

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.460 
positions I'll use my middle and ring
finger<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.800> play<00:03:08.920> strings<00:03:09.370> five<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.880> two<00:03:10.470> at

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
finger to play strings five and two at

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.550 
finger to play strings five and two at
fret<00:03:11.800> 5<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.550> I'll<00:03:13.030> compensate<00:03:13.420> up<00:03:13.840> 12<00:03:14.170> at<00:03:14.380> this

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
fret 5 and I'll compensate up 12 at this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.630 
fret 5 and I'll compensate up 12 at this
point<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.160> once<00:03:15.520> again<00:03:15.730> melody<00:03:16.300> bass<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
point and once again melody bass and

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.270 
point and once again melody bass and
then<00:03:19.300> when<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> go<00:03:19.660> back<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:20.260> chord<00:03:20.860> here

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
then when I go back to this chord here

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.760 
then when I go back to this chord here
where<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> move<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.780> shape<00:03:23.080> back<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.620> this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
where I move that shape back in this

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.440 
where I move that shape back in this
direction<00:03:23.980> you'll<00:03:24.489> notice<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.300> my

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
direction you'll notice that with my

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.140 
direction you'll notice that with my
index<00:03:25.750> finger<00:03:26.200> being<00:03:26.440> one<00:03:26.709> fret<00:03:27.100> behind<00:03:28.000> my

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
index finger being one fret behind my

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.820 
index finger being one fret behind my
third<00:03:28.390> finger<00:03:28.660> I<00:03:28.810> have<00:03:29.019> to<00:03:29.200> kind<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.500> switch

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
third finger I have to kind of switch

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.050 
third finger I have to kind of switch
these<00:03:30.069> two<00:03:30.099> fingers<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:33.459> there<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.940> then

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
these two fingers and go there and then

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.800 
these two fingers and go there and then
back<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.480> here<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:36.209> back<00:03:37.209> to<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.569> first

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
back to here just back to that first

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.590 
back to here just back to that first
shape<00:03:38.230> but<00:03:38.470> at<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.739> second<00:03:39.130> fret<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.790> then

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
shape but at the second fret and then

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.390 
shape but at the second fret and then
open<00:03:41.080> so<00:03:41.319> I'll<00:03:41.440> show<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.650> how<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:41.920> put<00:03:42.160> all<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
open so I'll show you how I put all this

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.070 
open so I'll show you how I put all this
together<00:03:42.640> but<00:03:43.030> basically<00:03:43.450> that's<00:03:43.750> kind<00:03:44.019> of

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
together but basically that's kind of

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.610 
together but basically that's kind of
the<00:03:44.230> idea<00:03:44.670> open<00:03:45.670> G<00:03:46.060> minor<00:03:46.269> tuning<00:03:46.600> 12<00:03:47.140> string

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
the idea open G minor tuning 12 string

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.300 
the idea open G minor tuning 12 string
some<00:03:48.519> trial-and-error<00:03:49.000> chords<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.319> I<00:03:50.709> have

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
some trial-and-error chords that I have

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.039 
some trial-and-error chords that I have
no<00:03:51.489> idea<00:03:51.819> what<00:03:52.000> they<00:03:52.180> are<00:03:52.330> but<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.690> don't<00:03:52.810> want

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
no idea what they are but I don't want

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.330 
no idea what they are but I don't want
to<00:03:53.110> try<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.350> figure<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> out<00:03:53.920> even<00:03:54.250> though<00:03:54.310> I

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to try and figure it out even though I

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
to try and figure it out even though I
probably<00:03:54.610> could<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:56.080> it<00:03:56.200> wouldn't<00:03:56.380> be<00:03:56.560> any

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
probably could but it wouldn't be any

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.710 
probably could but it wouldn't be any
point<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.280> then<00:03:57.489> I<00:03:57.519> try<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:57.880> go<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.239> a<00:03:58.299> melody

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
point and then I try and go for a melody

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.600 
point and then I try and go for a melody
so<00:03:58.900> in<00:03:59.019> this<00:03:59.110> case<00:03:59.380> I'm<00:03:59.620> working<00:03:59.799> more<00:04:00.190> from<00:04:00.519> I

guess<00:04:00.670> you<00:04:00.970> could<00:04:01.120> say<00:04:01.440> shapes<00:04:02.440> and<00:04:02.799> positions

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
guess you could say shapes and positions

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.120 
guess you could say shapes and positions
and<00:04:03.850> just<00:04:04.750> sort<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.109> trying<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.590> go<00:04:05.739> for<00:04:05.980> that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
and just sort of trying to go for that

and just sort of trying to go for that

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
ethereal feel with it and it sounds

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.949 
ethereal feel with it and it sounds
great<00:04:08.320> when<00:04:08.680> it's<00:04:08.799> played<00:04:09.090> particularly<00:04:10.090> on<00:04:10.900> a

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
great when it's played particularly on a

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.500 
great when it's played particularly on a
12<00:04:11.320> string<00:04:11.650> miked<00:04:12.220> with<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> pickup<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.299> like

12 string miked with a pickup I like

12 string miked with a pickup I like
that<00:04:13.720> combination<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:14.440> sometimes<00:04:14.890> I'll<00:04:15.070> even

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
that combination and sometimes I'll even

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.789 
that combination and sometimes I'll even
throw<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:15.760> delay<00:04:16.060> pedal<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:17.350> get<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> little

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
throw in a delay pedal to get a little

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.710 
throw in a delay pedal to get a little
bit<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.039> a<00:04:18.130> ricochet<00:04:18.640> effect<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:19.269> let<00:04:19.390> me<00:04:19.479> run

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
bit of a ricochet effect but let me run

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.350 
bit of a ricochet effect but let me run
through<00:04:19.930> this<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.680> couple<00:04:21.400> times<00:04:21.430> for<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.120> and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
through this a couple times for you and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.630 
through this a couple times for you and
see<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.470> use<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:23.860> concept<00:04:24.430> in<00:04:24.610> your

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
see if you can use this concept in your

see if you can use this concept in your
own<00:04:24.940> writing<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.510> have<00:04:25.600> some<00:04:25.810> fun<00:04:25.990> with<00:04:26.200> it
