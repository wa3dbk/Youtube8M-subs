00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:05.873
 During that second season ... 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.984
 ... I started hearing that on NBC ... 

00:00:10.887 --> 00:00:12.787
 ...they wanted... 

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:17.459
 ... Jerry and Elaine were a couple. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.284
 I was saying: 

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:24.690
 "Their relationship, when they are together, when people bet ... 

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:26.960
 ... for her, I think it's something ... 

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:29.434
 ... with what the public can identify. " 

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:33.196
 They kept insisting, and I flatly refused. 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.767
 I was not going to do it. 

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:41.406
 And then I remembered a fact in my life ... 

00:00:41.584 --> 00:00:44.280
 ... that I thought would work ... 

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:48.951
 ... for a very funny episode, although they would not have told me. 

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.494
 Once I remembered that incident from my past, in which-- 

00:00:53.663 --> 00:00:56.632
 Sorry to say... 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.200
 ... that I tried to make a deal ... 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.362
 ... with the one who could ... 

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:10.776
 ... have a physical relationship with someone, and ... 

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.939
 Without having to get to the point ... 

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:16.017
 ... to be a couple. 

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:20.713
 And the only way to do it was by following certain rules. 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.984
 And that became the episode 'The Deal'. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.128
 If something happens ... 

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:30.528
 ... and we could not be friends like now that would be very bad. 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.533
 - Devastator. - Because this is very good. 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.240
 And that would be good. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.741
 That would also be good. 

00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:45.212
 The idea is to combine this ... 

00:01:45.381 --> 00:01:47.542
 ... and that. 

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:50.151
 But this can not be disturbed. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.084
 Yes. We just want to take this ... 

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:56.521
 ... and add that. 

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.689
 I remember 'The Deal'. 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.625
 He had a great opening scene. 

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:04.561
 Even today ... 

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:09.467
 ... I consider it the best scene in the series. It's my favorite episode. 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.867
 I love the episode 'The Deal'. 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.304
 I remember many screams during that week. 

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:18.140
 Larry and Andy Scheinman were shouted at the shoot ... 

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.542
 ... on how to end the episode ... 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.381
 ... and also on how to interpret the scene ... 

00:02:25.555 --> 00:02:29.252
 ... where Jerry and I made the deal on the couch ... 

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.222
 ... and we discussed the rules ... 

00:02:31.394 --> 00:02:34.886
 ... about going to bed together and staying friends. 

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:36.932
 For example... 

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:41.668
 ... now I call you when I want and vice versa. 

00:02:41.838 --> 00:02:45.035
 But with that we may feel ... 

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.438
 ... some obligation to call. 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.895
 Why does it have to be like this? 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.507
 I have an idea, I have an idea. 

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:56.584
 No call the day after that. 

00:02:56.753 --> 00:02:58.118
 Beautiful. 

00:02:58.287 --> 00:02:59.515
 Let's make it a rule. 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:00.951
 All right, gentleman. 

00:03:01.124 --> 00:03:04.753
 Throughout the week, I interpreted it very sexually. 

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:07.924
 Y... 

00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:10.561
 It's funny, because if you read the script ... 

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:13.065
 ... it is seen as a decision that someone would take. 

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:15.898
 A bad decision, but a decision. 

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:18.768
 I felt a lot of pressure from Castle Rock ... 

00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.069
 ... to make her sexy and all that. 

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:26.511
 I did not understand what Larry was saying. It said: "It's nothing sexual. 

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:29.378
 You have to talk like ... 

00:03:29.552 --> 00:03:31.315
 As if it were a contract, a business. " 

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:33.552
 And I did not understand what he meant. 

00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:36.549
 Really not, and that was the night before the shooting ... 

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:39.854
 Yes, it was the night before filming, and I went home ... 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:43.226
 ... and I talked to my husband, Brad, as he used to do ... 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.731
 ... and I said, "This is what Larry said." 

00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:49.235
 And I remember clearly that Brad said: "Sure, he's right". 

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.273
 And Brad explained to me, so that I could understand ... 

00:03:53.443 --> 00:03:57.277
 ... Larry's point of view, and I understood it right away. 

00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:00.814
 The next day we interpreted it that way, and that's how it was. 

00:04:00.983 --> 00:04:02.716
 I slept with Elaine last night. 

00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:09.721
 Oxygen. I need oxygen. 

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:12.122
 - This is big. - I thought you would like that. 

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:13.990
 Is incredible. 

00:04:14.163 --> 00:04:17.564
 - I know. - All right, come on, details. 

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.359
 I can not give you details. 

00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:21.961
 - No what? - I can not give details. 

00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:23.965
 No details? 

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:26.418
 I'm not in the mood. 

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:30.435
 You invite me to lunch ... 

00:04:30.613 --> 00:04:32.604
 ... you tell me you slept with Elaine ... 

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:35.876
 ... and then you tell me you're not in the mood for details. 

00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:38.350
 Now, listen to me. 

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:41.552
 I want details and I want them right now. 

00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:44.124
 I do not have a job, I have nowhere to go. 

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:47.990
 You are not in the mood Well, get in the mood! 

00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:51.398
 I could write ... 

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:56.203
 ... the horrible weak point ... 

00:04:56.372 --> 00:04:59.341
 ... of human motivation: 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:02.376
 "To hell you and your morality. 

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.308
 Nothing interesting happens in my life ... 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.008
 ... and I want the dirty rags. 

00:05:06.182 --> 00:05:09.010
 Give me a reason to live. Go to hell". 

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:13.287
 Not only could he write it, it made it funny. 

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:17.722
 "Think of where a man's glory begins and ends ... 

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:22.158
 ... and say that my glory was having a friend like that ". 

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:24.824
 It's from Yates. 

00:05:26.335 --> 00:05:28.091
 Kramer ... 

00:05:32.742 --> 00:05:35.336
 Do you allow us, please? 

00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:36.739
 What? 

00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:38.380
 We are talking. 

00:05:39.878 --> 00:05:41.608
 The relationship. 

00:05:41.784 --> 00:05:44.344
 I remember the appointment of Yeats ... 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.650
 ... and it is very much in line with the series, in general. 

00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:50.587
 "Think where it starts. and the glory of a man ends ... 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.887
 ... and say that my glory was having a friend like that ". 

00:05:53.062 --> 00:05:55.496
 The motto "no hugs, no learning" ... 

00:05:55.665 --> 00:05:57.353
 ... is still applied to the series ... 

00:05:57.466 --> 00:06:01.202
 ... but being able to say something so beautiful ... 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.895
 ... it was a great opportunity, and it was very easy to do ... 

00:06:04.073 --> 00:06:07.372
 ... because it is a phrase full of emotion. 

00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:10.068
 It did not represent any problem. I loved. 

00:06:10.246 --> 00:06:14.410
 That was probably the most tender moment of the whole series. 

00:06:14.584 --> 00:06:19.180
 I remember that at that moment I felt that it surpassed me. 

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:20.754
 Y... 

00:06:20.923 --> 00:06:23.385
 ...what are you doing today? 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.627
 I am... 

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:27.557
 ...that. 

00:06:27.964 --> 00:06:29.955
 And other. 

00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:35.525
 Wow, I liked them more when they were not a couple. 

00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:38.704
 We think that people would not believe that they two ... 

00:06:38.874 --> 00:06:40.671
 ... be together again. 

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:43.073
 We thought that the idea that they were friends ... 

00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:45.098
 ... it was already taking reality by the hair. 

00:06:45.211 --> 00:06:47.305
 We think about putting them back together. 

00:06:47.483 --> 00:06:50.714
 I think we decided that that was what was going to happen. 

00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:53.912
 Jerry was on tour between seasons ... 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.287
 ... doing performances and all that, and the series had acquired ... 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.927
 ... some speed. 

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:01.393
 I asked questions to get answers ... 

00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:03.498
 ... and asked the audience: 

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:06.027
 "What do you think if Elaine and I go back together?" 

00:07:06.202 --> 00:07:09.096
 "No!" Then he came back and said, "No, no." 

00:07:09.271 --> 00:07:11.034
 Definitely not. 

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:13.471
 And that was it.
