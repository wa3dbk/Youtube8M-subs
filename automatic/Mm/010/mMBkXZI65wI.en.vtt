00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.850
 yes 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 the new technologies are a set 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 of products and derivative processes are 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 tools to both hardware and 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.750
 software communication channels and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.750
 information supports 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.449
 good storage related 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.250
 the distribution the processing and the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.630
 treatment of information 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
 characteristic that differentiates them from 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 previous technologies is that this is the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 information is digitized that 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 it means that we have converted all kinds 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 of information text image sound 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 etcetera to 0 if to some numbers and that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 feature of digitization we 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.410
 allows you to do fantastic things with the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.510
 information that we could not do before 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 allows us for example to transmit it to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 the other part of the world in tenths of 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.350
 second allows us to make it flow by 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.789
 the same channel on the same cable through the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.930
 same wireless network both texts as 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.920
 images as sound as video and that to 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.410
 dematerialized the information before the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.539
 information was linked to the objects 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.810
 think of a book a book that is the 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.850
 content or those support that keeps 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.289
 that information today a book already 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.640
 we do not know that it is the same way that 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.280
 we know what is a disc that is a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.050
 song when it is digitized is very 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.149
 easy to transfer from one place to another is 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.009
 very easy to work with her is very easy 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.170
 for example, reproduce it in a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.490
 undefined without losing lime 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.909
 it is possible to make thousands of copies 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.439
 without the initial quality disappearing 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.659
 That could not be done previously 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.060
 made some experts talk about that 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.009
 this revolution that we are living from 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.950
 the new technologies will have an impact 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.500
 in society comparable to that of the 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.390
 printing that is to say we are living a 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.789
 authentic revolution in all fields 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.280
 in the world of work in the leisure of 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.229
 free time in the business world 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.759
 and I hope that education is also 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.619
 important for education because the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.530
 education works with information although 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.990
 it is not reduced to transmit information of 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.880
 this way the teachers the students are 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.739
 large consumers of large 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 volumes of information and on the other 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.350
 part new technologies allow 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.850
 create innovative communication spaces 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.709
 spaces that did not exist before 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.209
 speaking for example of universities 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.459
 virtual ones in which one studies 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.470
 distance without having to travel and 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 who has access to materials to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.209
 contained in any format to their 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.780
 teachers to their classmates through 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.970
 internet through computers 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 I believe that there is no need to insist more 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.760
 what is a revolution about 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.160
 how many years maybe some people do not 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.080
 I saw but we are going from a world 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.640
 analog to a digital world and those two 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.520
 worlds are colliding and they look 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.470
 multiple in multiple spaces 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.200
 an example is the crisis that is 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.060
 living the press the traditional press 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.700
 on paper can not live with internet 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.780
 but you can not live without internet or what 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.820
 what is happening what has happened 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.180
 with the world of music the downloads 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.490
 copy the itunes mp3 phenomenon 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.590
 et cetera etcetera and that revolution 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.860
 we hope we will arrive in the world 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.860
 of Education 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.629
 I am 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.790
 digital competence is the answer 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.840
 of the education authorities and the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.959
 educational system to a social change that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.430
 has led to think that the school does not 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.170
 I was preparing the children and the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.829
 teenagers to integrate in the world 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.829
 from work to live
