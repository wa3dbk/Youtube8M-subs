there's<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.299> new<00:01:27.479> outlet<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.680> how

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
there's my new outlet you can see how

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.560 
there's my new outlet you can see how
has<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.190> ground<00:01:29.430> always<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> off<00:01:30.210> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
has the ground always want the off on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.140 
has the ground always want the off on
top<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.830> on<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.220> bottom<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:32.700> there's<00:01:32.970> two<00:01:33.119> ways

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
top the on on bottom so there's two ways

top the on on bottom so there's two ways
to<00:01:33.360> wire<00:01:34.080> these<00:01:34.290> quick<00:01:34.650> connectors<00:01:35.130> or<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.610> side

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
to wire these quick connectors or a side

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.010 
to wire these quick connectors or a side
wire<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> let<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.460> show<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.720> with<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> quick

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
wire so let me show you with a quick

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.170 
wire so let me show you with a quick
connect<00:01:40.350> there's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> release<00:01:41.010> tab<00:01:41.340> right

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
connect there's a release tab right

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.490 
connect there's a release tab right
behind<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> outlet<00:01:44.240> there<00:01:45.240> we<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
behind the outlet there we go so this

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.429 
behind the outlet there we go so this
one<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> bottom<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.990> one's<00:01:49.259> on<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
one is on the bottom this one's on the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.179 
one is on the bottom this one's on the
top<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> want<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> mimic<00:01:51.799> what<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.830> see

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
top and you want to mimic what you see

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.420 
top and you want to mimic what you see
on<00:01:53.430> your<00:01:53.780> particular<00:01:54.780> setup<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.950> top<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
on your particular setup so the top and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
on your particular setup so the top and
bottom<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> look<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.400> box<00:01:59.750> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
bottom and if you look in the box you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.660 
bottom and if you look in the box you
can<00:02:00.780> see<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> bare<00:02:01.740> ground<00:02:02.280> wire<00:02:02.610> back<00:02:03.119> here

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
can see the bare ground wire back here

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.050 
can see the bare ground wire back here
it's<00:02:04.450> got<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.660> connected<00:02:05.760> deal<00:02:06.760> here<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.250> my

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
it's got a connected deal here so my

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.930 
it's got a connected deal here so my
Sharia<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:11.650> I'm<00:02:11.740> gonna<00:02:11.830> do<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.310> add<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.580> wire

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
Sharia what I'm gonna do is add a wire

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.780 
Sharia what I'm gonna do is add a wire
there<00:02:13.440> now<00:02:14.440> we<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.740> either<00:02:14.950> remove<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.460> wire

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
there now we can either remove this wire

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:24.450 
there now we can either remove this wire
up<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.410> insert<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:18.780> our<00:02:22.920> got<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> special

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
up and insert it to our got a special

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.370 
up and insert it to our got a special
clamp<00:02:24.760> there<00:02:25.680> okay

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
clamp there okay

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.199 
clamp there okay
so<00:02:29.380> I've<00:02:29.830> got<00:02:30.040> another<00:02:30.130> piece<00:02:30.520> of<00:02:30.550> wire<00:02:30.850> here

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
so I've got another piece of wire here

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
so I've got another piece of wire here
and<00:02:31.390> we're<00:02:32.260> gonna<00:02:32.320> go<00:02:32.560> ahead<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.740> strip<00:02:33.070> this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
and we're gonna go ahead and strip this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.360 
and we're gonna go ahead and strip this
off<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.930> bare<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.440> ground<00:02:35.800> wires<00:02:36.070> are

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
off and the bare the ground wires are

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.210 
off and the bare the ground wires are
generally<00:02:36.850> bare<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:38.680> can<00:02:38.830> either<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
generally bare so we can either use a

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.270 
generally bare so we can either use a
green<00:02:39.550> wire<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.860> always<00:02:42.040> want<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.220> use

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
green wire and you always want to use

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.310 
green wire and you always want to use
wire<00:02:42.580> strippers<00:02:43.120> when<00:02:43.360> stripping<00:02:43.810> wires<00:02:44.050> you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
wire strippers when stripping wires you

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.290 
wire strippers when stripping wires you
don't<00:02:44.500> want<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:46.590> Nick<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.800> wire<00:02:48.060> okay

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
don't want to Nick the wire okay

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.390 
don't want to Nick the wire okay
now<00:02:49.900> we<00:02:49.989> can<00:02:50.230> either<00:02:50.350> use<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> green<00:02:50.950> piece<00:02:51.220> of

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
now we can either use a green piece of

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.000 
now we can either use a green piece of
tape<00:02:51.580> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.850> end<00:02:52.090> of<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:52.330> wire<00:02:52.590> or<00:02:53.590> we<00:02:53.830> can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
tape on the end of this wire or we can

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.490 
tape on the end of this wire or we can
strip<00:02:54.310> all<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> insulation<00:02:55.150> off<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:56.200> ground

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
strip all the insulation off the ground

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.850 
strip all the insulation off the ground
wire<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:57.150> lot<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.270> times<00:02:58.510> this<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.590> bare

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
wire a lot of times this is just bare

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.540 
wire a lot of times this is just bare
anyway<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.400> just<00:03:00.970> type<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.540> good<00:03:01.720> chunk<00:03:01.959> of<00:03:02.140> the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
anyway so just type a good chunk of the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.500 
anyway so just type a good chunk of the
insulation<00:03:03.550> off<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:04.620> another<00:03:05.620> one<00:03:05.860> here

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.120 

okay<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.870> looks<00:03:11.080> about<00:03:11.200> long<00:03:11.560> enough<00:03:11.860> so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
okay and that looks about long enough so

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.880 
okay and that looks about long enough so
I'll<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.810> trim<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.019> off<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.530> just<00:03:14.709> need

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
I'll just trim this off we just need

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.620 
I'll just trim this off we just need
enough<00:03:15.330> length<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.980> link<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.510> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
enough length to link this to the to the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.789 
enough length to link this to the to the
ground<00:03:20.070> on<00:03:21.070> our<00:03:21.130> new<00:03:21.370> outlet<00:03:22.260> I've<00:03:23.260> got<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> nice

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
ground on our new outlet I've got a nice

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.340 
ground on our new outlet I've got a nice
large<00:03:24.130> wire<00:03:24.700> connector<00:03:25.330> here<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:26.110> we'll<00:03:26.230> just

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
large wire connector here so we'll just

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.949 
large wire connector here so we'll just
add<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.820> now<00:03:31.000> our<00:03:31.180> outlet<00:03:31.600> will<00:03:31.840> be

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
add this and now our outlet will be

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.650 
add this and now our outlet will be
grounded<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.590> connect<00:03:33.070> this<00:03:33.299> when<00:03:34.299> you<00:03:34.390> side

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
grounded and connect this when you side

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.900 
grounded and connect this when you side
wiring<00:03:35.110> outlet<00:03:35.470> you're<00:03:36.130> gonna<00:03:36.250> want<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.580> curve

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
wiring outlet you're gonna want to curve

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.259 
wiring outlet you're gonna want to curve
the<00:03:37.390> wire<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:39.070> will<00:03:39.549> turn<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.060> same

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
the wire so that it will turn the same

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.990 
the wire so that it will turn the same
way<00:03:40.510> as<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.870> screw<00:03:41.200> when<00:03:42.160> you<00:03:42.250> clip<00:03:42.489> wire<00:03:42.790> an

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
way as the screw when you clip wire an

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.820 
way as the screw when you clip wire an
outlet<00:03:43.360> you're<00:03:44.019> going<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.230> want<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.470> make<00:03:44.620> sure

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
outlet you're going to want to make sure

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.190 
outlet you're going to want to make sure
that<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> strip<00:03:45.549> length<00:03:45.850> matches<00:03:46.630> your<00:03:46.840> strip

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
that the strip length matches your strip

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.699 
that the strip length matches your strip
gajj<00:03:47.470> on<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.580> back<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.239> outlet<00:03:49.630> you<00:03:50.019> could

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
gajj on the back of the outlet you could

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.650 
gajj on the back of the outlet you could
see<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.130> there's<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.370> little<00:03:51.549> strip<00:03:52.390> gudge

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
see here there's a little strip gudge

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.699 
see here there's a little strip gudge
that<00:03:53.440> tells<00:03:53.739> us<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.340> length<00:03:54.580> that<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.030> wire

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
that tells us the length that the wire

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.430 
that tells us the length that the wire
should<00:03:56.709> be<00:03:56.769> stripped<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.430> we're<00:03:58.030> good<00:03:58.239> here<00:03:58.540> so

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
should be stripped to we're good here so

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.160 
should be stripped to we're good here so
much<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> matter<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.160> plugging<00:04:00.459> these<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.170> to

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
much as a matter of plugging these in to

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.230 
much as a matter of plugging these in to
our<00:04:02.260> quick<00:04:02.500> connect

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.080 

bottom<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:06.650> then<00:04:07.010> now<00:04:07.310> I'm<00:04:07.550> going<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.790> hook<00:04:07.850> up

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
bottom and then now I'm going to hook up

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.200 
bottom and then now I'm going to hook up
our<00:04:08.450> ground<00:04:08.810> wire<00:04:09.080> here<00:04:09.670> like<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:10.820> said<00:04:10.850> we're

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
our ground wire here like I said we're

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.060 
our ground wire here like I said we're
gonna<00:04:11.300> curve<00:04:11.750> this<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.350> same<00:04:12.590> way<00:04:12.800> that<00:04:13.010> our

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
gonna curve this the same way that our

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.110 
gonna curve this the same way that our
screws<00:04:13.520> gonna<00:04:13.790> go<00:04:13.970> in<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.080> I'm<00:04:15.140> gonna<00:04:15.290> curve

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
screws gonna go in so I'm gonna curve

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.050 
screws gonna go in so I'm gonna curve
the<00:04:17.120> end<00:04:17.330> of<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:18.190> wire<00:04:19.190> but<00:04:19.610> you<00:04:19.760> probably

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
the end of the wire but you probably

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.410 
the end of the wire but you probably
can't<00:04:20.450> -<00:04:21.200> well<00:04:21.520> anyway<00:04:22.520> now<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:22.910> can<00:04:23.210> see<00:04:23.390> I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
can't - well anyway now you can see I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.600 
can't - well anyway now you can see I
curved<00:04:23.750> debt<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.650> so<00:04:24.830> we're<00:04:24.980> gonna<00:04:25.070> loop<00:04:25.340> that

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
curved debt and so we're gonna loop that

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.380 
curved debt and so we're gonna loop that
over<00:04:26.600> our<00:04:26.630> screen<00:04:27.170> here<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.910> now<00:04:28.910> I'm<00:04:29.240> gonna

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
over our screen here so now I'm gonna

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.750 
over our screen here so now I'm gonna
fold<00:04:29.690> the<00:04:29.900> wires<00:04:30.110> here<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.460> with<00:04:31.580> this

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
fold the wires here and with this

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.640 
fold the wires here and with this
portion<00:04:32.120> inserts<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.050> then<00:04:33.380> we're<00:04:33.530> gonna

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
portion inserts and then we're gonna

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.270 
portion inserts and then we're gonna
lift<00:04:33.950> up<00:04:34.220> our<00:04:34.460> down<00:04:35.390> water<00:04:35.720> here<00:04:36.100> get<00:04:37.100> this

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
lift up our down water here get this

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.480 
lift up our down water here get this
part<00:04:37.930> connected<00:04:38.930> on<00:04:40.570> like<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:41.900> and<00:04:42.310> we'll<00:04:43.310> just

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
part connected on like so and we'll just

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.440 
part connected on like so and we'll just
tighten<00:04:43.700> this<00:04:43.910> down<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:46.730> like<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.060> said<00:04:47.120> by

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
tighten this down and like I said by

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.470 
tighten this down and like I said by
curving<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:48.080> wire<00:04:48.290> this<00:04:48.650> way<00:04:48.830> as<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:50.000> screw

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
curving the wire this way as the screw

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.460 
curving the wire this way as the screw
turns<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:52.280> would<00:04:52.460> draw<00:04:52.700> out<00:04:52.730> a<00:04:52.880> wire<00:04:53.470> against

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
turns it would draw out a wire against

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.810 
turns it would draw out a wire against
the<00:04:54.590> screw<00:04:54.920> from<00:04:55.220> that<00:04:55.370> way<00:04:55.490> it's<00:04:55.640> not<00:04:55.760> going

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
the screw from that way it's not going

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.560 
the screw from that way it's not going
to<00:04:56.030> come<00:04:56.180> off<00:04:56.360> us<00:04:57.670> okay<00:04:58.670> and<00:04:58.820> now<00:04:59.270> we're<00:04:59.450> ready

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
to come off us okay and now we're ready

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.380 
to come off us okay and now we're ready
to<00:05:00.310> speed<00:05:01.310> our<00:05:01.340> switch<00:05:01.730> in<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.090> can<00:05:05.210> see

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
to speed our switch in and you can see

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.880 
to speed our switch in and you can see
behind<00:05:05.570> you<00:05:05.960> there's<00:05:06.200> these<00:05:06.350> little<00:05:06.530> plastic

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
behind you there's these little plastic

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.040 
behind you there's these little plastic
inserts<00:05:07.610> if<00:05:07.880> you<00:05:08.000> kind<00:05:08.210> of<00:05:08.270> hold<00:05:08.480> your<00:05:08.660> finger

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
inserts if you kind of hold your finger

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.440 
inserts if you kind of hold your finger
against<00:05:09.350> that<00:05:09.620> insert<00:05:10.130> it'll<00:05:10.850> allow<00:05:11.090> it<00:05:11.300> to

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
against that insert it'll allow it to

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.360 
against that insert it'll allow it to
tighten<00:05:11.840> up<00:05:11.960> against<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.890> pad<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:15.260> give<00:05:16.250> you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
tighten up against the pad and give you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.430 
tighten up against the pad and give you
a<00:05:16.430> little<00:05:16.760> bit<00:05:16.940> more<00:05:17.180> stability<00:05:17.600> but<00:05:18.050> mostly

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
a little bit more stability but mostly

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.990 
a little bit more stability but mostly
that<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:18.860> kind<00:05:19.070> of<00:05:19.100> holds<00:05:19.370> your<00:05:19.430> screw<00:05:19.760> there

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
that just kind of holds your screw there

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.260 
that just kind of holds your screw there
so<00:05:20.630> that<00:05:20.810> you<00:05:20.900> don't<00:05:21.080> lose<00:05:21.230> your<00:05:21.320> screw<00:05:21.710> it's<00:05:22.010> a

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
so that you don't lose your screw it's a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:33.700 
so that you don't lose your screw it's a
captive<00:05:23.270> screw<00:05:25.210> call<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.390> there

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.770 

so<00:05:34.710> now<00:05:34.830> we<00:05:34.890> just<00:05:35.220> made<00:05:35.370> this<00:05:35.610> switch<00:05:35.970> just<00:05:36.660> a

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
so now we just made this switch just a

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.930 
so now we just made this switch just a
tiny<00:05:36.990> bit<00:05:37.230> safer<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:37.980> now<00:05:38.340> it's<00:05:38.550> got<00:05:38.700> a<00:05:38.730> ground

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
tiny bit safer and now it's got a ground

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.980 
tiny bit safer and now it's got a ground
on<00:05:39.240> it<00:05:40.250> okay<00:05:41.250> okay<00:05:41.910> there's<00:05:42.150> our<00:05:42.500> switch

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
on it okay okay there's our switch

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.360 
on it okay okay there's our switch
here's<00:05:45.990> our<00:05:46.170> switch<00:05:46.440> plate<00:05:46.770> which<00:05:47.010> I<00:05:47.130> need<00:05:47.280> to

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
here's our switch plate which I need to

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:55.220 
here's our switch plate which I need to
come<00:05:47.550> back<00:05:47.730> and<00:05:48.000> clean<00:05:48.630> off<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.840> it's<00:05:55.050> always

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
come back and clean off and it's always

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.230 
come back and clean off and it's always
good<00:05:55.470> to<00:05:55.500> set<00:05:55.800> these<00:05:55.950> vertical<00:05:56.490> it<00:05:56.790> just<00:05:57.030> gives

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
good to set these vertical it just gives

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.480 
good to set these vertical it just gives
a<00:05:57.390> nice<00:05:57.570> uniform<00:05:58.230> appearance<00:05:58.770> who<00:05:59.190> looks

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
a nice uniform appearance who looks

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.700 
a nice uniform appearance who looks
better<00:05:59.670> and<00:06:00.480> that's<00:06:00.720> how<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:00.990> electrician

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
better and that's how the electrician

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.680 
better and that's how the electrician
set<00:06:02.010> him<00:06:02.160> that's<00:06:03.090> how<00:06:03.270> they<00:06:03.390> know<00:06:03.570> if

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
set him that's how they know if

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.720 
set him that's how they know if
someone's<00:06:04.050> been<00:06:04.260> in<00:06:04.410> that<00:06:04.560> outlet<00:06:04.950> box<00:06:05.250> before

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
someone's been in that outlet box before

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.390 
someone's been in that outlet box before
if<00:06:05.910> the<00:06:06.200> plate<00:06:07.200> screws<00:06:07.590> aren't<00:06:07.860> vertical

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
if the plate screws aren't vertical

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.160 
if the plate screws aren't vertical
you'll<00:06:08.970> think<00:06:09.120> someone's<00:06:09.570> been<00:06:09.750> messing<00:06:09.960> with

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
you'll think someone's been messing with

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.600 
you'll think someone's been messing with
it<00:06:10.440> someone's<00:06:10.830> been<00:06:11.040> getting<00:06:11.190> in<00:06:11.370> there

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
it someone's been getting in there

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.370 
it someone's been getting in there
anyway<00:06:12.540> you're<00:06:12.960> gonna<00:06:13.080> turn<00:06:13.320> my<00:06:13.530> back<00:06:14.340> on

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.120 

there<00:06:19.380> we<00:06:19.560> go

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
there we go

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.240 
there we go
reset<00:06:20.880> the<00:06:20.910> breaker<00:06:21.270> and<00:06:21.980> then<00:06:22.980> come<00:06:23.220> back

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
reset the breaker and then come back

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:32.200 
reset the breaker and then come back
over<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:24.950> curve<00:06:25.950> it<00:06:26.220> that<00:06:26.490> we<00:06:26.610> have<00:06:26.730> power

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.840 

which<00:06:33.210> this<00:06:33.420> one<00:06:33.750> is<00:06:33.780> nutshell<00:06:34.470> but<00:06:34.920> it's<00:06:35.670> not

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:35.850 
which this one is nutshell but it's not

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.170 
which this one is nutshell but it's not
showing<00:06:36.060> through<00:06:36.420> the<00:06:36.540> plate<00:06:37.910> doesn't<00:06:38.910> mean

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
showing through the plate doesn't mean

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.760 
showing through the plate doesn't mean
we<00:06:39.330> don't<00:06:39.450> have<00:06:39.540> power<00:06:39.840> but<00:06:40.200> anyway<00:06:40.530> I'm<00:06:40.620> gonna

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
we don't have power but anyway I'm gonna

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.010 
we don't have power but anyway I'm gonna
turn<00:06:40.950> it<00:06:41.130> turn<00:06:41.970> it<00:06:42.030> off<00:06:42.240> and<00:06:42.540> show<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.780> over

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
here I know this one controls this

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.900 
here I know this one controls this
outlet<00:06:45.300> the<00:06:46.020> top<00:06:46.230> half<00:06:46.500> so<00:06:47.250> it's<00:06:47.460> off<00:06:47.640> right

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
outlet the top half so it's off right

now and let me turn the switch on okay
and<00:06:52.320> then<00:06:52.620> test<00:06:52.920> for<00:06:53.010> power<00:06:53.340> here<00:06:54.320> we<00:06:55.320> go

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.640 

there's<00:06:59.640> our<00:06:59.790> switch<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:01.050> we<00:07:01.290> have<00:07:01.440> like
