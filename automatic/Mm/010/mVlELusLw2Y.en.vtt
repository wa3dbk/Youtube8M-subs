00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.289
 I have also found wonderful shape 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.289
 Hyundai engine gave overheated high jumps 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 almost every 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.729
 have work 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.400
 Hey guys 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.960
 No way 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.019
 No way 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.289
 No way 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.009
 No way 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.980
 never true 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.509
 how was it 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.390
 like Berlitz Kollegah 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.869
 No way 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.940
 never solve your computer problems yourself 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.850
 Herten 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 with whole audio files 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.000
 Drums trumpet they were not victims of the whole

 copyright-protected Mausi illegal www IAA de 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 in addition to that Formula 1 is on it I always thought I have to think 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.100
 their jobs are worried about 8 2 percent 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860
 February to 5 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.470
 what comes now is right with you 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.540
 learn and work 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.610
 ours is like the hot phase of his game in Berlin 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.600
 dülmen 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 already 2008 could have expected 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.550
 nationwide are just exaggerating but like to have more cats in the street 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.260
 would certainly have climbed at least two 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.240
 the percent train not because to liberate everything 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.350
 aggravating is added that the weather far, I know is Norway 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.119
 commemorates Zac Efron and I'm sure the dish I left out 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.730
 as is well known 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.830
 yes, well, I'm not alone 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.430
 No, he is not 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 trickier and besides, Klose can 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.460
 So that's winning and that's why I do not have any occupying power 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 make yes so that is the way to question the people but the device is there 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.970
 concerned 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.500
 that's not really talking 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.600
 hearty mass-produced slightly seventh place 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.549
 Comics I could top that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.609
 but I think that lasts one or two complain Well and that's why I am 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.920
 here again after a boring pilot 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.490
 but now for more encouraging news 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.760
 Be artists from slogans 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.230
 we have so much work but finally I have this hurdle 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.279
 overcome and insufficient 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 what the speech 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.519
 of course I dream I 5000 number Sahl 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.539
 that's really it 

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:38.389
 It's nice but of course I do not just have the whole vacation 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:40.029
 Teenagers set 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.279
 east 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.760
 I thought that in this case I would not find the way anymore instead 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.220
 one hundred euros completely rehabilitated small experiments works 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.369

 we want to win every game apart from the place and 40 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.310
 that's two hours 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.750
 to get on top of the topic like for example we want ours 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.769
 Pass on children 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.469
 and I'm sure that's what it's all about or not 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.779
 Jorge Valdano sounds like this 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.239
 Dr 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.499

 So at the ball Stuttgart 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.379

 because he keeps in mind 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.659
 what if it is to be duly justified 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.590
