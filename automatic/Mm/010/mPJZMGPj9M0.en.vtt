this is our front adjustments as you can
see<00:02:23.950> here<00:02:24.160> then<00:02:24.870> our<00:02:25.870> unique<00:02:26.380> system<00:02:26.680> we're

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
see here then our unique system we're

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.150 
see here then our unique system we're
using<00:02:27.670> on<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.120> cs<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.570> FS<00:02:29.140> series<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.800> we<00:02:29.920> call

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
using on the cs and FS series so we call

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.430 
using on the cs and FS series so we call
it<00:02:30.190> an<00:02:30.400> offset<00:02:30.760> hang<00:02:31.030> design<00:02:31.450> as<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:32.020> can<00:02:32.260> see

lot of area I can grab my camera I can't
grab<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.120> like<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.360> way<00:02:58.600> or<00:02:59.050> maybe<00:02:59.470> if<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.980> want

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
grab it like this way or maybe if I want

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.310 
grab it like this way or maybe if I want
to<00:03:00.280> use<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.550> vertical<00:03:00.700> handle<00:03:01.270> if<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.840> notice

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
to use the vertical handle if you notice

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.770 
to use the vertical handle if you notice
the<00:03:02.590> connection<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.280> offset<00:03:03.850> from<00:03:04.000> my<00:03:04.480> palm

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
the connection is offset from my palm

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.350 
the connection is offset from my palm
it's<00:03:05.410> not<00:03:05.680> in<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.040> center<00:03:06.400> is<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.180> way

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's not in the center is it's a way

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.300 
it's not in the center is it's a way
from<00:03:07.630> my<00:03:07.780> palm<00:03:07.990> so<00:03:08.290> it's<00:03:08.440> easier<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:08.950> me<00:03:09.280> to

from my palm so it's easier for me to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.430 
from my palm so it's easier for me to
use<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.910> vertical<00:03:10.090> system<00:03:10.660> when<00:03:10.990> I<00:03:11.020> make<00:03:11.260> this

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
ready okay this is basically how we

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.980 
ready okay this is basically how we
design<00:04:35.169> this<00:04:35.530> thing<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:37.570> pretty<00:04:37.840> well

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
design this thing and it's pretty well

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.010 
design this thing and it's pretty well
and<00:04:38.350> as<00:04:39.220> you<00:04:39.460> can<00:04:39.639> notice<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.240> connection<00:04:40.780> we

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
and as you can notice the connection we

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.430 
and as you can notice the connection we
are<00:04:41.080> using<00:04:41.320> here<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.639> baldhead<00:04:43.440> connector

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
are using here is the baldhead connector

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.790 
are using here is the baldhead connector
I<00:04:44.650> using<00:04:45.190> some<00:04:45.400> other<00:04:45.520> strap<00:04:46.060> before<00:04:46.540> and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
I using some other strap before and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.770 
I using some other strap before and
unfortunately<00:04:47.800> there's<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.880> lot<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.240> connector

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
unfortunately there's a lot of connector

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.670 
unfortunately there's a lot of connector
they<00:04:50.020> don't<00:04:50.260> allow<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:50.680> to<00:04:51.220> open<00:04:52.530> open<00:04:53.530> up

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
totally to expect to the condition so

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.800 
totally to expect to the condition so
that's<00:04:56.620> why<00:04:56.830> we<00:04:57.280> design<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.330> poor<00:04:58.660> head

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
that's why we design this poor head
