 thank you all thank you very much 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 critical 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.570

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.220

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.050
 after the holidays after 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.239
 vacation that I had I am totally at 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.860
 my side maybe it took me a little longer to 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.690
 what I expected but good is that here 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.700
 I am so let's go back to the track what 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.880
 as soon as possible starting with nine 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.430
 reasons to love well and shenzhen in 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.580
 so we're going to start boys 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.100
 if you do one of the characters more 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.630
 accepted in the limbo of naruto to simple 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.730
 view is a risk for the continuum but 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.190
 They have a lot of experience in combat and 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.620
 that's why society about three years in other 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.780
 words a thousand of will have a little 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.610
 only that they manage to solve we suffer 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.880
 nine reasons to love that sense 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.680
 amount the person 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 wow wow I would love interruption and 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.610
 bad savona 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.540
 units of people who dedicated their lives 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.090
 to find peace for example 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.619
 he wanted world peace so I know the 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.630
 happened traveling through all the parts and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.490
 committed transact is already a pervert 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.430
 there are very like for travel purposes for 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.320
 finding peace was worth the only thing 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.240
 that was missing a drawing that will look 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.240
 you are what things you give me the ridiculous part 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.880
 as in quantity it has already become 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.800
 promised will be a match but great 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.420
 that you have seen many to me it serves me 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.430
 for many perverts think a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.390
 official pervert this turn and so 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 we go for this reason 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.950
 it was with people who in a series 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.610
 demand whatever it is a hero can be 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.470
 a hero 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.170
 'we have or maybe we do not see but yes very 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 serious as it was that if two points and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.410
 On the other hand, it can also be very 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 funny and funny here we have to 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.800
 turning already time always makes you laugh 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.540
 with his follies that sometimes appears and 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.490
 We know personal I have to remember 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.020
 what has made the most of shitting with laughter 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.150
 musicians of Argentina would be 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.150
 definitely this old man if arias in 6 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.959
 your relationship with adults extremely 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.330
 because I am important because both 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.920
 as a person and as a basic girl 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.750
 needs was like a father to win 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.010
 uto so that's another reason why the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.540
 family gets tired of her self was 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.370
 pretty injected the time eating with 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.630
 this one of those that became good 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.840
 person and decided to follow the same path 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.450
 I would like to seek peace and to my son my 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.250
 children very rich memories and sense in the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.739
 times that I was young and now that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.680
 you are forest age adults I can say 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.780
 that was an excellent girl and a 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.190
 excellent person to which land has 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.959
 materials then you would be like a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.330
 father for me too but that is 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.100
 being younger has your family 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.100
 our parents are all the future 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.100
 understand still sounds that hurt me 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.710
 if it can not be very funny all the 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.540
 party but which one wants to be serious is it 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.280
 for example memory of a moment was 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.020
 able to kill your cesarean ship goes by 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.550
 above was not able to explain the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.170
 death against nothing is your own album 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.590
 so imagine what else I could 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.590
 do 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.120
 its invocation uses are epic 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.230
 he is an excellent writer and nobody 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.270
 can deny if they do not look at how it attacks you if 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.360
 your book from the beginning of the series or 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.360
 book that was basically a fight 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.370
 optimism and comedy say yesterday to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.590
 what always to the and gave the laws in 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.750
 his most dramatic moments we had in 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.620
 adults and young loners 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.959
 discriminated against he wanted to find his 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.310
 girlfriend do you know I tell your friend that at 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.720
 same time cinema that also had its 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.000
 problems but he was always smiling 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.000
 and being as optimistic as possible 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.329
 and good all the reasons that I mentioned 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.610
 previously they would take us to this reason 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.680
 and if the perfect teacher we have to 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.909
 change it because teachers like him and like 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.909
 there are not many 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.919

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.779

 have a very steady and good rhythm 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.319

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.039
