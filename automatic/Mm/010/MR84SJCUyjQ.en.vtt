00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
right here the hides of that one we come

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.930 
right here the hides of that one we come
over<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.269> same<00:03:31.480> as<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:31.870> one<00:03:32.580> keep<00:03:33.580> coming

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
over is the same as this one keep coming

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.500 
over is the same as this one keep coming
over<00:03:34.060> here<00:03:34.680> this<00:03:35.680> one<00:03:36.010> is<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.940> same<00:03:37.120> as<00:03:37.329> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
over here this one is the same as this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.100 
over here this one is the same as this
one<00:03:37.569> so<00:03:38.549> if<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.640> put<00:03:39.880> water<00:03:40.090> in<00:03:40.390> here<00:03:40.420> it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
one so if I put water in here it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.430 
one so if I put water in here it
automatically<00:03:42.099> adjust<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.880> one<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.959> to

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
automatically adjust to this one and to

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.170 
automatically adjust to this one and to
this<00:03:44.590> one<00:03:44.920> these<00:03:45.910> tanks<00:03:46.390> are<00:03:46.510> separate<00:03:47.319> tanks

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
this one these tanks are separate tanks

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.420 
this one these tanks are separate tanks
how<00:03:49.180> we<00:03:49.239> do<00:03:49.599> that<00:03:49.810> as<00:03:50.110> I'm<00:03:50.650> using<00:03:50.890> these<00:03:51.130> pipes

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
how we do that as I'm using these pipes

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.960 
how we do that as I'm using these pipes
right<00:03:51.849> here<00:03:52.500> some<00:03:53.500> pipes<00:03:53.769> right<00:03:54.099> here<00:03:54.489> and

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
right here some pipes right here and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.750 
right here some pipes right here and
that's<00:03:55.840> what<00:03:56.019> they<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.769> they<00:03:57.370> can<00:03:57.489> go<00:03:57.610> ahead

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
that's what they do is they can go ahead

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.780 
that's what they do is they can go ahead
and<00:03:58.060> keep<00:03:58.269> a<00:03:58.450> constant<00:03:58.780> level<00:03:59.590> on<00:04:00.190> each<00:04:00.370> one<00:04:00.670> of

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
and keep a constant level on each one of

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.059 
and keep a constant level on each one of
them<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:02.380> tank<00:04:02.739> has<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.310> lot<00:04:03.670> more<00:04:04.109> area<00:04:05.109> if<00:04:05.920> I

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
them this tank has a lot more area if I

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.970 
them this tank has a lot more area if I
put<00:04:06.340> this<00:04:06.489> tank<00:04:06.790> there<00:04:07.060> up<00:04:07.239> to<00:04:07.269> this<00:04:07.540> height<00:04:07.980> it

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
put this tank there up to this height it

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.479 
put this tank there up to this height it
would<00:04:09.930> overflow<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.560> one<00:04:11.799> cuz<00:04:12.069> it's<00:04:12.250> in

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
would overflow this one cuz it's in

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.870 
would overflow this one cuz it's in
constant<00:04:12.850> height<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.680> interesting<00:04:15.549> part

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
constant height so the interesting part

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.120 
constant height so the interesting part
here<00:04:16.180> with<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.600> tank<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.049> just<00:04:17.260> put<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.560> upside

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
here with the tank I just put it upside

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.100 
here with the tank I just put it upside
down<00:04:18.190> in<00:04:19.109> here<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.680> can<00:04:20.859> see<00:04:21.039> that<00:04:21.310> height

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.110 
down in here you can see that height

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.420 
down in here you can see that height
won't<00:04:23.110> be<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:23.410> constant<00:04:23.800> height<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
won't be the constant height like the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.640 
won't be the constant height like the
rest<00:04:24.610> them<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.419> heights<00:04:25.660> of<00:04:25.900> water<00:04:26.169> in<00:04:26.410> it

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
rest them to the heights of water in it

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.020 
rest them to the heights of water in it
which<00:04:26.889> again<00:04:27.900> this<00:04:28.900> is<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.229> bottom<00:04:30.030> that's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
which again this is the bottom that's

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.990 
which again this is the bottom that's
the<00:04:31.240> top<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.840> tank<00:04:32.110> down<00:04:32.800> there<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.520> put<00:04:33.880> it

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the top of the tank down there I put it

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.580 
the top of the tank down there I put it
in<00:04:34.090> upside<00:04:34.240> down<00:04:35.639> bottom<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:36.729> the<00:04:36.789> tank

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
in upside down bottom of the tank

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.149 
in upside down bottom of the tank
there's<00:04:38.590> that

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
there's that

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:44.489 
there's that
if<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.789> reach<00:04:41.119> down<00:04:41.389> in<00:04:41.659> here<00:04:41.959> I<00:04:42.879> can<00:04:43.879> go

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:44.499 
if I reach down in here I can go

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.529 
if I reach down in here I can go
underneath<00:04:45.550> there<00:04:46.550> so<00:04:46.879> you<00:04:46.969> can<00:04:47.149> see<00:04:47.330> how<00:04:47.479> that

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
underneath there so you can see how that

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.189 
underneath there so you can see how that
is<00:04:47.929> all<00:04:47.959> open<00:04:49.389> alright<00:04:50.389> just<00:04:50.719> want<00:04:50.929> to<00:04:50.989> share

is all open alright just want to share
with<00:04:51.349> you<00:04:51.529> about<00:04:51.619> the<00:04:52.119> constant<00:04:53.119> level<00:04:53.989> there

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
with you about the constant level there

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.249 
with you about the constant level there
is<00:04:54.800> on<00:04:55.129> all<00:04:55.399> them<00:04:55.669> with<00:04:56.269> the<00:04:56.419> exception<00:04:56.749> of<00:04:57.110> the

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
is on all them with the exception of the

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.850 
is on all them with the exception of the
one<00:04:57.379> I<00:04:57.439> just<00:04:57.739> put<00:04:57.949> in<00:04:58.099> upside<00:04:58.550> down<00:04:58.849> is<00:04:59.719> up<00:05:00.019> near

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
one I just put in upside down is up near

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.249 
one I just put in upside down is up near
the<00:05:01.279> top<00:05:01.519> which<00:05:01.999> is<00:05:02.029> actually<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.749> bottom<00:05:03.110> of
