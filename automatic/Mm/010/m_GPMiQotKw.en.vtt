00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
and that came up like two or three weeks

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.330 
and that came up like two or three weeks
after<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.959> game<00:03:28.080> came<00:03:28.200> out<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:29.040> was

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
after the game came out like this was

map<00:03:41.370> like<00:03:41.640> East<00:03:41.820> invest<00:03:42.180> in<00:03:42.269> general<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.110> only

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
map like East invest in general the only

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.740 
map like East invest in general the only
thing<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.150> not<00:03:45.269> just<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.480> research

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
thing is this is not just a research

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.840 
thing is this is not just a research
analyst<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.260> 10<00:03:46.950> Eastern<00:03:47.400> channels

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
analyst like 10 Eastern channels

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.630 
analyst like 10 Eastern channels

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
together it blob drift you see like it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.310 
together it blob drift you see like it
