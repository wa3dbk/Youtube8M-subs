00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
hi my name is el naschie I'm with the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
hi my name is el naschie I'm with the
outdoor<00:00:10.530> program<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> will<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.670> showing

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
outdoor program and I will be showing

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.240 
outdoor program and I will be showing
you<00:00:12.240> how<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> pump<00:00:12.719> your<00:00:12.870> tires<00:00:13.049> today<00:00:13.440> so

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
you how to pump your tires today so

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.099 
you how to pump your tires today so
there<00:00:14.610> are<00:00:14.730> two<00:00:14.880> different<00:00:15.000> types<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.690> valves

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
there are two different types of valves

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.330 
there are two different types of valves
there<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.160> Schrader<00:00:17.580> valve<00:00:17.850> which<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
there is Schrader valve which is a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.679 
there is Schrader valve which is a
similar<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> car<00:00:20.699> tire<00:00:20.850> it's<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> car

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
similar to a car tire it's like a car

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.470 
similar to a car tire it's like a car
tire<00:00:21.869> valve<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:23.699> there's<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> Presta

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
tire valve and then there's the Presta

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.890 
tire valve and then there's the Presta
valve<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.050> skinnier<00:00:26.599> more<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
valve which is a skinnier more for a

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.950 
valve which is a skinnier more for a
road<00:00:28.109> bike<00:00:28.320> valves<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:30.179> each<00:00:30.330> bike<00:00:30.660> tire

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
road bike valves so on each bike tire

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
road bike valves so on each bike tire
you'll<00:00:31.260> find<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.740> recommended<00:00:32.369> psi<00:00:32.969> which<00:00:33.390> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you'll find a recommended psi which is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.510 
you'll find a recommended psi which is
the<00:00:33.870> pressure<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.530> want<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.800> keep<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.250> tires

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the pressure you want to keep your tires

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.240 
the pressure you want to keep your tires
inflated<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.230> on<00:00:37.230> each<00:00:37.440> floor<00:00:37.770> pump<00:00:38.040> you'll

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
inflated to on each floor pump you'll

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.610 
inflated to on each floor pump you'll
find<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> gauge<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:40.680> has<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.399> number<00:00:42.110> every<00:00:43.110> 20

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
find the gauge it has a number every 20

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
find the gauge it has a number every 20
interval<00:00:44.719> there's<00:00:45.719> also<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.530> red<00:00:47.039> arrow<00:00:47.640> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
interval there's also a red arrow that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660 
interval there's also a red arrow that
will<00:00:48.270> tell<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.750> pressure<00:00:48.989> you're<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.670> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
will tell you what pressure you're at to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
will tell you what pressure you're at to
insert<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> pump<00:00:51.329> head<00:00:51.480> onto<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> valve<00:00:52.199> well

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
insert the pump head onto the valve well

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.569 
insert the pump head onto the valve well
first<00:00:52.949> want<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.870> check<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.579> insertion

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
first want to check which insertion

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.849 
first want to check which insertion
point<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.940> want<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.449> using<00:00:57.949> this<00:00:59.539> tire<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.859> a

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
point we want to be using this tire is a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.460 
point we want to be using this tire is a
Schrader<00:01:02.280> valve<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.480> we'll<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.110> larger

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Schrader valve so we'll use the larger

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.630 
Schrader valve so we'll use the larger
of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.949> pump<00:01:05.760> insertion<00:01:06.299> heads<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.640> we're

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
of the pump insertion heads so we're

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.740 
of the pump insertion heads so we're
going<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> stick<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.520> pump<00:01:11.520> head<00:01:11.729> onto<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
going to stick the pump head onto the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.359 
going to stick the pump head onto the
valve<00:01:13.189> nice<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.460> tight<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.720> then<00:01:15.780> pull<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.470> on

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
valve nice and tight and then pull up on

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
valve nice and tight and then pull up on
the<00:01:17.939> lever<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> remove<00:01:20.009> your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the lever in the back so to remove your

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.830 
the lever in the back so to remove your
pump<00:01:20.430> head<00:01:20.610> from<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.060> valve<00:01:21.240> you'll<00:01:21.600> first

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
pump head from your valve you'll first

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.100 
pump head from your valve you'll first
want<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.140> press<00:01:22.350> down<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> lever<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.430> then

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
want to press down on the lever and then

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.070 
want to press down on the lever and then
pull<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> pump<00:01:26.040> head<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.240> it's

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
pull on the pump head so that it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.510 
pull on the pump head so that it's
released<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.040> valve

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
released from your valve

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.679 
released from your valve
that's<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> valves<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.420> different

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that's the valves are a little different

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.679 
that's the valves are a little different
first<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> Presta<00:01:32.880> valve<00:01:33.090> you'll<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
first on the Presta valve you'll have to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
first on the Presta valve you'll have to
twist<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.259> little<00:01:34.470> end<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.360> valve

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
twist the little end of the of the valve

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.190 
twist the little end of the of the valve
up<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:40.799> stops<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.939> then

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
up all the way so that it stops and then

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.170 
up all the way so that it stops and then
you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> press<00:01:43.560> down<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> lever<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can press down on the lever and it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.859 
you can press down on the lever and it
removes<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> air<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:47.520> we'll<00:01:47.820> use<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.360> smaller

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
removes the air so we'll use the smaller

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.389 
removes the air so we'll use the smaller
of<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> two<00:01:49.670> pump<00:01:50.670> heads<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.630> insert<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
of the two pump heads and insert the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
of the two pump heads and insert the
same<00:01:53.610> way<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.119> have<00:01:54.270> Schrader<00:01:54.540> valve

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
same way you would have Schrader valve

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.219 
same way you would have Schrader valve
down<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.700> pulling<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> lever

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
down and then pulling up on the lever

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.100 
down and then pulling up on the lever
so<00:02:00.130> once<00:02:00.369> you<00:02:00.520> have<00:02:00.700> your<00:02:00.850> pump<00:02:01.119> head<00:02:01.299> inserted

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
so once you have your pump head inserted

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.770 
so once you have your pump head inserted
on<00:02:02.259> your<00:02:02.469> valve<00:02:03.180> correctly<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.479> go<00:02:04.659> ahead

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
on your valve correctly you can go ahead

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.600 
on your valve correctly you can go ahead
and<00:02:04.960> start<00:02:05.320> pumping<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.039> the<00:02:06.130> recommended

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
and start pumping to the recommended

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.779 
and start pumping to the recommended
pressure<00:02:07.379> you<00:02:08.379> can<00:02:08.560> keep<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.039> close<00:02:09.220> eye<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.459> the

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
pressure you can keep a close eye on the

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.180 
pressure you can keep a close eye on the
gauge<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.000> make<00:02:10.450> sure<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.959> you're<00:02:11.190> pumping

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
gauge to make sure that you're pumping

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.119 
gauge to make sure that you're pumping
to<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.910> right<00:02:13.060> amount<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.040> you

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
to the to the right amount so if you

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.440 
to the to the right amount so if you
need<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.280> save<00:02:15.580> some<00:02:15.730> time<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.239> still

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
need to save some time but you still

bother pumping your tires there are two
main<00:02:54.280> reasons<00:02:54.459> one<00:02:55.269> is<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.810> prevent<00:02:56.170> some

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
main reasons one is to prevent some

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.539 
main reasons one is to prevent some
nasty<00:02:57.280> pinch<00:02:57.519> flats<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.480> that's<00:02:58.630> when<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
nasty pinch flats and that's when the

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.880 
nasty pinch flats and that's when the
tube<00:03:00.750> contacts<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.079> rim

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
tube contacts the rim

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.280 
tube contacts the rim
whenever<00:03:03.790> you're<00:03:03.940> going<00:03:03.970> over<00:03:04.389> like<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> bigger

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
whenever you're going over like a bigger

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.800 
whenever you're going over like a bigger
bump<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:06.040> it'll<00:03:06.760> actually<00:03:06.970> create<00:03:07.600> two<00:03:07.780> holes

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
bump and it'll actually create two holes

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.750 
bump and it'll actually create two holes
in<00:03:08.260> your<00:03:08.380> tire<00:03:08.590> which<00:03:08.980> will<00:03:09.190> eventually<00:03:09.489> cause

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
in your tire which will eventually cause

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.750 
in your tire which will eventually cause
a<00:03:10.180> flat<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:11.590> other<00:03:11.709> is<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.250> prevent<00:03:12.519> rim

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
a flat the other is to prevent rim

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.270 
a flat the other is to prevent rim
damage<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.870> were<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.170> go<00:03:14.500> over<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.829> rock

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
damage if you were to go over a rock

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.059 
damage if you were to go over a rock
with<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.579> flat<00:03:15.940> tire<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:16.840> your<00:03:17.500> rim<00:03:17.739> will

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
with a flat tire then your rim will

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.610 
with a flat tire then your rim will
actually<00:03:18.670> come<00:03:19.600> into<00:03:19.750> contact<00:03:19.989> with<00:03:20.290> that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
actually come into contact with that

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.569 
actually come into contact with that
rocker<00:03:21.220> harder<00:03:21.850> object<00:03:22.239> object<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:22.989> cause<00:03:23.290> a

bend in the rim so that's how you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.160 
bend in the rim so that's how you
properly<00:03:26.560> inflate<00:03:27.280> your<00:03:27.400> tires<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:28.630> can<00:03:28.959> feel
