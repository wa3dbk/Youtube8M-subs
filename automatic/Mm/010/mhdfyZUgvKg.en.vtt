I'm going to be showing you how to give
feed<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> beast<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.320> also<00:00:10.740> minecraft<00:00:11.250> more

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
feed the beast and also minecraft more

RAM and this tutorial is specifically

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.950 
RAM and this tutorial is specifically
for<00:00:14.849> feed<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.089> beast<00:00:15.240> however<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.870> also

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
for feed the beast however it can also

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.109 
for feed the beast however it can also
be<00:00:16.320> applied<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.800> Minecraft<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.789> start<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
be applied to Minecraft you start to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.359 
be applied to Minecraft you start to
make<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> few<00:00:18.480> little<00:00:18.570> changes<00:00:18.980> anyway<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.220> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
make a few little changes anyway if you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.980 
make a few little changes anyway if you
don't<00:00:20.609> know<00:00:20.760> whether<00:00:21.300> or<00:00:21.539> not<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.779> need<00:00:21.960> to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
don't know whether or not you need to

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
don't know whether or not you need to
give<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:23.279> feed<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> based<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.090> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
give it on your feed the based more on a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.779 
give it on your feed the based more on a
few<00:00:25.050> basic<00:00:25.320> signs<00:00:25.529> are<00:00:25.740> constant<00:00:26.160> crashing<00:00:26.640> if

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
few basic signs are constant crashing if

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.640 
few basic signs are constant crashing if
it<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:27.689> low<00:00:27.869> framerate<00:00:28.199> rates

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it you get really low framerate rates

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.450 
it you get really low framerate rates
when<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.949> think<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.160> should<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.369> getting

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
when you think you should be getting

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.330 
when you think you should be getting
better<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> just<00:00:30.810> basically<00:00:31.769> shitty

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
better and just basically shitty

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.299 
better and just basically shitty
performance<00:00:32.899> now<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.140> pretty<00:00:34.350> simple<00:00:34.710> first

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
performance now it's pretty simple first

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.209 
performance now it's pretty simple first
of<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.700> want<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.090> control<00:00:36.570> panel

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
of all you want to go to control panel

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.850 
of all you want to go to control panel
open<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.309> system<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.149> security<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.570> then

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
open up system and security and then

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.459 
open up system and security and then
system<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.370> Windows<00:00:41.670> seven<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> way

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
system this for Windows seven by the way

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.959 
system this for Windows seven by the way
so<00:00:43.469> let's<00:00:43.530> open<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.950> system<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.850> down

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
so let's open up system and then go down

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.000 
so let's open up system and then go down
here<00:00:45.239> under<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.539> system<00:00:45.840> subcategory<00:00:46.649> it'll

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
here under the system subcategory it'll

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
here under the system subcategory it'll
say<00:00:47.190> installed<00:00:47.610> memory<00:00:47.820> ran<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> I've<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.989> 16

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
say installed memory ran and I've got 16

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.200 
say installed memory ran and I've got 16
gigabytes<00:00:49.739> now<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.489> lot<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> RAM<00:00:51.000> I've

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
gigabytes now that's a lot of RAM I've

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.160 
gigabytes now that's a lot of RAM I've
got<00:00:51.390> plenty<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.690> spare

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
got plenty to spare

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
got plenty to spare
however<00:00:52.680> most<00:00:53.010> computers<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.699> would<00:00:54.059> say<00:00:54.270> have

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
however most computers I would say have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.470 
however most computers I would say have
two<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> eight<00:00:55.230> gigabytes<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.800> RAM<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
two to eight gigabytes of RAM now if you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
two to eight gigabytes of RAM now if you
do<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.109> low<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.949> suggest<00:00:59.520> not

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
do have as low as two I suggest not

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.389 
do have as low as two I suggest not
doing<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.840> because<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.410> could<00:01:02.039> cause<00:01:02.250> some

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
doing this because that could cause some

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
doing this because that could cause some
problems<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.539> you've<00:01:03.690> got<00:01:03.719> four<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> eight

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
problems but if you've got four to eight

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.100 
problems but if you've got four to eight
gigabytes<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.189> fine<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> simply

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
gigabytes that's fine this is to simply

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
gigabytes that's fine this is to simply
decide<00:01:07.500> how<00:01:07.680> much<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.130> give<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.369> now<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
decide how much you can give it now you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.880 
decide how much you can give it now you
never<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> give<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.110> entirety<00:01:10.860> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
never want to give it the entirety of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.560 
never want to give it the entirety of
your<00:01:11.010> RAM<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.640> completely<00:01:12.060> stuff<00:01:12.390> up

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
your RAM that will completely stuff up

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.270 
your RAM that will completely stuff up
the<00:01:12.900> computer<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.799> not<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> give

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the computer so I'm not going to give

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
the computer so I'm not going to give
fit<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.640> 16<00:01:15.060> gigabytes<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
fit to be 16 gigabytes that's just a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410 
fit to be 16 gigabytes that's just a
crazy<00:01:16.110> amount<00:01:16.549> but<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.240> give<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
crazy amount but I'm going to give it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
crazy amount but I'm going to give it
three<00:01:18.600> gigabytes<00:01:18.840> because<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.340> said<00:01:20.400> I've

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
three gigabytes because like I said I've

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.320 
three gigabytes because like I said I've
got<00:01:20.729> plenty<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> spare

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
got plenty to spare

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
got plenty to spare
but<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.930> you've<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.290> four<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.770> eight

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
but if you've got four to eight

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
but if you've got four to eight
gigabytes<00:01:23.759> I'd<00:01:23.820> suggest<00:01:24.090> giving<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.659> to

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
gigabytes I'd suggest giving it to

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
gigabytes I'd suggest giving it to
gigabytes<00:01:25.259> I'd<00:01:25.590> say<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.340> default

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
gigabytes I'd say because it's default

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.050 
gigabytes I'd say because it's default
this<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.710> anyway<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> right-click

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
this one anyway to do that right-click

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.370 
this one anyway to do that right-click
on<00:01:30.420> your<00:01:30.450> desktop<00:01:30.600> go<00:01:31.590> new<00:01:32.810> text<00:01:33.810> document<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
on your desktop go new text document and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.469 
on your desktop go new text document and
then<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.430> name<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> whatever<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
then you can just name that whatever you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.440 
then you can just name that whatever you
want<00:01:37.009> it's<00:01:38.009> going<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> need<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.610> feed<00:01:39.119> beast

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
want it's going to need that feed beast

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.340 
want it's going to need that feed beast
Brown<00:01:40.970> let's<00:01:41.970> open<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.079> what<00:01:43.290> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
Brown let's open that up and what you

shortcut and let's just to find out the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
shortcut and let's just to find out the
directory

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
directory

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.460 
directory
I<00:02:12.709> go<00:02:13.159> properties<00:02:13.930> shortcut<00:02:15.080> and<00:02:15.170> it'll<00:02:15.379> be

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
I go properties shortcut and it'll be

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.559 
I go properties shortcut and it'll be
the<00:02:15.590> target<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:17.209> is<00:02:17.390> the

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
the target here and that is the

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.000 
the target here and that is the
directory<00:02:17.959> I'll<00:02:18.110> feed<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.440> beat<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.830> just

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
directory I'll feed the beat so just

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.360 
directory I'll feed the beat so just
copy<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.650> put<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:21.680> in<00:02:21.920> here<00:02:22.159> as<00:02:22.340> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
copy that and put it in here as the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.979 
copy that and put it in here as the
directory<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.299> as<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.599> see<00:02:23.659> that's<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
directory so as you can see that's the

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.930 
directory so as you can see that's the
same<00:02:24.140> as<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.379> was<00:02:24.470> before<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.790> once

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
same as it was before and then once

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.240 
same as it was before and then once
you've<00:02:26.060> done<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.269> typed<00:02:26.989> in<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.319> you<00:02:28.069> want
