00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.840
 well, monetary reform as well as electoral 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.910
 reform is two big questions for 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.230
 everyone who wants to change something and is ready 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.529
 go beyond stereotypes 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:12.929
 can spend money 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.549
 electoral reform is not easy 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.579
 they have strong NPP opponents 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:18.789
 who are interested in 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.129
 the present position of make 

00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:24.129
 everything possible to save it UAH 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.320
 but now we understand that money is just 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.869
 idea and in reality money can be 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.390
 anything here for example simple 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.739
 alternative monetary system 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.810
 purposes 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.350
 this model is based on having system 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.840
 place in the past in england and america 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.730
 the passenger was ruined by jewelers 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.340
 bankers of municipalities partial system 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.340
 backup system 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.870
 so to create an economy based 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.190
 on a stable money system without 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.380
 the recall of the percent of the judge should not 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.760
 create them spend governments 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.300
 preferably to create 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.950
 long-term infrastructure 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.190
 promoting the development of the economy 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.800
 road and rail bridges 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.130
 desks shopping centers such money will be 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.720
 create families like debt 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.140
 commitment as the value namely 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.780
 the value of what they are invested in 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.860
 with such money proportional 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.490
 the growth of trade associated with birth will not be 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.170
 call 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.170
 no inflation your experience 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.960
 if government spending 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 causes inflation there are two ways 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.160
 rectify the situation 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.190
 tons of inflation can be thought of as 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.080
 fee for using money 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.520
 That is, the tax if the money depreciated 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.900
 by 20 percent or if the government 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.740
 collects from us 20 percent of the money 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.340
 effectively our purchasing 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.190
 same ability 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.490
 from this point of view of inflation as 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.130
 tax is justified if it is used in 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.130
 benefit of costs within certain limits 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.030
 dollars or how could the government 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.780
 would fight inflation for may 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.510
 money from circulation and destroying them 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.510
 thus restoring them 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.610
 cost for 1 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.940
 to control deflation i.e. 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.359
 the process of falling prices and wages 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.279
 the government could issue and 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.329
 spend more money 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.509
 without competition from the created 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.239
 debt money banks government 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.849
 could effectively control 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.649
 government need for money 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.479
 people knew who was to blame for the failures 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.249
 management quality assessment 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.119
 the government would add value 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:33.729
 national currency 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:35.809
 so the government would exist behind 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:36.650
 tax invoice 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.159
 like now but tax money 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.140
 would work more efficiently because 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.480
 that there is no need to pay interest 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.309
 private bankers 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.019
 national debt is simply not 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.279
 would exist because 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:50.329
 the government itself created but everything 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.089
 money that spends the situation when the whole 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.109
 state people working for private 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.009
 a bank because it owes it with interest 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.009
 government would be impossible 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.619
 in money is a new form of slavery which 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.199
 different from its former secured 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.009
 since between master slave 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.319
 missing human 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.189
 relations 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.189
 Lev Tolstoy 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.329
 did not move another 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.479
 no one enslaved since the one who 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:22.369
 considers himself free as such 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.389
 is an 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.719
 priests what we have learned to count 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.549
 democracy freedom in reality is 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.299
 ingenious hidden form 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.049
 economic growth following 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.469
 still so far our whole society 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.529
 depends on bank loans in order 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.019
 so that there would be money equant kira 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.260
 will make decisions who give 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
 money is gay and who doesn't like 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.139
 modern banking system 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.109
 makes money out of nothing this process 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.099
 perhaps the most incredible trick 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.439
 ever invented usury 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.790
 conceived iniquities 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.189
 approved by Baron 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.159
 bankers own the whole world take it away 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.639
 down at the start to recreate the money 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.619
 with a stroke of pen I could not redeem it 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.049
 take back this great one from them 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.579
 authorities are all great states like mine 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.479
 substances 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.859
 they must disappear that this world has become 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.419
 better and happier but if you want 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.400
 continue to be bank slaves for 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.409
 soil your own slavery 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.490
 then let the bankers continue 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.150
 create money and manage the crowd 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.389
 immediately after growth 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.249
 CEO of the Bank of England, the second 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 attack on his 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:42.469
 it is impossible to issue additionally 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:44.089
 your money out of control 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.989
 King George III 

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:47.059
 international congress has become 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:49.069
 the main cause of the revolution 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.069
 threatening with a knife 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.080
 racing because few people realize that history 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.289
 united states starting with the revolution 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.870
 1770 anything more than that 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.220
 stories of success 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.890
 its independence from European 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.890
 international banks why be afraid 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:11.129
 here this fight was final 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.849
 Lost in 1913 times when President Woodrow 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.939
 Wilson signed the federal act 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.449
 reserve giving away american money in 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.669
 hands of international banking
