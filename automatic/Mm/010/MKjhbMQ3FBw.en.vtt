and<00:00:14.730> inspiring<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.990> picked<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> up<00:00:17.070> because<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and inspiring I picked it up because I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.179 
and inspiring I picked it up because I
had<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.240> gut<00:00:18.570> intuition<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:20.130> of

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
had this gut intuition that I kind of

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
had this gut intuition that I kind of
needed<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.640> at<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.970> moment<00:00:21.420> because

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
needed it at the moment because

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.929 
needed it at the moment because
throughout<00:00:22.439> January<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.160> had<00:00:23.369> been<00:00:23.670> so

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
throughout January I had been so

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
throughout January I had been so
scatterbrained<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.769> little<00:00:26.010> bit<00:00:26.130> too

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
scatterbrained and a little bit too

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.009 
scatterbrained and a little bit too
focused<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.849> chasing<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.510> goals<00:00:27.779> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
focused on chasing my goals and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.140 
focused on chasing my goals and
ambitions<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.830> felt<00:00:29.490> like<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> piece<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
ambitions I felt like a piece of the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
ambitions I felt like a piece of the
puzzle<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.630> missing<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.920> book

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
puzzle was missing and this book

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.340 
puzzle was missing and this book
literally<00:00:32.850> brought<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.210> back<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.660> love<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.230> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
literally brought me back to love and it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.950 
literally brought me back to love and it
just<00:00:34.530> reminded<00:00:35.070> me<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.690> important<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
just reminded me how important it is to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.350 
just reminded me how important it is to
put<00:00:37.500> love<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:37.820> because<00:00:38.820> love<00:00:39.120> should

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
put love first because love should

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.840 
put love first because love should
always<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.440> priority<00:00:40.850> over

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
always be our first priority over

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.209 
always be our first priority over
everything<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.690> want<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> do<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.170> life<00:00:43.219> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
more beautiful and it's really simple be

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.630 
more beautiful and it's really simple be
a<00:00:49.530> living<00:00:50.219> expression<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:51.300> love<00:00:52.309> we<00:00:53.309> are

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
a living expression of love we are

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.180 
a living expression of love we are
already<00:00:54.149> living<00:00:54.449> expressions<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.350> love<00:00:55.559> we

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
already living expressions of love we

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
already living expressions of love we
just<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:56.699> always<00:00:56.940> choose<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.809> express<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
just don't always choose to express the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.889 
just don't always choose to express the
love<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.280> within<00:00:59.520> us<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.600> usually

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
love that we have within us we usually

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.670 
love that we have within us we usually
hide<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.949> or<00:01:02.340> hold<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> back<00:01:03.690> because<00:01:04.019> we<00:01:04.470> just

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
hide it or hold it back because we just

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
hide it or hold it back because we just
want<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> protect<00:01:05.250> ourselves<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.689> we
