00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
ramp and yeah then it can go for it no

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.149 
ramp and yeah then it can go for it no
problem

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

standing on top of the cliff getting
ready<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:15.350> dropping<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.609> things<00:01:17.609> you<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.880> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
ready for dropping it things you have to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.599 
ready for dropping it things you have to
look<00:01:18.119> at<00:01:18.299> are<00:01:18.539> are<00:01:19.469> you<00:01:19.590> binding<00:01:19.950> slows<00:01:20.250> first

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
look at are are you binding slows first

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.480 
look at are are you binding slows first
of<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.969> don't<00:01:21.149> lose<00:01:21.390> your<00:01:21.420> board<00:01:21.719> and

then you get ready you spot your landing

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:28.999 
then you get ready you spot your landing
drop<00:01:27.209> in<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.750> then<00:01:28.020> launch<00:01:28.319> off<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> big

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
drop in and then launch off do a big

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
drop in and then launch off do a big
Ollie<00:01:29.219> or<00:01:29.609> small<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> depends<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> cliffs

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
Ollie or small it depends on the cliffs

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.529 
Ollie or small it depends on the cliffs
they're<00:01:31.740> all<00:01:31.859> different<00:01:32.099> the<00:01:32.880> faster<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.359> go

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
they're all different the faster you go

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.230 
they're all different the faster you go
the<00:01:33.840> better<00:01:34.679> angle<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.399> for<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> landing<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the better angle is for the landing the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
the better angle is for the landing the
slower<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> go<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.170> drop<00:01:37.200> down<00:01:37.709> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
slower you go the more you drop down and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.660 
slower you go the more you drop down and
you<00:01:38.039> just<00:01:38.250> fall<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.030> rock<00:01:39.359> space<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.810> here

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
you just fall off the rock space is here

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.459 
you just fall off the rock space is here
if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.789> land<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.179> powder<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.990> sit<00:01:43.259> down

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
if you land in powder don't sit down

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.050 
if you land in powder don't sit down
stomp<00:01:44.129> your<00:01:44.189> landings<00:01:44.579> that's<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:44.909> most

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
stomp your landings that's the most

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.209 
stomp your landings that's the most
important<00:01:45.479> doing<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.750> cliff<00:01:45.959> drop<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.099> you

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
important doing a cliff drop and if you

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.750 
important doing a cliff drop and if you
don't<00:01:47.399> stop<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.759> landing<00:01:48.090> do<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> again

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.930 

so<00:01:53.480> yeah<00:01:53.690> that's<00:01:53.990> how<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.140> do<00:01:54.290> a<00:01:54.320> cliff<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:54.950> go

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
so yeah that's how you do a cliff and go

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.870 
so yeah that's how you do a cliff and go
out<00:01:56.000> there<00:01:56.240> be<00:01:56.510> careful<00:01:56.990> stay<00:01:57.950> safe<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.870> peace
