a buck he's back yeah I'm happy to have

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.340 
a buck he's back yeah I'm happy to have
my<00:00:19.500> metal<00:00:20.369> master<00:00:20.850> wingman<00:00:21.210> inside<00:00:21.930> me<00:00:22.140> yes

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
my metal master wingman inside me yes

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.839 
my metal master wingman inside me yes
I'm<00:00:22.590> really<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:22.830> wing<00:00:23.040> I<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.310> supposed<00:00:23.610> to<00:00:23.700> do

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
I'm really the wing I was supposed to do

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.429 
I'm really the wing I was supposed to do
this<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.119> my<00:00:24.240> own<00:00:24.270> but<00:00:24.540> I'm<00:00:24.599> really<00:00:24.779> lazy<00:00:24.930> also

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
this on my own but I'm really lazy also

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.080 
this on my own but I'm really lazy also
I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.740> he's<00:00:25.890> really<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.760> good<00:00:27.000> at

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I think he's really really good at

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.940 
I think he's really really good at
talking<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.360> the<00:00:27.509> spec<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.020> fiddling<00:00:28.860> with

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
talking about the spec and fiddling with

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.859 
talking about the spec and fiddling with
knobs<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.400> great<00:00:30.150> fiddling<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.720> knobs

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
knobs is great fiddling with knobs

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.160 
knobs is great fiddling with knobs
lottery<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:31.770> um<00:00:32.040> okay<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
lottery yeah um okay so this is the this

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.680 
lottery yeah um okay so this is the this
is<00:00:34.230> probably<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> best<00:00:35.040> named<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> motor

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is probably the best named or the motor

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.840 
is probably the best named or the motor
appropriate<00:00:37.680> names<00:00:37.829> where<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.430> why

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
appropriate names where it's like why

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.790 
appropriate names where it's like why
didn't<00:00:39.210> he<00:00:39.540> eight<00:00:39.720> checks<00:00:40.020> work<00:00:40.380> out<00:00:40.620> that

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
didn't he eight checks work out that

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.080 
didn't he eight checks work out that
actually<00:00:41.130> if<00:00:41.190> they<00:00:41.309> did<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> pedal<00:00:41.850> called<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
actually if they did a pedal called the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.210 
actually if they did a pedal called the
ear<00:00:42.239> checks<00:00:42.600> torsion<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.620> from<00:00:43.770> day<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
ear checks torsion right from day one it

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.200 
ear checks torsion right from day one it
would<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.430> been<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> Cory's<00:00:45.030> name

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
would have been like the Cory's name

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.340 
would have been like the Cory's name
pedal<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:45.630> had<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> big<00:00:46.140> muffs

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
pedal that they had all the big muffs

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
pedal that they had all the big muffs
pretty<00:00:46.620> cool<00:00:46.800> isn't<00:00:46.949> it<00:00:47.039> anyway<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.989> you've

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
pretty cool isn't it anyway so you've

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.779 
pretty cool isn't it anyway so you've
got<00:00:49.140> an<00:00:49.230> amplifier<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:49.920> home<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.489> sounds

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
got an amplifier at home that sounds

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
got an amplifier at home that sounds
like<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> really<00:00:55.649> want<00:00:55.890> to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like of this and what you really want to

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.549 
like of this and what you really want to
do<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> give<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:57.000> dirty<00:00:57.420> sound<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.320> lead

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
do is give it a dirty sound and a lead

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
do is give it a dirty sound and a lead
boost<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.059> pedal<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.570> that's<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.929> this

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
boost in one pedal and that's what this

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
boost in one pedal and that's what this
pedal<00:01:01.379> does<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.429> have<00:01:02.670> essentially<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
pedal does so we have essentially the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.360 
pedal does so we have essentially the
top<00:01:03.600> row<00:01:03.839> here<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.500> imagine<00:01:04.860> imagine<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
top row here if you imagine imagine the

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.100 
top row here if you imagine imagine the
top<00:01:05.519> row<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.210> drive<00:01:06.510> channel<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.020> an

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
top row just like my drive channel on an

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.340 
top row just like my drive channel on an
amplifier<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.250> choose<00:01:08.490> between<00:01:09.350> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
amplifier and I can choose between the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
amplifier and I can choose between the
low<00:01:10.590> style<00:01:11.430> tones<00:01:11.970> which<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.450> sort<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.780> more

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
low style tones which are sort of more

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
low style tones which are sort of more
vintage<00:01:13.320> martially<00:01:13.860> sort<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.460> say<00:01:14.640> more

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
vintage martially sort of they say more

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
vintage martially sort of they say more
sort<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> plexi<00:01:15.420> style<00:01:15.690> f<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.740> full<00:01:16.890> Tears

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
sort of plexi style f is for full Tears

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
sort of plexi style f is for full Tears
for<00:01:17.490> tight<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.899> high<00:01:19.590> mode<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.490> modern

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
for tight the high mode is more modern

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.969 
for tight the high mode is more modern
sounding<00:01:21.810> gain<00:01:22.079> II<00:01:22.110> sort<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> amplify<00:01:22.799> them

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sounding gain II sort of amplify them

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
sounding gain II sort of amplify them
again<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.369> full<00:01:23.579> or<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.790> tight<00:01:24.000> mode<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
again with a full or a tight mode so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.749 
again with a full or a tight mode so
what<00:01:25.140> we're<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.100> just

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
what we're going to do first is just

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.160 
what we're going to do first is just
we're<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> use<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> sort<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.079> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
we're not going to use the sort of the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.450 
we're not going to use the sort of the
lead<00:01:28.350> boost<00:01:28.649> e<00:01:28.799> stuff<00:01:29.009> we're<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.280> going<00:01:29.399> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
lead boost e stuff we're just going to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.690 
lead boost e stuff we're just going to
get<00:01:29.729> some<00:01:30.030> fat<00:01:30.329> tone<00:01:30.750> gets<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> bit

should we see how that works over a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.740 
should we see how that works over a
slightly<00:02:02.579> crunched<00:02:03.119> tone<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.720> just

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
slightly crunched tone or do you just

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.510 
slightly crunched tone or do you just
want<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.110> something<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
want to do something is that all of the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
want to do something is that all of the
game<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.970> game<00:02:06.000> boost<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.600> everything<00:02:06.930> no

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
game in the game boost and everything no

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.749 
game in the game boost and everything no
no<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.640> like

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
no that's just that's the if you like

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.490 
no that's just that's the if you like
the<00:02:08.880> rhythm<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> see<00:02:09.869> where<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.050> takes<00:02:10.200> us

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the rhythm you see where it takes us

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.259 
the rhythm you see where it takes us
okay<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> press<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> boost<00:02:12.150> button

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
okay so now I press the boost button

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.960 
okay so now I press the boost button
boost<00:02:12.959> boost<00:02:13.380> uh<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.489> takes<00:02:14.760> me<00:02:14.940> to

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
boost boost uh and that takes me to
