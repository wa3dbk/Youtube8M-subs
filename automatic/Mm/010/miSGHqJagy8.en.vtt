00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 nice all guys the other group 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.830
 of the saint adecco of this curious 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.440
 filmed the cm team as you can see on 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.549
 video starts starts tomorrow starts in 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.520
 medias res therefore in the midst of facts 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.720
 that is my intelligence 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.699
 yes we don't get along so well since 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.500
 obviously I had to stop the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.779
 registration and starting from the second 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.279
 time since I am a genius but details 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 anyway with regards to the first one 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.859
 match already scored a goal in the second 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.270
 time of course because in the first half 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 luckily there were no goals 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.980
 otherwise you would have been angry but 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.989
 obviously at the seventy-fourth like 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 if not by a header, then tie it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 really only game continues to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.390
 attack and a strong team not 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.309
 you have unfortunately seen it but I can tell you 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.809
 that a france with benzema nasri and gods 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 my players a little more important then 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.430
 others better the name and nothing the first 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.629
 game ends with the result of 1 to 1 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.059
 I didn't even have time to tell him 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.469
 who are ready for 62 and welcome to all 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.449
 in this new video that is the game 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.799
 of the judiciary and then nothing 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 we talk at the end of the vigor that is not there now 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.210
 then I'll tell you a little about what 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.799
 will happen in this video 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.240
 so after winning he won it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.799
 match the first game we go to 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
 buy a goalkeeper since there is 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.689
 need to force 1 marchetti sucks 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 in disgust and handanovic and handanovic e 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.780
 it can be a bit divide into two in 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.909
 play both from a team and 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.979
 in the other because he would die and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.439
 consequently we buy the only goalkeeper 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.090
 remained 200 true buffon perhaps there is also 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.259
 she was not worth the trouble now I had i 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.100
 feet for simple and concrete for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 buy me pure ronaldo however it is not true e 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.650
 so we buy buffon whose price 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.210
 had risen from 7,000 to 11,000 credits 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
 maybe now I don't know how long it has arrived 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.950
 however, I also always think 10,000 nothing 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.409
 the fact is that we put buffon 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.579
 it seems to me in the titular team with 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:00.079
 because in 4 3 3 it was indeed necessary 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:02.990
 precisely and nothing then in 4 2 3 1 in the 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.280
 nectar of course that handanovic e 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.049
 nothing we do other changes for 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.179
 then go play the game 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.930
 let's say the player in the game 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.040
 against which we will face will be will have one 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.260
 leigh ann 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.480
 not bad with mayuka who went by 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.920
 bpl legal also because I do n't know says 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.430
 a girl maybe we don't say that not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.450
 it is a team but it was not crap 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.110
 nothing in my opinion aside 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.819
 mayuka cavani who really did 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.739
 destruction of social enough however 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.970
 we start very well with a great goal in 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.670
 overturned with guarin 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.099
 I did not understand why on fifa all of 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.099
 pitches from midfield to inverted rows 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.540
 I did not understand but you have a defense that 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.829
 sucks for example in this case 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.519
 mayuka pad is all quiet at 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:53.090
 defense goes to butterflies and menez and with a 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.980
 beautiful shooting angle do goals 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.560
 of one to one at 33rd sending in 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.239
 ruin my expectations however for mine 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.639
 luck managed to find the 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.769
 advantage with a recovery of cuadrado 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.620
 then an error but still a recovery that 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.930
 I will be thinking of de rossi 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.880
 survive no will be part of asamoah that 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.560
 pass for campagnaro then campagnano for 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.030
 square square for guarino guarini yes 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.500
 drinks two players with his dribbling 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 guerin and show on this thread to the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.100
 passage for de rossi pallonetto search 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.569
 the reversed because I wanted signals 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.790
 overturned however finds the head of 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.010
 gonzalo higuain who signs the goal of 2 a 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.859
 1 and the interval game will end with 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.060
 this result 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.859
 we say that there will be no more opportunities 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.599
 or better if there will be occasions though 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.030
 however they will not lead to any role 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.160
 no blues the action there will be only 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.790
 those TV actions pass the shooting ball 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.079
 out 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.510
 but if the ball shoots out I can 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.920
 talk about nothing and I never remember 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.810
 I don't remember well then at the last one 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 kick punishment that made him come up 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.069
 the heart in my throat and therefore nothing ends 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.900
 with the result of a two if it is not then 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.970
 in my favor since I didn't play in 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.990
 home but played away from home and 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.650
 consequently good three more points 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.180
 for this division that I don't remember 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.390
 the name 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.520
 I think 7 Jun will be that I don't know anyway 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.230
 the third game also because this 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.180
 episode is longer you do not know I had 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770
 want to record games because me 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.390
 He was 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.520
 let's start very well with the 4 3 3 then 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.110
 with el sharaawy cerci and palacio with a 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.010
 great goal of el sharaawy on rebutted of the 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.450
 goalkeeper 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.340
 let's go against a Portuguese liga mi 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.200
 I forgot to say not too strong 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.650
 but still acceptable 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.450
 let's say the weather just say hi 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.550
 that to this adversary we succeed in 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.160
 score the second goal always with the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:40.770
 great is a beautiful palacio a 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:42.210
 great shot at around Palasio boys and is 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 still a great header 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.310
 moreover, therefore it could seem a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.590
 scrauso 461 player who hits of 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.480
 head a little though thank you palace is 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.220
 very strong to me but all right if you are 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.290
 see commons anyway from this 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.880
 postponement but now moreover that is there 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.130
 will be able to recover the palasio ball 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.960
 snap like a fury from you that numbers 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.060
 of the palace it is absurd they are tiny 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.330
 attention balloon number for vidal here 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.040
 from the cross race in man city ​​it is right 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.530
 Shooting corner kick, then configuration 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.030
 replied by the goalkeeper from that kick 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.010
 corner 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.150
 who if not behrami I don't remember the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.620
 name is perhaps victor sure and victor 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.930
 behrami be able to score the goal of 3 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.060
 at 0 so now bringing the game on 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.730
 a situation a little more favorable to me 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.410
 but obviously our opponent 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.840
 manage to score at the 32nd one 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.060
 great goal with my great 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.870
 especially thanks to my stupid mistake 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.300
 moreover it is here that you are looking for that obviously you 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.850
 put on display as always with a 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.150
 great filtering passage from da 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:52.490
 a part from new york 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.720
 we fall from new york in china here is that 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.970
 it could be close depends on that 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.610
 part think so and palace with a shot at 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.030
 around that I have a triple to 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.740
 quaresma will score the goal of 4 to 1 e 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.780
 therefore in the 45th year there will be 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.450
 the excitement instead is not because obviously 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.950
 I have to do the stupid thing to postpone evil 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.140
 and consequently my opponent 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.340
 being able to find with a passage 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:19.610
 also filtering from his name 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.050
 from New York in China a ragù some time 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.810
 it gives me a calm calm that doesn't make sense 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.980
 because he was losing 4 but details 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.290
 we continue in the second half here 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.910
 obviously for the ball and it was immediately 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.590
 very quiet a filtering passage 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.450
 for there but obviously jokes in ancient 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.700
 but to feel now with lively thanks 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.240
 buffon among those who do not reject it 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.460
 I would be able to reopen the game for nothing 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:45.920
 a calm colorful calm then I have a little me 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.200
 angry and with diamonds I find better with 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.670
 ogbonna too this great goal on 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.000
 diamond cross I made the website site 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.170
 but it was worth it to show it why 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.810
 lasted two thousand years the same applies to 

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.430
 palacio and finally with still large of 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.170
 diamonds that have a fairy foot a 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.780
 great goal of vidal or better than 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.310
 joke but we don't care why 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.720
 we can win this game with 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:10.460
 the result of 7 to 3 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.500
 we conquered these 6 no not me 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.120
 I still remember nothing the video ends 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.290
 here guys I hope I can be help 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.290
 magician that everything is beautiful
