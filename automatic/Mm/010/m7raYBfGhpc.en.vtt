00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.120
 a new tutorial recording on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.929
 our channel and that is how it works 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 this tutorial about a cow farm too 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.949
 this copper is very simple and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.300
 simply built, above all, she is very 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.289
 save space if you are not very 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.970
 So much space is so unintentionally 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.130
 As I said before, it's just one 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.800
 small room that can be three or four 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 blocks long and four blocks wide 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.540
 should that be at least how big you are 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.190
 it is ultimately yours to build 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.280
 leave this here is now 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.590
 smaller version so it works 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.510
 also very simple that is just one 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.809
 room with water in it and that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.399
 average for bold and finally 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.570
 You should not even be very heavy on the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.230
 Overview of all cases 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 I 'll do it now with 2 and this room 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.039
 with water is just with such a no 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 I almost said lava chamber 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.930
 connected 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.030
 that is to say to this lava chamber performs so 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.400
 I would have a blog big slit 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.450
 almost said under this storage chamber 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.530
 are a funnel 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.240
 The water is from the pictures 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.649
 stopped and the lava that is called the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.359
 Lage could not go down because of 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.850
 the signs and that was the water 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:19.009
 does not flow further into the paint so 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.740
 the whole thing really not the two 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.319
 Cows are in there when you then go to 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:29.179
 Example built a bridge or so then 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:31.340
 this could multiply with me 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.530
 do that with a spot now 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.439
 a little cow sports and then goes 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.479
 through this a blog slash through 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.299
 because a small ball must have one 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.920
 blockhouse and that means that can also 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.729
 be washed away by that at the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.810
 Great occasion they can not get through 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.489
 this little cow if that then 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.759
 is grown up to the natural 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.439
 a blog more big means she is his 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.450
 bigger I leave a big one now 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:03.379
 sports means that burns when the then 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.530
 She dies and the things are burned fine 

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:08.899
 init judge so the funnels lead to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.420
 the box and it comes fried immediately 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.730
 steak sam in the crate that is to say a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.000
 Another advantage of this farm since the cows 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.260
 be fried immediately 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.030
 I would like to demonstrate it again 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.040
 that means now there are three 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.160
 Stacks in it also let a big one 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.349
 spawn she burns again and the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.349
 things fall back into the world 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:34.099
 funnel and now are at least 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:36.340
 two leathers joined and two more 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.889
 steaks are even after slipped 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.209
 great that was it then so far with 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.359
 I'll show you the explanation now 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.739
 what you need for it as always stone 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.750
 or any other material 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.569
 water lawa judge doing and student more 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.660
 is that not really true then I show 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.590
 how it is built 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:03.260
 I would like to spread such a blog 5 times 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.049
 space so can two or stair big 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.609
 be on the side and yes in the 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.720
 have at least four blocks inside 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:14.450
 that means a total of six citizens 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.579
 so then built this room full 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.889
 all 42 high walls I mean 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.150
 in the front as well 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:26.539
 and then you put in the middle front 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.150
 Two holes in it is the transition to 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:31.130
 The la vaca up here could be glass 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.549
 or so after each glass for the better 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.549
 illustration 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.740
 so 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.660
 and lower or better said that 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.020
 ever get away from here then comes on 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.090
 the bottom on the bottom of the glass 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.400
 then come two signs each robbery 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.580
 or a sign forest on it keeps that 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.300
 Water and the lava can do that now 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.739
 glass can be placed over it and here 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:04.310
 below can now be the chest and the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.310
 funnel 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.770
 that means here comes threatened with it 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.000
 her turn comes like that 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.050
 here then funnel 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.299
 pow 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.769
 and here could be a rest 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.680
 also make a goal that goes of course 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.380
 I'll do that again too 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.490
 and then it has to travel again 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.020
 Here and here I will do it 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.110
 but one will also suffice that 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.630
 But then spreads to deco 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.590
 I 'll do both lava with it too 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 standing laves 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.510
 then the back corners are important 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.700
 just in the back two corners of water 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.080
 purely 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.760
 that flows then also at the corners 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.140
 That's why it needs at least three blocks 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.420
 otherwise it will not work 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.070
 that also flows so that is if 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.390
 here are if in the middle 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.340
 small gear so that's it then 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.590
 actually already then I leave again 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.970
 two coolborn 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.310
 these would then be driven there 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.070
 as soon as these are scarce as this time 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.060
 several tracks here are the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.830
 all after a short time then too 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.180
 then push yourself between them 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.760
 Parents can sometimes do something through this 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.810
 usually all take and then land 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.490
 island java chamber 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.020
 if they are then fully grown 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.430
 of course what I am doing to you 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.760
 have previously been shown that is 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:34.040
 the big cows are burning and here 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:38.000
 comes again fried roast 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.260
 meat and the leather out so that's it 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.290
 then to the tutorial 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.030
 I hope you liked it when it was 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.910
 I would like you over 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.490
 a positive commentary one 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.630
 positive rating or maybe even 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.610
 very happy in abo 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.230
 and then I would say until the 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.390
 next time until the next tutorial 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.390
 and shy
