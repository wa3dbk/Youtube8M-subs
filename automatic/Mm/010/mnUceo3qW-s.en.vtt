00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.330 

so<00:02:15.110> now<00:02:15.290> we're<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.680> take<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.130> bit

this<00:02:21.230> on<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> lid<00:02:21.770> because<00:02:22.160> during<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
this on the lid because during the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.060 
this on the lid because during the
oscars<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.690> half<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> way<00:02:24.620> she<00:02:24.800> didn't<00:02:24.980> have

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
oscars and half the way she didn't have

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.070 
oscars and half the way she didn't have
a<00:02:25.100> lot<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.310> color<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.790> her<00:02:25.820> eyes<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.930> was

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
a lot of color on her eyes so it was

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.560 
a lot of color on her eyes so it was
more<00:02:27.290> about<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.770> liner<00:02:28.070> but<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.300> want<00:02:29.450> to
