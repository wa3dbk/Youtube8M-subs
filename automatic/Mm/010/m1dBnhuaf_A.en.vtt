00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.150
 I welcome you with you channel elena and 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.860
 today I want to share a recipe 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.850
 cooking your soup 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.189
 it will take me literally half an hour I 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.030
 take a pot and put a few in there 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.380
 pieces of chicken with bones and I will 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.690
 now boil broth 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.619
 and then I will prepare the vegetables that I 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.710
 I want to put 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.670
 soup well then start broth I already 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.610
 put it on the stove and let it for now 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.780
 boils I think it will take half an hour 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:47.079
 so that the chicken was ready I will 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.550
 cook potatoes carrots onions with aloi 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.340
 I can't remember what it is 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.680
 in Russian see what's memory and of 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.280
 other components that you will see 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.360
 now 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.930
 first broth I'll add fresh onion 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.390
 not fried carrots and potatoes are the most 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.220
 the products that gave is said but 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.470
 notice all the soup will be mine 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.020
 brewed only half an hour for 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.009
 to keep all the nutrients in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.039
 our products 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.380
 here is my soup boil and I added 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:22.429
 there is a little salt I try to salt 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.340
 little and now I have prepared the products 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.700
 which I threw first of all it 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.630
 carrot onion and potatoes as well 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.780
 the queue will be 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.429
 bell pepper pepper celery 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.619
 sure it is very useful 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:41.780
 then I'll put parsley cabbage and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.750
 a little bit tomatoes nothing nothing 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.970
 egor her nothing to fry I'm not going 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.209
 then I prepare 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.709
 to the dishes that I served with me 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.039
 there will be dill and onions 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:57.679
 but also necessarily onion garlic and I 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.099
 perhaps I'll put only half and another 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.840
 half put here in such a mold 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.560
 which mimics onions and put in 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.640
 fridge for another time and still want 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.650
 a little bit so say your secret i don't 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.469
 I love cooking but unfortunately 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.079
 I do not want to eat any options therefore I 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:20.120
 I try to make dishes and who prepare 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.489
 quickly and at the same time that they were 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.370
 useful because the main thing in our 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.829
 age is health and therefore necessary 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.989
 think about what can it bring you 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.250
 health and so here I am 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.159
 continue bye 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.620
 the cutting is so small and I will cook 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.469
 as I said a maximum of half an hour well 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.189
 Well, I already almost threw everything now 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.980
 I already cooked soup and stayed 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.269
 probably put a little spice now 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.549
 let's see what we come out 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.420
 Well, I decided to put here a little bit 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.659
 carnations 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.540
 Now I tell him a little by sea 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:01.250
 then be basil 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.079
 coriander and a little oregano 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.550
 I completely forgot I have this 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.740
 a little 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.860
 Well, as if a whole set of different spices 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.380
 from here I will take more pepper and bay 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.650
 leaf here you see it is still bay leaf he 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.510
 called brilev and he's Turkish i 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.970
 a little bit 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:25.880
 shake let's say a clove a little bit 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.400
 That's what the point looks like this 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.260
 us we are his pepper I can slowly it's here 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 on top of this little thing with two hands I pray 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.060
 here's the soup already we will tie up the spices 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.610
 and now he still has 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.320
 brewed literally 10 minutes we will cover it 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.340
 lid let it stew slowly 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.800
 On fire, I made a little light and I 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.280
 now I will continue what will be 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.620
 after the soup 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.670
 I think our soup is ready and our bow 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.290

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.100
 I do not like boiled onions so we him 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.430
