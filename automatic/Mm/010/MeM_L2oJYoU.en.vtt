year<00:01:01.699> as<00:01:01.910> your<00:01:02.239> your<00:01:02.629> zoom<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.140> no<00:01:03.500> problem<00:01:03.890> and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
year as your your zoom in no problem and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.120 
year as your your zoom in no problem and
got<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.680> focusing<00:01:07.070> ring<00:01:07.190> at<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.399> front<00:01:07.430> there

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
got the focusing ring at the front there

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.850 
got the focusing ring at the front there
the<00:01:10.130> only<00:01:10.490> switch<00:01:10.880> on<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.210> is<00:01:11.390> here<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:12.439> it's

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
the only switch on it is here and it's

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.700 
the only switch on it is here and it's
got<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.100> full<00:01:13.369> limit<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.210> basically<00:01:14.960> it<00:01:15.350> limits

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
got a full limit so basically it limits

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.500 
got a full limit so basically it limits
the<00:01:15.920> amount<00:01:16.010> of<00:01:16.340> focusing<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.060> it<00:01:17.150> speeds<00:01:17.390> up

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
the amount of focusing so it speeds up

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.490 
the amount of focusing so it speeds up
the<00:01:17.600> focus<00:01:17.810> in<00:01:18.140> now<00:01:19.100> one<00:01:19.340> of<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:20.049> downsides<00:01:21.049> I

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
the focus in now one of the downsides I

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.249 
the focus in now one of the downsides I
read<00:01:21.740> about<00:01:21.890> this<00:01:22.310> lens<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.360> slow<00:01:23.810> focus

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
read about this lens is the slow focus

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.160 
read about this lens is the slow focus
in<00:01:24.409> speed<00:01:24.650> but<00:01:25.220> I've<00:01:25.520> done<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.479> few<00:01:26.689> tests<00:01:27.080> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
in speed but I've done a few tests and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.530 
in speed but I've done a few tests and
it<00:01:27.619> I<00:01:27.799> don't<00:01:28.009> think<00:01:28.159> it<00:01:28.250> is<00:01:28.340> slow<00:01:28.670> at<00:01:29.060> all

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
it I don't think it is slow at all

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.340 
it I don't think it is slow at all
it's<00:01:29.659> um<00:01:31.180> when<00:01:32.180> you're<00:01:32.299> going<00:01:32.450> full<00:01:32.750> range

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
it's um when you're going full range

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.460 
it's um when you're going full range
it<00:01:33.799> seems<00:01:34.250> slow<00:01:34.610> but<00:01:34.970> I've<00:01:35.930> said<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:36.320> before

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
it seems slow but I've said this before

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.550 
it seems slow but I've said this before
my<00:01:36.770> videos<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:38.390> reality<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.320> when<00:01:39.409> you're

my videos in in reality and when you're
using<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.130> lens<00:01:40.630> it<00:01:41.630> doesn't<00:01:42.170> go<00:01:42.290> backwards

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
using the lens it doesn't go backwards

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.580 
using the lens it doesn't go backwards
and<00:01:43.430> forwards

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.940 
sort of loses bank you bank
absolutely<00:02:15.870> no<00:02:15.959> issues<00:02:16.230> at<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.440> with<00:02:16.500> focus

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
absolutely no issues at all with focus

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.500 
absolutely no issues at all with focus
in<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.940> will<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.239> quicker

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
in so that's that and it will go quicker

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
in so that's that and it will go quicker
if<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.140> limit<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.950> between<00:02:21.080> three<00:02:22.080> meters

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
if you limit it to between three meters

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.399 
if you limit it to between three meters
and<00:02:22.560> infinity<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.940> then<00:02:24.209> becomes<00:02:24.659> quicker

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
and infinity it then becomes quicker

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.119 
and infinity it then becomes quicker
because<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.250> has<00:02:26.370> got<00:02:26.549> so<00:02:26.640> far<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> travel<00:02:28.129> so

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
because it has got so far to travel so

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.649 
because it has got so far to travel so
the<00:02:29.959> downside<00:02:30.959> well<00:02:31.530> 300<00:02:32.129> mil<00:02:32.569> ideally<00:02:33.569> you

the downside well 300 mil ideally you

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.970 
the downside well 300 mil ideally you

want to be shooting this at least a 300
for<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> second<00:02:38.430> maybe<00:02:38.610> even<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.420> would<00:02:40.079> say<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
for a second maybe even I would say I

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.199 
for a second maybe even I would say I
would<00:02:40.799> try<00:02:41.220> an<00:02:41.280> air<00:02:41.549> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> side<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.030> caution

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
would try an air on the side of caution

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.390 
would try an air on the side of caution
and<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.079> at<00:02:43.170> least<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.409> 5<00:02:43.680> hundredths<00:02:44.129> of<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
second so on a dull miserable day like

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.000 
second so on a dull miserable day like
today<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.760> instance<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.260> 5

hundredths of a second

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.140 
hundredths of a second
I'd<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.959> bumping<00:02:52.349> my<00:02:52.500> iso<00:02:53.040> way<00:02:53.459> up<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.940> know<00:02:54.090> -

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
I'd be bumping my iso way up you know -

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.880 
I'd be bumping my iso way up you know -
probably<00:02:54.780> 3,200<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.470> drawback

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
probably 3,200 so that's the drawback

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.849 
probably 3,200 so that's the drawback
you<00:02:59.370> know<00:02:59.459> handheld<00:02:59.940> at<00:03:00.180> 300<00:03:00.870> mil<00:03:01.019> it's<00:03:01.290> not

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
you know handheld at 300 mil it's not

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.240 
you know handheld at 300 mil it's not
easy<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.180> even<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> good<00:03:03.900> day<00:03:04.379> when<00:03:05.129> I'm

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250

i've<00:03:08.700> got<00:03:09.000> perhaps<00:03:09.269> something<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.599> lean

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
i've got perhaps something to lean

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
i've got perhaps something to lean
against<00:03:10.409> or<00:03:10.590> ever<00:03:10.799> then<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.430> may<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.700> able<00:03:11.940> to

handhold it maybe 250th of a second

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
handhold it maybe 250th of a second
you'll<00:03:14.549> get<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.720> know<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> might<00:03:16.170> find<00:03:16.409> that

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you'll get you know you might find that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.430 
you'll get you know you might find that
50<00:03:17.190> 60<00:03:17.519> %<00:03:17.790> of<00:03:17.879> your<00:03:18.000> images<00:03:18.329> are<00:03:18.480> sharp<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:21.440> it's

50 60 % of your images are sharp so it's

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.199
