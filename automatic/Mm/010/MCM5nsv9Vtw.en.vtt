00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.780 

as<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.560> see<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:08.010> am<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.460> size<00:03:09.680> 7<00:03:10.680> in<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.160> I'm

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
as you can see I am a size 7 in this I'm

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.550 
as you can see I am a size 7 in this I'm
usually<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:13.260> size<00:03:13.580> 8<00:03:14.580> 8<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.600> 1/2<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.200> even

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
usually a size 8 8 and 1/2 and even

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.760 
usually a size 8 8 and 1/2 and even
sometimes<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:17.750> because<00:03:18.750> these<00:03:19.050> boots<00:03:19.440> are

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
sometimes not because these boots are

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.330 
sometimes not because these boots are
very<00:03:19.850> big<00:03:20.850> for<00:03:21.420> their<00:03:21.600> size<00:03:22.020> so<00:03:22.410> if<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.100> buy

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
very big for their size so if you buy

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
very big for their size so if you buy
them<00:03:23.610> online<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.209> highly<00:03:24.750> recommend<00:03:25.290> going

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
them online I highly recommend going

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.160 
them online I highly recommend going
into<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.980> store<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.520> trying<00:03:27.390> them<00:03:27.570> out<00:03:27.720> because

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
into a store and trying them out because

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.610 
into a store and trying them out because
they<00:03:28.650> are<00:03:28.950> pretty<00:03:29.940> big<00:03:30.270> for<00:03:30.570> their<00:03:30.780> size<00:03:31.110> so

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
they are pretty big for their size so

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.970 
they are pretty big for their size so
other<00:03:32.490> of<00:03:32.730> some<00:03:32.940> counts<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.990> really<00:03:34.800> nice

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
other of some counts of this really nice

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:42.020 
other of some counts of this really nice
boot<00:03:35.420> yes<00:03:36.420> there<00:03:38.300> it<00:03:40.520> they<00:03:41.520> get<00:03:41.700> easily

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
boot yes there it they get easily

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.630 
boot yes there it they get easily
scratched<00:03:42.660> I<00:03:43.140> think<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.709> little<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.430> you're

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
scratched I think this little if you're

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.180 
scratched I think this little if you're
not<00:03:44.850> careful<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.480> could<00:03:45.810> get<00:03:46.260> scratch<00:03:46.860> out

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
not careful this could get scratch out

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.880 
not careful this could get scratch out
here<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.970> would<00:03:48.390> get<00:03:48.570> pretty<00:03:48.630> ugly<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
here and it would get pretty ugly and

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.600 
here and it would get pretty ugly and
not<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.520> very<00:03:51.239> very<00:03:51.720> minor<00:03:52.140> thing<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.709> noticed<00:03:53.250> is

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
not a very very minor thing I noticed is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.080 
not a very very minor thing I noticed is
that<00:03:54.260> down<00:03:55.260> here<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.920> sole<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.520> used<00:03:56.880> to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that down here on the sole it used to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.410 
that down here on the sole it used to
say<00:03:57.270> no<00:03:57.930> Laureen<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.160> goes<00:03:59.459> off<00:03:59.820> very

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
say no Laureen but that goes off very

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.630 
say no Laureen but that goes off very
easily<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:03.660> completely<00:04:04.530> gone<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:05.100> went<00:04:05.430> off

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
easily is completely gone it went off

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.199 
easily is completely gone it went off
like<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.360> first<00:04:06.600> time<00:04:06.900> on<00:04:07.140> one<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:08.370> another

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
like the first time on one and another

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.449 
like the first time on one and another
thing<00:04:09.570> it's<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:09.900> really<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.620> just<00:04:10.739> personal

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
thing it's not really it's just personal

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.340 
thing it's not really it's just personal
preference<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:12.090> was<00:04:12.330> like<00:04:12.570> -<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.959> time<00:04:13.200> to

have a different design a little figure
something<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.359> think<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:18.780> forgot<00:04:18.959> to

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.440 
something I think I forgot to
mention<00:04:19.410> that<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.520> ruffle<00:04:21.060> kind<00:04:21.299> of

mention that this is a ruffle kind of

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.300
