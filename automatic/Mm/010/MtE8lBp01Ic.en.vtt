00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
what would happen if it comes out and it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
what would happen if it comes out and it
just<00:00:32.009> sucks<00:00:32.850> well<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> all<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.410> this

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
just sucks well first of all for this

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
just sucks well first of all for this
hypothetical<00:00:34.770> situation<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.640> work<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
hypothetical situation to work the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
hypothetical situation to work the
reviews<00:00:36.390> would<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> visible<00:00:37.350> like

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
reviews would have to be a visible like

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
reviews would have to be a visible like
five<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.700> ten<00:00:39.000> oh<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.719> anything<00:00:40.200> under

five out of ten oh really anything under

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.450 
five out of ten oh really anything under
an<00:00:40.500> eight<00:00:40.649> would<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:40.950> people<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.370> twice

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
an eight would make people think twice

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.619 
an eight would make people think twice
before<00:00:41.910> buying<00:00:42.210> it

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
before buying it

before buying it
any<00:00:42.870> problems<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> initial

release<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.460> game<00:00:44.670> will<00:00:44.820> probably<00:00:45.210> be

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
release of the game will probably be

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.029 
release of the game will probably be
fixed<00:00:45.629> through<00:00:45.750> patches<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.800> still

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
fixed through patches but that still

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
fixed through patches but that still
won't<00:00:47.190> fix<00:00:47.520> most<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> review<00:00:48.420> scores

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
won't fix most of the review scores

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
won't fix most of the review scores
sites<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.770> IGN<00:00:50.280> update<00:00:50.640> their<00:00:50.789> review

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
sites like IGN update their review

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.639 
sites like IGN update their review
scores<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.600> games<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:51.989> fixed<00:00:52.469> through

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
scores if games are fixed through

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.069 
scores if games are fixed through
patches<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.059> review<00:00:54.390> sites<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.870> this

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
patches but not all review sites do this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
patches but not all review sites do this
but<00:00:55.500> patching<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> game<00:00:56.160> still<00:00:56.460> won't<00:00:56.640> fix

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
but patching the game still won't fix

word-of-mouth<00:00:57.300> people<00:00:58.109> will<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.289> talking

about this game bashing the initial

about this game bashing the initial
release<00:01:00.210> unless<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.899> fix<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.350> lightning

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
release unless they fix it lightning

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
release unless they fix it lightning
fast<00:01:01.980> but<00:01:02.640> obviously<00:01:03.030> these<00:01:03.210> things<00:01:03.270> take

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
fast but obviously these things take

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
fast but obviously these things take
time<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> problems<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.400> so

time and what if the problems are so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.000 
time and what if the problems are so
cataclysmic<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> patches<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:07.290> won't<00:01:07.830> do

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
cataclysmic that patches just won't do

the<00:01:08.159> trick<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:09.150> five<00:01:09.390> hundred<00:01:09.750> million

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the trick if that five hundred million

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.170 
the trick if that five hundred million
dollar<00:01:10.200> budget<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.740> true<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:11.549> Bungie<00:01:12.000> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
dollar budget is true then Bungie and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
dollar budget is true then Bungie and
Activision<00:01:12.390> would<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> ton<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.710> money

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
Activision would be out a ton of money

Activision would be out a ton of money
they're<00:01:14.640> probably<00:01:14.880> projecting<00:01:15.509> huge<00:01:15.780> sales

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
they're probably projecting huge sales

they're probably projecting huge sales
from<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> game<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.250> some

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
from this game but that's some

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.010 
from this game but that's some
high-stakes<00:01:17.939> gambling<00:01:18.509> they're<00:01:18.780> almost

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
high-stakes gambling they're almost

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.570 
high-stakes gambling they're almost
guaranteed<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> return<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:19.979> their<00:01:20.100> investment
