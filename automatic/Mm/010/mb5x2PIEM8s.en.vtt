of the bar surprised me with my lack of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.600 
of the bar surprised me with my lack of
core<00:00:10.320> support<00:00:10.679> from<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.040> lack<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.400> belt

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
core support from the lack of the belt

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.240 
core support from the lack of the belt
and<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.780> slid<00:00:13.049> down<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.230> back<00:00:13.469> crashed<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.219> the

attempted anything like captions for the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.630 
attempted anything like captions for the
last<00:00:21.350> six<00:00:22.350> weeks<00:00:22.560> I've<00:00:22.920> been<00:00:22.980> training<00:00:23.400> really

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
last six weeks I've been training really

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
last six weeks I've been training really
hard<00:00:23.760> without<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.210> belt<00:00:24.420> after<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.650> meat<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
hard without a belt after my meat and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
hard without a belt after my meat and
really<00:00:26.369> trying<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> bring<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:26.939> some

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
really trying to bring up some

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.820 
really trying to bring up some
weaknesses<00:00:27.570> mainly<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.140> positioning<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
weaknesses mainly my positioning at the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.200 
weaknesses mainly my positioning at the
bottom<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.429> tendency<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> collapse

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
bottom and my tendency to collapse

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.020 
bottom and my tendency to collapse
forward<00:00:30.779> with<00:00:31.650> things<00:00:31.830> like<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.219> core<00:00:32.489> bracing

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
forward with things like my core bracing

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.569 
forward with things like my core bracing
and<00:00:33.270> just<00:00:33.570> keeping<00:00:33.930> tight<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.950> my<00:00:34.980> positions

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and just keeping tight in my positions

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.400 
and just keeping tight in my positions
and<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.149> doing<00:00:36.360> solid<00:00:36.540> throughout<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> lip<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and I doing solid throughout the lip and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.690 
and I doing solid throughout the lip and
I<00:00:38.190> figured<00:00:38.610> what<00:00:39.329> better<00:00:39.360> way<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.460> display<00:00:41.460> all

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I figured what better way to display all

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
I figured what better way to display all
that<00:00:41.879> work<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.239> I've<00:00:42.329> been<00:00:42.360> doing<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that work that I've been doing and to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
that work that I've been doing and to
test<00:00:43.950> all<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.579> work<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.969> I've<00:00:45.059> been<00:00:45.090> doing

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
test all that work that I've been doing

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
test all that work that I've been doing
with<00:00:45.870> Amon<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.190> bit<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.430> redemption

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
with Amon for a little bit of redemption

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.080 
with Amon for a little bit of redemption
and<00:00:48.090> taking<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.629> same<00:00:49.020> weight<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.280> felt

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and taking that same weight that I felt

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
and taking that same weight that I felt
was<00:00:51.570> unfinished<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.289> felt<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> left

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
was unfinished I felt like I left

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
was unfinished I felt like I left
something<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.850> didn't<00:00:54.629> quite<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
something there and didn't quite get the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
something there and didn't quite get the
closure<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> wanted<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.940> came<00:00:57.149> back

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
closure that I wanted and I came back

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
closure that I wanted and I came back
today<00:00:57.539> told<00:00:58.530> myself<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.890> was<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> hit<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
today told myself I was going to hit it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
today told myself I was going to hit it
for<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> rep<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.270> did<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:01.050> right<00:01:01.170> there

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
for a rep and I did you see right there

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.979 
for a rep and I did you see right there
first<00:01:02.129> rep<00:01:02.309> went<00:01:02.579> pretty<00:01:02.789> easy<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.420> felt<00:01:03.750> solid

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
first rep went pretty easy I felt solid

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
first rep went pretty easy I felt solid
I<00:01:04.379> felt<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.189> had<00:01:05.339> completing<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> total

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I felt can I got had completing a total

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
I felt can I got had completing a total
control<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> weight<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.320> even<00:01:07.799> decided<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
control of the weight I even decided to

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
control of the weight I even decided to
go<00:01:08.310> for<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> second<00:01:08.939> rep<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.500> bit

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
go for a second rep I got a little bit

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
go for a second rep I got a little bit
psyched<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> way<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.790> just

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
psyched out on the way down just

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.149 
psyched out on the way down just
thinking<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.619> second<00:01:13.979> rep

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
thinking about going for that second rep

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.300 
thinking about going for that second rep
and<00:01:14.900> got<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.110> flighty<00:01:16.470> got<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> second

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
and got a little flighty got the second

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
and got a little flighty got the second
one<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.640> shallower<00:01:18.330> than<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
one a little shallower than I would like

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.010 
one a little shallower than I would like
to<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.890> overall<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.970> first<00:01:21.299> rep<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.689> its<00:01:21.869> own

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to but overall the first rep on its own

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620
