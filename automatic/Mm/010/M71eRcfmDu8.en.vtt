00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello how are you all welcome to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 channel again today we want 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.469
 teach her with sophie how to do these 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.240
 funny little boats with a few simple 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.519
 materials that we can get at home 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.619
 It is a craft that can be done with 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.330
 children in this case I want to use it 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
 to teach my daughter 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.470
 things that float and things that you know 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.869
 they deepen and this is one of the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 purposes that we will be using as 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.300
 part of our arts class I hope 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.369
 that you like it and if you try to do it 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.130
 leave your photos on the facebook page 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.680
 I leave you with the step by step 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 bye and for this cute little boat we are going to 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 be needing in the following 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.539
 materials a pair of scissors in the keynes 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 Elastic Robert Bends as they call him 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.360
 some toothpicks or paper toothpicks 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.600
 It can be paper decorated white paper the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.780
 that you want corks corks 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.550
 they can be what they are cylindrical shape 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 parejita or you can also use these from 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 these ways alternating the direction and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.830
 as last and this is optional a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.260
 little thread 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.120
 and good to make these little boats 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.159
 to need exactly this amount of 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:17.159
 materials we take an elastic in 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.350
 and we hold it this way if they have 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.319
 a son who can work with elastic 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.240
 Ines without this hitting the face can 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.600
 ask him to make them and his son this 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600
 He passed 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.730
 good 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.829
 with the piola we are going to pass it here 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.829
 and we are going to make a knot 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.409
 and then drag it to the tip 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.509
 in this way if they need to make a 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.930
 double knot and if you can not leave it like this 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.930
 as well 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.190
 ready to take the toothpick and in the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.580
 bottom part not very on the shore what 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.580
 we nail 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.770
 we go down a little bit and talk to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.750
 back we nail on the other end either 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.500
 not very on the shore and we introduce it 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.710
 until then, we lower it so that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.140
 in this way 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.620
 and we stuck it in the little cork in the middle 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.610
 our little boat is ready with the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.350
 viola let's go through here 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.350
 and we are going to make a knot 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.970
 and then drag it to the tip 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.040
 in this way if they need to make a 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.489
 double knot and if you can not leave it like this 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.489

 we nail 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.310
 we go down a little bit and talk to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.870
 back and we nail in the other end 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.180
 not too much in life and what 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.210
 we introduce up there then this one what 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 we go down so that in this way 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 our little boat is ready 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.909

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.200
 good to put it with the others 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.160
 fleets 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.160
