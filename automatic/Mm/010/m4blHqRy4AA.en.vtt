00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.609
 good wheeling and today I'm in a 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.300
 video to make a stone machine 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.300
 automatic with redstone in minecraft 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 let us begin 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 this is the third real title of red ton 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 what do I do so 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.430
 where will I get a tutorial on dynamite 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.450
 and I 'll start with the treat for all 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.140
 we have night 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.580
 how to process it from the command 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.580
 I am more purist I like the bed 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.840
 very criticizable but for our 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.310
 good colors 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.310
 let's take everything out here 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.010
 what are we going to need for our 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.570
 stone machine 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.350
 but more than anything for the base one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.339
 torch red stone solvent repeater 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.239
 red stone bucket with water bucket with lava and 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.239
 a piston 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.199
 those are the materials you've all already 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.330
 taught how to capture the previously 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.330
 then how can you get them 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.000
 well we need more or less a size 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 of this area much more if I wanted to do 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.049
 accounts 1 2 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:27.039
 and we need nine spaces 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.039
 7 8 and 9 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.860
 we do as if it were a circle first 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.360
 It will start like this 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 and 12 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.500
 12 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.800
 so much turkey surrounding this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.800
 the rest the same here 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.270
 and in 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.270
 we break these two and put the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.010
 piston is very important that it is 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.010
 looking to this side forward 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.560
 two 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.099
 and we are going to move on to the important 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.640
 this is the basis of our machine but 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:19.970
 we are going to need an automatic motor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.209
 the engine or automatic but then 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.860
 electoral standard as the video of the 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.860
 channel and the inspired plane to use them 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.640
 to do it you need to do this way 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.069
 of tea and break 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.069
 why a repeater in 400 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.970
 with a walk tic's antorchitas de restan 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 and we need a little something that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.660
 cushions 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 third for our 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.200
 and here 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.330
 3. 4 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.920
 and right now it has been lit and throwing 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.920
 the pulses 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.970
 but it is important that to have 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.170
 off the glass is activated because 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.650
 so we can do this first 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 let's buy style fill with something 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.260
 and then we fill this one with álava 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.700
 as the day of the failure 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.459
 is that sometimes this is with consent 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.520
 so look well I know how you have to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.860
 avoid these waters were broken 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.440
 Wolves 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.940
 not for go but this is not a 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.940
 shame all past 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.370
 let's go back at night 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.200
 and now we would go crazy 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.019
 it's all saying we need the backus 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.019
 well in cascade 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.750
 here we need something 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.270
 and what you're going to see is that this 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.580
 stone generator as it is a bit 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.260
 slow I've made it from two lanes it 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.590
 you can do only taking into account 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.830
 from here to this side or vice versa and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.940
 which fher of 10 meters I like and 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.940
 it would work like this 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.380
 every three hits generates one 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:33.680
 2 3 1 2 3 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.240
 and so while going to be breaking a 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.520
 column is 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.539
 a real take a little longer to give 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.539
 where creative management 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:51.090
 breaking the ground that's another thing 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:53.330
 part 35 look we already have 123 removal 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.600
 I'm fed up 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.310
 but I'm going to teach him 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.310
 it is important that you have a cap 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.349
 how is how it works 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.839
 the momentum but be slow here the 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:10.889
 repeated in four times it goes 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.889
 repeating in that warning 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.580
 while mobilize if the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.259
 sale 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.389
 if you want it also appears for example 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:20.860
 there was a payment for a network torch 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.370
 style the pulse in a case that could 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.940
 stop what will break is the lever 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.940
 way 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.330
 As you can see, it has limited power and 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.089
 You have to make it reach balls 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.740
 but here it reaches its terrorist top at 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:49.620
 final made the memory of our 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.520
 small 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.889
 this is your dowry 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:06:01.800
 and a power 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:04.199
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 200 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.870
 it will be up to a stone baseline 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:10.580
 for each one and as you see it is blocked and 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.580
 does not get more but if we start to break 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.890
 continue with your work as if nothing 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.890
 I had passed 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.229
 to finish the work simply 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.229
 we passed the machine and as you see 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:36.539
 and it does absolutely nothing else 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.539
 it's a bit without traffic 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.000
 you can leave us without integrating here 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.969
 but the unnecessary 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.549
 then without peeling to the maximum 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:50.169
 and this would be the machine for 

00:06:48.549 --> 00:06:52.809
 beginners and to begin with is very 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:54.879
 well because it allows you to have two paths 

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:57.620
 of another type is to fix with a peak of 

00:06:54.879 --> 00:07:00.169
 iron stone more than amply 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.110
 the materials as you see requires 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:06.800
 we even went through the neighbor by 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:11.509
 this you can do remove 2 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.490
 of recría 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 of losing of 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:16.039
 networks with contact up to a repeater and 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.139
 a plant two pistons that is 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:21.319
 materials nobody who wants to get and 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:24.710
 two tubes of water fasting therefore 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:27.020
 As you can see , space is very small, 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.529
 occupies nothing and has enough power 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.929
 can take out 24 stone 

00:07:29.529 --> 00:07:33.999
 if you leave it works the blow and 

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:36.560
 also as if it is replenished at a speed 

00:07:33.999 --> 00:07:38.630
 up decent 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.430
 only then this is all if you have some 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.500
 doubt in particular about how the 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.840
 machine one if this is what I'm going to put the 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.610
 how it is created and how the video is generated 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.410
 and lose the description since the idea 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.230
 it was not mine but he designed this machine 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.660
 completely like that 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:56.110
 Well I hope you liked it if it's 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.060
 so I like any you can also 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.220
 subscribe to my channel add to 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.410
 Favorites and any questions or comments 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.510
 you have to put it in comments that 

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:06.870
 be happy to answer it many 

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.870
 Thank you
