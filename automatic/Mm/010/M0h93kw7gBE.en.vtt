00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.160
 so today I am super happy 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.440
 to be able to introduce you the new 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.090
 austere world cage only for those who 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.200
 want to know about the wound that is leaving 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.849
 in fact it's always like that that I have 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.910
 wanted to call it except that my parents do not 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:22.759
 not wanted so he wanted rather 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.109
 machrek flakes it was a pretty name but 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.570
 that it was too commonplace and that it was 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.890
 more for a bad and low blow but not 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.029
 round to the eve well I wanted 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.380
 call him who quit because I know 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.330
 that I will never call flakes 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.500
 like that naturally then do not know 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.850
 why do I know that who is leaving is a 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
 very weird name that I have myself 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.280
 invented but that's how I 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 say it's peace so I'm there 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.229
 not happy to have had this cage 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.449
 so I have the senses I bought them 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:51.379
 with the money that I for Christmas so she 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.030
 cost me 69.2 something euros or 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.519
 more super happy moment to have it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.960
 found because very generally the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.350
 shims especially in bars 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.930
 pet shops 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.619
 they are just super super small 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.840
 far too small and this one is there 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.280
 the right dimensions who lived it 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 is another cache than the other cage 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.220
 cost 99 euros while I was playing that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.390
 this one was better so here is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.620
 what he lives with this task is that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.750
 the key drawback cage with bars 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.730
 is that we can put enough said yesterday 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.340
 while he's the bac I measured 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.020
 so even it does not show it is 15 cm 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.300
 so we'll say it's the minimum 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.280
 for litter for a hamster for 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.260
 that he can dig 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.000
 so here I did not fill to the brim 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.660
 bac not yet what the jelly there is 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.760
 a few hours 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.530
 so that's the skirt the time of the 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.450
 minergie and emit liquid in it 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.100
 so I 'm going to show you they 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.870
 suffer by turning like this that's the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.150
 lite is to predict that it is not yet 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.400
 completely filled but still a 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.700
 high level of what can really 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.010
 dig a lot 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.810
 so here I have not represented you the 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.900
 first floor here we are his dish as 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.300
 his crisis with a staircase so giving 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.060
 there is a little house where she can 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.220
 so sleep with handkerchiefs because the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.220
 cotton or wool is dangerous for 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.080
 the hamster sees the little pink house 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220
 so in heaven and ue that leads to his 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.420
 first cage but I will show you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.720
 after that litter c 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.849
 rooms which if she has a small ferry 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.890
 there is his land to chinchilla so that the 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.390
 container is pretty small i'm going in 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.590
 take another bigger but good 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.810
 for now I leave it like that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.520
 I have not found anything yet 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.450
 suited me but it's true that 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.349
 it's better for these big steps 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.910
 that they want to roll in 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.700
 but there they will still be in 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.730
 so its main here from another corner 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.080
 there is his bowl of water so I took the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.870
 smaller diameter also not 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.269
 that she can drown in it and I 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.700
 not yet had my bird feeder 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.989
 so here a pipe that I buried in 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.010
 hemp because he prefers to concede 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.209
 dark pipes here so there is I'm going 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 you take it out because I do not see it 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:05.840
 not good a bowl you can 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.959
 leave extruded so in fact is not 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.049
 a mixture these two kinds of extruded 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.510
 so next here she to the ruin that 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.739
 were provided with his cage that's his 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.510
 two solid plastic wheels 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.120
 so he has a small diameter so he 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.269
 I have to change it whatever I change 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.950
 the wheel below it has a tray so 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.930
 with a hole I do not know if you're going 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.870
 see 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.700
 that's if he thinks we see here and so 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.019
 otherwise there is its complementary litter 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.989
 so it's hard corn cobs 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.370
 so I'll try to show it to you 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.359
 we do not see very well so I think 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.769
 that she inside because she 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.269
 really love to dig in and then not 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.140
 Too much bother her from the kit get you a 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:58.459
 little corn not there it looks like that 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.810
 and frankly she loves it so that's it 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:06.859
 it was all for main rampage so 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.170
 that's like that so I'm going and 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.859
 close so if not regarding a 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.239
 opening 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.970
 it's really a big opening 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.130
 like that on the top so if not everything 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.660
 is in gray so there is the 15-bin 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.110
 cm here it's there for the first floor 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.490
 is fixed so it gets fixed like this if he 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.460
 there is not much to say that here a 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.830
 hole we can put pipes puts the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.759
 bites 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.629
 So here it is, it's in a room 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.469
 in the cellar 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:41.689
 so here without pipes so it leads me to 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.909
 his first cage because actually 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.499
 I had this cage connecting it like that 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:48.289
 through a pipe to another cache except that 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.330
 the spreads of the bars was too much 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.009
 big multijet son friend around for 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.939
 to reduce the distance you were lying when 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.279
 even dangerous she could still 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.319
 escape even if she did not 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:59.360
 so I preferred to buy 50 cache there and 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.099
 it's better for her and it's more 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.449
 adapted so here she has her bottle so 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.009
 the bottle is dangerous 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.389
 finally it's not dangerous but it's 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.749
 bad for the hamster because he wants 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.059
 really get hurt or hit and he 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.099
 is not necessarily in a position 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.330
 natural but I still put it here 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.979
 for them to have water if he has 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.619
 really want and signed once 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.059
 always drink in his bowl here 

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:24.259
 so here is my love having rowed to 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:27.830
 birds have not arrived yet so 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:32.089
 there she has a hammock so I have 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.009
 myself does it so here is ammann feeling 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.949
 which has an opening from above so 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.309
 there is the hut that at the base was 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:43.300
 a hut to confuse a lack with 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:48.199
 tissue slips inside 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:51.289
 here she has an extrusion bowl here she has 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:52.909
 another round and so the litter is 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.240
 still hemp is a bridge 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:58.339
 allows him to access the cabin so in 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.719
 done before she was not at all 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.979
 arranged like that they were between 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.599
 better arranged quotes but it was 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.300
 pretty charged so now there is the 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.259
 big hut the big cage during I 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.550
 prefer not to overload it 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.050
 otherwise I think that 's about everything so 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.339
 I will show you how it works 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.509
 all in all so that's it gives that 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:19.909
 also contented are running everywhere and 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.349
 dig around at times it shows 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.729
 that she tells me a rampage of the world I 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:27.740
 think and I hope so here is so 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:30.529
 tomorrow I could not see her it's not 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.889
 too much where she is but I know she does not 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:37.009
 not finally sleep brief so I'll do 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:40.699
 soon a video on the storage and 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:42.550
 business that I have for her so 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.140
 know that I bought the rise 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.110
 as for the veneers of mealworms 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:51.010
 that we have already praying and finally I 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.450
 will show you his storage in a 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.670
 other video so here I hope that 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.800
 this little video you liked and I say 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:01.510
 at pita point of kisses videos so here we go 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.170
 she is here I just learned our 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.710
 qualities in his funny hut so 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:12.040
 here she is really cute 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:14.400
 and she's not at all shy so 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.400
 here
