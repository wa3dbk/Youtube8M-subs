 nothing in a few minutes reflections 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170

 truth of a country like ours is 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.140
 They can export and export many 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.769
 things related to talent them

 researchers architects engineers 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.520

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 the firm signature of Spain in culture

 good cinema music now they arrive 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 also now they arrive now we find out 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.820
 of the churros something so simple so 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 simple as a churro that is made with 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.450
 flour with water and salt because it triumphs 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 practically all over the world and it 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 can circulate part of the merit of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.210
 this peaceful investment of the culture of 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 the churros is due to a small 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 Valladolid family business that sells 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.510
 the machines to any country to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.699
 any country in the world 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.050
 Belen Blanco is the daughter of the founder and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.780
 current director of this company that

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.450
 good afternoon 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 good afternoon afternoons and congratulations for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.670
 This 2013 example of where have you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.030
 made orders to start laying 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.220
 exit machinery korea singapore 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:25.220
 australia usa france denmark country 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.440
 a few still but the churros 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.509
 they had or are they adapt to the country to 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.830
 that are intended and adapted to the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.020
 tastes and in many cases they are very 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.670
 different from those we know here are 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.789
 very typical churros filled with 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.950
 creams and even salty there are things 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.630
 very curious in japan for example are 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.450
 very typical green tea churros that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.360
 they are made with a green tea style yes 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.789
 there are very very curious things so the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.549
 Basic recipe is like ours but 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.290
 then they can add what they call 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.530
 Sometimes stuffed toppings 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.030
 there is an incredible variety of flavors 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.760
 Companies that are specialized 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.649
 precisely in that in offering 20-30 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.050
 different types of churros when you 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.490
 they make an order besides sending the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.560
 machinery incorporate some kind of 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.600
 training course or debt of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.540
 learning or something and there are several options 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.120
 for this sometimes 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.819
 and customers can not travel to 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.400
 Spain and they are sent some instructions 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.379
 very complete other times clients 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.870
 they decide that they want to come and carry out the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.730
 training to Spain and here they are 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.069
 they give courses or also the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.390
 teachers sometimes move to others 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.580
 countries and teach all the staff of 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.170
 of a churrería so that later on 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.730
 from there they can start to work 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.890
 alone 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.110
 and how he does it and when the company is born 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.610
 and as I am how it expands the Kid 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.310
 who is the idea 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.470
 well then 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.900
 the truth that from the beginning has been 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.810
 exported because being a product 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.870
 typical Spanish they looked for although not 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.150
 there would be methods then like now that 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.560
 it's so simple online through 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 the chambers of commerce were put in 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.250
 contact with us and they were looking for us 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.819
 the arrival of internet after we were 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.269
 facilitated a lot 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.519
 since the year 98 we already had a website 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.079
 it was one of our bets for the 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.670
 internationalization so that anyone 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.310
 to look for a churros machine 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.749
 meet and from there has been 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.219
 much simpler has made us very 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:31.099
 easy because through the internet 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:33.139
 We are in real time sending 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.620
 budgets solving doubts of the 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:38.209
 clients then it 's a wonder the 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.959
 last order for example where did you 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.310
 entered the in the last order as it 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.459
 that one of the things that came out today 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.250
 it's for usa for us yes and it's 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.629
 pending to leave singapore and 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.219
 how much does a machine cost 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.049
 standard a standard machine I have of 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.669
 many prices because it 's pretty 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.439
 a lot broader than we think 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:59.540
 There is a very wide range of machinery 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.400
 for churrería from the manual machine 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.340
 more chiquitita up machines very 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.889
 sophisticated automatic with control 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 touch that make a lot of products 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.459
 different but from a thousand euros you have 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.079
 a churros machine is not a thing 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.699
 so inaccessible we have the feeling 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.469
 come the feeling or the conviction 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.799
 what industry José Luis Blanco has 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:20.840
 been and are pioneers in many things 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.419
 pioneers in technology 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.520
 in business culture at will 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.040
 expand I do not know if in the latter 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.169
 five years meant five by to quote 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.360
 the worst time you have noticed of any 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.130
 crisis or not so in our 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.570
 company the last five years have been 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.510
 those with the highest turnover in our 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.120
 world history with which then the 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.460
 crisis has not touched us fortunately 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.500
 It is also true that many were taken 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.860
 decisions before the crisis that has 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.380
 helped her cope with making machines 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.060
 cheapest little ones always 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.669
 within our quality line 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.500
 for foreseeing that a time was coming 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.479
 in which people would not have so much 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.280
 purchasing power and then then giving 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:04.790
 also a lot of momentum to the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.650
 internationalization and or percentage of 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.200
 business of a Spanish forum 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.960
 last year the statistics have 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.610
 given as between 40 and 50 percent 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.260
 that has come out of the year I imagine 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.169
 what white vélez will have as I do not know 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.789
 if you will have it but a map out there with 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.229
 thumbtacks in countries where you can 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.479
 eat churros from Spanish 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.120
 we could effectively cover all the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.310
 world eating churros 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.199
 in churrerías of our clients 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.090
 the squirrel could go jumping from trees 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.280
 with churros 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.600
 yes yes yes it could be done would be fine 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.810
 make a kind of gastronomic route 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.250
 by churrerías of the world and in fact we 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.600
 many customers are invited many times 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.080
 some yes we have had opportunity 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.699
 to go and meet them even to install 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.980
 some machine last year in new 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.810
 york for example we were 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.910
 and well, the truth is that it is a 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.440
 proud to see the map and see all the 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.080
 sites where we have reached a company 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.240
 little girl here from Valladolid without doing 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.610
 Noise because it is a pride how many 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.980
 people work 13 people 13 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.590
 people 2 with 13 people this almost one 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.180
 it's almost not a miracle if I'm in Spain 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.350
 that has a churro currently 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.300
 Well, the truth is that it's good 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.220
 I think it's a product in which the 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.920
 crisis has not influenced either because 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.450
 it is a cheap product one can 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.770
 allow to take a chocolate with 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.450
 churros and it is also highly recommended 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.760
 because it's a very healthy product and it's 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.740
 very good I'm that many people 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.510
 sometimes think that in which cholesterol 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.800
 is that it fattens is not true you are 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.470
 you are a very healthy product with zero 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.190
 cholesterol fat 50% less than 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.200
 cookies 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.450
 you have to consume south it will rock mood to 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.370
 the carnies in fact I look at myself 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.920
 I have it in front of my house 2 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.200
 churrerías I will not say brands 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.860
 but 2 churrerías in front and I called the 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.170
 attention the number of people older than 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.390
 age that are putting themselves up 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.620
 of churros you say that has to be healthy 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:59.350
 because look 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.419
 that's why they are that old in summer in 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.100
 winter at all hours in the morning by 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.560
 the afternoon is a is a I think it's a 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.030
 little the elixir of eternal youth is 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.580
 that the elders had the fox and 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.889
 also the Mediterranean diet and they know very 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.860
 well the lesson and they know where is it 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.120
 good and so go white drink a lot 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.919
 thanks for leaning this afternoon the 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.720
 window and really congratulations 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.610
