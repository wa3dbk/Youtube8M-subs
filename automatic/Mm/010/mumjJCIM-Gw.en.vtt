so the French they shoot a shop called

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.250 
so the French they shoot a shop called
the<00:00:07.320> pin<00:00:07.530> shop<00:00:07.800> a<00:00:08.069> lot<00:00:08.910> of<00:00:09.000> Europeans<00:00:09.540> do<00:00:09.780> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
the pin shop a lot of Europeans do the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.890 
the pin shop a lot of Europeans do the
Belgians<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.250> Dutch<00:00:11.520> many<00:00:12.270> of<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.480> Germans

Belgians the Dutch many of the Germans
but<00:00:13.790> it's<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.910> shot<00:00:15.180> that<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.450> think<00:00:15.900> is

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
but it's a shot that I think is

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.690 
but it's a shot that I think is
synonymous<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> French<00:00:16.860> they've<00:00:17.520> done

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
synonymous with the French they've done

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.250 
synonymous with the French they've done
it<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:17.849> many<00:00:18.060> years<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.930> shoot<00:00:19.110> it<00:00:19.230> very

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it for many years and they shoot it very

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.490 
it for many years and they shoot it very
well<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.520> has<00:00:20.790> evolved<00:00:21.660> over<00:00:21.900> time<00:00:22.110> and<00:00:22.410> it's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
well it has evolved over time and it's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.190

you're going to pull the ball in a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.470 
you're going to pull the ball in a
pinned<00:00:48.750> position<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> look<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.769> hand

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
pinned position have a look at my hand

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.119 
pinned position have a look at my hand
in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.690> similar<00:00:52.019> position<00:00:52.109> and<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
in the similar position and you going to

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.720 
in the similar position and you going to
pull<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.429> ball<00:00:53.660> across<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> goal<00:00:55.699> like<00:00:56.699> that

pull the ball across the goal like that
okay<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:58.320> why<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.339> do<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.519> shot<00:00:59.879> as

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
okay now why would you do this shot as

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.779 
okay now why would you do this shot as
opposed<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> pull<00:01:00.870> shot<00:01:01.280> it's<00:01:02.280> easier<00:01:02.670> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
opposed to a pull shot it's easier to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
opposed to a pull shot it's easier to
set<00:01:02.999> up<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:03.510> reason<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> pool<00:01:04.620> shot

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
set up is one reason with a pool shot

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080 
set up is one reason with a pool shot
I've<00:01:05.040> got<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> get<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.400> ball<00:01:05.550> there<00:01:05.760> I've<00:01:05.909> got

position<00:01:08.700> with<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.910> pin<00:01:09.150> shot<00:01:10.070> pinning<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
position with a pin shot pinning the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.590 
position with a pin shot pinning the
ball<00:01:11.340> once<00:01:11.910> you've<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> little<00:01:12.360> bit<00:01:12.480> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
ball once you've got a little bit of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
ball once you've got a little bit of
practice<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.110> easy<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.160> I<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.400> get<00:01:14.520> on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
practice is very easy and I can get on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.480 
practice is very easy and I can get on
it<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.350> okay<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.560> you're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.190> pull<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
equally you've got to see the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.510 
equally you've got to see the
differences<00:01:22.440> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.620> pool<00:01:22.980> starting

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
differences in the pool starting

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
differences in the pool starting
position<00:01:23.940> from<00:01:24.150> being<00:01:24.390> pinned<00:01:24.660> to<00:01:25.410> Pierre<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
position from being pinned to Pierre a

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.580 
position from being pinned to Pierre a
side<00:01:26.160> of<00:01:26.460> yeah<00:01:27.270> obviously<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> hand<00:01:28.350> action

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
side of yeah obviously the hand action

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.040 
side of yeah obviously the hand action
slightly<00:01:29.190> different<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.550> well<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
slightly different as well but in

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.800 
slightly different as well but in
essence<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:31.710> taking<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.670> ball<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.300> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
essence I'm taking the ball one way and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.300 
essence I'm taking the ball one way and
then<00:01:34.050> coming<00:01:34.230> back<00:01:34.350> playing<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.920> ball<00:01:35.100> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
then coming back playing the ball and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.970 
then coming back playing the ball and
hitting<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.260> the<00:01:37.350> push<00:01:37.560> side<00:01:39.980> again

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
hitting it this is the push side again

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.310 
hitting it this is the push side again
starting<00:01:41.430> from<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.760> side<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> goal<00:01:42.390> now<00:01:43.080> how

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
starting from one side the goal now how

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.650 
starting from one side the goal now how
that<00:01:43.350> shots<00:01:43.860> evolved<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.610> why<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
that shots evolved is why it's so

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.260 
that shots evolved is why it's so
dangerous<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:46.470> impressive<00:01:47.160> now<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.030> top

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
dangerous and so impressive now the top

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.190 
dangerous and so impressive now the top
players<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> world

some<00:01:49.470> still<00:01:49.800> shoot<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.190> from<00:01:50.280> one<00:01:50.520> side<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
some still shoot it from one side as a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
some still shoot it from one side as a
variation<00:01:52.080> but<00:01:52.920> many<00:01:53.130> shoot<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> from<00:01:53.790> the

variation but many shoot it from the
middle<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.510> what<00:01:54.720> they<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.080> they<00:01:55.200> walk<00:01:55.440> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
middle and what they do is they walk it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.240 
middle and what they do is they walk it
around<00:01:55.850> so<00:01:56.850> doing<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.980> from

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
around so doing this with it and from

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:09.600 
around so doing this with it and from
this<00:01:59.400> walk<00:01:59.640> they<00:02:00.450> can

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.010

we're<00:02:27.950> shooting<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.490> two<00:02:28.970> reasons<00:02:29.360> one<00:02:29.570> the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
we're shooting it two reasons one the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.010 
we're shooting it two reasons one the
player<00:02:30.170> knows<00:02:30.350> where<00:02:30.530> he's<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:32.020> they've

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
player knows where he's going to they've

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.660 
player knows where he's going to they've
practiced<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:33.800> hard<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.490> what<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
practiced so hard they know what that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.300 
practiced so hard they know what that
motion<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:35.420> something<00:02:35.630> they<00:02:35.870> do<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:37.250> a

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
motion is it's something they do as a

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.220 
motion is it's something they do as a
defender<00:02:37.850> you're<00:02:38.330> simply<00:02:38.660> looking<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.930> try

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
defender you're simply looking to try

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.170 
defender you're simply looking to try
and<00:02:39.350> be<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.530> two<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.220> those<00:02:40.310> five<00:02:40.550> holes<00:02:40.850> at<00:02:41.060> all

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
and be in two of those five holes at all

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.120 
and be in two of those five holes at all
times<00:02:41.450> if<00:02:41.930> both<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.350> men<00:02:42.500> are<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.740> that

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
times if both your men are like that

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.699 
times if both your men are like that
we're<00:02:43.430> only<00:02:43.520> blocking<00:02:43.910> one<00:02:44.060> of<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> five<00:02:44.709> so

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
we're only blocking one of the five so

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.620 
we're only blocking one of the five so
if<00:02:45.830> you're<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.100> to<00:02:46.160> move<00:02:46.520> around<00:02:46.670> that's

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
if you're going to move around that's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.060 
if you're going to move around that's
what's<00:02:47.870> making<00:02:48.050> it<00:02:48.260> hard<00:02:48.440> for<00:02:48.530> how<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
what's making it hard for how the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.520 
what's making it hard for how the
attacker<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.750> other<00:02:50.870> thing<00:02:51.080> they<00:02:51.200> can<00:02:51.350> do

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
attacker the other thing they can do

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.860 
attacker the other thing they can do
which<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.400> very<00:02:52.640> hard<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.060> something<00:02:53.209> on<00:02:53.360> are

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
which is very hard and something on are

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.600 
which is very hard and something on are
not<00:02:54.140> brilliant<00:02:54.500> acts<00:02:54.830> again<00:02:55.130> this<00:02:55.250> isn't<00:02:55.520> my

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.340 
the top pin shooters be able to come
across<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.980> ball<00:03:16.160> get<00:03:16.820> jingle<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:18.200> hit

great players they just hit that little

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.310 
great players they just hit that little
angle<00:03:29.870> from<00:03:30.019> there<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> there's<00:03:32.900> four<00:03:33.170> or<00:03:33.260> five

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
angle from there so there's four or five

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.080 
angle from there so there's four or five
ways<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.830> can<00:03:33.980> shoot<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:34.580> let's<00:03:34.760> recap

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
ways you can shoot this so let's recap

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.080 
ways you can shoot this so let's recap
on<00:03:35.269> those<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:36.019> can<00:03:36.170> shoot<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.500> from<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:36.800> side

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.660 

you<00:03:41.090> can<00:03:41.239> shoot<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.600> from<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.750> middle<00:03:42.670> where

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
you can shoot it from the middle where

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.470 
you can shoot it from the middle where
you<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:43.880> rock<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.390> ball<00:03:44.540> at<00:03:44.720> this<00:03:49.480> and
