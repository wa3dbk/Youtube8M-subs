00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.290
 Yes hello 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.830
 listener and 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.730
 Today I want to tell something about the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.270
 great effect of diary writing 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.700
 a personal experience of what I had today 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.830
 So I already write relatively 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.529
 regular diary but there is one 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.540
 few times where I do not 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:40.230
 write and such times were now 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 I only wrote a little and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.710
 then everything developed this way today 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
 that i will write a diary again 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 I have written with one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 great success for me everything started with it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.030
 I'll go back to books 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740
 had ordered then come today 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.700
 are 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.320
 Among other things, I have a book 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:09.509
 ordered you can see the power 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 Writing words as a profession I find 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.110
 I really liked the book 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.150
 only my reaction to the book was the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.280
 which all can do better than I, I 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 I suddenly felt totally small 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.720
 i thought i was sad 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.150
 He would also like to be an author 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 work or as a consultant writes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.370
 I have already made already forget 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 I then all my successes yes 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.290
 and I realized there was such a thing in there 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.780
 neck in the solar plexus where it completely me 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.549
 heavy and yes the tears came easy 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.799
 yes, then I had another one 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.740
 book orders that I show sometimes 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:57.060
 cure by writing 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.930
 yes I write it with the topic 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.930
 you know that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.180
 yes, when I opened the book 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.320
 I found 2 quotes on page 6 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.860
 I do not want to withhold them 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.210
 or you we were when I like you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.030
 better 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:20.610
 a quote from anne frank am 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 I still like that, that's what I like 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 I think and feel 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.440
 at least you could write down otherwise 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.640
 I completely suffocate 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.280
 she wrote that on march 16, 1944 in her 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.840
 diary 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.220
 the author of the book I just 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.400
 james w panel baker and was shown 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.250
 there was a quote in front of them in front 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.000
 and about his study participants that 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.340
 I would like to quote as James baker 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.010
 in the 80s the first studies 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.050
 Participants dip four to five times for 20 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.380
 minutes her deepest thoughts and 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 Feeling the worst emotionally 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 most touching experience in her 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.739
 writing life down surprised those 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.200
 clear results not only the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.320
 research community but in the 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.910
 strength of their effects even him the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.920
 Study participants had to be in the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.680
 less often in the following months 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.620
 doctor and were more positive than 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.640
 the comparison group yes there I have 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.459
 So thought out with my sadness 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.519
 out on paper and I have mine 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.910
 Diary brought in the moment I have here 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.540
 such a nice half as a diary even 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.200
 with bookmarks and started to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.940
 write 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.620
 I wrote that I'm sad 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.900
 I feel like I have pictures 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.030
 I make myself so small 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.190
 feel like a grain of sand in the big one 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.049
 the universe and me are the tears 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.470
 flowed while writing but it was 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:55.700
 a total liberation yes and at the end 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.739
 I noticed something is there 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.780
 touched by these books the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.160
 I ordered where I am in it 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.660
 have read 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.030
 i somehow have an event out 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.450
 a distant past past 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.270
 live at least I think off 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.070
 I do not know how you see it but it 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.739
 was very clear to me there is something 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.920
 what I experienced there are hardly any pictures yes 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.150
 that was already locked up 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.490
 because of something I wrote 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.770
 that I am enjoined from writing 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.620
 Sometimes I have something unconsciously 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.330
 also impose yourself 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.670
 and i was able to do that by doing this 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.470
 I could have revived the event 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.080
 that could also let go I say okay 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.130
 that was a reminder of something that is 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.420
 over now 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.980
 yes that is no longer relevant and me 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.970
 was allowed to experience it again 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.900
 out to find out what to find out 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.090
 So I did not do that 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.340
 that's why I felt this small 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.780
 I did not feel like writing 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.290
 which is why I was scared too 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.750
 maybe some things to write down 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.560
 in my diary who knows who reads them 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.240
 and so and I was so thankful and 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.070
 happy i have freed myself 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.070
 tears were gone I felt again 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.990
 big and strong i was somehow again 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.240
 with me, I'm kind of like that 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.820
 My typist brought back 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.669
 in my heart center through that 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.320
 diary writing 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.950
 and it just makes me happy 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.530
 I thought that was sensational 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.380
 So it's important in the diary 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.960
 really something to write something 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.050
 a very emotionally moved thing 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.240
 makes you sad or angry does not 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.520
 just like I often do that 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.740
 nice things for which i am grateful if that 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.450
 make me totally happy but 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.220
 Writing diary can really 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.970
 also help from feelings to 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.060
 to free 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.230
 the one burden and I think so 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:01.130
 wonderful 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:06:03.969
 yes that was already my thoughts for 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.219
 diary diary 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:07.839
 I wish you a wonderful time 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:10.929
 Maybe you buy yourself too 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:14.079
 nice folder and write in there if 

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:18.129
 it moves you and if you
