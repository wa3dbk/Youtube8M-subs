so<00:00:08.870> here<00:00:09.020> we<00:00:09.170> are<00:00:09.200> in<00:00:09.440> George's<00:00:09.770> workshop<00:00:10.220> and

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
so here we are in George's workshop and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.430 
so here we are in George's workshop and
today<00:00:11.030> I'm<00:00:11.210> going<00:00:11.390> to<00:00:11.450> demonstrate<00:00:11.660> some<00:00:12.410> of

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
today I'm going to demonstrate some of

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.260 
today I'm going to demonstrate some of
the<00:00:12.530> techniques<00:00:13.100> that<00:00:13.220> we<00:00:13.430> use<00:00:13.460> in<00:00:13.880> the<00:00:13.970> engine

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:14.270 
the techniques that we use in the engine

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.730 
the techniques that we use in the engine
turning<00:00:14.540> of<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:15.680> dials<00:00:16.400> for<00:00:17.210> my<00:00:18.110> wristwatches

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
turning of the dials for my wristwatches

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.180 
turning of the dials for my wristwatches
and<00:00:19.190> also<00:00:19.610> George's<00:00:20.180> anniversary<00:00:21.140> piece<00:00:21.350> and

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
and also George's anniversary piece and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
and also George's anniversary piece and
the<00:00:22.910> example<00:00:23.270> I'm<00:00:23.330> going<00:00:23.510> to<00:00:23.570> use<00:00:23.660> is<00:00:24.849> for<00:00:25.849> the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
the example I'm going to use is for the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.990 
the example I'm going to use is for the
Daniels<00:00:26.929> piece<00:00:28.480> so<00:00:29.480> what<00:00:30.050> we<00:00:30.230> have<00:00:30.439> here<00:00:30.679> is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
Daniels piece so what we have here is

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.610 
Daniels piece so what we have here is
the<00:00:32.000> background<00:00:32.450> what<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:33.110> going<00:00:33.320> to<00:00:33.440> be<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
the background what is going to be the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.760 
the background what is going to be the
background<00:00:33.830> of<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.760> dial<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.440> it's<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.560> piece

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
background of the dial and it's a piece

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.029 
background of the dial and it's a piece
of<00:00:36.920> silver<00:00:37.340> 45<00:00:38.120> millimeter<00:00:38.660> square<00:00:39.020> by<00:00:39.620> nine

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
of silver 45 millimeter square by nine

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.520 
of silver 45 millimeter square by nine
point<00:00:40.309> six<00:00:40.489> millimeters<00:00:40.789> thick<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.660> I've

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
point six millimeters thick and I've

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.880 
point six millimeters thick and I've
already<00:00:42.770> super<00:00:43.370> glued<00:00:43.610> it<00:00:43.850> down<00:00:44.090> onto<00:00:45.079> this

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
already super glued it down onto this

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.200 
already super glued it down onto this
brass<00:00:46.640> disc<00:00:47.030> which<00:00:47.750> I'll<00:00:48.079> use<00:00:48.579> then<00:00:49.579> grip<00:00:49.940> in

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
brass disc which I'll use then grip in

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.410 
brass disc which I'll use then grip in
these<00:00:50.989> focus<00:00:51.410> training<00:00:51.739> line<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:53.180> Rose

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
these focus training line and then Rose

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.160 
these focus training line and then Rose
engine<00:00:54.309> so<00:00:55.309> now<00:00:56.120> at<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:56.359> stage<00:00:56.629> where<00:00:56.930> this

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
engine so now at the stage where this

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.910 
engine so now at the stage where this
has<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.829> be<00:00:57.890> marked<00:00:58.129> out<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:59.559> I'm<00:01:00.559> going<00:01:00.859> to

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
has to be marked out and I'm going to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.819 
has to be marked out and I'm going to
mark<00:01:01.250> the<00:01:01.760> silver<00:01:02.420> sheet<00:01:02.690> out<00:01:02.930> with<00:01:03.680> the

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
mark the silver sheet out with the

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.770 
mark the silver sheet out with the
various<00:01:04.220> sectors<00:01:04.730> that<00:01:05.090> have<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.390> be<00:01:05.510> engine

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
various sectors that have to be engine

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.260 
various sectors that have to be engine
turned<00:01:06.050> onto<00:01:06.440> it<00:01:06.550> so<00:01:07.550> in<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.790> center<00:01:08.120> of<00:01:08.180> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
turned onto it so in the center of the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.360 
turned onto it so in the center of the
dial<00:01:08.480> here<00:01:08.780> will<00:01:09.140> be<00:01:09.260> a<00:01:09.290> basket<00:01:09.740> weave<00:01:09.890> puzzle

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
dial here will be a basket weave puzzle

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.660 
dial here will be a basket weave puzzle
and<00:01:10.630> then<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.750> outer<00:01:11.900> radius<00:01:12.259> here<00:01:12.740> will<00:01:13.460> be

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
and then the outer radius here will be

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.870 
and then the outer radius here will be
the<00:01:13.909> rose<00:01:14.180> pattern<00:01:14.509> for<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.560> background<00:01:16.070> so

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
the rose pattern for the background so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.760 
the rose pattern for the background so
I'll<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:17.270> just<00:01:17.570> show<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:17.780> how<00:01:18.049> we<00:01:18.110> mark<00:01:18.530> out

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
I'll now just show you how we mark out

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.440 
I'll now just show you how we mark out
these<00:01:19.220> various<00:01:19.580> sectors<00:01:21.939> so<00:01:22.939> for<00:01:23.240> their

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
these various sectors so for their

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.870 
these various sectors so for their
marking<00:01:23.840> out<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.170> dial<00:01:24.409> we<00:01:24.890> simply<00:01:25.640> just

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
marking out of the dial we simply just

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.760 
marking out of the dial we simply just
help<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.299> find<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.750> center<00:01:27.140> of<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.560> square

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
help to find the center of the square

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.039 
help to find the center of the square
and<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.670> do<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:30.640> describe<00:01:32.259> two<00:01:33.259> lines

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
and to do that we describe two lines

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:46.900 
and to do that we describe two lines
from<00:01:36.939> corner<00:01:37.939> to<00:01:37.970> corner

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.790 

basically<00:01:47.910> where<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.540> two<00:01:48.990> lines<00:01:49.260> meet<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
basically where the two lines meet is

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.620 
basically where the two lines meet is
the<00:01:50.400> center<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> piece<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.830> silver<00:01:53.510> so<00:01:54.510> we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the center of the piece of silver so we

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
the center of the piece of silver so we
just<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> little<00:01:55.200> pit<00:01:55.980> mark<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.580> there<00:01:58.340> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
just put a little pit mark in there and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.830 
just put a little pit mark in there and
this<00:01:59.460> will<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.760> where<00:01:59.940> the<00:01:59.970> hour-hand<00:02:00.330> will

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
this will be where the hour-hand will

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.280 
this will be where the hour-hand will
eventually<00:02:01.640> come<00:02:02.640> through<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> dial<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.240> we

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
eventually come through the dial so we

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.550 
eventually come through the dial so we
just<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.800> measure<00:02:08.660> mark<00:02:09.660> out<00:02:09.899> two

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
just have to now measure mark out two

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720 
just have to now measure mark out two
radiuses<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:12.650> from<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.770> drawing<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.460> first

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
radiuses and from the drawing the first

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.500 
radiuses and from the drawing the first
one<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.660> radius<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.260> 12<00:02:16.590> millimeters<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
one is a radius of 12 millimeters and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.300 
one is a radius of 12 millimeters and
this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.840> border<00:02:19.260> between<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.920> barley

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
this is the border between the barley

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.160 
this is the border between the barley
pattern<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.180> basket<00:02:21.570> weave<00:02:21.720> pattern

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
pattern and the basket weave pattern

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.090 
pattern and the basket weave pattern
that<00:02:22.770> I'll<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.430> demonstrating<00:02:24.740> so<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.860> doesn't

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that I'll be demonstrating so it doesn't

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.730 
that I'll be demonstrating so it doesn't
have<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.400> particularly<00:02:26.700> accurate<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:28.530> just

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
have to be particularly accurate we just

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.630 
have to be particularly accurate we just
measured<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.130> softer<00:02:29.520> 12<00:02:29.760> millimeters<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
measured a softer 12 millimeters and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:42.510 
measured a softer 12 millimeters and
scribe<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.820> circle

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.630 

like<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:43.970> and<00:02:44.240> then<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> outer<00:02:45.440> radius<00:02:45.800> which

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
like so and then the outer radius which

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.390 
like so and then the outer radius which
is<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:46.850> limitation<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.810> dial<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.380> going<00:02:49.310> to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
is a limitation of the dial is going to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.970 
is a limitation of the dial is going to
be<00:02:49.460> 20<00:02:49.790> millimeters<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.370> again<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.740> mark

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
be 20 millimeters so again you just mark

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:14.520 
be 20 millimeters so again you just mark
off<00:02:55.190> there<00:02:59.050> and<00:03:00.050> strive<00:03:02.110> another<00:03:03.110> circle

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.809 

and<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:15.980> probably<00:03:16.459> very<00:03:16.640> difficult

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
and that's it probably very difficult

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.120 
and that's it probably very difficult
for<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.240> to<00:03:17.270> see<00:03:17.569> but<00:03:17.870> it's<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.620> deep<00:03:18.830> enough

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
for you to see but it's just deep enough

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.820 
for you to see but it's just deep enough
for<00:03:19.190> me<00:03:19.459> to<00:03:19.640> be<00:03:19.760> able<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.170> see<00:03:21.170> where<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:21.500> need<00:03:21.620> to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
for me to be able to see where I need to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:29.780 
for me to be able to see where I need to
engine<00:03:22.459> turn<00:03:22.640> up<00:03:22.850> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.970 

and<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.360> there<00:03:30.569> we<00:03:30.659> have<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:30.959> very<00:03:31.620> simply

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
and so there we have it just very simply

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.270 
and so there we have it just very simply
mark<00:03:32.280> time<00:03:32.489> we<00:03:32.640> have<00:03:32.730> two<00:03:33.379> circles<00:03:34.379> which<00:03:35.040> now

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
mark time we have two circles which now

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.910 
mark time we have two circles which now
denote<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.150> limits<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.689> both<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.409> baskets

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
denote the limits of both the baskets

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
denote the limits of both the baskets
and<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.280> balding<00:03:38.640> patent<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.959> next

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
and the balding patent and the next

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.110 
and the balding patent and the next
stage<00:03:40.379> is<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.590> move<00:03:40.829> over<00:03:41.189> to<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.489> Rose<00:03:41.670> engine

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
stage is to move over to the Rose engine

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.289 
stage is to move over to the Rose engine
where<00:03:42.780> we<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.049> begin<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:44.010> put<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:45.060> rose

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
where we can begin to put the rose

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.069 
where we can begin to put the rose
pattern<00:03:45.569> in<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.440> sector<00:03:46.890> here
