00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
during Kenner's major run so this was a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560 
during Kenner's major run so this was a
pretty<00:01:19.830> popular<00:01:20.070> line<00:01:20.520> back<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.119> era<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pretty popular line back in that era and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.700 
pretty popular line back in that era and
it's<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.990> those<00:01:22.080> things<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.500> always

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
it's one of those things that I always

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's one of those things that I always
think<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.979> kind<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> weird<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.090> both<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
think is kind of weird because both of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.380 
think is kind of weird because both of
these<00:01:25.140> movies<00:01:25.650> were<00:01:25.830> rated<00:01:26.280> R<00:01:26.460> yet<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.210> had

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
these movies were rated R yet we had

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
these movies were rated R yet we had
these<00:01:27.540> huge<00:01:27.990> successful<00:01:28.799> toy<00:01:29.159> lines<00:01:29.460> geared

these huge successful toy lines geared
towards<00:01:30.479> kids<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.079> always<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:31.890> funny

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
towards kids I always think it's funny

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.819 
towards kids I always think it's funny
when<00:01:32.220> stuff<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.790> happens

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.899 

all<00:01:36.829> right<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.159> let's<00:01:37.340> go<00:01:37.460> ahead<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:37.700> take<00:01:37.880> a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
all right so let's go ahead and take a

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.609 
all right so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:01:38.119> at<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.359> two<00:01:38.539> figures<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.320> set<00:01:39.590> and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
look at the two figures in this set and

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.649 
look at the two figures in this set and
we'll<00:01:39.890> start<00:01:40.159> things<00:01:40.399> off<00:01:40.579> by<00:01:40.820> taking<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.509> look

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
we'll start things off by taking a look

translucent plastic so it's not

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.120 
translucent plastic so it's not
completely<00:02:47.299> clear<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.709> does<00:02:48.859> give<00:02:49.040> it

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
completely clear but it does give it
