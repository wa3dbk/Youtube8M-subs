00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hamburger SV VfB Cano for 96 Bundesliga 16 degrees 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.320

 strange Kenzie Alter the strange Kenzie thinks Dirk Hamburg wins with 1 0 0 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.979
 these 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:16.929
 a duel of the upper part of the table in which the fight for the international 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.929
 Table seats is performed 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.099
 Game you can die soon the thirtieth game day of the Bundesliga 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.029
 describe 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.329
 the Hanseatic League have the victory over the league leaders 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.080
 unfortunately deliver 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.610
 Munich while the new 6s again very safe in 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.230
 own stadium have occurred 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.809
 In the first leg in Hannover there was a 3 to 2 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.830
 wins the new 6 Series 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.240
 16 degrees 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.650
 Weidhausen Tel 15:30 the Hanseatic people are still fighting for the 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.520
 international league tables but when they are back from bad luck 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.050
 be followed as in the last game against Dortmund 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.769
 they will scarcely be their target 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:00:59.950
 can reach 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.850
 but you have to say that the hamburger 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.910
 Blame is why they do not win in this game 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.140
 but they have as the equalizer in injury time 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.230
 They have known that she has turned their backs on luck 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.840
 was the main culprit for this draw because he was twelve minutes before the game 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.340
 Finally got the red card and allowed the guests additional 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.740
 To make pressure 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.150
 but anyway, that's the fact 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.490
 is that they have skipped two points 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.240
 the Hanseatic League have shown a very good game in this match and if 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.810
 she one 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.899
 similar game against the new 6er then deliver 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.950
 this time around that 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.010
 Not have to fear result 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.170
 they have not suffered a defeat for three rounds 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.270
 the last defeat was conceded in the alliance-arena as 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.620
 a real debacle 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.740
 have lived 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.200
 After that, the new coach was signed 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 after his arrival, this team from the north of Germany is the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.860
 Newborn and some excellent individual 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.270
 We finally started working very well as a team 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.349
 however, half the time knows if they want them in the next 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.810
 season 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.530
 the probe on the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.229
 international stage 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.969
 they are just a few points behind Mainz and Numberger 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.069
 and this residue is definitely recoverable 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:30.869
 Fortunately, they have not had to deal with the injuries lately 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.609
 fight and so becomes in the meeting with the new 6er only the locked 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.249
 ben-hatira will fail 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.049
 Jansen will step in instead of him 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.500
 as the team should remain unchanged compared to the last game 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.370
 Attack should be led by Petric and van Nistelrooy during 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.650
 the recovering Mathijsen from the bank is expected to start 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.040
 list 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.729
 Position Hamburg BroÃŸ 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:03:00.009
 Diekmeier Kalkar Westermann Aluko Jarolim 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:02.200
 Elijah Zorro Bertok Janssen 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.180
 Petrik Juan is ready the new 6's are in the last ten rounds 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.600
 undefeated farmer but only because they play at home 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.959
 the guest appearances are something completely different 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.159
 In the last five rounds they have won at home while in the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.589
 Distant defeats 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:24.959
 the last draw was recorded on matchday 22 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.909
 the fact that they are the best home team in the league has them 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.199
 in third place in the 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.899
 11 percent brought 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:37.489
 the Munich are hot on their heels and aware of them 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.589
 but it will stay in third place until the end of the season 

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:46.529
 the European League is for sure 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:51.099
 so Bayern fight they need to improve their game in the distance because it is in 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.439
 the last two matches very much 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.369
 in Cologne they have a 4 to 0 defeat 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:01.989
 cashed while they were defeated in Dortmund with 4 to 1 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.219
 They played at home on the final day of the match where they played 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.279
 creates from Mainz with 2 to 0 have defeated 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.349
 very important for a team that has no wide spare bench available 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.489
 that they have no problems with the injuries 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.930
 So the new 6s will come and go in the strongest cast 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.930
 Elbers attention should be paid to the great scorer Ya Konan 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.419
 13 times in this 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.590
 strangely shot lying 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.090
 expected installation 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.760
 Position Hannover Zieler I would have lied Hattingen Pogatetz 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.029
 Blacksmith Bach Pinto 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.460
 agreed 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.180
 Abdellaoue Jan Koller NASA 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.780
 It is difficult to expect that the new 6s will be in this encounter 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.080
 will end negative outward series 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.309
 somehow it seems 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:55.360
 Watch as if the hamburger found the right shape and they need it 

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:59.269
 the points because those on the international stage to be active 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:00.169
 want 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.280
 the new 6s have already become the international table places 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.429
 secured and probably they themselves do not believe that 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.969
 Persons who will stand in the table in front of Bayern
