00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
know what's a mess in here and I think

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.650 
know what's a mess in here and I think
it's<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.940> story<00:04:29.940> thing<00:04:30.510> or

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
something it's pretty cool so now we

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.360 
something it's pretty cool so now we
could<00:04:33.960> PC<00:04:34.380> contents<00:04:34.650> though<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:37.190> think<00:04:38.190> it's

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
could PC contents though and think it's

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.520 
could PC contents though and think it's
how<00:04:38.820> you<00:04:38.880> make<00:04:39.060> your<00:04:39.210> own<00:04:39.270> paper<00:04:39.630> craft<00:04:40.140> things

that<00:04:54.090> gets<00:04:54.270> not<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:54.990> guess<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> same<00:04:55.590> he<00:04:55.950> has<00:04:55.980> a

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
that gets not I guess the same he has a

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.710 
that gets not I guess the same he has a
different<00:04:56.550> one<00:04:56.670> it's<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.180> other<00:04:57.330> ones<00:04:57.510> like

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
different one it's the other ones like

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.810 
different one it's the other ones like
walls<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.380> then<00:04:58.470> this<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.800> has<00:04:58.890> Geralt<00:04:59.580> of

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
walls and then this one has Geralt of

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.460 
walls and then this one has Geralt of
Rivia<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.310> maybe<00:05:02.310> a<00:05:02.460> give<00:05:02.850> you

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
Rivia on it so it is maybe a give you

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.540 
Rivia on it so it is maybe a give you
instructions<00:05:04.470> on<00:05:04.620> but<00:05:04.920> maybe<00:05:05.070> it's<00:05:05.220> not<00:05:05.370> that

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
instructions on but maybe it's not that

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.720 
instructions on but maybe it's not that
hard<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.910> fit<00:05:06.210> and<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:07.470> know<00:05:07.590> trader<00:05:07.920> me<00:05:08.700> a
