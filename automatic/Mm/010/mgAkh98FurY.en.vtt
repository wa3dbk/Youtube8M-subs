how much time we're doing but I lost the
halfway<00:02:01.820> between<00:02:02.119> consciousness<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.310> there

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
halfway between consciousness and there

so<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.820> know<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.300> make<00:02:05.750> mistake<00:02:06.320> Verena

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so I know that make mistake Verena

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.530 
so I know that make mistake Verena
that's<00:02:08.090> type<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.510> better<00:02:08.840> be<00:02:09.020> softer<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.540> then

that's type of better be softer and then

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's type of better be softer and then
