bringing<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.219> up<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.729> property<00:01:35.909> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
bringing them up to the property because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.950 
bringing them up to the property because
this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.780> maybe<00:01:37.079> 150<00:01:38.039> yards<00:01:38.520> south<00:01:38.789> of

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
this is like maybe 150 yards south of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.070 
this is like maybe 150 yards south of
where<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.140> spot<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> what

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
where my spot is so this is what

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.960 
where my spot is so this is what
we're<00:01:43.680> pulling<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.760> is<00:01:44.940> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
we're pulling out right here this is a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.470 
we're pulling out right here this is a
green<00:01:45.210> gauge<00:01:45.510> plum

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.040 

and<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:51.230> is<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:52.120> European<00:01:53.120> pair<00:01:53.390> one<00:01:53.870> of<00:01:53.990> the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
and this is a European pair one of the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.100 
and this is a European pair one of the
pairs<00:01:54.260> is<00:01:54.440> called<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.710> key<00:01:54.920> for<00:01:55.160> pair<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
pairs is called a key for pair so the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.600 
pairs is called a key for pair so the
Sao<00:01:57.260> Paulo<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.680> is<00:01:57.800> definitely<00:01:58.160> more<00:01:58.280> Hardy

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
Sao Paulo this is definitely more Hardy

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:14.699 
Sao Paulo this is definitely more Hardy
than<00:01:58.760> this<00:01:58.850> one<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.330> we'll<00:01:59.780> plan<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.350> up<00:02:00.650> there

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.750 

and<00:02:15.709> I'm<00:02:15.769> wondering<00:02:15.950> if<00:02:16.189> people<00:02:16.430> watching

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and I'm wondering if people watching

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.610 
and I'm wondering if people watching
this<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:16.970> gonna<00:02:17.090> are<00:02:17.780> gonna<00:02:17.900> say<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.439> oh

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
this is gonna are gonna say like oh

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.050 
this is gonna are gonna say like oh
there<00:02:18.920> should<00:02:19.069> be<00:02:19.189> like<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.370> massive<00:02:19.670> root

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
there should be like a massive root

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.449 
there should be like a massive root
clump<00:02:20.390> around<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.930> or<00:02:21.349> these<00:02:21.980> trees<00:02:22.400> are

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
clump around this or these trees are

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.850 
clump around this or these trees are
gonna<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.849> sha<00:02:23.170> but<00:02:24.170> this<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.439> the<00:02:24.560> way<00:02:24.680> that

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
gonna be sha but this is the way that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.229 
gonna be sha but this is the way that
they<00:02:24.980> ship<00:02:25.189> it<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:25.879> is<00:02:26.060> like<00:02:26.209> a

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
they ship it to you and this is like a

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.089 
they ship it to you and this is like a
good<00:02:26.450> organic<00:02:26.750> nursery<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.590> they<00:02:27.769> ship<00:02:28.010> them

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
good organic nursery and they ship them

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.589 
good organic nursery and they ship them
this<00:02:28.250> way<00:02:28.430> because<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.819> think<00:02:28.939> they<00:02:29.180> realize

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
this way because I think they realize

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.660 
this way because I think they realize
that<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.500> trees<00:02:30.739> are<00:02:30.920> pretty<00:02:31.069> strong<00:02:31.430> and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
that the trees are pretty strong and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.910 
that the trees are pretty strong and
they're<00:02:31.760> able<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:32.030> survive<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:33.319> it's<00:02:33.709> just

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
they're able to survive and it's just

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500 
they're able to survive and it's just
maybe<00:02:34.190> with<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.579> whole<00:02:34.760> shipping<00:02:35.000> issue<00:02:35.239> it's

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
maybe with the whole shipping issue it's

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.180 
maybe with the whole shipping issue it's
just<00:02:35.659> too<00:02:35.780> heavy<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.170> ship<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.650> soil<00:02:36.950> I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
just too heavy to ship all that soil I

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.309 
just too heavy to ship all that soil I
don't<00:02:37.340> know<00:02:37.430> but<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.510> how<00:02:38.720> they<00:02:38.840> come<00:02:39.079> and

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
don't know but this is how they come and

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.899 
don't know but this is how they come and
I<00:02:39.379> guess<00:02:39.590> people<00:02:40.069> are<00:02:40.099> usually<00:02:40.370> pretty<00:02:40.459> happy

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
I guess people are usually pretty happy

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:57.330 
I guess people are usually pretty happy
with<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.510> we're<00:02:42.260> gonna<00:02:42.409> see<00:02:42.560> what<00:02:42.709> happens

$90 and so we're just gonna spread them
around<00:05:03.490> here<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:06.300> would<00:05:07.300> say<00:05:07.420> almost<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.780> like

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
do the peat moss first and then put it

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.480 
do the peat moss first and then put it
on<00:05:24.450> top<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.930> then<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.530> let<00:05:25.590> mix<00:05:26.040> as<00:05:26.220> long<00:05:26.370> as

on top and then just let mix as long as
its<00:05:26.610> moist<00:05:26.850> then<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.600> worms<00:05:27.780> can<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.140> climb

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
its moist then the worms can just climb

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.920 
its moist then the worms can just climb
right<00:05:28.350> in<00:05:28.560> we<00:05:29.310> have<00:05:29.400> also<00:05:29.790> poised<00:05:30.240> room<00:05:30.540> I

would highly recommend leaves if you
have<00:05:32.970> them<00:05:33.120> on<00:05:33.240> hand<00:05:33.270> right<00:05:33.840> now<00:05:33.870> we're<00:05:34.110> going
