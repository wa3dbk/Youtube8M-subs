don't have the right staff in place to
do<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.039> I'm<00:00:35.489> primarily<00:00:35.730> focused<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
do that and I'm primarily focused on the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.779 
do that and I'm primarily focused on the
SMB<00:00:36.960> type<00:00:37.230> market<00:00:37.649> here<00:00:37.800> where<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
SMB type market here where you have you

SMB type market here where you have you
no<00:00:38.910> less<00:00:39.090> than<00:00:39.120> eight<00:00:39.329> cameras<00:00:39.809> or<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
no less than eight cameras or or so and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
no less than eight cameras or or so and
we're<00:00:41.760> trying<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.090> target<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> new

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
we're trying to target that with a new

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.650 
we're trying to target that with a new
solution<00:00:43.129> which<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.160> cloud-based<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
solution which is cloud-based and the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
solution which is cloud-based and the
bottom<00:00:45.780> line<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.199> we<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:47.280> deploy

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bottom line is that we can deploy

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
bottom line is that we can deploy
cameras<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> small<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:49.829> omega

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
storage devices which are of course much

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
storage devices which are of course much
cheaper<00:00:52.829> than<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> MV<00:00:53.399> oz<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> dvrs<00:00:54.090> they

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
cheaper than the MV oz and dvrs they

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.470 
cheaper than the MV oz and dvrs they

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
video surveillance in an SMB environment

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.660 
video surveillance in an SMB environment
up<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.140> an<00:01:10.229> enterprise-class<00:01:10.670> video

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
up to an enterprise-class video

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.890 
up to an enterprise-class video
surveillance<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.240> let<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.420> just<00:01:12.570> show<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.720> how

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
surveillance so let me just show you how

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
surveillance so let me just show you how
it<00:01:12.990> works<00:01:13.220> additionally<00:01:14.220> deploy<00:01:14.490> cameras

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
it works additionally deploy cameras

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.590 
it works additionally deploy cameras
like<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.229> box<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.490> well<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:18.329> local

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
like this a box as well for local

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
like this a box as well for local
storage<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.650> dual<00:01:19.860> stream<00:01:20.159> from<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
storage and we dual stream from the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.179 
storage and we dual stream from the
cameras<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> both<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.110> local<00:01:22.259> storage<00:01:22.680> if's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
cameras to both the local storage if's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280 
cameras to both the local storage if's
platform<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.880> well<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.270> into<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> cloud<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
platform as well as into the cloud and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.899 
platform as well as into the cloud and
the<00:01:25.320> purpose<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.250> local<00:01:26.520> storage<00:01:26.729> is

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the purpose for the local storage is

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.179 
the purpose for the local storage is
twofold<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.770> an<00:01:28.920> internet

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
twofold one when you have an internet

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.300 
twofold one when you have an internet
issue<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:31.259> longer<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:31.680> access<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
issue and no longer have access to the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.889 
issue and no longer have access to the
internet<00:01:32.670> you're<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.689> still

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
internet you're going to want to still

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.149 
internet you're going to want to still
have<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.170> video<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.649> you<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> local

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
have that video so you need a local

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.520 
have that video so you need a local
storage<00:01:35.520> box<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.420> actually<00:01:36.720> store<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.200> video

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
storage box to actually store that video

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
storage box to actually store that video
but<00:01:38.280> there's<00:01:38.430> another<00:01:38.490> reason<00:01:39.270> why<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> want

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
but there's another reason why you want

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.660 
but there's another reason why you want
that<00:01:39.960> local<00:01:40.350> box<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.100> really<00:01:41.250> gets<00:01:41.430> sort

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that local box and it really gets sort

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.850 
that local box and it really gets sort
of<00:01:41.700> time<00:01:41.970> value<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> data<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> video

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
of time value of data and so the video

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.080 
of time value of data and so the video
surveillance<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.520> creating<00:01:44.670> right

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
surveillance that we're creating right

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
surveillance that we're creating right
now<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.570> more<00:01:46.290> important<00:01:46.799> than<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> video

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
now is more important than the video

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.609 
now is more important than the video
surveillance<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.909> general<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.899> was<00:01:49.079> created

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
surveillance in general that was created

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.399 
surveillance in general that was created
say<00:01:50.009> six<00:01:50.280> months<00:01:50.520> ago<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.689> your<00:01:52.020> store<00:01:52.380> is

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
say six months ago so if your store is

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.929 
say six months ago so if your store is
being<00:01:52.649> robbed<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.310> an<00:01:53.430> instrument<00:01:53.820> has

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
being robbed or an instrument has

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789 
being robbed or an instrument has
happened<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.479> store<00:01:54.719> you<00:01:55.439> typically

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
happened at your store you typically

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.410 
happened at your store you typically
know<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.310> happening<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.180> want

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
know that's happening and so you want

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
know that's happening and so you want
that<00:01:57.570> video<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> highest<00:01:58.289> frame<00:01:58.680> rate<00:01:58.860> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
that video at the highest frame rate and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.490 
that video at the highest frame rate and
highest<00:01:59.310> quality<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.320> want

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
highest quality that you can so you want

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.749 
highest quality that you can so you want
to<00:02:01.560> put<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> these<00:02:02.009> boxes<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.610> which

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
to put one of these boxes in there which

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.100 
to put one of these boxes in there which
is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.880> very<00:02:03.030> low<00:02:03.270> cost<00:02:03.479> few<00:02:03.840> hundreds<00:02:04.110> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
is a very low cost few hundreds of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
is a very low cost few hundreds of
dollars<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:05.189> terabytes<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.729> storage<00:02:05.789> that's

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
dollars with terabytes of storage that's

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.610 
dollars with terabytes of storage that's
mirrored<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
mirrored and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.800 
mirrored and
you<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.369> access<00:02:08.820> to<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:08.940> immediately<00:02:09.540> when

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you have access to that immediately when

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.720 
you have access to that immediately when
those<00:02:09.930> instance<00:02:10.320> occur<00:02:10.590> however<00:02:11.100> for<00:02:11.520> long

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
those instance occur however for long

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
those instance occur however for long
term<00:02:12.000> duration<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:13.110> know<00:02:13.200> maybe<00:02:13.350> for

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
term duration you know maybe for

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.110 
term duration you know maybe for
compliance<00:02:14.010> issues<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> may<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:14.970> keep

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
compliance issues you may have to keep

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.700 
compliance issues you may have to keep
video<00:02:15.660> for<00:02:15.980> 30<00:02:16.980> days<00:02:17.190> 180<00:02:18.030> days<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.620> to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
video for 30 days 180 days you want to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.990 
video for 30 days 180 days you want to
put<00:02:19.830> that<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> clouds<00:02:20.610> you're<00:02:20.880> not

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
put that out to the clouds you're not

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.990 
put that out to the clouds you're not
storing<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.660> locally<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.500> much<00:02:23.430> safer<00:02:23.670> in

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
storing that locally it's much safer in

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.820 
storing that locally it's much safer in
the<00:02:24.090> cloud<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:25.080> cheaper<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.530> cloud

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
the cloud it's a cheaper in the cloud

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.070 
the cloud it's a cheaper in the cloud
and<00:02:26.070> from<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> customers<00:02:27.420> perspective<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
and from the customers perspective it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.380 
and from the customers perspective it
moves<00:02:28.290> his<00:02:28.680> expenses<00:02:29.250> from<00:02:29.400> a<00:02:29.520> capex<00:02:29.880> model<00:02:30.240> to

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
moves his expenses from a capex model to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.780 
moves his expenses from a capex model to
an<00:02:30.720> effects<00:02:31.230> model<00:02:31.620> much<00:02:32.010> easier<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.460> budget

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
an effects model much easier to budget

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.430 
an effects model much easier to budget
so<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.690> screen<00:02:33.960> here<00:02:33.990> we're<00:02:34.290> showing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
so in this screen here we're showing

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.130 
so in this screen here we're showing
just<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.770> set<00:02:35.010> up<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:36.450> cameras<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:36.990> have

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
just the set up the cameras that we have

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.200 
just the set up the cameras that we have
so<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.500> four<00:02:37.770> cameras<00:02:38.160> here<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:39.000> we're

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
so we have four cameras here that we're

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.600 
so we have four cameras here that we're
streaming<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:39.840> both<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.500> box<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.040> also

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
streaming now both to this box and also

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.430 
streaming now both to this box and also
into<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:41.940> cloud<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.990> bottom<00:02:43.110> line

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
into the cloud and on the bottom line

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.290 
into the cloud and on the bottom line
here<00:02:43.620> we<00:02:43.740> actually<00:02:44.010> show<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.730> box<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.150> in

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
here we actually show that the box is in

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.210 
here we actually show that the box is in
that<00:02:45.450> environment<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:46.050> well<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:47.040> next

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
that environment as well and the next

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
that environment as well and the next
thing<00:02:47.340> about<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:47.880> can<00:02:47.910> stream<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
thing about it is we can stream to the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.720 
thing about it is we can stream to the
local<00:02:48.900> box<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.380> much<00:02:49.890> different<00:02:50.250> resolution

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
local box at much different resolution

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.860 
local box at much different resolution
in<00:02:50.790> fragment<00:02:51.150> than<00:02:51.240> we<00:02:51.300> do<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.510> in<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.660> cloud

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
in fragment than we do it in the cloud

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.610 
in fragment than we do it in the cloud
and<00:02:52.520> leverage<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.670> time<00:02:53.940> value<00:02:54.300> of<00:02:54.540> data<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
and leverage that time value of data and

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.750 
and leverage that time value of data and
over<00:02:55.890> here<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.070> shows<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> user

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
over here it shows what the user

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
over here it shows what the user
interface<00:02:56.970> looks<00:02:57.360> like<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.260> have

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
interface looks like so here we have

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.920 
interface looks like so here we have
three<00:02:58.620> cameras<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.490> actually<00:02:59.850> here<00:03:00.270> at<00:03:00.300> emc

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
three cameras but actually here at emc

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.050 
three cameras but actually here at emc
world<00:03:01.160> these<00:03:02.160> three<00:03:02.400> here<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.730> one<00:03:02.940> that's

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
world these three here and one that's

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.690 
world these three here and one that's
actually<00:03:03.510> in<00:03:04.080> seattle<00:03:04.800> washington<00:03:04.920> looking

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
actually in seattle washington looking

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.910 
actually in seattle washington looking
at<00:03:05.970> a<00:03:06.000> Puget<00:03:06.450> Sound<00:03:06.690> which<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> other

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
at a Puget Sound which is the other

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.550 
at a Puget Sound which is the other
aspect<00:03:08.820> of<00:03:09.060> cloud<00:03:09.330> surveillance<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
aspect of cloud surveillance that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.860 
aspect of cloud surveillance that
provides<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.220> much<00:03:11.610> easier<00:03:11.820> way<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.090> manage<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
provides a much easier way to manage the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.110 
provides a much easier way to manage the
interface<00:03:13.200> if<00:03:13.440> I'm<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.980> store<00:03:14.520> owner<00:03:14.550> and<00:03:14.820> I

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
interface if I'm a store owner and I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.320 
interface if I'm a store owner and I
have<00:03:15.270> say<00:03:15.480> 10<00:03:15.720> franchises<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.310> own<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.970> can

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
have say 10 franchises that I own I can

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.030 
have say 10 franchises that I own I can
now<00:03:18.480> view<00:03:18.780> video<00:03:19.320> from<00:03:19.590> all<00:03:19.770> of<00:03:19.920> those

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
now view video from all of those

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.520 
now view video from all of those
franchises<00:03:20.520> on<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.120> same<00:03:21.300> screen<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:22.320> if<00:03:22.440> I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
franchises on the same screen so if I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.170 
franchises on the same screen so if I
