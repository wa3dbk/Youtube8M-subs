so don't know if you can see probably

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.520 
so don't know if you can see probably
can<00:00:39.719> because<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> light<00:00:40.760> but<00:00:41.760> i<00:00:45.170> think<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
can because of the light but i think the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.090 
can because of the light but i think the
scars<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.640> somewhere<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:49.320> like<00:00:49.440> tiny<00:00:49.829> look

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
scars the somewhere it's like tiny look

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
scars the somewhere it's like tiny look
like<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.520> chicken<00:00:50.820> pox<00:00:51.059> scar<00:00:51.360> or

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
like a little chicken pox scar or

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.959 
like a little chicken pox scar or
something<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.620> from<00:00:52.980> having<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> dermal

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
something that's from having a dermal

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.770 
something that's from having a dermal
anchor<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:54.719> 6-7<00:00:55.379> months<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:57.570> one

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
anchor for about 6-7 months and the one

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.930 
anchor for about 6-7 months and the one
that<00:00:58.079> was<00:00:58.230> by<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.710> i<00:00:59.010> took<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.760> well

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that was by there i took out as well

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
that was by there i took out as well
because<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.510> didn't<00:01:00.780> like<00:01:00.899> having<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.620> not

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
because i didn't like having one and not

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
because i didn't like having one and not
the<00:01:01.770> other<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:04.769> scar<00:01:05.040> by<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.570> even

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the other so the scar by there's even

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.010 
the other so the scar by there's even
smaller<00:01:07.229> than<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.119> because<00:01:09.119> this

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
smaller than one by here because this

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.940 
smaller than one by here because this
one<00:01:10.320> actually<00:01:10.680> healed<00:01:11.310> okay<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.830> whilst<00:01:13.830> I
