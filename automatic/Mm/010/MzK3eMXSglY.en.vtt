00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
the mouthful to say Z so I did all the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.480 
the mouthful to say Z so I did all the
previous<00:00:09.750> ones<00:00:09.960> yesterday<00:00:10.309> said<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
previous ones yesterday said was the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.549 
previous ones yesterday said was the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
last one to be released today and unlike

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.169 
last one to be released today and unlike
some<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.009> speculations<00:00:14.370> earlier<00:00:14.969> did<00:00:15.120> this

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
some of my speculations earlier did this

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.120 
some of my speculations earlier did this
one<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:15.540> 750<00:00:16.350> RP<00:00:16.619> so<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
one is actually 750 RP so it's the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.620 
one is actually 750 RP so it's the
cheaper<00:00:17.490> class<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.910> skin<00:00:18.090> doesn't<00:00:18.270> cost<00:00:18.480> too

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
cheaper class of skin doesn't cost too

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.599 
cheaper class of skin doesn't cost too
much<00:00:18.720> so<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.710> looks<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:19.949> let's<00:00:20.310> go<00:00:20.430> through

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
much so it looks like let's go through

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.130 
much so it looks like let's go through
all<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> animations<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.570> abilities<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.050> all

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
all the animations and abilities and all

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.040 
all the animations and abilities and all
that<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.500> stuff<00:00:22.580> don't<00:00:23.580> embrace<00:00:24.390> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
that kind of stuff don't embrace the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.729 
that kind of stuff don't embrace the
