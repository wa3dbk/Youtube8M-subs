Hey Foodies, I am Kanak and you are watching
Kanak's Kitchen. Today I will be showing you

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.109
how to prepare coconut burfi. This is a very
popular and one of the oldest sweets prepared

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.529
in India during the time of any festivals
or ocassion. It is very easy to prepare at

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.349
home. All you need is just a few ingredients
and it does not take much of your time and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.500
effort. It comes out quite delicious. So today
I am going to show you how to plate this burfi

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.760
in the form of water melon. So watch till
the end as I am going to show you how to present

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.760
this burfi in front of your guests. First
up, in a thick vessel, dry roast the coconut

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.010
for just 2 to 3 minutes on medium high flame
till it gives out a good aroma. Do not brown

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:04.010
it. Now its ready. I am going to add the condensed
milk over here. Mix it nicely. into the coconut

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.310
mixture. You can increase the heat little
bit and keep stirring it until the condensed

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.289
milk is nicely incorporated with the coconut.
At this point of time, you can also taste

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.560
and check for sweetness. If you want, you
can add in some more powdered sugar to it. I am

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.990
adding just a table spoon of powdered sugar
as I like it to be very sweet. When the mixture

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.990
becomes relatively dry, add in the ghee to
the mixture and stir well. Next add the cardomom

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.630
powder and mix well. When you see that all
the things have nicely come together to make

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.990
a dough like consistency, you can switch off
the flame. This process will take around 3

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.799
to 5 minutes. Now greese the plate or the
dish with a little ghee and keep it aside.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.799
Here I am using this semi circle plate, but
if you want you can use any thali or any other

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.319
plate if you have available. Now I am going
to divide my mixture into 2 portions. 1/4

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.400
and 3/4. I am going to add green food colour
to the 1/4 portion nicely so that it is mixed

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.400
well into the coconut mixture. I am going
to gently place this on the sides of the thali

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:41.659
or the container you are using. Nicely pat
it on the walls to make a small semi circle.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.970
Keep pressing it nicely so that it stands
there. Now I am going to add the red colour

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.640
to the remaining 3/4 portion of the coconut
mixture. Mix well until they are incorporated

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.379
well with each other. Now I am going to put
this over the green layer and nicely flatten

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.860
it with the help of your hands or with the
help of a spatula to complete the semi circle.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.689
So this could give you an effect of a slice
of water melon. Now I am going to place a

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:29.689
few choco chips at random over it to give
an effect of water melon seeds. Now let it

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.950
cool down a bit and once cool, cut it into
slices. And my lovely looking water melon

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:48.109
shaped coconut barfi is ready. My chewy burfi
is ready. It really changes your taste buds

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.939
as well as your mood. Its nothing less than
a bite from heaven. Here I have used some

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:59.510
dessicated coconut but if you want, you can
also use fresh coconut over here. So do try

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.120

it turned out in the comments section below.
