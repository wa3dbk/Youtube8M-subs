00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.029
 Hello and welcome to casserole tv 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 today a new video of 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.910
 presentation that relates to a ssd the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.990
 brand new strength 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 gs by corsair a ssd that comes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.310
 place just above the force gt that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.800
 takes over even the rates on 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.140
 got the 240 giga version and we'll get you 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.629
 present it quickly on video 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.670
 as always we will start with the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.079
 bundle for that we need to open the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.609
 box of this force 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.500
 gs when it always chooses the 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.170
 stickers that are very complicated to 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.179
 to undo for one should learn to them 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.780
 undo alone before in this 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:09.740
 small box we find a guarantee 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:13.790
 logic a 2.5-inch adapter to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:26.780
 3.5 inches a ssd of red dressed 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:28.970
 absolutely superb and the entirety of 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.130
 the hardware story of mounting your ssd 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.950
 in your case or on the adapter 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.960
 at the level of the ssd itself you go 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.830
 see it we are on a ssd format 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.370
 Classic 9.5mm thick connection 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.990
 in sata iii here the connector for them 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.680
 data here the connector for 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 supply 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.620
 we have the right to a small sticker 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.510
 force gs we are facing the model 240 giga 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.590
 and inside there is memory 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.880
 mlc 24 nanometers from toshiba who 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.790
 so is in toggle with a sf controller 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 2281 all for 555 MB per second in 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.119
 reading and 500 25th or per second in 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.920
 writing 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.060
 we joined right away 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 inside the ssd 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.480
 Interview forces we find a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.290
 pcb a pcb of a smaller size than 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.840
 usually 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.360
 it does not change much in itself 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840
 at the level of chips we see we have 16 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.740
 fleas 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.810
 in total she her badge and sandisk 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.720
 come from toshiba all 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.180
 simply they are in 24 nanometers 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.670
 and works in toggle mode are done 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.950
 normally the chips that are among the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.300
 more efficient market at the level of 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.760
 controller we find a sf 2281 him 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.470
 as well known at the level of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.520
 performances corsair announces five years to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.410
 25 and not per second in reading 525 mo 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.780
 per second in writing and 90000 yupps 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.850
 in 4k random write 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.250
 we will not miss very soon 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.590
 provide you with a complete test of this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 new ssd sure when a point like 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.880
 on his tell you very soon
