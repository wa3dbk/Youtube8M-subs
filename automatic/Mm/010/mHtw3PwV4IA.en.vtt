00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.589
 hello friends welcome to this your 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:09.910
 space I am jimena and today I will be your guide 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:14.389
 today we will see pure lounge style 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.900
 Our beautiful model is mozart and as 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.699
 master woman manuel graniel like you 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.369
 you know it is very important 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.320
 detail certain areas before the bath and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.810
 that this will allow us greater hygiene 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.720
 in those parts where they are most saved 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.970
 the bacteria like the little legs and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.559
 your sanitary areas brushing is 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.379
 important before the bath in some 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.870
 copies remember that this is 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.969
 commercial aesthetics not of exposure by 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.829
 what we have more flexibility to the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.510
 time to decide what is best for the 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.370
 next that we are attending 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.980
 remember that brushing has many 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.289
 benefits because by doing so we activate 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.329
 the blood microcirculation we eliminate 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.250
 impurities stimulate the follicles 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.039
 hairy to produce natural oils 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 and hydrate anne and keep one more hair 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.359
 bright and healthy personally there 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.400
 certain details that I like to do 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.040
 before the bath because they avoid many 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.290
 problems after 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.900
 our dear nails those that when 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.530
 you're cutting them the customer arrives and 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.930
 today they do not begin to bleed let's avoid this 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.880
 cutting the ones before in addition to wetting 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.980
 they will not be so sharp anymore and we 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.610
 they will avoid many claims like no 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.110
 are well cut or missing the magnet 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.540
 during the bathroom let's not forget the laments 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.240
 because our customers like to see 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.409
 clean and bright eyes so 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.179
 let's remove those ugly store 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.399
 do not forget the importance of a bathroom 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.649
 well done since this will mark the 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.869
 difference between an excellent aesthetic 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.100
 and one full of imperfections at 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.439
 finalize a bath 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 we must rinse very well because these 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.429
 waste can be a big problem more 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.640
 go ahead and nobody likes the 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:56.159
 claims the conditioner only gets 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.120
 used in some cases but today this 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.190
 it is commercial aesthetics everything is worth 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.830
 in the drying we find the 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.530
 questions dryer heat dryer 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.050
 of good power this depends on the weather and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.000
 of the type of the finish you look for so 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 the best one is the one that gives the result 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.370
 also expected the important thing is that 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.680
 this effect remains now part more 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.260
 important and that will make the handsome of 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.170
 mozart return or not to our room the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 haircut here we have the advantage of 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.610
 an excellent coat of those that all 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.520
 we would like to see every day 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.400
 abundant and tight good ideal for 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.190
 corner then we decided that we are going to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.220
 do as this is a free style I see 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.120
 their faces their color their body their hair and 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.430
 I say I would like something style and they are from 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.730
 those that everyone wants to hug kiss and 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.430
 apapachar so we start the kind of 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.590
 equipment and technique will define how much 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.480
 we will finish and we all want 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.150
 finish fast to be able to do more 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.280
 true so it's worth investing in 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.500
 quality equipment like good ones 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.110
 scissors 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.020
 Queen machine and blade because it is 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.830
 them and to whom we defend what now if 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.530
 art has started to see nothing but 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.840
 beauty and this work is something that 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 will last at home because all of our 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.580

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.840

 creativity we all put part of 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.090
 ourselves in it so maybe 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.670
 At the beginning do not remain as we expect 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.160
