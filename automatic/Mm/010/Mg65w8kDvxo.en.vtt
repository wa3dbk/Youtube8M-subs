cylinders and mortar cylinders so I
thought<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.529> time<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:16.920> try<00:00:17.100> something

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
thought it's about time to try something

and<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.650> Stanley<00:00:20.189> lock<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.640> bought

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and I have a Stanley lock that I bought

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.910 
and I have a Stanley lock that I bought
down<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.390> South<00:00:21.810> America<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.289> don't<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.650> don't

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
down in South America I don't I don't

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.200 
down in South America I don't I don't
even<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.279> they're<00:00:23.550> made<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.910> United

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
even I think they're made in the United

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
even I think they're made in the United
States<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.689> uh<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.140> haven't<00:00:25.619> seen<00:00:25.920> them<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
States but uh I haven't seen them in the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.120 
States but uh I haven't seen them in the
United<00:00:26.670> States<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.349> laminated<00:00:28.949> steel

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
United States so it's a laminated steel

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.359 
United States so it's a laminated steel
body<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.699> then<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.029> has<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> aluminum<00:00:31.199> base<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
body and then it has a aluminum base and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.200 
body and then it has a aluminum base and
a<00:00:33.059> removable<00:00:33.870> aluminum<00:00:34.620> shroud<00:00:35.550> there<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a removable aluminum shroud there if you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.389 
a removable aluminum shroud there if you
take<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.710> that's<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.160> half

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
take that out that's actually the half

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.090 
take that out that's actually the half
screw<00:00:39.090> I've<00:00:39.210> disassembled<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> when<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> first

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
screw I've disassembled it when I first

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.380 
screw I've disassembled it when I first
got<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.120> done<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
got it just to see how it was done and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.130 
got it just to see how it was done and
it's<00:00:42.750> quite<00:00:43.050> difficult<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:44.239> both<00:00:45.239> take<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it's quite difficult to both take it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.880 
it's quite difficult to both take it
apart<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.649> reassemble<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.360> there's<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
apart and reassemble it but there's a

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
apart and reassemble it but there's a
the<00:00:49.890> nut<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> bottom<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.270> has<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.449> spinner

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the nut from the bottom it has a spinner

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.610 
the nut from the bottom it has a spinner

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
real nice and it's got a code on it I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
real nice and it's got a code on it I
don't<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.439> that's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> direct<00:01:19.830> code<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> think

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
don't think that's a direct code I think

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.770 
don't think that's a direct code I think
that<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.060> probably<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
that you probably have to go to a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
that you probably have to go to a
Stanley<00:01:22.259> dealer<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> give<00:01:22.830> him<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
Stanley dealer to give him that to have

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.140 
Stanley dealer to give him that to have
a<00:01:23.400> new<00:01:23.549> key<00:01:24.150> made<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.920> anyway<00:01:26.220> let's<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.090> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
a new key made but anyway let's see if

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.140 
a new key made but anyway let's see if
we<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> pick<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> zoom<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
we can pick this thing you zoom just a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
we can pick this thing you zoom just a
little<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.509> give<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> little<00:01:30.869> bit<00:01:30.990> better

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
little to give you a little bit better

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
little to give you a little bit better
view<00:01:33.680> okay<00:01:34.680> try<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.050 

and<00:01:42.330> I'm<00:01:42.600> gonna<00:01:42.840> try<00:01:43.610> 23,000<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:44.909> when<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and I'm gonna try 23,000 because when I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940 
and I'm gonna try 23,000 because when I
looked<00:01:45.330> at<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> key<00:01:45.840> way<00:01:46.049> there's<00:01:46.470> kind<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
looked at this key way there's kind of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.980 
looked at this key way there's kind of
an<00:01:47.040> angle<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:48.659> around

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
an angle that you have to go around

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.010 
an angle that you have to go around
there<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.790> didn't<00:01:50.790> my<00:01:51.060> favorite<00:01:51.210> thickness

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there so I didn't my favorite thickness

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.930 
there so I didn't my favorite thickness
is<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> 31,000<00:01:53.310> Syd<00:01:53.460> gives<00:01:53.610> me<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> best

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
is the 31,000 Syd gives me the best

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.910 
is the 31,000 Syd gives me the best
feedback<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.960> didn't<00:01:55.350> think<00:01:55.560> I'd<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.770> able

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
feedback but I didn't think I'd be able

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.260 
feedback but I didn't think I'd be able
to<00:01:56.040> get<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.280> around<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.610> tight<00:01:56.850> warning

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to get it around this tight warning

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.530 
to get it around this tight warning
anyway<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.320> pressure<00:01:58.530> and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
anyway a little bit of pressure and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.580 
anyway a little bit of pressure and
let's<00:02:00.540> see<00:02:00.690> if<00:02:00.750> we<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> get<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
let's see if we can get this thing to

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:14.080 
let's see if we can get this thing to
cooperate<00:02:02.190> with<00:02:02.369> us

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.420 

there's<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.720> lot<00:02:15.110> of<00:02:15.380> spring<00:02:15.709> tension<00:02:16.190> on<00:02:16.280> these

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
there's a lot of spring tension on these

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.110 
there's a lot of spring tension on these
pins<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.940> can<00:02:17.090> feel<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:19.069> it's<00:02:20.200> not<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> lot<00:02:21.470> of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
pins I can feel and it's not a lot of

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.320 
pins I can feel and it's not a lot of
core<00:02:23.440> rotation<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.709> as<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.400> think<00:02:25.760> I'm<00:02:25.940> setting

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
core rotation if as I think I'm setting

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.320 
core rotation if as I think I'm setting
the<00:02:26.450> pins<00:02:29.020> I'm<00:02:30.020> getting<00:02:30.819> about<00:02:31.819> two<00:02:32.120> or<00:02:32.300> three

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the pins I'm getting about two or three

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.900 
the pins I'm getting about two or three
pins<00:02:32.810> binding<00:02:33.680> at<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.950> same<00:02:34.190> time<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.790> seems

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
pins binding at the same time it seems

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.370 
pins binding at the same time it seems
like<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.450> would<00:02:35.569> indicate<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:36.080> me<00:02:36.200> at

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
like so that would indicate to me at

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.830 
like so that would indicate to me at
least<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:37.550> has<00:02:37.730> pretty<00:02:38.000> tight<00:02:38.330> tolerance

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
least that has pretty tight tolerance

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.509 
least that has pretty tight tolerance
when<00:02:39.140> manufacturer<00:02:40.069> I<00:02:43.060> haven't<00:02:44.060> had<00:02:44.180> any

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.190 
when manufacturer I haven't had any

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
no-fault set I can't quite get on that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:24.369 
no-fault set I can't quite get on that
first<00:02:55.550> pin<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.360> angle<00:02:56.780> here

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.289 

in<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.069> hoarding<00:03:25.459> doesn't<00:03:25.790> like<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.150> get

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
in the hoarding doesn't like you to get

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.580 
in the hoarding doesn't like you to get
that<00:03:26.420> first<00:03:26.689> pin<00:03:28.840> sure<00:03:29.840> if<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.989> can<00:03:30.049> get<00:03:30.319> on<00:03:30.439> him

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that first pin sure if I can get on him

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.930 
that first pin sure if I can get on him
though

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:54.380 

come<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:43.550> tempted<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.610> leave<00:03:44.820> him<00:03:44.970> alone

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.170 

except<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.319> think<00:03:55.350> he's<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.150> all<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
except I think he's the one all the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.120 
except I think he's the one all the
others<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.690> springy<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.380> just<00:03:58.740> absolutely

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
others are springy so I just absolutely

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.699 
others are springy so I just absolutely
have<00:03:59.310> to<00:03:59.840> figure<00:04:00.840> out<00:04:00.959> some<00:04:01.170> way<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.319> get<00:04:01.560> my

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
have to figure out some way to get my

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:35.810 
have to figure out some way to get my
pick<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.160> him

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.910 

mmm<00:04:36.940> here<00:04:37.480> we<00:04:37.600> go<00:04:39.540> open<00:04:40.540> Stanley<00:04:41.110> 6-pin

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
mmm here we go open Stanley 6-pin

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.810 
mmm here we go open Stanley 6-pin
laminated<00:04:42.720> shrouded<00:04:43.720> padlock<00:04:44.610> not<00:04:45.610> too

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
laminated shrouded padlock not too

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.970 
laminated shrouded padlock not too
difficult<00:04:46.060> no<00:04:46.540> security<00:04:47.110> pins<00:04:47.350> whatsoever

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
difficult no security pins whatsoever

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.800 
difficult no security pins whatsoever
that<00:04:48.100> I'm<00:04:48.190> able<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.550> do<00:04:48.850> zags<00:04:49.120> they're<00:04:49.270> all<00:04:49.420> you

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
that I'm able to do zags they're all you

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.260 
that I'm able to do zags they're all you
know<00:04:49.870> seem<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> be<00:04:50.470> all<00:04:50.590> standard<00:04:51.070> pins<00:04:51.310> so

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
know seem to be all standard pins so

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.010 
know seem to be all standard pins so
there<00:04:52.540> you<00:04:52.660> go

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
there you go

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.360 
there you go
everybody<00:04:53.800> stay<00:04:54.010> safe<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.550> stay<00:04:55.030> legal
