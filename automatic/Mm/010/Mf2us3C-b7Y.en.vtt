00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.850
 when I heard the paper world 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.320
 impressions to come 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.789
 the terrible contradictions 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.339
 we were happy 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.669
 the forest and the planet warming all that 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.890
 and then I discovered three bodies 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.089
 this great international school of Grenoble 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.699
 he is part of the very exclusive club of prestigious rank universities 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.729
 I was very surprised to learn that she had just celebrated her centers 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.020
 tagro trains some of the highest paid engineers in europe 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 in future fields than on paper printed communication 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.340
 and biomaterials 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 nor why did I tell myself at the time of the internet remains 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.900
 these areas it's a decade 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.520
 whether they are printing paper and writing acquired in my swimming suffer 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.490
 sanitary ware suffered smart 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.000
 it is beech oak or cellulose fibers extracted from other wood 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.450
 plants 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.020
 but what kind of wood are we talking about 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.640
 wood used for paper making essentially projects 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 sawmills and forest clearings 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.930
 thinning is an operation not essential to the vitality and 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.150
 forest development the most chic type trees are taken from the 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.200
 benefit of the finest specimens the French forest also grows 50 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.090
 thousand hectares a year 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.730
 moreover in France only 40% of papers are made from 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.820
 flax fibers 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.259
 the remaining 60% are made from recycled fibers yes 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.810
 recycling is also a great reservoir of fiber 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.929
 constantly renewed who store carbon and participate in the fight against 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.370
 c02 emissions 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.240
 the fossil fuels used in this industry 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.230
 are gradually giving way to clean energies 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.430
 and the om borrowed from the river 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.450
 it is returned to him perfectly secure 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.470
 as for the lÃ©zignan plume 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.490
 they are all only water vapor 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.480
 There you go 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.480
 it does not hurt a lot of misconceptions that we twisted our necks 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.529
 did you know that a paper machine 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:10.539
 texts and so many cards 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.599
 elise electronics complex 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.119
 which mother of the site a320 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:17.989
 did you know that this machine 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.830
 and able to produce a reel of recycled paper 10 meters wide 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.929
 at 120 km 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.209
 who weighs the weight of the nrb more 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.209
 and represents a round trip paris rome every day 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 paper is a biomaterial 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.929
 printed communication gives him other future still 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.319
 when we play more or less blurry the other seagate factory we wish 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.549
 that the expert committee logically rubble 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.299
 imagine your custom office colleagues with advertising that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.680
 is exclusively for you imagine the packaging of the future with a 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 label is resurrected containing information about the product packaged the 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.429
 whoever used the kilometers traveled per year 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.759
 shocks suffered the accidental break in the cold chain the date of 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.179
 expiry and all kinds of essential data to avoid mistakes 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:15.100
 medical 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.750
 track down counterfeits imagine a 4 by 3 poster with sensors 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.480
 printed photovoltaics which supplies a battery also printed and which 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 anime colors printed on this action 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.069
 imagine your phone or computer screen are not all printed 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069
 printed electronics on the objects of our everyday life 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.809
 bp who manages to capture the light of day and restores it in the evening 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.080
 today we are printing on the carnage of the metal of the fabric 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.959
 there are many other materials 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.939
 by means of multiple techniques are more recipe the silkscreen of the 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:53.179
 flexography 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.529
 it's hard to come back 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:58.279
 and of course the conductor and then the electro photographic 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.249
 these digital printing processes or lower the manufacturing costs of 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:05.249
 applications of the future 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.979
 when I heard the word 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:10.849
 forget about materials 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.519
 then there is nothing 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.719
 the void 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:15.840
 and yet 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.229
 agora and its research laboratory 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.769
 actively participate in the gradual replacement of materials from 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.050
 petroleum chemistry 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.300
 because of biomass 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.860
 king it is renewable and plethoric on the planet 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.180
 it's biomaterials will surprise you in our current applications and 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.800
 future 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.970
 these bags and trays intended for this food contact 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.729
 this operation make based on materials 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.150
 Second generation biofuels from wood waste 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.759
 or other plants 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.710
 more small than me it's not bad 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.719
 gradually in place 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.719
 those first generation corn based on 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.809
 the cellulose fiber itself 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.430
 is conquering all areas 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.430
 those who cheat find in the bumpers of your car 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.999
 printed communication or biomaterial 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.360
 three domains that make it one 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.659
 this is all the alchemy of the synergy that takes place within these 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.379
 agreements 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.550
 this composite industry 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 a great need for executives and leaders performing 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.539
 hr future expo-plants what I lived did not agree 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.330
 this school and the portal open on an international professional future 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.889
 exciting
