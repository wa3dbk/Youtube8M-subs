00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and against such a background an hour ago washington 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.410
 demanded that the Ukrainian authorities withdraw 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.330
 security officials from the center of Kiev and just 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.820
 from Brussels reported that the heads of MID 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.679
 EU agreed some sanctions in 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 all cases such statements are addressed 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 only one event participant 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 Ukraine's leadership adequate assessment 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 actions of extremists who 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 provoked numerous victims 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.500
 West still does not give noted in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 Russian mid 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 confirmation of this is the chronology of the trip to 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 Kiev heads of diplomatic departments 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.719
 Germany Poland and France 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 declared as an intermediary mission 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.590
 details have paul bekina this meeting 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.750
 several times transferred communication with 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.270
 riots in the center of Kiev, however 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.170
 the ministers took the opportunity 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.760
 defiantly meet first 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 turn with the leaders of the Ukrainian opposition 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.090
 that in any European country 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.820
 would be considered as 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 frank challenge official authority but 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.750
 European commissioners it seems at all 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 not embarrassed by the fact they came to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.739
 Yanukovych with the requirements of close cult 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 swearing to announce new early elections 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.629
 Parliament and the President and backed it up 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.460
 threats of sanctions from the side is what 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.520
 wrote in his twitter microblog 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.600
 french foreign minister 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.729
 alleged sanctions include 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 visa deprivation 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.600
 as well as freezing of funds 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 certain officials russia 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.380
 meanwhile insist on settling 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.630
 respecting authority 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.670
 Ukrainian authorities calling emissaries from 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.799
 use your close contacts with 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.960
 opposition to convince them 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.460
 cooperate with the official authorities except 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.530
 Russia is categorically against 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 pressure on cues using sanctions while 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.070
 while the opposition is not going 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.960
 dissociate themselves from extremists 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.180
 western politics according to chapter 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.640
 Russian mids prefer this not 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.329
 notice all the blame lay on the authorities 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.729
 Ukraine and do not qualify as 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.280
 posited as befits action 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.250
 extremists instead threaten 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.479
 sanctions and thereby create 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.969
 additional incentives for the opposition 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.100
 be unyielding and indirectly 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.860
 if not directly encourage militants 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.750
 the continuity of chaos between 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.180
 ultimatum emissaries and with completely 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.590
 repeats the former Ukrainian ultimatums 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.269
 come 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.129
 goal with the leaders of which Vladimir 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.729
 klitschko arseneve entirely and Oleg 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.250
 a yarn 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.140
 European ministers met at that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.700
 there is talking about coordinated action 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.459
 dismissal of legitimate authority 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 Ukraine no matter what and how 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.810
 can not be better contributes to the assumption 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.150
 that the leaders of the Maidan does not control 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.370
 extremists maybe so but all 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.250
 says that the action of two parts 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.510
 the opposition is very well agreed here 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.370
 that after negotiations with Yanukovych 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.099
 says arseny yatsenyuk 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.079
 there is positive news assault and sweep 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.360
 who were scheduled to be canceled now 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.730
 truce negotiations start 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.370
 process to stabilize the situation 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.790
 and here is what the militant leader says in response 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.769
 right sector Dmitry Yarosh officially 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.959
 I declare the right sector did not sign 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.670
 no agreements with anyone about anything 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.530
 so agreed the offensive 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.500
 rebellious people must continue 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.690
 on the face of a clear distribution of roles at that 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.250
 while the authorities are noticeable under 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.220
 guarantees european commissioner 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.390
 make concessions truce 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.760
 release the arrested gangsters and 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.829
 keep the agreement leaders 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.109
 the opposition also reports on the fulfillment 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.690
 terms of termination 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.489
 such a state of institution protecting 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.639
 the great as well as the release 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.720
 captured buildings are so called 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.000
 uncontrollable action films after a couple 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.489
 hours just these buildings capture 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.680
 again thereby creating a new argument 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.630
 and the pressure on Yanukovych European 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.060
 emissaries do not seem to notice this 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.829
 retaliatory measures of the Ukrainian police 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.500
 considered a violation of the agreement 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.239
 Ukrainian authorities and threaten them with sanctions 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.819
 in all cases when it is necessary to lead 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.470
 negotiations as advises the west to introduce them 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.260
 it is necessary with Klitschko and Yatsenyuk 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.209
 but when to fulfill obligations 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.239
 Klitschko and Yatsenyuk does not and they do not 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.760
 control of these militants actually 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.769
 it's just such a military trick 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.959
 meanwhile in the west of Ukraine are tuned 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.579
 radically to the accompaniment of negotiations 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.040
 continue to seize and regional 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.470
 administration offices 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.810
 police even parts of the Ukrainian army with 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.550
 this captures thousands of combat units 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.800
 weapons 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.560
 militant leader honestly declares that 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:20.230
 weapons will be soon and that's how they evaluate 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.750
 the situation in the west is the local interior ministry now 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.870
 Police in manual mode but with 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.490
 all the commands are given to this phone 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.940
 almost all communications are damaged 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.440
 we are back in 1945 services 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.480
 there are quite a few extremists 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.880
 Bandera ideology heirs are not 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.220
 leave doubt their purpose is the overthrow 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.080
 legal authority in the country and construction 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.390
 new mono national ukrainian 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.370
 state by analogy mated 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.830
 here and there Russian majority 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.990
 turned into second-class citizens here 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.130
 why is the Ukrainian state like now 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.230
 seen on this map 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.950
 split into almost 2 equal 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.430
 parts western speaking ukrainian and 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.830
 Russian part 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.630
 and that's how people are set up in the south east 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.150
 areas marked on the map in blue 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.100
 color they are openly preparing for 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.780
 to defend their right not to become 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.040
 second-class citizens 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:13.420
 I want to warn these national rubles

 and on the street how not to forget them 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.040
 twist up the straw 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.600
 case of some radical action with 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.380
 parties 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.720
 oppositionists or those who are 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.610
