a short head and they're absolute

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.190 
a short head and they're absolute
powerful<00:01:31.909> muscles<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:32.479> fatigue<00:01:32.899> really

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
powerful muscles but fatigue really

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.830 
powerful muscles but fatigue really
quickly<00:01:33.829> they're<00:01:34.399> also<00:01:34.579> a<00:01:34.789> powerful<00:01:35.210> Supra

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
quickly they're also a powerful Supra

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.260 
quickly they're also a powerful Supra
nater<00:01:36.079> which<00:01:36.829> means<00:01:37.159> that<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.729> turn<00:01:38.060> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
nater which means that you turn the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.490 
nater which means that you turn the
hands<00:01:38.630> outwards

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
hands outwards

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.590 
hands outwards
especially<00:01:40.280> when<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.520> elbow<00:01:40.880> is<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.240> flexed

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
especially when the elbow is in a flexed

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.690 
especially when the elbow is in a flexed
position<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.679> we<00:01:42.770> work<00:01:42.950> as<00:01:43.189> it's<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.460> hinge

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
position so we work as it's a hinge

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.340 
position so we work as it's a hinge
joint<00:01:43.789> at<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.240> elbow<00:01:44.719> and<00:01:44.929> we're<00:01:45.170> going<00:01:45.289> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
joint at the elbow and we're going to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.770 
joint at the elbow and we're going to
lift<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.039> weights<00:01:46.280> up<00:01:46.579> now<00:01:47.270> look<00:01:47.450> at<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.689> way

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
lift the weights up now look at the way

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.499 
lift the weights up now look at the way
the<00:01:47.960> grip<00:01:48.259> is<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:48.859> nice<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.159> soft<00:01:49.640> if<00:01:50.210> you

start to pump up and then the forearms
fatigue<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.549> grip<00:01:59.090> becomes<00:01:59.509> really<00:01:59.810> weak

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
fatigue and the grip becomes really weak

and we cramp up so try and keep the grip
nice<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:02.810> loose<00:02:03.020> there's<00:02:03.649> an<00:02:03.770> option<00:02:04.100> of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
now a powerful supinator of the bicep

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.270 
now a powerful supinator of the bicep
with<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.120> hammer<00:04:22.390> curl<00:04:22.690> so<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.350> can<00:04:23.500> inhale<00:04:23.890> and

breathe in so actually maneuver on the
effort<00:04:39.250> phase<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.420> we're<00:04:40.540> going<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.690> do<00:04:40.930> a

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
effort phase so we're going to do a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.410 
effort phase so we're going to do a
powerful<00:04:41.800> supinator<00:04:42.430> which<00:04:42.700> means<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.240> when

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
powerful supinator which means that when

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
the elbow is bent you can rotate the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.120 
the elbow is bent you can rotate the
palm<00:04:46.300> outwards<00:04:46.990> and<00:04:47.260> that's<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.620> aid<00:04:47.800> of<00:04:48.010> the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
palm outwards and that's the aid of the

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.420 
palm outwards and that's the aid of the
bicep<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.780> a<00:04:49.840> good<00:04:50.020> work<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.130> going<00:04:54.340> to

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
bicep it's a good work so just going to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.790 
bicep it's a good work so just going to
get<00:04:54.550> a<00:04:54.580> bit<00:04:54.730> closer<00:04:55.030> so<00:04:55.570> now<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.170> lock<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.680> arm
