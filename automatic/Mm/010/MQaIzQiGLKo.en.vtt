00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220

could<00:03:30.610> kind<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.970> utilize<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.050> put<00:03:32.260> in

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
could kind of utilize this and put in

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.160 
could kind of utilize this and put in
motion<00:03:32.830> sensing<00:03:33.220> but<00:03:33.850> then<00:03:33.970> again<00:03:34.170> personally

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
motion sensing but then again personally

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.680 
motion sensing but then again personally
I<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.709> not<00:03:35.890> feel<00:03:36.490> like<00:03:36.520> Grand<00:03:36.880> Theft<00:03:36.970> Auto<00:03:37.120> 5<00:03:37.450> is

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
cool things with motion sensing we've

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.670 
cool things with motion sensing we've

I just I don't know if this is something
that<00:04:09.940> Nintendo<00:04:10.780> should<00:04:11.080> really<00:04:11.350> add<00:04:11.560> into

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
that Nintendo should really add into

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
Grand Theft Auto 5 I mean obviously they

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.620 
Grand Theft Auto 5 I mean obviously they
can<00:04:14.470> do<00:04:14.739> it<00:04:14.890> without<00:04:15.299> doing<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.480> motion

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
can do it without doing the motion

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.690 
can do it without doing the motion
sensing<00:04:17.200> they<00:04:17.799> could<00:04:18.010> make<00:04:18.190> it<00:04:18.310> just<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:18.580> the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
sensing they could make it just like the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.310 
sensing they could make it just like the
xbox<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.209> ps3<00:04:19.390> where<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.049> hold<00:04:20.230> the

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
controller and you know you just play

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.890 
controller and you know you just play
the<00:04:21.760> game<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.090> hit<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.240> buttons<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:22.750> that's

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
the game you hit the buttons and that's

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.279 
the game you hit the buttons and that's
it

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
it

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:25.230 
it
on<00:04:23.560> top<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.950> it's<00:04:24.340> very<00:04:24.430> important<00:04:25.120> to

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
on top of that it's very important to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.230 
on top of that it's very important to
mention<00:04:25.419> that

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
mention that

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.730
