00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
to the next level and I don't mean that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.650 
to the next level and I don't mean that
in<00:00:49.260> some<00:00:49.320> odd<00:00:50.129> way<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.489> mean<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> literally<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
takes it to a second level and so when I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
takes it to a second level and so when I
opened<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> Box<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.170> was<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.350> little<00:00:55.649> surprised

to find that low and behold it comes
with<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.129> whole<00:00:59.609> pile<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.090> styrofoam<00:01:00.840> cut<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
with a whole pile of styrofoam cut the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.090 
with a whole pile of styrofoam cut the
blocks<00:01:02.070> well<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.320> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.379> get<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.710> stuff<00:01:04.920> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
blocks well I kind of get this stuff for

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
blocks well I kind of get this stuff for
free<00:01:05.309> all<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.090> packaging<00:01:06.600> but

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
free all the time and packaging but

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
free all the time and packaging but
these<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.110> customs<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> that's<00:01:08.610> not

these are customs that and that's not
really<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> point<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> expansion

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
really the point in the expansion

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
really the point in the expansion
because<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.409> make<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.430> can

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
because you can make more and you can

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.520 
because you can make more and you can
build<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> second<00:01:12.180> level<00:01:12.330> out<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.110> far<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.409> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
build the second level out as far as you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.310 
build the second level out as far as you
want<00:01:13.560> what<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> expansion<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.630> about<00:01:15.900> really

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
want what this expansion is about really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.410 
want what this expansion is about really
is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.490> ramps<00:01:17.880> yes<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.330> would

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
is the up and down ramps yes it would

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.490 
is the up and down ramps yes it would
have<00:01:18.450> been<00:01:18.600> nice<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.930> they<00:01:19.080> had<00:01:19.110> come<00:01:19.350> with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
have been nice if they had come with

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
have been nice if they had come with
nice<00:01:19.950> wooden<00:01:20.280> blocks<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.820> these<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
nice wooden blocks for these but that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.120 
nice wooden blocks for these but that
would<00:01:21.360> have<00:01:21.390> probably<00:01:21.720> cost<00:01:21.900> about<00:01:22.049> $600<00:01:22.890> -

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
would have probably cost about $600 -

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
would have probably cost about $600 -
and<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:23.820> heavy<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.299> pile<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.500> I'm

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and how heavy this pile would be so I'm

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.289 
and how heavy this pile would be so I'm
more<00:01:25.920> concerned<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.150> down

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
more concerned about the up and down

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.880 
more concerned about the up and down
ramps<00:01:27.570> let's<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> look<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.350> them<00:01:28.530> all

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
ramps let's take a look at them all

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.929 
ramps let's take a look at them all
right<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.159> are<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> pieces<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.729> are

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
right here are the pieces that are

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.310 
right here are the pieces that are
included<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.450> each<00:01:30.509> ramp<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
included for each ramp you get two of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
included for each ramp you get two of
everything<00:01:31.530> I'm<00:01:31.920> showing<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
everything I'm showing you you get this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300 
everything I'm showing you you get this
flat<00:01:33.720> piece<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.470> no<00:01:34.650> puzzle<00:01:35.009> piece<00:01:35.159> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
flat piece with no puzzle piece on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
flat piece with no puzzle piece on
either<00:01:35.430> side<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.540> wooden<00:01:37.200> pieces<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
either side these two wooden pieces and

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980 
either side these two wooden pieces and
then<00:01:38.790> two<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.150> these<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.810> four

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
then two of these you actually get four

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.600 
then two of these you actually get four
of<00:01:40.079> these<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> box<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:41.159> will<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.400> used

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
of these in the box that will be used

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.010 
of these in the box that will be used
for<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.360> bottom<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.780> ramp

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
for the top and the bottom of the ramp

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.609 
for the top and the bottom of the ramp
this<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.369> will<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:45.060> basically<00:01:45.600> your<00:01:46.259> track

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
this here will be basically your track

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.609 
this here will be basically your track
comes<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.310> point<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:49.020> will<00:01:49.049> come<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
comes to this point and it will come and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
comes to this point and it will come and
it<00:01:49.799> will<00:01:49.890> meet<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.430> bottom<00:01:50.880> piece<00:01:51.060> here

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it will meet this bottom piece here

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
it will meet this bottom piece here
which<00:01:51.780> smoothly<00:01:52.320> comes<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:52.950> places

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
which smoothly comes up you just places

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.240 
which smoothly comes up you just places
against<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> other<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.040> top

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
against the other one then on the top

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.270 
against the other one then on the top
you're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:58.590> wooden<00:01:59.040> piece

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you're going to have this wooden piece

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.030 
you're going to have this wooden piece
which<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.299> top<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.719> smaller<00:02:01.200> pylon<00:02:01.799> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
which is on top of a smaller pylon and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.760 
which is on top of a smaller pylon and
then<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:03.060> basically<00:02:03.570> use<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.140> flat<00:02:04.469> piece

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
then you basically use this flat piece

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
then you basically use this flat piece
to<00:02:05.719> connect<00:02:06.719> these<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.920> other<00:02:08.280> flat<00:02:08.700> wooden

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to connect these this other flat wooden

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
to connect these this other flat wooden
piece<00:02:09.179> end<00:02:09.479> goes<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> top<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> wooden

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
piece end goes in the top of the wooden

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.830 
piece end goes in the top of the wooden
pylon<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.790> top<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.180> wooden<00:02:12.450> piece<00:02:12.629> here

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
pylon or top of the wooden piece here

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.100 
pylon or top of the wooden piece here
that's<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> top<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.410> small<00:02:13.590> pylon

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
that's the top of the small pylon

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.410 
that's the top of the small pylon
the<00:02:14.320> top<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.680> large<00:02:14.860> pylon<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.580> at<00:02:16.210> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the top of a large pylon and at that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.000 
the top of a large pylon and at that
point<00:02:16.690> you<00:02:16.810> can<00:02:16.960> start<00:02:17.170> building<00:02:17.380> your<00:02:17.590> track

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
point you can start building your track

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.490 
point you can start building your track
and<00:02:18.310> as<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.030> can<00:02:19.120> see<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> cars<00:02:19.990> are

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
and as you can see then the cars are

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.710 
and as you can see then the cars are
basically<00:02:21.070> just<00:02:21.250> gonna<00:02:21.370> be<00:02:21.550> coming<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.150> up

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
basically just gonna be coming and up

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.880 
basically just gonna be coming and up
the<00:02:22.930> track<00:02:23.230> here<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.800> on<00:02:24.580> now<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.390> only<00:02:25.890> they

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the track here and on now if only they

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.340 
the track here and on now if only they
ever<00:02:27.160> went<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.760> smoothly<00:02:28.210> more<00:02:28.990> likely

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
ever went that smoothly more likely

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.990 
ever went that smoothly more likely
they're<00:02:29.500> gonna<00:02:29.560> go<00:02:29.770> up<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.100> track<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.760> shoot

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
they're gonna go up the track and shoot

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.820 
they're gonna go up the track and shoot
up<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.330> air<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.900> keep<00:02:32.020> going<00:02:32.200> forever<00:02:32.500> but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
up in the air and keep going forever but

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.410 
up in the air and keep going forever but
eventually<00:02:33.550> you'll<00:02:33.670> be<00:02:33.820> able<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.030> get<00:02:34.150> them<00:02:34.270> up

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
eventually you'll be able to get them up

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.120 
eventually you'll be able to get them up
and<00:02:34.570> hopefully<00:02:35.230> they'll<00:02:35.560> land<00:02:35.770> somewhere

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
and hopefully they'll land somewhere

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.300 
and hopefully they'll land somewhere
along<00:02:36.400> there<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.830> use<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.190> this

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
along there and what is the use of this

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.360 
along there and what is the use of this
well<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:40.390> all<00:02:40.570> honesty<00:02:41.080> not<00:02:41.770> a<00:02:41.830> whole<00:02:42.040> lot<00:02:42.220> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
well in all honesty not a whole lot I

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.490 
well in all honesty not a whole lot I
mean<00:02:42.580> granted<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.780> neat<00:02:43.959> thing<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.410> in

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
mean granted this is a neat thing and in

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.900 
mean granted this is a neat thing and in
fact<00:02:44.530> if<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.040> want<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.580> could<00:02:45.730> take<00:02:45.820> away

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
fact if you want to you could take away

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.310 
fact if you want to you could take away
the<00:02:46.030> second<00:02:46.300> level<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.570> make<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.140> ultimate

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
the second level and make the ultimate

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.990 
the second level and make the ultimate
jump<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.220> mean<00:02:48.370> that's<00:02:48.490> a<00:02:48.580> pretty<00:02:48.790> neat<00:02:48.970> thing

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
jump I mean that's a pretty neat thing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.540 
jump I mean that's a pretty neat thing
in<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.870> itself<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.040> mean<00:02:51.250> moving

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
in and of itself but I mean moving

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.830 
in and of itself but I mean moving
around<00:02:51.640> an<00:02:51.790> upper<00:02:52.030> track<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.420> it<00:02:52.540> that<00:02:52.660> much

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
around an upper track is it that much

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.890 
around an upper track is it that much
harder<00:02:53.110> no<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:54.430> can<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.910> go<00:02:54.940> other<00:02:55.300> over

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
harder no you can have it go other over

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.990 
harder no you can have it go other over
other<00:02:56.050> tracks<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.739> fact<00:02:56.920> I've<00:02:57.370> saw<00:02:57.730> some

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
other tracks and in fact I've saw some

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880 
other tracks and in fact I've saw some
setups<00:02:58.360> where<00:02:58.600> they<00:02:59.050> had<00:02:59.170> pylons<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.830> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
setups where they had pylons in the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.300 
setups where they had pylons in the
middle<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.190> tracks<00:03:00.489> but<00:03:00.930> these<00:03:01.950> cars<00:03:02.950> move

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
middle of tracks but these cars move

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.949 
middle of tracks but these cars move
these<00:03:03.489> pylons<00:03:03.880> too<00:03:04.150> easily<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.570> when<00:03:04.840> it's

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
these pylons too easily and when it's

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.190 
these pylons too easily and when it's
underneath<00:03:05.530> other<00:03:06.100> wooden<00:03:06.760> pieces<00:03:07.239> it<00:03:07.930> might

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
underneath other wooden pieces it might

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.810 
underneath other wooden pieces it might
not<00:03:08.350> move<00:03:08.560> as<00:03:08.770> easily<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:09.489> still<00:03:09.700> gonna

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
not move as easily but it's still gonna

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.390 
not move as easily but it's still gonna
move<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.180> whole<00:03:10.330> track<00:03:10.630> around<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.950> does

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
move the whole track around this does

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.949 
move the whole track around this does
move<00:03:12.700> around<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:13.120> little<00:03:13.209> bit<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.570> you'll<00:03:13.690> find

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
move around a little bit and you'll find

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.990 
move around a little bit and you'll find
yourself<00:03:14.459> repositioning<00:03:15.459> these<00:03:15.610> all<00:03:15.910> the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
yourself repositioning these all the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.610 
yourself repositioning these all the
time<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.330> get<00:03:16.450> them<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:16.840> spot<00:03:17.170> but

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
time to get them in the right spot but

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.289 
time to get them in the right spot but
it<00:03:17.709> does<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.280> does<00:03:18.340> do<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.670> pretty<00:03:18.730> good<00:03:18.970> job<00:03:19.090> on

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
it does it does do a pretty good job on

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:28.570 
it does it does do a pretty good job on
how<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.630> whole<00:03:19.840> thing<00:03:20.049> comes<00:03:20.290> together

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580
