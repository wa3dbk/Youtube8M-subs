 Sir 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.930
 they have attacked us twice in our

 ground 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.470

 killed before not remember it sanchez is a 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.050
 Necessary evil 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.430
 he is the only man who has been so 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.720
 close to serra 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.720
 we turn on 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.400
 and we have imposed ourselves 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.460
 are the masters to those who do 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.540
 Hello everyone, I 've brought you the 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.550
 final sequence of the mayday map in call 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 of duty ghosts in extinction mode and 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.640
 you know the map that came out recently for 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.980
 xbox 360 and xbox one and good inside 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.490
 you will have little in plate that is to say that 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.620
 good 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.540
 this final sequence good does not cool so much 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.550
 like the first one like the map nights 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.080
 Failed me I liked the other more but 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.990
 it's good that they leave us a little 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.390
 a clue to what the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.210
 next map is worth it since it could be a 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.010
 volcano or something like that and good they're going to see 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.860
 a much larger beehives of the 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.070
 that have seen so far and good and to 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.750
 Finally, they leave us some images of a 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.270
 kind of bugs that are like that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 they're supposed to handle the cryptics 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.479
 which are the ones I 'm seeing now and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.160
 nothing quite curious the truth as already 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.050
 I say I liked more another sequence 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160
 but well I brought you this one too 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.690
 that one since I did it with the map 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.250
 previous I've done it with this what 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.929
 I would continue doing the following map 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.090
 palÃ© so nothing is simply this 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.580
 was to see that final trailer at 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 pass extinction mode on the map 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.760
 mayday and nothing is simply so 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.260
 nothing but that you have liked is 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.340
 liked to vote i like favorites and we 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.000
 we see in the next video 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.000
 only untied 2 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.980
 with the same
