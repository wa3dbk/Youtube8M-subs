of our market leaders in a sense i'll
tell<00:00:39.269> you<00:00:39.329> why<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.690> second<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.920> cub

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
tell you why in a second this is the cub

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.990 
tell you why in a second this is the cub
crafters<00:00:41.600> carbon<00:00:42.600> cub<00:00:42.960> SS<00:00:43.519> it's<00:00:44.519> a<00:00:44.610> few<00:00:44.820> words

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
crafters carbon cub SS it's a few words

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.549 
crafters carbon cub SS it's a few words
to<00:00:45.239> say<00:00:45.269> in<00:00:45.540> there<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:45.839> there's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> reason<00:00:46.260> why

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to say in there but there's a reason why

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.530 
to say in there but there's a reason why
it<00:00:46.620> has<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.040> those<00:00:47.159> in<00:00:47.339> a<00:00:47.370> carbon<00:00:48.089> cub<00:00:48.239> because

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
it has all those in a carbon cub because

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.450 
it has all those in a carbon cub because
it's<00:00:48.720> got<00:00:48.839> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> carbon<00:00:49.589> components<00:00:50.129> you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's got a lot of carbon components you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.729 
it's got a lot of carbon components you
look<00:00:50.640> back<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.390> cross<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> interior

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
look back here they cross the interior

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
look back here they cross the interior
you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.430> carbon<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.570> material

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you can see that carbon like material

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can see that carbon like material
and<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.089> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> engine<00:00:57.629> cowl

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and we see it up here on the engine cowl

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.899 
and we see it up here on the engine cowl
as<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:58.260> why<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.769> they<00:00:58.949> use<00:00:59.159> that<00:00:59.399> they<00:00:59.519> use<00:00:59.699> it

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
as well why do they use that they use it

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.459 
as well why do they use that they use it
to<00:00:59.940> keep<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.420> weight<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> airplane

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to keep the weight down on this airplane

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
to keep the weight down on this airplane
it<00:01:01.890> costs<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.519> little<00:01:02.609> more<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.390> way

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it costs a little more to do it that way

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.540 
it costs a little more to do it that way
but<00:01:04.259> it<00:01:04.320> allows<00:01:04.619> them<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.890> stay<00:01:05.160> within<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
but it allows them to stay within the

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.790 
but it allows them to stay within the
category<00:01:06.090> better<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.990> reasons<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.530> says

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
category better the reasons why it says

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.830 
category better the reasons why it says
SS<00:01:08.340> super<00:01:08.789> sports<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> has<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
SS super sports because this has got a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.050 
SS super sports because this has got a
big<00:01:10.320> engine<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.009> it<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> biggest<00:01:11.460> engine<00:01:11.940> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
big engine in it the biggest engine in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.870 
big engine in it the biggest engine in
the<00:01:12.149> LSA<00:01:12.539> fleet<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.289> far<00:01:13.590> at<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> hundred<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.729> 80

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

the LSA fleet so far at a hundred and 80
horsepower<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.780> time<00:01:16.020> limited<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
horsepower now it's time limited you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
horsepower now it's time limited you
can't<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.280> much<00:01:17.580> power<00:01:17.789> all<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.149> time

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
can't use that much power all the time

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.510 
can't use that much power all the time
in<00:01:18.780> flight<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.649> it<00:01:19.770> allows<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> thing<00:01:20.399> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
in flight but it allows this thing to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.070 
in flight but it allows this thing to
have<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.820> impressive<00:01:21.690> takeoff

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
have some impressive takeoff

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.660 
have some impressive takeoff
characteristics<00:01:22.800> and<00:01:22.950> they've<00:01:23.340> been<00:01:23.490> showing

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
characteristics and they've been showing

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
characteristics and they've been showing
it<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:23.970> here<00:01:24.210> we've<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.899> them<00:01:24.960> here

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it off here we've got two of them here

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
it off here we've got two of them here
at<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> show<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> they've<00:01:26.190> been<00:01:26.280> taken<00:01:26.640> off

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
at the show and they've been taken off

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
at the show and they've been taken off
and<00:01:26.970> climbing<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.539> like<00:01:27.720> homesick<00:01:27.990> angels

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and climbing out like homesick angels

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.230 
and climbing out like homesick angels
over<00:01:29.220> and<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.460> again<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.940> show<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
capabilities of that big engine cub
crafters<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:32.970> been<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> leader<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.630> mentioned

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
crafters has been the leader I mentioned

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
crafters has been the leader I mentioned
earlier<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.040> couple<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.369> ways<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.790> because

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
earlier in a couple of ways it's because

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.060 
earlier in a couple of ways it's because
the<00:01:36.299> last<00:01:36.450> two<00:01:36.720> years<00:01:36.960> they've<00:01:37.259> been<00:01:37.290> maybe

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the last two years they've been maybe

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770 
the last two years they've been maybe
not<00:01:38.310> first<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.850> they've<00:01:39.000> been<00:01:39.180> high<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
not first but they've been high on the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.149 
not first but they've been high on the
list<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:40.200> those<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.710> delivered<00:01:41.070> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
list of those that have delivered the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.469 
list of those that have delivered the
most<00:01:41.280> airplanes<00:01:41.670> last<00:01:42.060> year<00:01:42.240> they<00:01:42.390> were

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
most airplanes last year they were

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
most airplanes last year they were
number<00:01:42.780> two<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.680> position

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
number two they're in that position

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.859 
number two they're in that position
again<00:01:44.250> but<00:01:44.579> they're<00:01:44.670> only<00:01:44.820> number<00:01:45.180> 22<00:01:45.450> Cessna

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
again but they're only number 22 Cessna

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.260 
again but they're only number 22 Cessna
so<00:01:46.290> that's<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:46.710> impressive

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
so that's a pretty impressive

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.580 
so that's a pretty impressive
accomplishment<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.390> they<00:01:48.899> are<00:01:49.110> putting<00:01:49.380> out

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
accomplishment and they are putting out

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
accomplishment and they are putting out
about<00:01:49.799> three<00:01:50.280> airplanes<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.939> month<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.420> current

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
about three airplanes a month at current

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.240 
about three airplanes a month at current
records<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:52.469> a<00:01:52.590> mighty<00:01:52.829> impressive

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
records and that's a mighty impressive

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.550 
records and that's a mighty impressive
performance<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.540> LSA<00:01:54.960> space<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.409> this
