00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.779
 tickets sold to 1 video let's go to 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.270
 Munich 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.830
 let's go also to a murderer to all 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.860
 women over the years we are going to 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.690
 put 18 stabs with a katana and 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.299
 let's not blame the video games 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.789
 we are running to a young boy 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.009
 of 18 19 years seems to have 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.619
 stabbed with a katana 18 times as 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.960
 better than 31 years old and how has not been blamed 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.150
 to a video game is unoccupied final 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.679
 good fantasy is all this all this has 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.630
 been thanks to ignorance not perhaps 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.240
 part of which the kid left with a 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.130
 photo out there 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.720
 of a game called the world games with 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.820
 and to stop as what they have 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 interpreted that it was not from that game that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.850
 it was from final fantasy well they have said by 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.400
 good guilt of this game no 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.170
 because how is the kid of disguised 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.240
 this game in a photo well let's 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.410
 blame the game because because it throws it 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.030
 well we are going to close the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.010
 research that easy 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.050
 news like this one I think they're starting 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.940
 to leave almost every day we start each 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.390
 Once more we have more murders not 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.059
 but they begin to link more 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.509
 murders video games and this is 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.700
 very sad, very sad very embarrassing 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.280
 especially for a policeman or me 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.009
 It's embarrassing to be a police investigator or 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.530
 be it or police or whatever and really 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.140
 say this for good without investigating 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.690
 Nothing seems absurd to me, it does not seem so 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.820
 asshole that is to vomit and there's everything 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.580
 on the floor I would tell her what I do with my 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.080
 fucking job i'm doing 19 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.399
 you play the game the world was judged 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.929
 but hey it 's a people say that's why 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.770
 is a game that is not exactly 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:40.340
 violent and the truth is very funny is 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.690
 very funny the truth since put 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.550
 which is the game's fault that really is not 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.640
 it's that game and over blame in a game 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.350
 that really, well, there's no need to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.360
 put this kind of stuff 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.830
 truth the news is sad for several 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.229
 reasons not because a person has died 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.380
 31 years old because a son of a bitch a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.350
 fucking bitch wants to kill 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.360
 a woman with 18 stabs what good 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.600
 a katana for me are no longer stabbed 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.050
 they are swords for me that guy has 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.060
 to rot jail because you kill him 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.190
 of which he feels a stab worth 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.230
 I think you dare that way is from 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.970
 that you're wrong with the fucking head that 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.260
 they're wrong with the fucking head and they do not know 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.019
 deserves is something very bad they are already 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.040
 honestly you deserve something very wrong not 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.110
 you deserve the videogames this 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.310
 discredit because people really 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.620
 it's not like that in the center it goes down the street 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.019
 killing the truth a real shame 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.250
 a real pity for all for 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.590
 all reasons for all reasons 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.260
 what is life seems to be that is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.819
 forming that way and well I 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.969
 the truth 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.530
 My advice is to try I tried one year 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.299
 the world economy to elvis and the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.680
 videogames to see what happens to 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.840
 see if people are entrepreneurs a 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.420
 little bit of what's here 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.109
 good nothing more kids in the next 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.109
 life until next time
