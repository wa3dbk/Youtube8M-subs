00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 it was a real effort trying to enter 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.950
 I managed to get through the ducts of 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.040
 ventilation however there is more a grate and below 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.690
 I believe we are in fact two guards 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:18.180
 I prepare the gun and go on stage 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.240
 his hands both of you but search among them 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 you and then you must die 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 commercial continues definitely not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:43.469
 like this will be the last thing 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 you will see their minecraft demon girls 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 I'm piece 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.280
 today I am here to present you a new one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860
 fashion fashion or freeze secret agent mod 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.170
 let's start immediately let's see what's there 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.539
 introduces this new fashion this new one 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 fashion introduces us to clothing and clothes 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.059
 objects typical of secret agents 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.880
 let's go see the clothes in the meantime i 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.680
 clothes are called tuxeedo 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 there are six different variants 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.840
 the first the main one is the dress 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.090
 classic that kraft putting in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.869
 standard position of the armor the wool 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.580
 Black 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.540
 if we want there are also opens 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 the upgrade in lever iron gold chain e 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 finally diamond as a seacraft will suffice 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.890
 put the position to create the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.900
 hat and in the middle and the piece of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.939
 desired armor then of diamonds 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.890
 of aaron of gold however everything is done 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.579
 how they work 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.170
 every armor or let's say I live in one 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.700
 different defense then give us some 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.130
 different defense we try with the di 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 diamond we take a moment there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 creative and wear the perfect dress 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.920
 as you can see this is the general texture 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.570
 I must say that in my case anyway 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.300
 character is not very well because 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.060
 I swell a lot you see that is 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.240
 the body does not hold the body well also 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 hat a little bit ugly that is at least a 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 I don't like it anyway let's say if like 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.450
 defense is excellent 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.030
 I don't know if it equals the shipowner of 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.590
 diamond, however, I think so 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.650
 moreover this fashion introduces us to the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.500
 guns the guns have two types 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 there is different than the normal one 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.490
 kraft a using the airon or there is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.320
 the golden one that is kraft using 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.450
 we have to create a gun 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.920
 need three pieces land gang great 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.720
 dangan hammer helen dan langan burrell 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.370
 this also to make the nature of gold 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.260
 and anyway we will need the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.360
 bullets which kraft with one leg 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.680
 holder and a ningbo aero or a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.660
 gunpowder a goal of bots 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 these are the pieces look at the crafting 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 they are very, very simple anyway 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.960
 they are all on the official website from fashions 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.550
 which you will find in the description as 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.160
 it works let's take for example that of 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:58.440
 perfect gold loads with the right button 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.570
 let go and shoot as you see 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.820
 you don't see the blow this is a flaw 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.450
 of this fashion because if I for example 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.770
 shot I watched the blow I don't see 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.330
 get there you don't even see one 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.310
 pallino you don't really see anything e 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.770
 this in my opinion is a mistake that 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.390
 it should still be fixed because not 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.500
 it is also well known the trajectory that 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.260
 takes the bullet 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.209
 however, the belief that it is fixed is that it goes 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.280
 straight ahead 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.820
 they also exist however they are introduced 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.000
 other objects that are in my opinion 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.489
 fantastic 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.830
 we have the first that the treble is that 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.950
 it would be the launch hat we have 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.010
 let's say a self-destruct mechanism 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.110
 we have some say a mouthpiece that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.900
 they go so to walk to breathe 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.030
 underwater eyes and eyes 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 visual glasses to the splinter cell 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.989
 then we have a chuckles that he doesn't know 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.790
 old is good what it is anyway 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.650
 are those who use tipini already believed 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.690
 and do n't kill me if they aren't 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.790
 I don't know we have other midnight that 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.590
 it would be the throwing knife we ​​have 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.930
 then they are very, very much 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.780
 fine end we have the ex leather plug 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.990
 let's see how the thrombus works 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.150
 thus at sea ​​kraft thus has 3d 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.690
 blackpool and two by iron ingot the thing 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.000
 interesting is that a hat launch 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.110
 we can't wear it we launch it with 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.930
 right key 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.670
 as you can see they will remove 10 of life then 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.799
 not even for example to kill 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.510
 a villager we should pull them two 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.010
 hats while to kill anyway 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.650
 who only has a hat life of ten 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.530
 see and it is very, very strong that is 10 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.450
 is the yes I must say that it is a little bit more 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.790
 strong diamond spa even if 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.850
 really takes away 10 and then epic if 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.340
 we then have the mini air canister this 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.230
 here great for maybe missions 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.480
 underwater we put it in place of 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.560
 of the head, as you can see, takes away a bit 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.840
 defense 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.240
 look, it's a mouthpiece, let 's call it 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.480
 so and it gives us respiration 3 this is 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.090
 very but very useful for the fund and in 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.400
 the more it also gives us let's call it the night 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.110
 vision ie we see better underwater 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.500
 see if how I do this is not seen 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.690
 nothing 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.980
 if I put it the background becomes 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.890
 enlightened so this is one thing here 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.120
 interesting for this object 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.050
 we raise already seen games on the ground 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.690
 otherwise we end up more 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.420
 ok ok let's put my beautiful back on 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.610
 hat ok no I will not show you 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.230
 the knights vision on tv gold vision 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.430
 let's call them so kraft has it in this 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.169
 so I don't even show them there 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.210
 because they are fast once inserted there 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.400
 they will then give permanent nightvision 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.870
 useful for night missions now 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.730
 he is saying missions anyway it is 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.220
 fun maybe create I don't know about 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:36.100
 mini map or make battles 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:38.770
 with your friends , how good it is 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.970
 also equal to splinter cell sophisms 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.650
 too beautiful 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.630
 we have the young knife that sucks 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.940
 but at least it is beautiful because it is launchable 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.250
 the animation sucks, I repeat 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.200
 look at it, that is, it throws it just like that 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.390
 which makes no sense launches the thing 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.640
 anyway it's fine we have in a cha 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.260
 so we say they are more like a weapon 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.070
 they can be used as a weapon in this 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.560
 way 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.230
 as you can see they give 5 well not even so much 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.700
 however it is good as a weapon 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.550
 however I would recommend a spa of 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.710
 diamond we have the blue great thing needed 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.600
 the blue gun is the sort of blowpipe e 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.700
 gunfire poisoned art that you pick up in 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.010
 this way anyway there are all crofts 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.020
 here we shoot it and as you can see if 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.490
 I can catch her no now if she moves 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.229
 and we catch that as you see it 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.200
 hits poison I don't know for how many 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.220
 seconds however very strong we pass to 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.470
 this 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.630
 the one who shows you if you see it 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.980
 I show what happens when 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.960
 for example we are in critical situations 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.720
 right click boom 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.820
 we burst is strength and very very strong 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.880
 and it will destroy everything then 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.770
 let's say it's our last hope 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.240
 finally he takes it from the creative now 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.210
 we have the former plugin pen 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.920
 the explosion is very very useful for 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.660
 doing high jumps for example we run 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.360
 we make it explode under our own 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.670
 feet as you see it throws us forward 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.830
 this is the use we say overall 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.750
 that we had it so if for example the 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.760
 we remove cemetery in creative explode 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.920
 as you can see we die if we don't have a 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.480
 armor, however, the use would be its own 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.570
 how he had made me see that 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.640
 jump there anyway I remind you to put 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.050
 250 like I will publish a new fashion 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.060
 a video of the Syria border however 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.070
 I don't know what today 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.600
 I will publish my apologies if I am not yesterday 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.669
 managed to publish the third video 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.500
 daily but I arrived late at 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.850
 home didn't make it 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.590
 I remind you to write to the channel for i 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.910
 manors born on the next will come out in 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.020
 and see you in an upcoming video on a 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.590
 minecraft in a mode 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.590
 hello everyone guys
