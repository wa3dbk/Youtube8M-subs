difference<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.190> what<00:00:17.430> i<00:00:17.460> did<00:00:18.330> between<00:00:19.010> links

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
difference is what i did between links

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.000 
difference is what i did between links
and<00:00:20.250> dog<00:00:20.760> wizards<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.420> hope<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.650> right

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and dog wizards I hope I got that right

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
in it goes in pretty easy it comes out

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.350 
in it goes in pretty easy it comes out
easy<00:00:34.160> slides<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:36.140> slides<00:00:37.140> out<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.790> put<00:00:38.790> slots<00:00:39.149> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
easy slides in slides out I put slots in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
easy slides in slides out I put slots in
here<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> ride<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.590> both<00:00:40.739> sides<00:00:41.070> so

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
here for it to ride in on both sides so

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.799 
here for it to ride in on both sides so
it<00:00:41.370> made<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.760> easier<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.329> slide<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
it made it a lot easier to slide in and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
it made it a lot easier to slide in and
out<00:00:44.539> then<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.809> show<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:47.750> the

out then I want to show you that the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.189 
out then I want to show you that the
working<00:00:49.710> clip<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.489> done<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> far

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
working clip what I got done so far

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.250 
working clip what I got done so far
here's<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> base<00:00:52.879> here's<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> top<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:55.170> can

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
here's the base here's the top you can

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
here's the base here's the top you can
see<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.530> Hollow<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> base<00:00:57.480> slips<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:59.030> it'll

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
see it's Hollow the base slips in it'll

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
see it's Hollow the base slips in it'll
have<00:01:00.210> probably<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.170> pins<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.250> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have probably two pins one here one here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
have probably two pins one here one here
to<00:01:02.579> hold<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> base<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.510> dismantle

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to hold the base on so you can dismantle

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
to hold the base on so you can dismantle
it<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:05.159> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> slide<00:01:06.299> inside

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it it's going to have a slide inside

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
it it's going to have a slide inside
here<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.530> Springs<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.280> right

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here that is right on Springs and right

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.510 
here that is right on Springs and right
on<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.760> Springs<00:01:09.060> right<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:11.280> type<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
on these Springs right here this type of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.469 
on these Springs right here this type of
spray<00:01:12.229> I'll<00:01:13.229> stretch<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> little<00:01:14.070> bit

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
spray I'll stretch it out a little bit

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.520 
spray I'll stretch it out a little bit
then<00:01:15.479> I'll<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> base<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.439> would

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
then I'll have on the base there would

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.830 
then I'll have on the base there would
be<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> pin<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.220> slide<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
be a pin for it slide into and on the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
be a pin for it slide into and on the
top<00:01:19.049> there<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.350> pin<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> write<00:01:20.130> until

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
top there we pin for it to write until

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.230 
top there we pin for it to write until
they<00:01:20.520> stay<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.790> place<00:01:23.450> on<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.720> rails<00:01:26.030> I'm<00:01:27.030> on

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they stay in place on the rails I'm on

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.130 
they stay in place on the rails I'm on
the<00:01:27.900> hailer<00:01:28.110> wiki<00:01:28.890> says<00:01:29.130> uses<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> 7.62<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the hailer wiki says uses a 7.62 and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
the hailer wiki says uses a 7.62 and
halo<00:01:31.320> 1<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> halo<00:01:32.100> 2<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.700> went<00:01:32.880> up<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
halo 1 and halo 2 that they went up to a

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.469 
halo 1 and halo 2 that they went up to a
nine<00:01:33.990> point<00:01:34.290> six<00:01:34.590> six<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.970> i'll<00:01:36.090> probably<00:01:36.299> go

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
nine point six six so i'll probably go

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
nine point six six so i'll probably go
with<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> size<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> they'll<00:01:37.500> figure<00:01:37.680> out

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
with that size and they'll figure out

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.969 
with that size and they'll figure out
how<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.100> fit<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> clip<00:01:39.990> i'll<00:01:40.799> try

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
how to fit in the in the clip i'll try

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.710 
how to fit in the in the clip i'll try
to<00:01:41.040> have<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.340> done<00:01:41.549> tonight<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.299> ship<00:01:42.600> it
