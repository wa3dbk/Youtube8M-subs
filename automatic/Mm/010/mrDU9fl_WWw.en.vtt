00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.230
 and that's all I hope you now know 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.480
 a little better at what we do the 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.480
 numbers besides putting out fires 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.130
 good guys we continue with the day of the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.190
 professions and now it's the turn of 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.520
 neighborhood that will tell us what it is 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.520
 dedicate 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.860
 Hi, I'm Roberto, the father of Sergio 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.450
 and good yo 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.450
 right now I'm unemployed 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.490
 visions equipment and those 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 well let's say now my work 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.840
 is looking for a job 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 let's see you like football true 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.860
 Well, imagine that you are losing 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 40 but that has not yet finished the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.100
 party so you have two possibilities 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.600
 one give up and the second one is 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.800
 force them even more and try 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.800
 come back you would do as 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.180
 very good because that's what I'm 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.420
 doing 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.340
 try to overcome the opponent is very 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.590
 hard and you have to leave your skin and you have to 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.070
 do it as well as possible and for that there is 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.340
 to try even harder the key is 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.560
 in playing together attacking everyone and defending 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.920
 all because to win you have to play in 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.590
 team and that's why I have mine 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.850
 you are true forward 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.850
 you are a doorman 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.660
 You see all of you are part of the team 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.110
 the class are not alone all of you are a 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.970
 team help us to win well 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.000
 in life 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.820
 and a more important team how many of 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.150
 you eat daily with your 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.480
 grandparents 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.010
 how many come to alcohol accompanied by 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 your brother for your sister 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.950
 how many have an older brother who has 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.900
 returned to live at home 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.450
 how many of your parents or mothers 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 work and at the same time deal with the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.170
 house chores 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.310
 we are many who are playing the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.370
 most difficult party of our lives and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.569
 we need a team to overcome 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.969
 and I have a great team my family 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.549
 because they encourage me in the morning to 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.140
 get up because they take out a smile 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.610
 when I'm sad 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.690
 or I endured in the bad mood when 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.810
 I'm having a bad day 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.640
 we all put our shoulders together and we help each other 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.880
 as much as possible 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.420
 because if the grandparents the brothers the 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.310
 parents, mothers, even all of you 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.850
 many of us would lose the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.670
 match 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.860
 the important thing is not the position where 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.940
 you play but the letter player effort 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.930
 because despite the difficulties 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.930
 and the team is united 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.390
 because you can always trace
