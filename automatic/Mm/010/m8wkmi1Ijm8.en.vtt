00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
important because you don't have the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.420 
important because you don't have the
four<00:01:00.719> people<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.109> ton<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.949> zombies<00:01:02.280> that

four people that ton of zombies that
they<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.589> principles

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they have and so these principles

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.679

applied<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.760> basically<00:01:06.180> there<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.600> they

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
applied it basically there but they

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.910 
applied it basically there but they
still<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:06.990> apply<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> four<00:01:07.470> player<00:01:07.680> mode

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
still can apply to four player mode

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.760 
still can apply to four player mode
especially<00:01:08.340> i<00:01:08.369> believe<00:01:08.700> since<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.540> zombies<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to a certain level to open up the next

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
to a certain level to open up the next
map<00:01:14.509> something<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.350> interesting

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
map something that will be interesting

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.550 
map something that will be interesting
to<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:17.100> plays<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> for

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
to see how that plays out so this is for

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560 
to see how that plays out so this is for
about<00:01:19.740> rounds<00:01:20.100> 5<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.520> 10<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:21.540> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
about rounds 5 to 10 they're just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.969 
about rounds 5 to 10 they're just

feel<00:03:51.079> and<00:03:51.590> not<00:03:51.739> for<00:03:52.040> me<00:03:52.069> its<00:03:52.220> speed<00:03:52.459> Cola<00:03:52.669> first

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
feel and not for me its speed Cola first

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.020 
feel and not for me its speed Cola first
then<00:03:53.599> juggernaut<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:55.400> depends<00:03:55.699> on<00:03:55.729> the<00:03:55.819> map

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030

important on shi no numa than it is
under<00:03:59.900> ice<00:04:00.049> I<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.500> speed<00:04:01.069> coal<00:04:01.219> is<00:04:01.310> more

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
under ice I think speed coal is more

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.789 
under ice I think speed coal is more
important<00:04:01.879> to<00:04:01.969> get<00:04:02.120> first<00:04:02.389> but<00:04:03.139> then<00:04:03.469> you<00:04:03.620> got
