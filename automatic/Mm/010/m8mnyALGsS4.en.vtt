time I've had a couple Crimmins and a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.670 
time I've had a couple Crimmins and a
couple<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.580> blues<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.720> far<00:02:36.990> which<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.290> actually

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
couple of blues so far which is actually

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:49.070 
couple of blues so far which is actually
quite<00:02:37.980> good<00:02:39.560> no<00:02:40.560> that's<00:02:40.830> his<00:02:44.990> magic<00:02:45.990> logs<00:02:48.080> 11

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
quite good no that's his magic logs 11

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.870 
quite good no that's his magic logs 11
of<00:02:49.170> them<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.680> these<00:02:49.890> are<00:02:49.950> looking<00:02:50.459> like<00:02:50.670> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
of them so these are looking like a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.790 
of them so these are looking like a
obviously<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.900> spawns<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.440> lot<00:02:52.650> higher

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
obviously the spawns are a lot higher

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.530 
obviously the spawns are a lot higher
right<00:02:53.070> now<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.760> everyone<00:02:54.120> can<00:02:54.360> get

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
right now just so that everyone can get

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540 
right now just so that everyone can get
to<00:02:54.780> them<00:02:54.900> um<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.890> wouldn't<00:02:56.160> normally<00:02:56.340> be

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to them um that wouldn't normally be

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.120 
to them um that wouldn't normally be
able<00:02:56.640> to<00:02:56.820> if<00:02:57.000> they<00:02:57.120> were<00:02:57.180> super<00:02:57.480> crowded<00:02:58.130> but

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
able to if they were super crowded but

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.890 
able to if they were super crowded but
they<00:02:59.250> look<00:02:59.459> like<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.820> very<00:03:00.120> good<00:03:00.270> consistent

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
they look like a very good consistent

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.449 
they look like a very good consistent

I'm gonna start dropping some of my food

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.790 
I'm gonna start dropping some of my food
because<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.310> probably<00:03:20.670> don't<00:03:20.940> need<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.510> it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
because I probably don't need all of it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.370 
because I probably don't need all of it
um<00:03:22.940> especially<00:03:23.940> since<00:03:24.060> it's<00:03:24.239> close<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.660> bank

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.259 

um<00:03:28.380> so<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.160> special<00:03:29.489> attack<00:03:29.700> he<00:03:29.850> doesn't<00:03:30.120> seem

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
um so the special attack he doesn't seem

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.490 
um so the special attack he doesn't seem
to<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.450> doing<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.200> don't<00:03:31.350> know<00:03:31.410> if

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
to be doing it very much I don't know if

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.600 
to be doing it very much I don't know if
that's<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:31.739> I'm<00:03:32.040> killing<00:03:32.370> it<00:03:32.430> very

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
that's because I'm killing it very

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.440 
that's because I'm killing it very
quickly<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:33.769> if<00:03:34.769> I'm<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.220> doing<00:03:35.880> something

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
quickly or if I'm just doing something

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.840 
quickly or if I'm just doing something
right<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.019> don't<00:03:37.200> know<00:03:37.290> about<00:03:37.380> um<00:03:38.390> but<00:03:40.850> it

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
right that I don't know about um but it

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970 
right that I don't know about um but it
appears<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.330> be<00:03:42.420> going<00:03:42.510> pretty<00:03:42.660> well<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.230> know

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
appears to be going pretty well I know

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.410 
appears to be going pretty well I know
there's<00:03:44.280> something<00:03:44.489> where<00:03:44.910> when<00:03:45.060> he<00:03:45.150> starts

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
there's something where when he starts

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.150 
there's something where when he starts
hitting<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.720> really<00:03:45.989> rapidly<00:03:46.709> with<00:03:46.890> Mellie

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
hitting you really rapidly with Mellie

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.220 
hitting you really rapidly with Mellie

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
you use the flurry ability to counteract

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.170 
you use the flurry ability to counteract
it<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:51.810> fact<00:03:52.670> i'm<00:03:53.670> not<00:03:54.060> i'm

obviously I'm gonna try to pronounce
them<00:04:00.150> that's<00:04:00.959> my<00:04:01.170> feeble<00:04:01.620> attempt<00:04:02.130> at

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
them that's my feeble attempt at

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:11.330 
them that's my feeble attempt at
pronouncing<00:04:02.459> them<00:04:02.790> um<00:04:06.680> but<00:04:07.680> yeah

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.180 

the<00:04:12.340> kills<00:04:12.580> are<00:04:12.850> quite<00:04:13.210> quick<00:04:13.570> um<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.410> do<00:04:15.100> have

dragged<00:04:15.520> oars<00:04:15.730> and<00:04:15.940> I'm<00:04:16.150> assuming<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:16.690> do

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
dragged oars and I'm assuming they do

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.480 
dragged oars and I'm assuming they do
have<00:04:16.990> good<00:04:17.170> defense<00:04:17.680> because<00:04:18.100> they<00:04:18.280> are<00:04:18.460> a

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:18.490 
have good defense because they are a

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.890 
have good defense because they are a
high<00:04:18.910> level<00:04:19.210> Slayer<00:04:19.420> creature<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:22.060> high

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
high level Slayer creature and that high

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.390 
high level Slayer creature and that high
defense<00:04:23.230> usually<00:04:23.560> comes<00:04:23.770> along<00:04:24.010> with<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.190> um

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
defense usually comes along with that um

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.980 
defense usually comes along with that um
but<00:04:27.400> I'm<00:04:27.640> sure<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.060> would<00:04:28.180> be<00:04:28.270> fine<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.780> kill

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.679 

that's<00:06:22.789> approximate<00:06:23.300> it<00:06:23.360> was<00:06:23.449> probably

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:23.689 
that's approximate it was probably

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:26.799 
that's approximate it was probably
posted<00:06:24.050> a<00:06:24.139> 30<00:06:24.349> or<00:06:24.529> 40<00:06:24.800> k<00:06:24.979> but<00:06:25.159> that's<00:06:25.309> fine<00:06:25.809> so

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:26.809 
posted a 30 or 40 k but that's fine so

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:28.719 
posted a 30 or 40 k but that's fine so
I'm<00:06:27.110> gonna<00:06:27.259> add<00:06:27.439> everything<00:06:28.039> in<00:06:28.279> here<00:06:28.520> and

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
I'm gonna add everything in here and

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.119 
I'm gonna add everything in here and
just<00:06:29.240> tell<00:06:29.569> you<00:06:29.659> guys<00:06:29.779> if<00:06:30.080> this<00:06:30.289> is<00:06:30.499> a<00:06:30.529> good<00:06:30.680> way

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
just tell you guys if this is a good way

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.679 
just tell you guys if this is a good way
to<00:06:31.159> make<00:06:31.370> money<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.789> I'm<00:06:31.939> thinking<00:06:32.240> it<00:06:32.509> will

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:32.689 
to make money and I'm thinking it will

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.189 
to make money and I'm thinking it will
be<00:06:32.870> because<00:06:33.050> these<00:06:34.449> drops<00:06:35.449> are<00:06:35.629> stackable

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
be because these drops are stackable

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.980 
be because these drops are stackable
they're<00:06:36.439> consistent<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:38.680> yeah<00:06:40.569> so<00:06:41.569> I'm

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
they're consistent and yeah so I'm

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.019 
they're consistent and yeah so I'm
assuming<00:06:42.409> these<00:06:42.740> bones<00:06:43.069> are<00:06:43.339> worth<00:06:43.580> less<00:06:43.610> than

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:44.029 
assuming these bones are worth less than

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:45.249 
assuming these bones are worth less than
that<00:06:44.330> though<00:06:44.569> so<00:06:44.779> you<00:06:44.870> know<00:06:44.960> what<00:06:45.080> i'm<00:06:45.139> gonna
