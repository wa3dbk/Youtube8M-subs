00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 hello to all and to all 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 tactics we find ourselves for a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.640
 new video tutorial to know how to do it 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.490
 menu mode on mw2 so I 'm going in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 Gregory's company hello yes here 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.390
 hi to all so as you could 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.550
 see in the last video I have you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.399
 does download the archived narrates so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.190
 in and at the flat button so he 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.809
 try in this case and so you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.820
 will need a usb key that your 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.960
 usb key you the food &amp; in your or 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.829
 so here's gonna have time 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 that they open 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 that's where he's the file so I had 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.449
 already stuff you delete everything 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 which is in you put that slab and 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.879
 you drag the default button 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 that there are in the art figures that I have 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 provided down you will have it in this video 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.379
 even you drag all sedan and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.940
 that's it and we end up on the ps3 for 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.170
 or ford to make you see more 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.580
 excuse me right now 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.470
 so here's once you're on 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 the ps3 you join the person who to 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.460
 the cng infection and so you go in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.100
 split screen you create a new 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.000
 profile is if it has not already happened 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.330
 here I am a little confused 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.210
 paint brushes 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.200
 here you are chasing you put objects 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 playstation network 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.200
 yes it's primordial added yes that same 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.729
 moment you insert your usb stick into 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.409
 the right port I repeat in the port 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 right of your ps3 and you launch the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 part of which you start in the game 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.659
 and there you will see if you do 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 it's the ex it does not work so it's 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.439
 normal I'm going to stop the party 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.439
 you will return to multiplayer there 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.759
 so here we go back and multiplayer 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.570

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.970
