nothing<00:04:44.760> to<00:04:44.850> do<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> store<00:04:45.540> there<00:04:45.960> are<00:04:46.080> stores

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
nothing to do a store there are stores

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.570 
nothing to do a store there are stores
right<00:04:46.800> there<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.740> they're<00:04:49.979> in<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.160> locality

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
right there and they're in a locality

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
right there and they're in a locality
they<00:04:51.060> go<00:04:51.389> out<00:04:51.540> every<00:04:51.930> day<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.169> eat<00:04:53.330> and<00:04:54.330> bring

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
they go out every day and eat and bring

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.450 
they go out every day and eat and bring
in<00:04:54.780> pollen<00:04:55.350> they<00:04:55.530> were<00:04:55.590> fed<00:04:58.190> they've<00:04:59.190> got

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
in pollen they were fed they've got

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.870 
in pollen they were fed they've got
pollen<00:05:00.000> in<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.150> combs<00:05:01.280> there's<00:05:02.280> there<00:05:02.610> Paul

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
pollen in the combs there's there Paul

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.730 
pollen in the combs there's there Paul
and<00:05:03.120> Patty

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.920 

so<00:05:08.740> age<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.790> Queen<00:05:10.060> doesn't<00:05:10.330> seem<00:05:10.750> to

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
so age of the Queen doesn't seem to

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.530 
so age of the Queen doesn't seem to
matter<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.560> much

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.120 

now<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.170> big<00:05:16.470> question<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:17.100> are<00:05:17.370> these<00:05:17.670> combs

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
now the big question is are these combs

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.320 
now the big question is are these combs
contagious<00:05:20.130> I<00:05:21.770> have<00:05:22.770> been<00:05:23.010> reusing<00:05:23.640> them<00:05:24.000> year

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
contagious I have been reusing them year

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.300 
contagious I have been reusing them year
after<00:05:24.360> year<00:05:25.790> but<00:05:26.790> some<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.630> the<00:05:27.720> ones<00:05:27.990> on<00:05:28.320> the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
after year but some of the ones on the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
after year but some of the ones on the
reuse<00:05:29.910> combs<00:05:30.270> are<00:05:30.450> doing<00:05:30.780> fine<00:05:31.400> no<00:05:32.400> rhyme<00:05:32.940> or

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
reuse combs are doing fine no rhyme or

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.780 
reuse combs are doing fine no rhyme or
reason<00:05:33.740> I<00:05:35.630> give<00:05:36.630> up
