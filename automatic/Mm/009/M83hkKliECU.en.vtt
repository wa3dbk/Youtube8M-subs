actually made a video in a while but

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.020 
actually made a video in a while but
this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.160> products<00:00:11.730> I've<00:00:11.880> been

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
this is one of the products I've been

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.950 
this is one of the products I've been
working<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.889> it<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:14.969> not<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.719> sure

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
working on it is a well not really sure

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.689 
working on it is a well not really sure
what<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.289> call<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.500> don't<00:00:17.250> have<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> name<00:00:17.640> for

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
what to call it don't have a name for

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.830 
what to call it don't have a name for
yet<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:19.760> it's<00:00:20.760> pretty<00:00:20.910> bad<00:00:21.150> guys<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.510> can<00:00:21.630> see

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
yet but it's pretty bad guys you can see

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.029 
yet but it's pretty bad guys you can see
the<00:00:22.800> firing<00:00:23.340> system<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.970> uses<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.390> rail<00:00:24.720> system

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
the firing system it uses a rail system

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
the firing system it uses a rail system
with<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.070> short<00:00:26.400> firing<00:00:26.820> pin<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.570> actual<00:00:27.960> pin

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
with a short firing pin the actual pin

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
with a short firing pin the actual pin
is<00:00:28.769> just<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.330> blue<00:00:30.330> blue<00:00:31.019> blue<00:00:31.650> rod<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.669> length

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
is just a blue blue blue rod in length

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
is just a blue blue blue rod in length
as<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.770> can<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.750> so<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.780> allows<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.860> make

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
as you can see so that allows to make

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.670 
as you can see so that allows to make
the<00:00:38.190> barrel<00:00:38.460> longer<00:00:38.850> giving<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.930> more<00:00:40.110> power

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
the barrel longer giving it more power

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.600 
the barrel longer giving it more power
but<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:44.629> magazine<00:00:45.629> hold<00:00:45.960> six<00:00:46.559> shots<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:47.250> got

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but a magazine hold six shots I've got

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
but a magazine hold six shots I've got
three<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.940> there<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> three<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.899> here<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
three in there and three out here to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.360 
three in there and three out here to
show<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.850> eat<00:00:51.660> load<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.309> loading<00:00:53.309> is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
show you how I eat load it loading is

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.170 
show you how I eat load it loading is
pretty<00:00:53.610> simple<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:58.699> put<00:00:59.699> them<00:00:59.820> in<00:00:59.940> through

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
pretty simple just put them in through

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.910 
pretty simple just put them in through
the<00:01:00.300> front<00:01:02.149> and<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.049> continue<00:01:04.559> I'll<00:01:04.710> make<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the front and if I continue I'll make a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
the front and if I continue I'll make a
better<00:01:05.220> way<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> load<00:01:05.780> I'm<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.960> sure<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.260> I'm

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
better way to load I'm not sure if I'm

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.929 
better way to load I'm not sure if I'm
going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> keep<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.280> project<00:01:08.580> or

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
going to keep going with this project or

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
going to keep going with this project or
not<00:01:10.400> then<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.640> all<00:01:11.790> loaded<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:13.490> take

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
not then it's all loaded up just take

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
not then it's all loaded up just take
this<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.360> holds<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.650> pusher

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this so that's what holds the pusher

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
this so that's what holds the pusher
down<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> bottom<00:01:18.200> let's<00:01:19.200> take<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.560> out

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
down to the bottom let's take that out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.039 
down to the bottom let's take that out
and<00:01:20.240> snap<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:21.659> there<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.939> then

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
and snap it in right there and then

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.539 
and snap it in right there and then
firing<00:01:27.200> all<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.009> pull<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
firing all you have to do is pull this

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.260 
firing all you have to do is pull this
back<00:01:29.820> all<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.360> way<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:31.470> trigger<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.909> right

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
back all the way the trigger is right

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.720 
back all the way the trigger is right
there

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.330 

and<00:01:42.730> it<00:01:42.820> catches<00:01:43.030> right<00:01:43.450> there<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.680> top<00:01:45.130> of

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
and it catches right there the top of

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.010 
and it catches right there the top of
the<00:01:45.400> red<00:01:45.610> connector<00:01:46.120> I<00:01:46.300> don't<00:01:46.720> know<00:01:46.810> if<00:01:46.900> you

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
the red connector I don't know if you

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.040 
the red connector I don't know if you
can<00:01:47.110> see<00:01:47.260> that<00:01:47.500> but<00:01:47.730> it<00:01:48.730> catches<00:01:49.000> on<00:01:49.270> the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
can see that but it catches on the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.890 
can see that but it catches on the
bottom<00:01:50.440> part<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.090> blue<00:01:52.090> connector<00:01:52.390> for

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
bottom part of the blue connector for

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.500 
bottom part of the blue connector for
the<00:01:52.930> RAM<00:01:53.170> and<00:01:53.440> that's<00:01:54.400> how<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.640> trigger<00:01:55.150> holds

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
the RAM and that's how the trigger holds

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:05.460 
the RAM and that's how the trigger holds
it<00:01:55.630> in<00:01:55.750> place<00:01:55.780> but<00:01:56.640> this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:59.020> firing<00:02:04.380> got<00:02:05.380> to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
it in place but this is firing got to

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.150 
it in place but this is firing got to
get<00:02:05.590> an<00:02:05.680> amount<00:02:05.860> of<00:02:06.010> power<00:02:07.830> not<00:02:08.830> sure<00:02:09.009> if<00:02:09.100> you

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
get an amount of power not sure if you

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.540 
get an amount of power not sure if you
saw<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:09.429> but<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.660> ammo<00:02:11.200> actually<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:12.010> blew

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
saw that but the ammo actually just blew

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.020 
saw that but the ammo actually just blew
apart<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:14.040> again<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:17.700> don't<00:02:18.700> want<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:18.940> actually

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
apart and again I don't want to actually

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.430 
apart and again I don't want to actually
