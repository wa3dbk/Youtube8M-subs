 micro marie laure hombourg years in 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.130
 as an Ivorian I do not wish that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.050
 this situation happens and that she 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.700

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 and to all 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.630
 because every time you miss the crisis 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.220

 Ivory Coast who pays is the space 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.850
 who will really try it is a pass 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.469
 to arrange was not really not 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.060
 of redoubt and peaceful us one to 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.370
 other the cpi as we can 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.649
 we will not vote what we adhere to 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.780
 fields still calm when I when 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.579
 even two peace can work 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.660
 they know very well that the solution 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.100
 is not violence because he can 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.270
 not jostling the system that put in 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.270
 do not you put that bottom 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.280
 who would say the term has screwed up the maximum 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.450
 so that people are not 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.680
 quiet and no they are not 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.300
 quiet are not quiet 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.310
 we have all to merder we launched 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.660
 regatta but that's not the solution they 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.489
 stop and then well here's everyone going 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.020
 to his occupations the well-being will come 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.340
 with the instruments the development he 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.200
 have to throw the guys anyway on the 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.580
 football course nor is it someone 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.100
 who is a supporter of non-violence 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.870
 is it would take more than once for 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.280
 good that we do not begin unity the union 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 national it will take that time to see 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.240
 it starts with what this country deserves 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.130
 not what what it is 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.230
 therefore see today it must be said 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.580
 that both know that the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.479
 violence is not has ever been 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.670
 solution of a problem 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.170
 we are suffering we are gonna 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.970
 are still on the bench and our 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.560
 offspring 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.430
 what are they going to become so he 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.380
 both should 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.450
 understand this after he was no voice 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.270
 must live and good to endorse that for 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.530
 years of years after london is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.119
 the man passes the country stays and remains 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.190
 so a few hours after this 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.009
 violent attack of other Ivorians 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.050
 including district traders 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.289

 line where his problem is working it's 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.250
 that his steps in those days the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.459
 types not sitting there we it suits us 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.230
 not if it continues long since that we 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.490
 the economic operators we want then 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.260

 that our children can have 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.970
 work enough my major concern and that 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 will find a viable solution so that 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.540
 children can work and that 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.760

 circle the government takes some 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.280
 provisions that the government takes 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.540
 provisions for this so that everything 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.590
