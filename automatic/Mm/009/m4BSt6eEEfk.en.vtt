00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 for the ideal evening the victory and the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 causes that help us and rubs shoulders with 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.870
 Croatia was not enough for us 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269
 done there was concluded ticket the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 internship in the United States who criticize 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.490
 always besides that you do 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.350
 something or not they criticize 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.910
 always but I think we did the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.490
 things like we had to stop him 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.840
 fifteen days we did we are not 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 stayed in the same place that made us a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.210
 well crazy came together we varied the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.099
 football with the pleasure that brought together 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.560
 my fat and today they have been 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.050
 until then the rope of pain 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.940
 passers-by were born to smash them I loved him 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 everyone has been to the maximum of his 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.239
 possibilities because we knew that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 it was an important match is good it's 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.660
 for me for me it's well deserved 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 we have this opportunity we may have 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 still a lack of finish we have the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 opportunities we have if it was a match 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 difficult 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.489
 many duels whose victory is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 at the end but we are not in brazil 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.930
 still we had said that which ships 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.250
 it's getting closer like a husband I have not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.320
 said that it does not get closer I 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 screwed step we took three 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.609
 advanced points 1 go the brh but you know 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 very well how does it stay nine points 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 the Scots come from bats and 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.810
 Croatian so that means we will play 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.000
 the maires match final 8 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.500
 first no to France to hand over 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.390
 everyone up there right now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.119
 they are dancing and I have 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 directly a little calmed we will not celebrate 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 before we get this ticket so the bias 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.409
 we have not done hard that we have 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.350
 discovered a new facet also of 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.930
 red devils the realism 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.840
 I believe that moment given in place of 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.369
 throw in the ve 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.679
 when you score the first goal 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.000
 first action yes benteke we see 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.250
 we can not put the second one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.439
 wait a little we varied between wait 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.270
 low enough but all the spaces were 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.219
 closed we had a three against three 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.030
 in our game they were not able to 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.950
 to put us in difficulty 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.880
 except we indulge and then we got the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.780
 occasions we should have started 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.729
 shelter much faster 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 but it was precisely 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.689
 wait because we saw you on the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.189
 field and making signs to 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.579
 players before these advances go the 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.319
 search 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:58.240
 there is a certain moment so play his 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.189
 head know would you like to go out but I 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.229
 see that there is the engine and lack 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.099
 of gas to go out to go up 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.689
 go early in the season and now 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:06.429
 it's not the same thing but that I 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.019
 knew before returns now they have 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.739
 really are attached to it they've been 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.269
 to the end of themselves 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.310
 there they deserved vacation 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.709
 we are going to look 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.760
 on the screen the program that awaits us 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.290
 we know it will be a duel with the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.879
 croatia it will be in september 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.410
 ecos belgium meanwhile there at the 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.750
 serbia confronts croatia 1 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.030
 exactly when I saw this Serbian team 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.829
 is still excellent so from 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.099
 from there yes but I do not rely on 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.319
 other 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.549
 I'm counting on myself so it wants 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.530
 to say that we will go to Scotland in Iran is not 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.060
 that hang the three points we believe 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.040
 also at 6 so already celebrated the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.359
 qualification there listen up we're gonna 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.769
 affected at all when we have nothing for 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.780
 the moment so we go first now 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.100
 try to take match after match and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 we will try to win wherever 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.989
 we go 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.849
 you do not know how to play for a point of the day 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.380
 important it's over you died good on 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.609
 will play with our weapons with our 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.620
 way we will see the players 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.030
 already available who will be present because 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.130
 in this case it's normal so the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.180
 players answered marois did not play 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.220
 all the time now he's answered 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.319
 present dembélé there I would speak of a 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.760
 group of a belgian group and who 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.120
 created who lives together that's the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.120
 best things
