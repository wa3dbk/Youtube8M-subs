 30 to 6 car owner and all the rest 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.750
 players on the same show 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.920
 conduct a similar test 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.250
 special rules exist for 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.980
 cornering to go through it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.290
 okay the car owner must finish 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.690
 move within this turn as 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.959
 at least as many times as indicated 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.359
 a large number but turning the digit on 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.269
 green background the number of cells in turn by 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:34.209
 maximum trajectory it is red by 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.549
 minimum if the pain has passed the turn is not 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.120
 by making the internal indicated number 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.609
 stops it gets damaged loses 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.389
 one for each cell after 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.750
 turning 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:48.819
 until the end of the movement if it hurts 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.829
 made no stops at all 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.650
 turning with two or three or 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:57.639
 stopped just once on the turn with 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:01.900
 three he flies off the track and leaves the 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:03.849
 race pilot whose hurts first crosses 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.389
 finish line becomes the winner 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.870
 race but race ends only when 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:13.269
 all reach the finish line in the future players 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.699
 can complicate the game by several 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.410
 options for example add 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.889
 extra lap race with 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.990
 the need to check in on pit stop and 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.789
 damage points recovery by 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.340
 same rule but with small 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:30.159
 changes can be played in the street 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.060
 racing on a city highway in this 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.610
 player case 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.190
 nitrous oxide will be available but im 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.800
 will have to drive through various dangerous 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.130
 sections of the road and with a roar rush 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.260
 past the police station as soon as 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.389
 players will understand the basic rules 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.169
 they can go to advanced 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.240
 option 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.900
 which allows you to make this game 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.520
 much harder and more realistic each 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.919
 the player in this variation plays for 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.580
 certain character with his 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:02.400
 unique car properties and 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.990
 respectively a set of characteristics 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.790
 strength will be less abstract and 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.370
 represents specific parameters 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.860
 car in this mode appear 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.880
 weather conditions and many others 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.580
 race-specific aspects of formula d 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.169
 is considered to be almost the best

 racing board game

 variable rule is quite strong 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.160
 allow you to customize the complexity and 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.620
