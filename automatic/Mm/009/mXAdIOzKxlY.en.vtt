00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
let me make it a little bit difference

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.460 
let me make it a little bit difference
and<00:00:19.380> now<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.250> will<00:00:20.400> snap<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> same<00:00:21.060> way

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
and now you will snap it the same way

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.689 
and now you will snap it the same way
music<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> drive<00:00:23.220> from<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> title

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
music here so you drive from the title

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
music here so you drive from the title
and<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> side<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.859> how<00:00:25.980> has

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and just go to the side you see how has

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.150 
and just go to the side you see how has
the<00:00:26.460> frames<00:00:26.820> there<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> let's<00:00:28.769> let<00:00:28.980> that

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the frames there for you let's let that

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.410 
the frames there for you let's let that
go<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.140> same<00:00:31.140> thing<00:00:31.170> for<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.650> side<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.420> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
go and same thing for this side and to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.910 
go and same thing for this side and to
restore<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> windows<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.500> pull<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.770> down

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
restore the windows just pull it down

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100 
restore the windows just pull it down
from<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.250> title<00:00:35.550> bar<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.480> goes<00:00:36.630> back<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
from the title bar and it goes back to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.690 
from the title bar and it goes back to
its<00:00:37.530> original<00:00:38.460> state<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:39.120> guess<00:00:39.420> right<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
its original state I guess right the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
its original state I guess right the
center<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.120> same<00:00:42.360> thing<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.780> strike<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
center is the same thing you strike it

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.369 
center is the same thing you strike it
to<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> top<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.090> you<00:00:45.090> have<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:46.230> know

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
to the top and you have this you know

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.360 
to the top and you have this you know
full<00:00:46.800> screen<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.309> maximize<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.920> that's

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
full screen or maximize here and that's

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
full screen or maximize here and that's
how<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> do<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.449> nothing<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:51.899> new

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
how you do that so nothing really new

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.549 
how you do that so nothing really new
there<00:00:53.480> okay<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.440> an

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
there okay so the other one we see an

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.959 
there okay so the other one we see an
open<00:00:55.800> another<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:58.160> documents<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.789> have

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
open another one documents so we have

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.740 
open another one documents so we have
three<00:01:00.770> windows<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> same<00:01:02.750> dolphin

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
three windows here of the same dolphin

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.830 
three windows here of the same dolphin
so<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.769> i<00:01:04.860> hover<00:01:05.040> over<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:05.909> taskbar<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so if i hover over my taskbar here you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
so if i hover over my taskbar here you
see<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.939> arrow<00:01:09.090> p<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.659> thing

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
see you have the arrow p kind of thing

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.429 
see you have the arrow p kind of thing
right<00:01:10.340> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.930> good<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.229> with

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
right you know and the good thing with

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.530 
right you know and the good thing with
this<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.130> they<00:01:14.369> added<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.000> where

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
this is I think they added this where

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.140 
this is I think they added this where
you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.810> click<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> I'll<00:01:16.880> minimize<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you can click on it and I'll minimize it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.109 
you can click on it and I'll minimize it
like<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.830> see<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> ad<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> something<00:01:20.909> to

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like that see so the ad is something to

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
like that see so the ad is something to
that<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.710> think<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that also I don't think they have that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.300 
that also I don't think they have that
you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.490> windows<00:01:23.909> seven<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.159> there<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> go

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you know windows seven but there you go

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.469 
you know windows seven but there you go
there's<00:01:26.790> some<00:01:26.939> improvements<00:01:27.450> there<00:01:29.210> so<00:01:30.210> if

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
there's some improvements there so if

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.679 
there's some improvements there so if
you<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:32.030> requires<00:01:33.030> k<00:01:33.299> window

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you well this one is a requires k window

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.289 
you well this one is a requires k window
the<00:01:34.409> arrow<00:01:34.619> snap<00:01:34.950> thing<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> one

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the arrow snap thing and that that one

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.050 
the arrow snap thing and that that one
was<00:01:36.329> by<00:01:36.780> default<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> want<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.759> you

should<00:02:14.080> be<00:02:14.170> smoother<00:02:14.650> then<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.580> just<00:02:15.640> did

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
