00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
these techniques here's the thing though

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.820 
these techniques here's the thing though
if<00:04:26.270> you're<00:04:26.510> gonna<00:04:26.630> start<00:04:26.930> cooking<00:04:27.260> oil<00:04:27.500> free

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
if you're gonna start cooking oil free

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
if you're gonna start cooking oil free
using<00:04:28.130> these<00:04:28.400> techniques<00:04:28.760> like<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.090> water

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
using these techniques like the water

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.440 
using these techniques like the water
cooking<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.290> cooking<00:04:31.160> with<00:04:31.430> applesauce<00:04:31.850> and

cooking and cooking with applesauce and
sweet<00:04:33.020> potato<00:04:33.350> puree<00:04:33.980> then<00:04:34.639> I<00:04:35.000> think<00:04:35.600> it's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
sweet potato puree then I think it's

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.450 
sweet potato puree then I think it's
gonna<00:04:35.870> take<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.200> little<00:04:36.470> bit<00:04:36.680> time<00:04:36.919> to<00:04:36.950> get<00:04:37.250> used

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
gonna take a little bit time to get used

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.010 
gonna take a little bit time to get used
to<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:37.940> keep<00:04:38.150> that<00:04:38.330> in<00:04:38.389> mind<00:04:38.510> because<00:04:38.840> it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
to it so keep that in mind because it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.300 
to it so keep that in mind because it
definitely<00:04:39.350> took<00:04:39.470> me<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.680> little<00:04:39.800> bit<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.130> time

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
definitely took me a little bit of time

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.620

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
it is of high quality because the good

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.210 
it is of high quality because the good
stuff<00:05:11.000> tastes<00:05:11.870> better<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:12.530> it's<00:05:12.919> even
