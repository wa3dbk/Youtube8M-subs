00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
know when we pre print cards they

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.899 
know when we pre print cards they
typically<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.689> different<00:01:15.990> artwork<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.490> set

symbol something that differentiates
them<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.460> Japan<00:01:21.360> when<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:21.600> reprinted<00:01:21.900> these

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
them in Japan when they reprinted these

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
them in Japan when they reprinted these
they're<00:01:22.409> exactly<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.460> who<00:01:23.939> knows

they're exactly the same so who knows

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.910
