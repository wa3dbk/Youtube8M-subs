00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.500
 good morning this 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
 I got the theme of freehand drawing 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.019
 will be about four thousand channels ventura 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.349
 of all enrique 1 of mechanical and electrical engineering 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.239
 It is estimated that this group is not 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:24.789
 according to joan manuel serrat is the one that is done without using any 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.169
 auxiliary tool 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:28.710
 yes it is not like that with your hand 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.419
 and here was a similar sad moment 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.360
 it is also known as drawing 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.430
 olson 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.390
 I write known and faces 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.900
 but maintains the proportions 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.910
 in him all the drawing techniques are used 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.770
 as a hat 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.770
 chiaroscuro texture and exeter 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 as an example came with lazada a bidding and simple car 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.850
 good yes no 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.519
 the freehand drawing 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.149
 if in the whole drawing is made by hand even the drawing assisted by 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.480
 coordinator 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.040
 Well, to be 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560
 unless we give a program 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.250
 commanded for robberies 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.150
 we must accelerate the hands 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.500
 the 14th particularity 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
 will be precisely as its name indicates 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.230
 a raised hand hits the sasec 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.710
 necessary 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.880
 In the freedom that movement in the wrists 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.010
 for me to make this kind of drawing 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.560
 to draw the lines although mistakes employ group that 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.980
 it consists in supporting the hand on paper and thus it is arranged along the opa 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.610
 to reconcile straighter lines that keep her 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 is also known this feared as drawing trouble 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.010
 because they would not have any war min conciliate 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.530
 except in peace 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.430
 for breaking a horse 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.670
 cospedal 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.540
 the painting four 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.700
 center 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 and the hand 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.860
 the freehand drawing do not be this scale 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.319
 but it maintains the proportions to obtain them 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.670
 simple trick is employed like taking action with quindío delays 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.479
 helping with the actress 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.780
 and in these measures are terrassa 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.189
 paradoxes 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.829
 type of freehand drawing 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.980
 among the drawing techniques dawn 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.129
 We made several types 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.489
 drew in it denis natural I participate chorus pins 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.719
 cartoon 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:42.719
 and then we will define each of them 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.900
 the first artistic drawing refers to the time it is used for this is requested 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:50.509
 is 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.129
 feelings promotions 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.030
 the artist drew things not as they are but as a growing 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.109
 it's a kind of drawing that requires an innate talent 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.949
 that for example - with imagine cagno woman 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:09.789
 there is no more or less tone of the artist who has done this annual figures 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.029
 and a natural judge 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:19.379
 is the drawing copied by the flirtatious directly by observing a 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.959
 this type the drawing is worked with a model that faces 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.029
 Do not be like that 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.449
 and memory and if you try to copy g20 that what you have done 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.279
 for example 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.700
 finished from the author ceiling this collector 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.829
 Manila said Robinson 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.509
 the other hand in hand 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:44.339
 3 provided with a sketch is a fast and effective type of drawing 

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.660
 clear precise synthetic 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.049
 capture everything 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.249
 all the important details 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.049
 but in a way 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.349
 handcuffed without stopping to invest millions that I care about data 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.380
 the next they committed 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.839
 I partamento 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:05.839
 more or less validate as that colon department 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.629
 we knew 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.689
 caricatures that he retracted that exaggerates institutional support the 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:20.069
 physiognomy of the model the chemist his art consists in distorting the features more 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.059
 Marking of the person 

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:23.170
 those who 2 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.610
 distinguish at a general level are used for purposes 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.670
 very physical 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.059
 and can jump under that a person is not flashy 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.659
 but that are identified with the characteristics of his personality 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.749
 In the 70s, a drawing of 

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:41.020
 ricardo palma 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.389
 what is the caricature done 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.389
 however humorous 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.289
 now 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.289
 we invoke in architecture 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.719
 the architecture the freehand drawing I'm very interested 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.449
 in the part more presence in the 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.050
 miller tabak architectural drawing 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.059
 They are usually done with very intimidating means to all and everyday 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.599
 the physis the human 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.659
 fountain pen chesterfield freehand drawing 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.039
 nine holder 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.249
 if it is used to perform 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.479
 and choirs in the facts 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.699
 and they do it 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.809
 to work on these procedures stylized projections users 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:29.889
 and some work procedures to draw 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:33.300
 as taking orders 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.409
 the application of shadows and other details 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.219
 to consider 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.559
 the freehand drawing and a sketch is about capturing 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:43.819
 The geometry 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.620
 and to contribute the reality if before a simple drawing they can vote 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.620
 the first is key to the creation of a space 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.459
 both exterior and interior through the cross 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.639
 for example meat drawing we have 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.699
 future penélope and chile 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.849
 then the construction of a school 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.719
 the beautiful and 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.510
 like this filmmaker 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.169
 this what it means 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:11.360
 I play tectonic 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.270
 good 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.710
 that was all the time and the weather com and 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.719
 Your drawing show 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.529
 zero that you liked 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:19.979
 you will see
