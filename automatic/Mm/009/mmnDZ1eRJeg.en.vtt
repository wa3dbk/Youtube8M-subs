these will these these things lift

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.680 
these will these these things lift
because<00:00:47.360> they're<00:00:47.510> not<00:00:47.660> stuck<00:00:47.989> down<00:00:49.570> okay<00:00:50.570> and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
because they're not stuck down okay and

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.090 
because they're not stuck down okay and
this<00:00:50.780> is<00:00:50.840> this<00:00:51.170> is<00:00:51.290> basically<00:00:51.410> because<00:00:51.950> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
this is this is basically because the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.069 
this is this is basically because the
cake<00:00:52.250> was<00:00:52.460> left<00:00:52.640> for<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.790> few<00:00:52.850> hours<00:00:53.059> before<00:00:53.840> I

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
cake was left for a few hours before I

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.139 
cake was left for a few hours before I
started<00:00:54.559> putting<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:54.980> black<00:00:55.489> paste<00:00:55.789> on<00:00:55.969> so

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
started putting this black paste on so

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.110 
started putting this black paste on so
they're<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.719> white<00:00:56.870> paste<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.260> slightly<00:00:57.710> gone

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
they're the white paste is slightly gone

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.100 
they're the white paste is slightly gone
hardened<00:00:59.120> off<00:00:59.239> so<00:00:59.420> it's<00:00:59.539> not<00:00:59.690> sticking

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110
