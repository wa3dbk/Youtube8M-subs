00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.160
 we looked at the world the woman and here he sees 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.049
 March so from the PiS here 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.469
 Hausen 1 which is all 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.279
 but basically you can cruelly put the 1005p around a thousand five 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.400
 drive there we should actually have all the same housing 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.070
 as is the case again and again 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.249
 one percent changing the test data 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.800
 but if on comeback he can so whenever a combo shows you 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 how it works is easy 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.269
 is for cover 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.339
 looks like this Weisz 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.990
 and who just here 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.380
 which I loosen screw 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.230
 and then that could have lifted so much lift out 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.230
 and then it looks already this year with former 2 percent 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.910
 Of course we always have a gigabyte RAM presale from Asus 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.410
 your two wishes case that the maximum 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.630
 if you could install it just have to 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.250
 here are class this Mittal 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.590
 for the promises on the page where 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.470
 push it up to suppress hot soup 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.280
 and then automatically jumps out like this 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.170
 and I just that really hard outside 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 then we could see we have one here 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.860
 built around the value of 2 1 each 800 modules that if so bleed it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 threaten those in their 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.220
 where it takes her as well as in the same size with two gigabytes that 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.160
 theoretically could not be called 800 but also the Dr 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.950
 5300 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.870
 you can count on many different ones 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.190
 Mengkofen 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.790
 because pro for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.520
 20 to 50 euros or more 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.650
 if it's like a bomb and just here 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.700
 that's where Opel reaches down 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.260
 push in 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.420
 and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 so needed on both sides 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.090
 is firmly scheduled 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.300
 and then just have to motherboard 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.670
 that's a tough one 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 and you have already changed your frame 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.910
 So you do not want to lose the guarantee that you'll go for Max Mosley 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.310
 Shape the era 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.130
 if so then that is all his thing wanted to install a new hard drive 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.200
 wanted to change module or other 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.660
 then trickled 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.960
 then you have to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.140
 remove four screws here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.639
 some corners 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.639
 Let's not forget the screw I loose here very important 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.109
 And that is not all done projects with we are now 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.219
 doing five screws to six screws loose 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.849
 after that, hopefully not that way but never off yet 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:23.879
 Dischingen plastic cover here 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.879
 our keyboard 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.590
 First, do not get rid of the keyboard by using one 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.769
 plastic card 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.819
 so I'm just the one here because the three are arresting 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.149
 I would have to enter here and the whole life I am that you with 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:38.689
 that Wollitz accidentally has something the other 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.020
 Music either down screws but they do 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.599
 I do not recommend it 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.059
 Even with ladies are always nice because 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.919
 Voigt if it did not want to see 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:50.849
 is he starting from the top a lot reconciled here 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.329
 for four weeks 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.969
 here 4 here and there 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:56.749
 their percent 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.999
 with the press card, so to speak, as we have to and immediately awake 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.519
 then all the pros can 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.109
 Just take out Vienna 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 and here is the cable you see the phone summer out 

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.929
 a messenger is moored to himself that would be easy at Memmert 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.229
 Unlimited nature does not relax 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.809
 after all these students have chastity on top 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.090
 it could be removed by loosening another six screws 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.729
 or are you thinning? 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.359
 once here the 2 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.959
 "It's better, of course 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.599
 so here to 2 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.309
 then under this stick around it the warranty loses so the former 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.199
 You can not do it without damaging it 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.149
 as with the Christian Said 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:37.709
 So are at 3 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.629
 Here's another screw 4 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.369
 and then Lyon still 5 and 6 of the video not exactly here five and six 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:47.449
 if all the screws have loosened then Sam again the same principle 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.790
 same principle as before with Acer's Tour 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.790
 very delicious at the beginning it is enough to lift the whole thing so high 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.739
 that the card is pure and then roll up something similar it forms something 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.099
 harder it was just here with up to four cards just so important 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.639
 push forward and then 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:04.589
 how the whole thing is already 

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.589
 Hertha Plastik hooked on a scanned smile to show it briefly 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.610
 it is only here son Karl Stoss that a daring so not break off 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.309
 So we do not know 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.489
 and then it came to him and here, of course, the whole again in 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.939
 attached to the cable "We have an on / off switch and so on 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.059
 so that light will be up 

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:25.610
 for example, respectively 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.680
 now also have the mouse and the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.639
 exchanged 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.039
 Delia complete and cultivated 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.749
 after that remove crap the whole look like this with a feast of please 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.249
 which have expanded between 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.599
 which took a little longer, of course, ten minutes 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.400
 and the hard drive 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.900
 the ISS 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.030
 here should then be under this contest can sometimes loose on one side 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.059
 do 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:47.980
 us 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.270
 and solid at least one screw loose with you directly to the ball 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.749
 another one that has already demonstrated 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.639
 from other side where we took the arm out so not only here 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.300
 possible 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.520
 same with the first date Anneliese a screw 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.479
 take out 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.479
 and he could be the button 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.460
 the hard drive just peacefully thanks to these levers years to gut 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.559
 and there is also Kaba around it 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.699
 and that could be from just me all four screws of course on the sides 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:16.539
 from 8 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.809
 logically and then deported 160GB of Seagate hard drive 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.880
 the samples Momentus 5400 6 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.009
 5004 means she can only lead with 5000 and who and turn per minute 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:29.349
 that it is not that fast 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.199
 then data is nice and quiet and consumes less 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.909
 electricity 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.979
 for the current misery together 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.990
 otherwise an interesting fact still in the men's word 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.039
 we have one here 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.949
 Inscription or stands for him the commission that is to act here and it 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:47.749
 was postponed for a week 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.210
 because the sense card reader is here and you certainly could not do it here 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:52.030
 just insert 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.719
 and here's why there's still a bit of space under the design 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.050
 otherwise you can see 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.059
 here on one side will be the Interwetten 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:01.919
 Mühlhäuser more often than not 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.240
 and otherwise 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.009
 nice many transistors come and 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:07.009
 Rheine 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:10.499
 Wieland had the Bluetooth can monthly the timeless speak yes in front 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:12.819
 that was at the WTV 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.989
 with the couple Society she breaks 1 Pink 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.419
 around 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.340
 most but have fun with it and of course now assumes no liability 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.830
 that their deep geothermal energy does that
