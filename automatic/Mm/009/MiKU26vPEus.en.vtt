00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 polycrystalline silicon to 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.400
 1420 degrees Celsius special 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.630
 sealed furnace which is cleared from 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.630
 air argon 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.490
 then the resulting molten silicon 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 It spins in a crucible and the seed 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.930
 silicon crystals size and shape 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.420
 a resembling pencil plunges into it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.420
 spinning in the opposite direction 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.699
 until molten polycrystalline 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.860
 silicon cools off the seed crystal 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.270
 maiden and extract approximately by 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.270
 one and a half millimeter per minute 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.680
 the result is a solid 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.990
 silicon crystal weighing about 200 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560
 kilograms and a diameter of about 200 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.560
 millimeters 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.010
 the crystal is so durable that its weight 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.129
 can withstand 1 thread with a diameter of just 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:08.960
 three millimeters but he's fragile now 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.490
 it needs to be cut exactly to fit 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.840
 after chemical and fluoroscopy 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.520
 chesky study to check 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.229
 degree of its purity and molecular 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.659
 orientation it is loaded into the installation 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.330
 for cutting silicon this wire saw 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.460
 weighing 10 house using fast moving 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 ultra fine wire ribbons 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.680
 slice silicon wafer thick 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:39.780
 only 2 3 millimeters and at 99 99 and 99 and 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 99 percent free of impurities but 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.550
 after cutting on the surface of the plates 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.740
 microscopic defects remain 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 it means it's time to go polishing with 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.550
 using grinding 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.539
 but even after processing in this powerful 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.700
 sanding machine they are not yet 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.860
 fairly smooth so then them 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.430
 polishes one more time using 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.689
 chemical reagents 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.600
 the result is silicon wafers with 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.590
 surface roughness less than 0.1 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.180
 billion billion per meter now 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.579
 when they are polished to a shine on 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.579
 you can finally engrave the microcircuit 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.440
 place millions of transistors on these 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.090
 tiny plates work such 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.590
 chip makers like texas 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.800
 instruments 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.480
 in 1958 to the inventor of the integral 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.250
 chip jack kirby succeeded 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.820
 place on your scheme one 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.980
 transistor nowadays last 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.230
 generation uses almost a billion and in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.950
 according to law moore every two 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.660
 years capacity doubles 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.060
 Well, of course the more trying to increase 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.560
 the capacity should be less each 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.270
 the transistor in this model is over a quarter 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.570
 a billion with a transistor to someone 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.980
 will have to reduce them for her 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.750
 working with such microscopic 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.630
 parts put before manufacturers 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.400
 chips are a serious problem since 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.200
 only one transistor thickness 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.170
 ten thousandth of a millimeter even 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:16.240
 tiny dust particles can lead to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:18.190
 disaster so before such 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.620
 experts like dnb or will proceed to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.770
 work at the factory they wear protective 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.770
 suit 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.060
 here on the vader test we make 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.740
 chip yet we start with silicon 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.850
 substrate plates perform many 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.230
 various technological operations 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.880
 produced by our ordinary chips from 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.560
 beginning to end usually consists of 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.360
 about one and a half thousand separate 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.360
 technological operations 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.189
 shop area which is slightly 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.569
 less than 18 thousand square meters 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:58.340
 is clean room and class 1 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:01.069
 thanks to 12 tones equipment for 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.920
 air conditioning 10,000 times cleaner 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.020
 than surgical operating 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.540
 in one cubic foot of air equal to 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.360
 approximately 1 30 cubic meters contained 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.640
 less than 100 microparticles just one 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.380
 particle hit the most important 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.590
 plot of the plate is able to withdraw from 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.000
 building a whole chip to give you 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.860
 idea of ​​how this 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.930
 the room is clean I will say that only when 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.450
 walking every minute forms 5 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.100
 million microparticles 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.410
 so to avoid inadvertent 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.940
 pollution by staff stack blasting 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.890
 go through a difficult process 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.020
 component assembly in 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.440
 standardized frontal containers 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.720
 discoveries the main problem is how 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.740
 reduce complex patterns and make at least 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.740
 plate suit 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.059
 this is done using the process under 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.039
 photolithography name 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.669
 the plates are covered first 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.469
 photosensitive chemical 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.559
 reagents that harden under 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:03.610
 UV exposure 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:05.800
 sealed dark rooms 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.529
 ultraviolet passes through images 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.620
 then through diminishing lenses and hits 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.270
 on a reagent-coated plate 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.680
 when chemicals wash off the image 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.550
 stays just like when developing 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.550
 Photo 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.270
 but to place everything on the plate 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:27.940
 components add them layer by layer 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.940
 like floors in a tiny skyscraper 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.640
 to complete the work plate in 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.130
 containers run up to forty cycles and 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.210
 photolithography operations are repeated over 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.210
 each new layer 

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:47.210
 some layers heat up on some 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:50.599
 affect ionized plasma and 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.520
 some are covered with metal each 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.559
 the processing type changes the properties of this 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.020
 layer and slowly create part 

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:59.020
 puzzles forming a chip model 

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:05.149
 on finished silicon wafer sheets 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.339
 accommodates up to thousands of individual 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:10.449
 microchips and over 4 billion 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.449
 schematic components 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.729
 it remains only to cut and pack them 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:20.330
 and turning the sand circuit board 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:22.430
 completed that once there was nothing 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.009
 standing heaps of sand now can be 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.680
 sold for more than 17 thousand dollars 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:30.139
 per gram and is able to blink of an eye 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.619
 calculate the pi number with an accuracy of 1000 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:33.229
 signs 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:35.149
 the poet metaphysician William Blake argued 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.119
 that he can see the world in a grain of sand 

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:40.009
 but if he looked at her now 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:42.519
 once again by unconditional marvel 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.519
 more discovering a billion tiny 

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.519
 transistors
