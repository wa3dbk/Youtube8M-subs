came under attacks DDoS attacks by I've
heard<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:20.390> one<00:00:21.390> person<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.350> was<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> group<00:00:23.220> of

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
heard from one person it was a group of

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.040 
heard from one person it was a group of
people<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.820> Twitter<00:00:24.180> they're<00:00:24.539> kind<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
people on Twitter they're kind of a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
people on Twitter they're kind of a
group<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.500> Twitter<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.980> they're<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.640> going

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
group on Twitter and they're just going

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.019 
group on Twitter and they're just going
around<00:00:26.939> attacking<00:00:28.070> online<00:00:29.070> game<00:00:29.340> servers<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
around attacking online game servers and

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.610 
around attacking online game servers and
websites<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:32.600> runescape<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.899> obviously<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
websites and runescape is obviously the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.010 
websites and runescape is obviously the
major<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.280> they<00:00:35.399> did<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.020> basically

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
major one that they did and basically

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.260 
major one that they did and basically
it's<00:00:37.940> it's<00:00:38.940> interrupting<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> service<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
it's it's interrupting the service and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.430 
it's it's interrupting the service and
basically<00:00:42.270> it's<00:00:42.450> causing<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.170> become

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
basically it's causing people to become

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.619 
basically it's causing people to become
disconnected<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> game<00:00:44.910> while<00:00:45.390> they're

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
disconnected from the game while they're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
disconnected from the game while they're
doing<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.180> just<00:00:48.420> mid<00:00:49.280> you<00:00:50.280> could<00:00:50.460> be<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
doing you know just mid you could be in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.569 
doing you know just mid you could be in
the<00:00:50.789> wilderness<00:00:51.000> fighting<00:00:51.690> someone<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.350> then

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
the wilderness fighting someone and then

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.040 
the wilderness fighting someone and then
you<00:00:53.579> could<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.969> disconnected<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.840> they

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you could get disconnected and they

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.549 
you could get disconnected and they
wouldn't<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.219> end<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.460> dying<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
wouldn't and you would end up dying and

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.400 
wouldn't and you would end up dying and
people<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.649> complaining<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
people are complaining about that and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.050 
people are complaining about that and
there<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.739> no<00:01:02.100> rollbacks<00:01:04.430> which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> basically

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there is no rollbacks which is basically

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.950 
there is no rollbacks which is basically
they<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:09.090> server<00:01:09.360> gets<00:01:09.600> backed

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
they back up like the server gets backed

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.370 
they back up like the server gets backed
up<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.830> before<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.820> happened<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
up to before this happened but the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.999 
up to before this happened but the
problem<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.590> old<00:01:16.590> school<00:01:16.860> runescape

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
problem is is that old school runescape

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.320 
problem is is that old school runescape
does<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:18.740> backups<00:01:19.740> every<00:01:20.310> five<00:01:21.000> minutes

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
does not have backups every five minutes

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.740 
does not have backups every five minutes
or<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.140> apparently<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
or so apparently I don't know when the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.580 
or so apparently I don't know when the
backup<00:01:25.080> times<00:01:25.350> are<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.040> apparently<00:01:26.460> not

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
backup times are but it's apparently not

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.390 
backup times are but it's apparently not
not<00:01:28.590> like<00:01:28.950> every<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.780> every<00:01:31.400> month

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
not like every it's probably every month

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.640 
not like every it's probably every month
or<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.939> maybe<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.350> don't<00:01:34.560> know

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
or so maybe I don't I really don't know

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.620 
or so maybe I don't I really don't know
but<00:01:35.540> jagex<00:01:36.540> went<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> said<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.560> they

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
but jagex went out and said that they

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
but jagex went out and said that they
cannot<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:40.380> roll<00:01:40.619> backs<00:01:41.450> on<00:01:42.450> old<00:01:43.170> school<00:01:43.500> on

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
cannot do roll backs on old school on

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.889 
cannot do roll backs on old school on
runescape<00:01:44.790> 3<00:01:44.820> however<00:01:46.850> they<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.630> parent

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
runescape 3 however they can the parent

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.980 
runescape 3 however they can the parent
ball<00:01:49.049> sort<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> rollback<00:01:51.000> rather

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
ball sort of it's not a rollback rather

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.039 
ball sort of it's not a rollback rather
but<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:55.430> like<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.880> send<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
but it's a it's a like you send in a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.609 
but it's a it's a like you send in a

application but yeah a support forum and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.219 
application but yeah a support forum and
they<00:02:04.979> will<00:02:05.219> give<00:02:05.430> you<00:02:05.670> they<00:02:06.540> could<00:02:06.840> give<00:02:07.049> you

they will give you they could give you

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.670 
they will give you they could give you
your<00:02:07.890> items<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.819> lost<00:02:09.560> but<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.640> I

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
your items back that you lost but and I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.039 
your items back that you lost but and I
I<00:02:12.709> saw<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.459> don't<00:02:14.120> mean<00:02:14.269> to<00:02:14.299> call<00:02:14.599> it<00:02:14.719> a<00:02:14.780> rollback

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
I saw I don't mean to call it a rollback

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.500 
I saw I don't mean to call it a rollback
because<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.799> not<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.159> a<00:02:16.189> rollback<00:02:16.510> see

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
because it's not really a rollback see

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.300 
because it's not really a rollback see
what<00:02:17.659> happens<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.760> because<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:20.209> server<00:02:20.540> is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
what happens is because the server is

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.479 
what happens is because the server is
that<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.489> network<00:02:22.700> is<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:24.489> correctly

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
that the network is not correctly

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.880 
that the network is not correctly
functioning<00:02:26.140> sometimes<00:02:27.140> what<00:02:27.349> will<00:02:27.469> happen

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
functioning sometimes what will happen

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.729 
functioning sometimes what will happen
is<00:02:30.099> you'll<00:02:31.099> actually<00:02:31.340> get<00:02:32.560> sort<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.620> a

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
is you'll actually get sort of a

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.910 
is you'll actually get sort of a
rollback<00:02:33.980> because<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:36.049> server<00:02:36.290> was<00:02:36.500> acting

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
rollback because the server was acting

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.929 
rollback because the server was acting
up<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.340> it<00:02:37.549> wasn't<00:02:37.849> connecting<00:02:38.329> properly<00:02:39.939> to

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
up and it wasn't connecting properly to

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.089 
up and it wasn't connecting properly to
your<00:02:41.060> character<00:02:41.359> so<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.349> might<00:02:42.560> do<00:02:42.829> something

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
your character so you might do something
