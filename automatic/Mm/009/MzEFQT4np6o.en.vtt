aspect<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> physical<00:01:25.620> league<00:01:25.800> and

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
aspect of this is a physical league and

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
aspect of this is a physical league and
there's<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.060> times<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.630> had<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
there's going to be times when I had to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.390 
there's going to be times when I had to
get<00:01:27.990> down<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> try<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> yard<00:01:29.160> rushing

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
get down and try to get a yard rushing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.710 
get down and try to get a yard rushing
the<00:01:29.580> ball<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.940> think<00:01:30.150> James<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.510> going<00:01:30.660> to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the ball and I think James is going to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
the ball and I think James is going to
bring<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> dynamic<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> us<00:01:31.800> how<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> other

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
bring that dynamic to us how the other

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.060 
bring that dynamic to us how the other
packs<00:01:33.390> looking<00:01:33.750> obviously<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.350> make<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.010> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
packs looking obviously you make it a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730 
packs looking obviously you make it a
transition<00:01:35.610> from<00:01:36.080> jonathan's<00:01:37.080> offense<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
transition from jonathan's offense to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
transition from jonathan's offense to
this<00:01:38.010> new<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.460> seems<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.420> you're<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.750> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this new one seems like you're going to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.390 
this new one seems like you're going to
need<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.050> little<00:01:40.229> bit<00:01:40.440> more<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.860> running<00:01:41.369> game

have<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.430> rely<00:02:13.430> heavily<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.240> run<00:02:14.450> game<00:02:14.630> and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
have to rely heavily on the run game and

try to mature these quarterbacks into
and<00:02:17.180> make<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.600> feel<00:02:17.810> comfortable<00:02:17.840> when<00:02:18.410> they

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
and make them feel comfortable when they

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.770 
and make them feel comfortable when they
go<00:02:18.650> out<00:02:18.680> there<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.370> tight<00:02:19.940> situations<00:02:20.209> neck

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780

part<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.650> getting<00:03:27.010> back<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.370> what<00:03:27.490> we've<00:03:27.670> done

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
part of getting back to what we've done

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.580 
part of getting back to what we've done
this<00:03:28.000> is<00:03:28.210> you<00:03:29.020> know<00:03:29.140> these<00:03:29.320> type<00:03:29.560> of

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
this is you know these type of

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.080 
this is you know these type of
quarterbacks<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.160> we<00:03:30.340> have<00:03:30.520> are<00:03:30.670> similar<00:03:30.970> to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
quarterbacks that we have are similar to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.550 
quarterbacks that we have are similar to
what<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.210> had<00:03:31.420> at<00:03:31.510> West<00:03:31.720> Virginia<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:32.110> Oklahoma

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
what I had at West Virginia and Oklahoma

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.710 
what I had at West Virginia and Oklahoma
State<00:03:32.770> you<00:03:33.460> know<00:03:33.550> you<00:03:33.610> just<00:03:33.940> got<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.210> utilize

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
State you know you just got to utilize

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.960 
State you know you just got to utilize
their<00:03:35.320> strengths<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.490> know<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.700> got<00:03:36.880> to

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
their strengths and you know you got to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.700 
their strengths and you know you got to
take<00:03:37.090> advantage<00:03:37.390> of<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:38.230> know<00:03:38.350> what<00:03:38.530> they<00:03:38.650> do

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
take advantage of you know what they do

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.800 
take advantage of you know what they do
best<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.450> obviously<00:03:40.450> they're<00:03:40.660> probably

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
best and obviously they're probably

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.510 
best and obviously they're probably
going<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.080> be<00:03:41.140> more<00:03:41.320> pocket<00:03:41.770> passer<00:03:42.100> guys<00:03:42.250> but

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
going to be more pocket passer guys but

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.010 
going to be more pocket passer guys but
I<00:03:42.550> think<00:03:42.820> somewhat<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:43.330> mobile<00:03:43.630> enough<00:03:43.870> to

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
I think somewhat more mobile enough to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.360 
I think somewhat more mobile enough to
maybe<00:03:44.170> get<00:03:44.410> some<00:03:44.620> things<00:03:44.830> out<00:03:44.980> there<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.280> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
maybe get some things out there on the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.580 
maybe get some things out there on the
perimeter<00:03:45.580> enough<00:03:46.540> its<00:03:47.050> cover<00:03:47.230> your<00:03:47.410> roll

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
perimeter enough its cover your roll

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.450 
perimeter enough its cover your roll
time<00:03:48.250> is<00:03:49.260> tight<00:03:50.260> ends<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.710> know<00:03:50.770> that<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.280> an

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
time is tight ends you know that is an

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.790 
time is tight ends you know that is an
issue<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.850> when<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.240> have<00:03:52.390> cam<00:03:52.630> clears<00:03:52.930> 6

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
issue like when you have cam clears 6

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.340 
issue like when you have cam clears 6
foot<00:03:53.980> 6<00:03:54.220> 207<00:03:54.970> pounds<00:03:55.300> I<00:03:55.390> can<00:03:55.540> run<00:03:55.690> over<00:03:55.720> bass<00:03:56.140> I

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
foot 6 207 pounds I can run over bass I

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.690 
foot 6 207 pounds I can run over bass I
think<00:03:56.530> it's<00:03:56.650> pretty<00:03:56.800> smart<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.340> down<00:03:57.550> like

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
think it's pretty smart to get down like

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.780 
think it's pretty smart to get down like
that<00:03:57.760> bill<00:03:58.300> so<00:03:58.800> you<00:03:59.800> know<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.040> can<00:04:00.160> utilize<00:04:00.310> him

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
that bill so you know we can utilize him

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.030 
that bill so you know we can utilize him
in<00:04:01.030> different<00:04:01.840> ways<00:04:01.960> I<00:04:02.200> think<00:04:02.230> easy<00:04:02.560> guy<00:04:02.800> that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
in different ways I think easy guy that

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.120 
in different ways I think easy guy that
you<00:04:03.160> can<00:04:03.310> mix<00:04:03.490> personnelles<00:04:04.390> up<00:04:04.630> or<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:05.080> mix<00:04:05.980> up

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
you can mix personnelles up or a mix up

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.010 
you can mix personnelles up or a mix up
books<00:04:06.430> where<00:04:06.880> he<00:04:07.030> can<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.300> in<00:04:07.390> tight

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
books where he can be in tight

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.320 
books where he can be in tight
he's<00:04:08.470> also<00:04:08.680> good<00:04:08.980> enough<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.250> spread<00:04:09.490> out<00:04:09.670> so

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
he's also good enough to spread out so

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.120 
he's also good enough to spread out so
you<00:04:10.870> know<00:04:10.960> definitely<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.470> think<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.980> can

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
you know definitely I think you can

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.830 
you know definitely I think you can
involve<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.580> run<00:04:12.760> game<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.180> little<00:04:13.390> bit<00:04:13.510> with

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
involve the run game a little bit with

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.040 
involve the run game a little bit with
the<00:04:13.930> big<00:04:14.110> body<00:04:14.350> like<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:14.790> you<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:16.690> also<00:04:16.810> get

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
the big body like that you can also get

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.570 
the big body like that you can also get
out<00:04:17.140> there<00:04:17.350> spread<00:04:17.650> around<00:04:17.770> so<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.220> tithing

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
out there spread around so the tithing

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.430 
out there spread around so the tithing
is<00:04:18.610> going<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.880> be<00:04:19.000> pretty<00:04:19.390> much<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:20.320> we're

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
is going to be pretty much so we're

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.750 
is going to be pretty much so we're
going<00:04:20.530> to<00:04:20.620> do<00:04:20.709> what<00:04:20.890> we<00:04:20.920> do<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.400> think<00:04:21.640> we

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
going to do what we do but I think we

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.850 
going to do what we do but I think we
can<00:04:21.910> also<00:04:22.060> utilize<00:04:22.420> it<00:04:22.930> some<00:04:23.410> unique<00:04:23.680> things

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860
