Great A eggs.

00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:12.130
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Grade A eggs.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.690
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Grade B eggs.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.870
And finally, advanced AP eggs.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.580
So Miriam, what subject
will it be?

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.015
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Well, you know,
I think I'll try Grade A

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:25.760
eggs, Jeff.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.230
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Grade
A eggs, all right.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.310
Well, here is your question.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.170
You have two eggs.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.160
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Two eggs.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.820
JEFF FOXWORTHY: And you
add one more egg.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.720
MIRIAM CHASWICK: One more egg.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.420
JEFF FOXWORTHY: How many eggs
does that give you?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.095
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Oh,
that's a tough one.

00:01:40.095 --> 00:01:41.060
Oh, I don't know.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.780
Is it George Washington?

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.770
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Now remember,
Miriam, it is not a world

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.890
history question.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.930
It is an egg question.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.380
You have two eggs, you add one
more egg, how many eggs do you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.486
have all together?

00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:59.500
[BEEPING]

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.220
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right, well,
the chickens have locked

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.630
in their answers, what is
your answer, Miriam?

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.490
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Oh, I
have no idea really.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.630
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Would you
like to ask a chicken?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.810
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Yeah,
yeah, sure.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.250
I'll ask Megan.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.340
Megan, how much is two
eggs plus one egg?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.370
MEGAN: Buack, buack, buack.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780
JEFF FOXWORTHY: She says
three eggs altogether.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.110
Miriam, will you go
with that answer?

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.620
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Yeah,
sure, you betcha.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.460
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
that is correct.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.720
Two eggs plus one egg is
one, two, three eggs.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.045
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Woo.

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:38.580
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
good job there, Megan.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.810
MEGAN: Buack.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.466
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
next subject, Miriam.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.420
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Oh, I'll
take Grade B eggs.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.240
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
here is your question.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:56.290
You have three eggs and you add
three more eggs, how many

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.160
eggs do you have all together?

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.830
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Hmm.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.415
[BEEPING]

00:03:06.415 --> 00:03:07.610
JEFF FOXWORTHY: The chickens
are locked in.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.260
How about you, Miriam?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.200
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Oh, I remember
this one from

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.190
chemistry class.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.260
I think it has something
to do with hydrogen.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.385
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Not even
close, Miriam.

00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:20.170
Why don't you just
ask a chicken?

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.070
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Yep.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.410
You betcha.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.100
I'll ask Kyle.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.740
Kyle, how much is three
eggs plus three eggs?

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:33.050
KYLE: Bwok, bwok, bwok,
bwok, bwok, bwok.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.248
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Kyle
says six eggs.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:38.450
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Yeah, sure.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.336
You betcha.

00:03:39.336 --> 00:03:41.550
That's a one, six.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.260
JEFF FOXWORTHY: And
that is correct.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.100
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Woo.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.872
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Three eggs plus
three eggs is one, two,

00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:49.340
three, four, five, six.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.160
Six eggs all together.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.840
Smart answer there, Kyle.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.700
KYLE: Bwok.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.730
MIRIAM CHASWICK:
What about me?

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.500
JEFF FOXWORTHY: I think without
these chickens here,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.890
you'd have some serious egg
on your face, Miriam.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.360
Now, here's your
final question.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.460
The subject is advanced
AP eggs.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.811
Have many eggs are in a dozen?

00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.679
[BEEPING]

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.550
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Oh, a dozen?

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.970
How many eggs are in a dozen?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.240
I think it's somewhere
like kagillion.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.120
JEFF FOXWORTHY: Miriam,
do yourself a favor

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.700
and just ask a chicken.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.965
MIRIAM CHASWICK:
Oh, all right.

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:28.930
I'll ask Tandoori.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.860
How many eggs are in
a dozen, Tandoori?

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.698
TANDOORI: Cluck, cluck, cluck,
cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck,

00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:38.490
cluck, cluck, cluck,
cluck, cluck.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.530
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
Tandoori says there are 12

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.950
eggs in a dozen.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.375
MIRIAM CHASWICK: I'll
go with that.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.480

that is correct.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480
MIRIAM CHASWICK: Woo.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.870
JEFF FOXWORTHY: A dozen is 12.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.850
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.860
eleven, twelve.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.620
12 eggs.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.440
Very smart, Tandoori.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.210
TANDOORI: Ah, cluck.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.320
As for you, Miriam, you are not
smarter than an egg layer,

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.227
but you have won!

00:05:12.227 --> 00:05:14.135

JEFF FOXWORTHY: Miriam, you
have won a million buacks.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.858
MIRIAM CHASWICK: A
million bucks?

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:22.790
I'm rich.

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.722
I'm rich.

Miriam, no, no, no.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.316

of prize is this?

00:05:38.382 --> 00:05:41.044
JEFF FOXWORTHY: All right,
