here's<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:23.070> first<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> all<00:00:23.550> there

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699

was<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> calendar<00:00:24.420> shift<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.930> accounts<00:00:25.410> for

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
was a calendar shift that accounts for

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.160 
was a calendar shift that accounts for
about<00:00:25.619> 2%<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.490> labor<00:00:26.760> day<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.990> these

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
about 2% the labor day is in these

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.859 
about 2% the labor day is in these
numbers<00:00:28.590> that's<00:00:28.800> 2%<00:00:29.359> second<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.449> all<00:00:30.599> when<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
numbers that's 2% second of all when you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
numbers that's 2% second of all when you
go<00:00:31.109> down<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> numbers<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.219> all<00:00:32.369> then

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
go down the numbers they're all then

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.000 
go down the numbers they're all then
what<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:33.030> are<00:00:33.090> almost<00:00:33.300> all<00:00:33.510> red<00:00:33.890> when<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
what they are almost all red when you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.530 
what they are almost all red when you
look<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.280> all<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.579> red<00:00:35.820> numbers<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
look at all these red numbers you have

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.740 
look at all these red numbers you have
to<00:00:36.690> realize<00:00:37.050> last<00:00:37.350> year<00:00:37.649> was<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.829> catastrophe

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
to realize last year was a catastrophe

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
to realize last year was a catastrophe
down<00:00:39.750> double<00:00:40.170> digits<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> what<00:00:41.489> you've<00:00:41.670> done

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
down double digits so what you've done

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.880 
down double digits so what you've done
is<00:00:42.210> you've<00:00:42.510> done<00:00:42.540> worse<00:00:43.079> than<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is you've done worse than the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.630 
is you've done worse than the
catastrophe<00:00:44.700> my<00:00:45.510> arithmetic<00:00:45.930> says<00:00:46.710> that's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
catastrophe my arithmetic says that's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.560 
catastrophe my arithmetic says that's
terrible

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
terrible

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.380 
terrible
well<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.070> rate<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.579> decline<00:00:50.940> has

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
well but it's the rate of decline has

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.920 
well but it's the rate of decline has
slowed<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.320> sort<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.949> Obama<00:00:53.430> logic<00:00:54.120> he

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
slowed it's sort of the Obama logic he

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.439 
slowed it's sort of the Obama logic he
lost<00:00:55.309> 700,000<00:00:56.309> jobs<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.850> he's<00:00:57.030> doing<00:00:57.180> great

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
lost 700,000 jobs now he's doing great

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.279 
lost 700,000 jobs now he's doing great
we're<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.379> losing<00:00:59.359> 250,000<00:01:00.359> jobs<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we're only losing 250,000 jobs but the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.340 
we're only losing 250,000 jobs but the
unemployment<00:01:01.559> rate<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.820> up<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> 9.8<00:01:04.170> that's

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
unemployment rate is up to 9.8 that's

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.600 
unemployment rate is up to 9.8 that's
the<00:01:04.530> Obama<00:01:04.860> thinking

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the Obama thinking

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
the Obama thinking
I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.600> certifiably<00:01:07.320> mad<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:07.920> it's<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
I think it's certifiably mad but it's a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.350 
I think it's certifiably mad but it's a
way<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
way to look at it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
way to look at it
I<00:01:09.390> don't<00:01:09.900> buy<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.710> think<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.220> crazy<00:01:11.850> I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
I don't buy it I think it's crazy I

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.929 
I don't buy it I think it's crazy I
think<00:01:12.479> we're<00:01:12.689> worse<00:01:13.159> than<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.340> bad

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
think we're worse than the bad

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
enough to figure that out I look it's

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.870 
enough to figure that out I look it's

the<00:03:52.040> value<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.579> look<00:03:53.000> at<00:03:53.120> all<00:03:53.269> those<00:03:53.420> things<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
the value I look at all those things and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.140 
the value I look at all those things and
I<00:03:53.930> say<00:03:54.200> those<00:03:54.829> two<00:03:55.130> companies<00:03:55.639> are<00:03:55.790> in<00:03:56.120> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
I say those two companies are in the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.949 
I say those two companies are in the
crapper<00:03:56.569> I<00:03:57.579> ask<00:03:58.579> you<00:03:58.790> about<00:03:58.910> luxury<00:03:59.239> retailers

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
crapper I ask you about luxury retailers

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.740 
crapper I ask you about luxury retailers
as<00:04:00.139> well<00:04:00.350> because<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.670> logic<00:04:02.150> would<00:04:02.269> seem<00:04:02.540> to

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
as well because the logic would seem to

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.000 
as well because the logic would seem to
be<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.079> people<00:04:03.230> don't<00:04:03.530> necessarily<00:04:03.620> have

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
be that people don't necessarily have

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.280 
be that people don't necessarily have
money<00:04:04.190> for<00:04:04.370> luxury<00:04:04.670> right<00:04:04.819> now<00:04:04.910> however<00:04:05.450> we're

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
money for luxury right now however we're

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.110 
money for luxury right now however we're
hearing<00:04:06.560> from<00:04:06.799> consumers<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.910> they're

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
hearing from consumers that they're

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.210 
hearing from consumers that they're
going<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.720> luxury<00:04:09.079> stores<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.799> the

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
going to the luxury stores and the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.030 
going to the luxury stores and the
inventory<00:04:10.519> isn't<00:04:11.180> necessarily<00:04:11.720> there<00:04:12.139> so

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
inventory isn't necessarily there so

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.160 
inventory isn't necessarily there so
what's<00:04:13.760> your<00:04:13.940> view<00:04:14.120> of<00:04:14.150> those<00:04:14.750> kinds<00:04:15.139> of

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
what's your view of those kinds of

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.289 
what's your view of those kinds of
retailers<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:15.889> think<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.400> luxury<00:04:16.760> stores<00:04:17.120> are

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
retailers I think the luxury stores are

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.300 
retailers I think the luxury stores are
in<00:04:17.329> survival<00:04:17.780> mode<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.350> two<00:04:18.560> biggest<00:04:18.829> Saks

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
in survival mode the two biggest Saks

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.039 
in survival mode the two biggest Saks
and<00:04:19.519> Neiman's<00:04:19.940> now<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.539> numbers<00:04:20.930> I

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
and Neiman's now you see the numbers I

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.740 
and Neiman's now you see the numbers I
mean<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.590> losses<00:04:22.130> are<00:04:22.280> massive<00:04:22.760> as<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.450> Sears

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
mean the losses are massive as in Sears

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.520 
mean the losses are massive as in Sears
the<00:04:24.200> reading<00:04:25.039> is<00:04:25.280> massive<00:04:25.909> flowing<00:04:26.599> minus

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
the reading is massive flowing minus

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.670 
the reading is massive flowing minus

in<00:04:30.890> LA<00:04:31.159> I<00:04:31.460> mean<00:04:31.610> you<00:04:31.970> tell<00:04:32.240> me<00:04:32.270> where<00:04:32.630> they<00:04:32.750> go

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
in LA I mean you tell me where they go

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.659 
in LA I mean you tell me where they go
and<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.320> doesn't<00:04:33.680> now<00:04:34.220> what<00:04:34.490> are<00:04:34.580> those

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
and it doesn't now what are those

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.520 
and it doesn't now what are those
companies<00:04:35.180> doing<00:04:35.479> of<00:04:35.870> course<00:04:35.930> they're

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
companies doing of course they're

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.020 
companies doing of course they're
slashing<00:04:36.800> inventory<00:04:37.400> they<00:04:37.520> have<00:04:37.729> to<00:04:37.849> do<00:04:37.909> to

slashing inventory they have to do to

they're<00:04:39.080> cutting<00:04:39.320> back<00:04:39.590> capital<00:04:40.130> they're

they're cutting back capital they're
cutting<00:04:40.700> expenses<00:04:41.060> everybody<00:04:41.599> I<00:04:41.659> think

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
cutting expenses everybody I think

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.540 
cutting expenses everybody I think
that's<00:04:42.020> why<00:04:42.260> but<00:04:42.650> do<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:42.950> think<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.340> they're

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
that's why but do you think that they're

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.279 
that's why but do you think that they're
then<00:04:43.760> going<00:04:43.789> to<00:04:43.970> come<00:04:44.150> out<00:04:44.360> stronger<00:04:45.050> from

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
then going to come out stronger from

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.050 
then going to come out stronger from
this<00:04:45.320> because<00:04:46.010> they<00:04:46.370> have<00:04:46.520> taken<00:04:46.789> those

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
this because they have taken those

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.600 
this because they have taken those
measures<00:04:47.479> I<00:04:47.599> don't<00:04:48.110> I<00:04:48.289> don't<00:04:48.349> I<00:04:48.979> think<00:04:49.430> they're

measures I don't I don't I think they're

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.370

in<00:04:49.729> survival<00:04:50.240> mode<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.599> think<00:04:50.960> what<00:04:51.110> it'll<00:04:51.260> take

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
in survival mode I think what it'll take

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.210 
in survival mode I think what it'll take
for<00:04:51.950> them<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.370> come<00:04:52.760> out<00:04:52.909> stronger<00:04:53.770> if<00:04:54.770> sac

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
for them to come out stronger if sac

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.279 
for them to come out stronger if sac
