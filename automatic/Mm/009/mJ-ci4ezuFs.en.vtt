00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.070

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.790
 then let's go and put a bowl there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 sourdough if we add some 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 let's see it absolved then now let's go 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.390
 to add the flour a part 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.280
 let's have the rest of the water centered 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.610
 then we go to alternate water and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610
 flour 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.230
