is not the way you want to touch a star
I'll<00:00:12.540> tell<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> why<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.980> batteries<00:00:14.429> are

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
I'll tell you why the batteries are

from<00:00:17.880> summer<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.630> what<00:00:18.869> kills<00:00:19.170> them

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
from summer is what kills them

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.380 
from summer is what kills them

them<00:00:21.900> or<00:00:21.990> right<00:00:22.439> it's<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.460> whatever

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
them or right it's just for whatever

reason he really takes its toll on
batteries<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.609> batteries<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.119> not<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.480> much

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
batteries the batteries are not as much

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.450 
batteries the batteries are not as much
of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.990> issue<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> starter<00:00:29.340> you're

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
of the issue here is the starter you're

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
of the issue here is the starter you're
going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.820> destroy<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> starter<00:00:30.779> because

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
going to destroy the starter because

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.410 
going to destroy the starter because
you're<00:00:31.380> forcing<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.949> starter<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:33.149> fight

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
you're forcing a starter to to fight

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.660 
you're forcing a starter to to fight
against<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.110> motor<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.250> very<00:00:35.460> low

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
against a motor with just very low

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.010 
against a motor with just very low
amperage<00:00:36.030> coming<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> batteries<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
amperage coming out of the batteries and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.380 
amperage coming out of the batteries and
it<00:00:37.140> will<00:00:37.290> destroy<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> starter<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
it will destroy the starter now this is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.690 
it will destroy the starter now this is
the<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.780> want<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.110> truck<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.500> start

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.540 

here's<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> thing<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.469> old<00:00:49.680> batteries<00:00:50.280> if

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here's the thing the old batteries if

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.819 
here's the thing the old batteries if
you<00:00:50.610> push<00:00:51.030> them<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.469> start

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you push them and get out of the start

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
you push them and get out of the start
every<00:00:53.129> time<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.879> barely<00:00:54.210> okay<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.110> happens

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
every time just barely okay what happens

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.080 
every time just barely okay what happens
is<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.920> end<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.129> destroying<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> starters

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
is you end up destroying the starters

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.630 
is you end up destroying the starters
now<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:58.079> got<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> end<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.590> buying<00:00:58.800> batteries

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
now you got to end up buying batteries

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.459 
now you got to end up buying batteries
and<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> starter<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.809> maybe<00:01:00.989> bring<00:01:01.230> up

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
and a starter and you maybe bring up

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.880 
and a starter and you maybe bring up
starter<00:01:01.829> solenoid<00:01:02.039> -<00:01:02.930> what<00:01:03.930> happens<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.680> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
starter solenoid - what happens is is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
starter solenoid - what happens is is
that<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.250> sending<00:01:05.489> lots<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.030> amperage

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that you're sending lots of amperage

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 
that you're sending lots of amperage
with<00:01:06.810> low<00:01:06.990> voltage<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> starter<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
with low voltage into the starter and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.120 
with low voltage into the starter and
you<00:01:09.000> burn<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> armature<00:01:10.020> let<00:01:10.830> me<00:01:10.890> show<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you burn up the armature let me show you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.940 
you burn up the armature let me show you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
here and why they have to be healthy is

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.170 
here and why they have to be healthy is
that<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:44.100> only<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.430> they<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.729> crank<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
that not only do they have to crank this

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969

great<00:01:45.420> big<00:01:45.630> engine<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> cold<00:01:46.439> day<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:46.710> they

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
great big engine on a cold day but they

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
great big engine on a cold day but they
have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.250> actuate<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> glow<00:01:48.270> plugs<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> glow

have to actuate the glow plugs the glow
plugs<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> dead<00:01:50.009> short<00:01:50.430> right

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
plugs are like a dead short right

plugs are like a dead short right
straight<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.630> battery<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.649> sucks

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
straight to the battery and just sucks

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.480 
straight to the battery and just sucks
all<00:01:53.040> kinds<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> current<00:01:53.820> out<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.119> them<00:01:54.270> and

that<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.829> got<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.129> start<00:02:32.370> with<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.610> good<00:02:32.940> base

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
that you got to start with a good base

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
that you got to start with a good base
here<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.900> best<00:02:34.140> base<00:02:34.409> I<00:02:34.709> found<00:02:35.040> is

will spin the engine a little faster
than<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.099> old-style<00:03:38.519> starter<00:03:39.180> let<00:03:39.959> me<00:03:40.019> show

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
than the old-style starter let me show

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.449 
than the old-style starter let me show
you<00:03:40.260> what<00:03:40.379> they<00:03:40.500> look<00:03:40.530> like<00:03:40.889> over<00:03:41.040> here<00:03:41.250> on<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
you what they look like over here on the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.900 
you what they look like over here on the
table

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
table

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.729 
table
now<00:03:42.449> the<00:03:42.540> starter<00:03:42.989> on<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.260> right<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.650> very

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
now the starter on the right is very

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.099 
now the starter on the right is very
similar<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.639> late-model<00:03:44.879> 7-3<00:03:45.780> starter

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
similar to the late-model 7-3 starter

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.129 
similar to the late-model 7-3 starter
this<00:03:46.230> actually<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.799> 6.0<00:03:47.489> but<00:03:48.449> the<00:03:48.629> design

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
this actually for a 6.0 but the design

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.449 
this actually for a 6.0 but the design
is<00:03:49.349> almost<00:03:49.709> identical<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:51.629> older<00:03:51.930> style<00:03:52.459> 7.3

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
is almost identical the older style 7.3

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.490 
is almost identical the older style 7.3
starter<00:03:53.879> is<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> direct-drive<00:03:54.569> starter<00:03:55.379> and

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
starter is a direct-drive starter and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.770 
starter is a direct-drive starter and
they<00:03:56.129> were<00:03:56.190> good<00:03:56.609> there's<00:03:56.849> no<00:03:57.030> problem<00:03:57.599> with

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
they were good there's no problem with

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420 
they were good there's no problem with
them<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.530> know<00:03:58.650> there's<00:03:58.829> no<00:03:58.949> problem<00:03:59.160> with

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
them you know there's no problem with

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.159 
them you know there's no problem with
the<00:03:59.609> old<00:03:59.760> direct-drive<00:04:00.269> starters<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.019> they

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
the old direct-drive starters but they

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.369 
the old direct-drive starters but they
spin<00:04:01.500> at<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.709> lower<00:04:01.919> rpm<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:03.540> gear<00:04:03.810> reduction

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
spin at a lower rpm the gear reduction

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.860 
spin at a lower rpm the gear reduction
starter<00:04:04.859> actually<00:04:05.310> spins<00:04:05.669> a<00:04:05.819> good<00:04:06.030> bit<00:04:06.239> faster

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
starter actually spins a good bit faster

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.259 
starter actually spins a good bit faster
and<00:04:07.019> because<00:04:07.859> you're<00:04:08.040> cranking<00:04:08.459> it<00:04:08.609> faster

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
and because you're cranking it faster

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.150 
and because you're cranking it faster
the<00:04:09.720> high<00:04:09.900> pressure<00:04:10.169> oil<00:04:10.440> pump<00:04:10.859> and<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
the high pressure oil pump and the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.069 
the high pressure oil pump and the
compression<00:04:11.579> builds<00:04:12.060> quicker<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.959> it

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
compression builds quicker and so it

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.050 
compression builds quicker and so it
cranks<00:04:13.440> right<00:04:13.590> over<00:04:13.889> real<00:04:14.160> quick<00:04:14.519> nice<00:04:14.819> and

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
cranks right over real quick nice and

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.180 
cranks right over real quick nice and
short<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.389> fast<00:04:15.690> that's<00:04:16.500> one<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.949> keys

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
short and fast that's one of the keys

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.339 
short and fast that's one of the keys
that<00:04:17.760> I<00:04:17.789> found<00:04:18.269> at<00:04:18.510> getting<00:04:18.720> these<00:04:18.840> trucks<00:04:19.199> to
