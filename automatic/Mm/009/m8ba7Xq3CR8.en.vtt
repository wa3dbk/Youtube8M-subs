00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
how to vent r134a into the atmosphere so

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.410 
how to vent r134a into the atmosphere so
it<00:00:13.019> is<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> greenhouse<00:00:13.590> gas<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.549> supposedly

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it is a greenhouse gas it is supposedly

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
it is a greenhouse gas it is supposedly
illegal<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.949> United<00:00:17.100> States<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:19.189> if

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
illegal to do in the United States so if

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.150 
illegal to do in the United States so if
you're<00:00:20.400> gonna<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.270> sure<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:22.160> don't

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
you're gonna do it make sure you don't

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.910 
you're gonna do it make sure you don't
let<00:00:23.310> anybody<00:00:23.630> like<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> EPA<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
let anybody like the EPA see you do it I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
let anybody like the EPA see you do it I
guess<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> could<00:00:27.090> save<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.480> hundreds<00:00:27.900> or

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
guess but it could save you hundreds or

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.040 
guess but it could save you hundreds or
thousands<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.710> dollars<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.840> go<00:00:31.019> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
thousands of dollars so if you go to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.920 
thousands of dollars so if you go to
autozone<00:00:31.859> or<00:00:32.070> something<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.420> grab<00:00:33.690> this

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
autozone or something and you grab this

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690 
autozone or something and you grab this
stuff<00:00:34.260> thinking<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.520> real

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700

easy<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> end<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:36.989> overcharging

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.729 
easy to do and you end up overcharging
your<00:00:37.829> system<00:00:38.690> there's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> real<00:00:40.050> simple<00:00:40.320> fix

are<00:01:32.340> trying<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.820> first<00:01:35.970> place

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
are trying to do this in the first place

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.370 
are trying to do this in the first place
well<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> store<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.049> this<00:01:40.049> gauge

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
well from the store see this this gauge

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.800 
well from the store see this this gauge
right<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> should<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.259> been<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:44.009> like

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
right here it should have been on like

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
right here it should have been on like
85<00:01:45.810> 90<00:01:46.290> degrees<00:01:46.759> well<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.390> that's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
85 90 degrees well because that's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
85 90 degrees well because that's
temperature<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.350> outside<00:01:49.770> well<00:01:50.490> instead

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
temperature it was outside well instead

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
temperature it was outside well instead
it<00:01:51.540> was<00:01:51.869> down<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> red<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> took

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it was down here in the red now I took

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.999 
it was down here in the red now I took
that<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.420> fill<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.259> red<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
that as fill it up to the red and I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
that as fill it up to the red and I
didn't<00:01:56.340> know<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.820> blue<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.420> moved

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
didn't know that this blue thing moved

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.950 
didn't know that this blue thing moved
so<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.579> first<00:01:59.820> mistake<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.509> fold<00:02:00.840> it

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
so that was my first mistake I fold it

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.630 
so that was my first mistake I fold it
up<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> red<00:02:01.500> which<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.460> have

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
up to the red which it should not have

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.330 
up to the red which it should not have
been<00:02:02.790> there's<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> reason<00:02:03.390> it's<00:02:03.540> red<00:02:04.250> so<00:02:05.250> if

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
been there's a reason it's red so if

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.190 
been there's a reason it's red so if
you're<00:02:05.490> gonna<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.909> yourself<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:07.140> sure

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you're gonna do it yourself make sure

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.190 
you're gonna do it yourself make sure
you<00:02:07.590> go<00:02:08.520> inside<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.119> car<00:02:09.450> go<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.959> weather

you go inside your car go on weather
about<00:02:10.500> do<00:02:10.800> something<00:02:11.280> find<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
about do something find out the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.070 
about do something find out the
temperature

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
temperature

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.570 
temperature
make<00:02:13.200> sure<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:14.250> where<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.520> should

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
make sure this is right where it should

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.180 
make sure this is right where it should
be<00:02:14.870> because<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.110> will<00:02:16.320> screw<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.070> you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
be because you will screw it up if you

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.230 
be because you will screw it up if you
don't<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.630> if<00:02:18.690> it's<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.140> red<00:02:19.350> like<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.920> did

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
don't and if it's in the red like I did

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.940 
don't and if it's in the red like I did
make<00:02:21.240> sure<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.450> fix<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.050> understand<00:02:22.770> that

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
make sure you fix it understand that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.400 
make sure you fix it understand that
this<00:02:23.100> pressure<00:02:23.430> gate<00:02:23.790> or<00:02:24.090> this<00:02:24.360> little<00:02:25.140> gauge

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
this pressure gate or this little gauge

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.720 
this pressure gate or this little gauge
right<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:25.920> moves<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.080> so<00:02:28.730> definitely

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
right here moves to that so definitely

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.630 
right here moves to that so definitely
don't<00:02:29.940> screw<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.480> because<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.440> will<00:02:31.650> you

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
don't screw that up because you will you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.410 
don't screw that up because you will you
will<00:02:32.850> never<00:02:33.270> charge<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:35.240> symptoms<00:02:36.240> I'd

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
will never charge it so symptoms I'd

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.150 
will never charge it so symptoms I'd
knew<00:02:36.630> right<00:02:36.870> away<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.440> overcharged

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
knew right away that it was overcharged

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.760 
knew right away that it was overcharged
was<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.330> air<00:02:39.540> compressor<00:02:40.170> was<00:02:40.290> kicking<00:02:40.620> on

and off you can hear that because it

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
and off you can hear that because it
clicks<00:02:42.930> it'll<00:02:43.710> go<00:02:43.830> click<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.670> it'll<00:02:44.790> run

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
you could hear it and then click and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.210 
you could hear it and then click and
it'll<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.770> off<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:48.300> symptom<00:02:49.020> of<00:02:49.170> that<00:02:49.620> the

it'll go off and a symptom of that the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.400 
it'll go off and a symptom of that the
compressor<00:02:50.760> kicking<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.420> off<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.810> rough

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
compressor kicking on and off is rough

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.010 
compressor kicking on and off is rough
idle<00:02:52.680> like<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.160> was<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.700> from<00:02:53.850> 500<00:02:54.180> RP<00:02:54.900> and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
idle like I was going from 500 RP and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.910 
idle like I was going from 500 RP and
the<00:02:55.170> whole<00:02:55.320> way<00:02:55.410> up<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.910> 1000<00:02:56.910> rpm<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.920> that

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the whole way up to 1000 rpm and that

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.210 
the whole way up to 1000 rpm and that
was<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.900> incredible<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.959> me<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.560> could<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
was just incredible to me that I could I

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.900 
was just incredible to me that I could I
could<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.690> much<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:05.400> knew

could see that that much and I knew
right<00:03:05.940> away<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.570> overcharged<00:03:07.230> because<00:03:07.590> it

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
right away it was overcharged because it

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.340 
right away it was overcharged because it
didn't<00:03:08.880> do<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.120> before<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.570> did<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.370> so

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
my intake manifold and all over the

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.770 
my intake manifold and all over the
engine<00:05:26.219> all<00:05:26.400> over<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.669> belts<00:05:27.000> I<00:05:27.120> had<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.360> wipe

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
engine all over the belts I had to wipe

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.409 
engine all over the belts I had to wipe
that<00:05:27.810> off<00:05:28.020> even<00:05:28.620> with<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.949> rag<00:05:29.129> but<00:05:30.030> after<00:05:30.360> it

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
that off even with the rag but after it

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.019 
that off even with the rag but after it
started<00:05:30.779> to<00:05:30.840> do<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.279> then<00:05:32.279> the<00:05:32.729> air

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
started to do that then the air

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.839 
started to do that then the air
instantly<00:05:33.659> got<00:05:33.930> cold<00:05:34.199> it<00:05:34.469> was<00:05:34.650> instantly<00:05:35.190> it

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
instantly got cold it was instantly it

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.279 
instantly got cold it was instantly it
was<00:05:36.029> freezing<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:38.430> think<00:05:39.029> that's<00:05:39.240> where<00:05:39.539> it

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
was freezing so I think that's where it

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.499 
was freezing so I think that's where it
needs<00:05:40.529> to<00:05:40.650> be<00:05:40.830> I<00:05:40.860> don't<00:05:41.039> you<00:05:41.909> guys<00:05:42.029> can<00:05:42.330> mess

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
needs to be I don't you guys can mess

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.439 
needs to be I don't you guys can mess
around<00:05:42.539> but<00:05:43.020> that's<00:05:43.110> how<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.460> actually<00:05:44.460> get

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
around but that's how you actually get

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.080 
around but that's how you actually get
rid<00:05:45.719> of<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:45.990> so<00:05:46.289> if<00:05:46.650> you<00:05:46.830> empty<00:05:47.490> it<00:05:47.520> completely

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
rid of it so if you empty it completely

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.610 
rid of it so if you empty it completely
out<00:05:48.120> that's<00:05:48.810> up<00:05:49.020> to<00:05:49.229> you

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
out that's up to you

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.040 
out that's up to you
just<00:05:50.279> make<00:05:51.000> sure<00:05:51.029> you<00:05:51.330> use<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.719> valve<00:05:51.930> right

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
just make sure you use the valve right

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.170 
just make sure you use the valve right
because<00:05:52.800> you<00:05:53.340> wouldn't<00:05:53.580> be<00:05:53.639> watching<00:05:53.849> this

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
because you wouldn't be watching this

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.219 
because you wouldn't be watching this
video<00:05:54.389> if<00:05:54.750> you<00:05:54.870> didn't<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:56.629> make<00:05:57.629> sure<00:05:57.659> it's<00:05:58.050> in

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
video if you didn't so make sure it's in

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.110 
video if you didn't so make sure it's in
here<00:05:58.460> somewhere<00:06:00.620> you<00:06:01.620> could<00:06:01.800> even<00:06:01.979> fill<00:06:02.879> it<00:06:03.029> up

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
here somewhere you could even fill it up

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.519 
here somewhere you could even fill it up
little<00:06:03.449> by<00:06:03.569> little<00:06:03.599> and<00:06:04.020> then<00:06:04.139> just<00:06:04.319> keep

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
little by little and then just keep
