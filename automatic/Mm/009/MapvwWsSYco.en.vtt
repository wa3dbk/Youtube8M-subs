00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
March with some keyboards that I like a

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.589 
March with some keyboards that I like a
lot<00:03:00.500> even<00:03:01.010> if<00:03:01.099> I<00:03:01.220> do<00:03:01.280> wish<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:02.180> vocals

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
lot even if I do wish that the vocals

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:05.140 
lot even if I do wish that the vocals
were<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> bit<00:03:03.650> more<00:03:03.860> up<00:03:04.069> front<00:03:04.099> I<00:03:04.640> see<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
were a bit more up front I see the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.449 
were a bit more up front I see the
appeal<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.810> just<00:03:06.019> how<00:03:06.140> cavernous<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.980> distant

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
appeal in just how cavernous and distant

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.539 
appeal in just how cavernous and distant
and<00:03:07.849> deadpan<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.989> vocals<00:03:09.380> are<00:03:09.680> on<00:03:10.010> this

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
and deadpan the vocals are on this

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.300 
and deadpan the vocals are on this
record<00:03:11.000> but<00:03:11.569> they<00:03:11.900> do<00:03:11.959> kind<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.799> lose<00:03:13.040> their

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
record but they do kind of lose their

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.910 
record but they do kind of lose their
appeal<00:03:13.400> after<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.209> while<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.840> think<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.260> get<00:03:15.590> much

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
appeal after a while I think I get much

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.949 
appeal after a while I think I get much
more<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.400> thrill<00:03:16.670> from<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> odd<00:03:17.390> vocal

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
more of a thrill from the odd vocal

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.890 
more of a thrill from the odd vocal

point of this track it's a moment where
I<00:03:30.739> feel<00:03:31.069> like<00:03:31.239> haunted<00:03:32.239> horses<00:03:32.780> really<00:03:32.989> shifts

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
themselves from being a rock band to

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.710 
themselves from being a rock band to
just<00:03:35.540> some<00:03:36.109> kind<00:03:36.350> of<00:03:36.530> primal<00:03:37.160> noise<00:03:37.489> act<00:03:38.000> like

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
just some kind of primal noise act like

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.690 
just some kind of primal noise act like
these<00:03:39.019> are<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.230> kinds<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.709> terrible<00:03:39.980> sounds

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
these are the kinds of terrible sounds

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.550 
these are the kinds of terrible sounds
that<00:03:40.819> would<00:03:40.970> be<00:03:41.090> created<00:03:41.660> if<00:03:41.810> rock

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
that would be created if rock

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.860 
that would be created if rock

too really busy way more detail than
some<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.819> the<00:03:49.880> other<00:03:50.000> beats<00:03:50.239> on<00:03:50.480> here<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:50.959> I

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
some of the other beats on here and I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.830 
some of the other beats on here and I
feel<00:03:52.010> like<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:52.459> order<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.910> keep<00:03:53.120> things<00:03:53.420> very

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840

it<00:03:58.040> points<00:03:58.579> to<00:03:58.670> kind<00:03:58.790> of<00:03:58.910> play<00:03:59.180> into<00:03:59.420> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
it points to kind of play into the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.170 
it points to kind of play into the
aesthetic<00:03:59.900> of<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:00.709> record<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:01.670> still<00:04:01.970> there

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
aesthetic of this record but still there

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.699 
aesthetic of this record but still there
are<00:04:02.209> songs<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.870> void<00:04:03.079> where<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> beat

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
are songs like the void where the beat

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.400 
are songs like the void where the beat
is<00:04:03.859> oddly<00:04:04.130> danceable<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.359> closing<00:04:05.900> track<00:04:06.170> on

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
is oddly danceable the closing track on

is oddly danceable the closing track on
here<00:04:06.590> actually<00:04:06.769> features<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> beat<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:08.090> feels

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
here actually features a beat that feels

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.410 
here actually features a beat that feels
a<00:04:08.870> little<00:04:08.900> tangible<00:04:09.680> -<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.940> spots<00:04:11.239> like

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
a little tangible - and it spots like

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.849 
a little tangible - and it spots like
this<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.720> make<00:04:11.840> me<00:04:11.870> feel<00:04:11.959> like<00:04:12.230> maybe<00:04:12.680> the

this that make me feel like maybe the

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:13.990
