00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello how about friends and especially my 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 subscribers I hope you are well in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.400
 this new video tutorial I will teach you to 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.410
 how to detect or know that we have a virus 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.420
 using the task manager of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.420
 windows well let's start 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.599
 once had the video with extension w 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.810
 they go to the program and they give right click of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.810
 run 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.520
 there is also the command tab 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.520
 we put a and and we squeeze between 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.560
 Hello 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.850
 good to start if you suspect that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.740
 you have some kind of malware in your 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.630
 computer and you do not have antivirus or 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.820
 simply the antivirus that you have not 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.680
 he has detected it by simpler and dumb 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.040
 that the administrator of 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.540
 Windows tasks may be able to help you 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.339
 many times the values are executed 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.140
 since the beginning of the system and 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.120
 they find assets functioning as a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.860
 permanent process which makes the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.120
 antivirus many times can not 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.120
 detect them or eliminate them 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.250
 well to detect them in the description 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.530
 of the video I will leave you a link of a voice 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.700
 in my blog to learn more and from 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.680
 there will be another link that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.510
 redirect the site to inmotec and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.430
 where you can find lists of 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.350
 processes by name and get a 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.140
 description of what each one is for 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.729
 in its origin this is the website and well 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.320
 now to look for the processes 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.210
 malicious we turn to the 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.040
 task manager by clicking on it 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 right to the taskbar and start 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.330
 task manager 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.310
 here we choose what process we think 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.140
 strange to us I will choose the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.600
 window exe set that we know not 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.670
 it is a virus but a fundamental process 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.680
 in windows and well once chosen to 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 process we go to the page that 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.780
 I left them and in the search engine they write the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.790
 name of the process and they give to enter and 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.770
 well they will appear a brief info of what 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.810
 this process is treated and it will appear 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.509
 what is its function and precaution 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.030
 of virus is in English but for 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.590
 translate them I will leave you a very 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.209
 good for google chrome what 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.720
 we select and we give right click 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.160
 translate to Spanish and we can read what 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.959
 we translate the precautionary part of 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.880
 virus and it tells us in which route it 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.010
 found in windows point exe original 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.260
 of microsoft if you do not have it in 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.750
 the route that indicates the page eliminate what 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.940
 what will he do 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.040
 well we will do another example with another 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.810
 process and well we do the same what 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.700
 We write in the search engine and verify 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.660
 that exists and we see the little 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.760
 information that he gives us 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.560
 for example in the precaution of viruses 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.110
 Tells us which route you are on 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.760
 installed the process looking good in 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.040
 this first route has to be found 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.870
 the original process if it is in 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.120
 another is surely an intruder file 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.580
 and well now I will put one more s 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.040
 this process that we know does not exist and 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.019
 we give enter and he will give us this sentence 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.269
 in our computer you need a 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.269
 urgently cleaning that file not 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.459
 exists and that we analyze it already if you 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.590
 they have a virus and they want to eliminate it in 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.329
 the description of the video also gives them 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.220
 I will leave an excellent program that will 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.989
 help you scan your computer and 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.560
 eliminate the different threats that 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.420
 you own 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.519
 I also want to say that not always 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.019
 this sentence will come out if it's a virus 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.180
 known the one that you put in this search engine 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.190
 the information of that project will come out 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.959
 evaluate so you know what it is that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.380
 you have and what effects it has on the 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.320
 computer 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.810
