will show you how to make the top 5 10 G
come<00:00:06.930> into<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.319> opinion<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:07.950> far<00:00:08.250> um<00:00:08.550> if<00:00:09.269> you

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
come into my opinion so far um if you

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.850 
come into my opinion so far um if you
hadn't<00:00:09.599> guessed<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.320> beautiful

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
hadn't guessed from this beautiful

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.180 
hadn't guessed from this beautiful
ranges<00:00:11.750> okay<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.080> guess<00:00:13.590> we'll<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.009> have

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
ranges okay so I guess we'll just have

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.880 
ranges okay so I guess we'll just have
to<00:00:14.280> get<00:00:14.490> right<00:00:14.880> into<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.299> every<00:00:15.870> flag<00:00:16.379> one

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
to get right into it every flag one

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.140 
to get right into it every flag one
number<00:00:17.070> five<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:19.130> five<00:00:20.130> isn't<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> number

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
number five is this five isn't it number

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.450 
number five is this five isn't it number
five<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.109> one<00:00:22.289> over<00:00:22.529> there<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.189> just

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
five is this one over there it's just

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
five is this one over there it's just

command blocks you're going to put you

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.199 
command blocks you're going to put you
can<00:02:19.110> use<00:02:19.200> some<00:02:19.680> commands<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.430> summon<00:02:21.000> the

point<00:02:21.510> TNT<00:02:23.150> use<00:02:24.150> these<00:02:24.480> squiggly<00:02:24.959> line<00:02:25.170> things

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
point TNT use these squiggly line things

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.309 
point TNT use these squiggly line things
and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> numbers<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.850> sort<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.319> ordinate

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and then the numbers to sort of ordinate

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.040 
and then the numbers to sort of ordinate
where<00:02:28.470> you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.800> put<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.459> fuse<00:02:29.910> on<00:02:30.209> this

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
where you want to put the fuse on this

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.670 
where you want to put the fuse on this
last<00:02:31.319> one<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.770> 50<00:02:32.220> which<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.940> very<00:02:33.180> good<00:02:33.680> which

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
last one to 50 which is very good which

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.559 
last one to 50 which is very good which
means<00:02:34.920> they've<00:02:35.400> put<00:02:35.700> these<00:02:35.850> songs<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.180> 20<00:02:36.540> then

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
it will have a 30 views delay before

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.850 
it will have a 30 views delay before
