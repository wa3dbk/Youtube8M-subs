00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680 

so<00:01:20.580> I'll<00:01:20.670> play<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.940> through<00:01:21.060> twice<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
so I'll play that through twice the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:42.600 
so I'll play that through twice the
whole<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.470> part<00:01:22.710> sounds<00:01:22.800> like<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700 

and<00:01:43.120> obviously<00:01:43.330> Metallica<00:01:44.200> plays<00:01:44.410> that<00:01:44.590> on

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
and obviously Metallica plays that on

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.440 
and obviously Metallica plays that on
electric<00:01:45.130> guitar<00:01:45.370> not<00:01:45.520> an<00:01:45.670> acoustic<00:01:46.180> so<00:01:46.330> it's

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
electric guitar not an acoustic so it's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.480 
electric guitar not an acoustic so it's
going<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.660> sound<00:01:46.780> better<00:01:46.960> on<00:01:47.050> an<00:01:47.260> electric<00:01:47.680> but

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
going to sound better on an electric but

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.560 
going to sound better on an electric but
the<00:01:49.120> part<00:01:49.330> after<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.690> you're<00:01:50.530> going<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.570> this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
