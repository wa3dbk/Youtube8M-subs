which I got quite some time ago now many

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.320 
which I got quite some time ago now many
years<00:00:07.919> ago<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.340> friend<00:00:08.550> bought<00:00:08.849> them<00:00:09.030> for<00:00:09.179> me

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
years ago a friend bought them for me

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.240 
years ago a friend bought them for me
and<00:00:09.870> when<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.050> first<00:00:10.320> saw<00:00:10.559> them<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.800> wasn't

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
and when I first saw them I wasn't

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.470 
and when I first saw them I wasn't
really<00:00:11.370> sure<00:00:11.580> what<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> do<00:00:12.000> with<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.330> they

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
really sure what to do with them they

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.870 
really sure what to do with them they
seemed<00:00:12.750> kind<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.080> daunting<00:00:13.590> as<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> system<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.849> I

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
seemed kind of daunting as a system so I

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
seemed kind of daunting as a system so I
just<00:00:15.059> put<00:00:15.210> them<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.450> one<00:00:15.570> side<00:00:15.859> and<00:00:16.859> then<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
just put them to one side and then a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.590 
just put them to one side and then a
couple<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.580> years<00:00:17.760> ago<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:17.970> started<00:00:18.060> playing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
couple of years ago I started playing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.620 
couple of years ago I started playing
with<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> got<00:00:19.500> really<00:00:19.800> into<00:00:20.220> them<00:00:20.630> so

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
with them and I got really into them so

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.420 
with them and I got really into them so
I<00:00:21.660> wanted<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.140> show<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> format<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
I wanted to show you the format and the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.880 
I wanted to show you the format and the
way<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> cards<00:00:24.060> are<00:00:24.180> set<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> kind

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
way the cards are set out and the kind

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259 
way the cards are set out and the kind
of<00:00:25.949> formula<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.490> they<00:00:26.580> use<00:00:26.849> because<00:00:27.029> they're

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
of formula that they use because they're

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.320 
of formula that they use because they're
very<00:00:27.449> different<00:00:27.900> from<00:00:27.960> Tarot<00:00:28.699> there<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.820> 25

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
very different from Tarot there are 25

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.690 
very different from Tarot there are 25
cards<00:00:30.660> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> deck<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:32.219> come<00:00:32.489> with

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
cards in the deck and they come with

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120 
cards in the deck and they come with
these<00:00:32.880> split<00:00:33.480> pictures<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.350> these<00:00:34.860> four

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
these split pictures on them these four

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.790 
these split pictures on them these four
kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> different<00:00:36.420> halves<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.350> pictures

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
kind of different halves of pictures

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
kind of different halves of pictures
that<00:00:38.010> fit<00:00:38.460> together<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> other<00:00:39.149> half<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
that fit together with the other half of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
that fit together with the other half of
that<00:00:39.690> picture<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.739> you've<00:00:40.860> got<00:00:40.980> 25<00:00:41.460> cards<00:00:41.760> in

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
that picture so you've got 25 cards in

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.900 
that picture so you've got 25 cards in
all<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:42.780> actually<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.469> 50<00:00:43.950> images<00:00:44.160> so

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
all but they actually make 50 images so

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.610 
all but they actually make 50 images so
there<00:00:45.059> are<00:00:45.180> 50<00:00:45.480> possibilities<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
there are 50 possibilities for the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.580 
there are 50 possibilities for the
reading<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> works<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.320> kind<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
reading and the way it works is kind of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
reading and the way it works is kind of
like<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.430> lay<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.449> lay<00:00:51.629> all

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
like this you lay them out you lay all

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.319 
like this you lay them out you lay all
25<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.920> them<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.160> each<00:00:53.399> time<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.149> lay

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
25 of them out each time and you lay

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.080 
25 of them out each time and you lay
them<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.809> rows<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> five<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.789> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
them down in rows of five and then you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
them down in rows of five and then you
just<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.750> basically<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.710> which

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
just take a look basically at which

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.180 
just take a look basically at which
images<00:01:00.030> are<00:01:00.270> present<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> reading<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.160> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
images are present in the reading so you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
images are present in the reading so you
might<00:01:02.460> find<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.120> are<00:01:03.300> none<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.019> are

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
might find that there are none that are

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.980 
might find that there are none that are
actually<00:01:04.559> joined<00:01:04.890> together<00:01:05.129> straight<00:01:05.610> away

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
actually joined together straight away

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
actually joined together straight away
there's<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> anchor<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.700> been<00:01:08.880> joined

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
there's the anchor there has been joined

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.050 
there's the anchor there has been joined
together<00:01:09.860> just<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.189> come<00:01:11.460> out<00:01:11.490> kind<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
together just as it's come out kind of

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.219 
together just as it's come out kind of
thing<00:01:12.560> you've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.830> tree<00:01:14.159> here<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:16.080> can

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
thing you've got the tree here you can

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
thing you've got the tree here you can
see<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.619> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.009> made<00:01:17.250> an<00:01:17.369> image<00:01:19.850> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
see that's kind of made an image and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
see that's kind of made an image and
then<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.740> go<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.100> from

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
then what you do is you go on from

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.740 
then what you do is you go on from
looking<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> images<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.420> actually

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
looking at the images that have actually

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.830 
looking at the images that have actually
been<00:01:24.780> made<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> random<00:01:26.070> drawing<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.479> then

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
been made in the random drawing and then

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.090 
been made in the random drawing and then
you<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> have<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> have<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you kind of you have to have a little

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.480 
you kind of you have to have a little
bit<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.600> good<00:01:30.600> eye<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> go<00:01:32.250> on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
bit of a good eye because then you go on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
bit of a good eye because then you go on
to<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.509> images<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.140> be<00:01:34.170> made<00:01:34.500> from

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
to see which images can be made from

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.660 
to see which images can be made from
cards<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.490> next<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.820> each<00:01:35.970> other<00:01:37.670> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
cards that are next to each other for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.690 
cards that are next to each other for
example<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:40.009> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.390> make<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> owl<00:01:43.700> like

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
example here you can make the owl like

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.190 
example here you can make the owl like
that<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> goes<00:01:47.850> together<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.540> then<00:01:49.079> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that and that goes together and then you

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.969 
that and that goes together and then you
see<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> image<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> owl<00:01:50.040> come<00:01:50.399> up<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.979> I

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
see the image of the owl come up and I

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.789 
see the image of the owl come up and I
can<00:01:53.130> also<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.810> Fox<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.619> made

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
can also see that the Fox can be made

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.389 
can also see that the Fox can be made
here<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.899> you<00:01:57.899> can<00:01:58.110> shift<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.530> around<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
here so you can shift them around to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.580 
here so you can shift them around to
actually<00:01:59.820> make<00:02:00.000> images<00:02:00.240> from<00:02:00.960> cards<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.500> are

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
actually make images from cards that are

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
actually make images from cards that are
next<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> each<00:02:02.070> other<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.689> can't

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
next to each other but you can't

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
next to each other but you can't
actually<00:02:04.079> move<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.950> rotation

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
actually move them out of the rotation

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.459 
actually move them out of the rotation
so<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.570> cards<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.079> are<00:02:07.170> next<00:02:07.350> to

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
so it's got to be cards that are next to

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.809 
so it's got to be cards that are next to
each<00:02:07.619> other<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.729> an

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
each other but if you can see that an

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
each other but if you can see that an
image<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.360> be<00:02:09.509> made<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.959> them<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.190> can

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
image can be made with them then you can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
image can be made with them then you can
go<00:02:11.459> ahead<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.819> make<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> image<00:02:12.330> by<00:02:12.599> turning

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
go ahead and make that image by turning

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
go ahead and make that image by turning
the<00:02:13.110> car

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the car

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.340 
the car
around<00:02:13.710> and<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:15.660> know<00:02:15.750> it's<00:02:15.870> really<00:02:16.050> quite<00:02:16.320> a

clever I'm not sure you know if this is

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.210 
clever I'm not sure you know if this is
a<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.780> traditional<00:02:21.990> old-school<00:02:22.860> way<00:02:23.190> of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
this book is quite a lengthy in-depth

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.900 
this book is quite a lengthy in-depth
book<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.740> interesting<00:03:11.190> thing<00:03:11.220> about<00:03:11.400> it

book and the interesting thing about it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.820 
book and the interesting thing about it
is<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.540> gives<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:13.110> a<00:03:13.140> different<00:03:13.590> meaning

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
is that it gives you a different meaning

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.550 
is that it gives you a different meaning
dependent<00:03:14.730> upon<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.300> position<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.990> the<00:03:16.410> image

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
dependent upon the position of the image

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.340 
dependent upon the position of the image
so<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.459> image<00:03:17.490> can<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.800> upright<00:03:21.350> downwards

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
so the image can be upright downwards

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.770 
so the image can be upright downwards
facing<00:03:22.620> downwards<00:03:23.310> facing<00:03:23.520> left<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.360> facing

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
facing downwards facing left or facing

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.740 
facing downwards facing left or facing
right<00:03:25.020> and<00:03:25.350> for<00:03:25.890> each<00:03:26.060> way<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.390> picture

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
right and for each way that the picture

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.690 
right and for each way that the picture
can<00:03:27.930> be<00:03:28.130> you've<00:03:29.130> got<00:03:29.160> four<00:03:29.580> different

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
can be you've got four different

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.140 
can be you've got four different
meanings<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.530> let<00:03:31.650> me<00:03:31.740> show<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> for

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
meanings so let me show you so for

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.270 
meanings so let me show you so for
example<00:03:33.209> if<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.140> Fox<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.620> right<00:03:34.830> ways<00:03:35.040> up

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
example if the Fox was right ways up

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.480 
example if the Fox was right ways up
like<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.820> would<00:03:35.940> mean<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.390> thing<00:03:36.660> and

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
like that it would mean one thing and

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.640 
like that it would mean one thing and
then<00:03:38.490> say<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.510> we<00:03:39.660> were<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.930> get<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.170> Fox<00:03:40.410> like

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
then say if we were to get the Fox like

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.010 
then say if we were to get the Fox like
this<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.250> rotation<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.630> would<00:03:42.810> mean

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
this in the rotation it would mean

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.670 
this in the rotation it would mean
something<00:03:43.230> else<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.160> on<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:44.610> on<00:03:45.380> now<00:03:46.380> I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
something else and so on and so on now I

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.440 
something else and so on and so on now I
choose<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.280> actually<00:03:47.610> not<00:03:47.820> read<00:03:48.090> them<00:03:48.270> that

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
choose to actually not read them that

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.240 
choose to actually not read them that
way<00:03:48.630> I'm<00:03:48.840> not<00:03:49.050> so<00:03:49.350> keen<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.890> four

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
way I'm not so keen on the four

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.530 
way I'm not so keen on the four
different<00:03:50.670> meanings<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.330> four

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
different meanings for the four

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.750 
different meanings for the four
different<00:03:51.900> directions<00:03:52.470> purely<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:53.280> it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
different directions purely because it

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.270 
different directions purely because it
doesn't<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.150> feel<00:03:54.950> intuitively<00:03:55.950> right

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
doesn't really feel intuitively right

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.300 
doesn't really feel intuitively right
for<00:03:56.670> me<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:58.050> do<00:03:58.230> have<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.130> key

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
for me and I do have the the key

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.070 
for me and I do have the the key
meanings<00:03:59.760> in<00:03:59.910> my<00:04:00.030> head<00:04:00.209> for<00:04:00.420> each<00:04:00.510> picture<00:04:00.810> but

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
meanings in my head for each picture but

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.410 
meanings in my head for each picture but
I<00:04:01.110> really<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.830> go<00:04:01.980> with<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.220> flow<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.820> I

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
I really like to go with the flow and I

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.479 
I really like to go with the flow and I
like<00:04:03.900> to<00:04:04.050> see<00:04:04.230> kind<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.590> which<00:04:04.739> images<00:04:05.130> come<00:04:05.370> up

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
like to see kind of which images come up

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.430 
like to see kind of which images come up
first<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.239> me<00:04:06.390> what's<00:04:06.660> more<00:04:06.900> important

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
first and for me what's more important

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.320 
first and for me what's more important
is<00:04:07.560> which<00:04:07.770> images<00:04:08.250> actually<00:04:08.790> arrive<00:04:09.060> like

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
is which images actually arrive like

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.840 
is which images actually arrive like
that<00:04:09.540> from<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.959> random<00:04:10.320> shuffle<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.010> which

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
that from the random shuffle and which

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.850 
that from the random shuffle and which
images<00:04:12.270> do<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.510> need<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.810> rotate<00:04:13.020> to<00:04:13.530> get<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
images do I need to rotate to get to

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.190 
images do I need to rotate to get to
that<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.790> kind<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.330> what<00:04:15.750> I'm<00:04:15.930> really

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that that's kind of what I'm really

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.900 
that that's kind of what I'm really
interested<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.859> because<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.250> always<00:04:17.459> feel<00:04:17.700> that

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
interested in because I always feel that

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.490 
interested in because I always feel that
if<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.090> picture<00:04:18.390> needs<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.690> be<00:04:18.810> rotated<00:04:19.020> to

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
if the picture needs to be rotated to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.400 
if the picture needs to be rotated to
actually<00:04:20.030> make<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.239> image<00:04:21.570> then<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.200> might

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
actually make the image then that might

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.290 
actually make the image then that might
suggest<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:23.130> it's<00:04:23.550> something<00:04:24.090> that<00:04:24.210> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
suggest that it's something that the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.850 
suggest that it's something that the
client<00:04:24.660> has<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> blockage<00:04:25.140> with<00:04:25.500> or<00:04:25.710> it's

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
client has a blockage with or it's

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.960 
client has a blockage with or it's
something<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.310> perhaps<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.700> cry

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
something that perhaps the cry

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.720 
something that perhaps the cry
can't<00:04:27.330> quite<00:04:27.600> see<00:04:27.870> right<00:04:28.110> now<00:04:28.400> whereas<00:04:29.400> any

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
can't quite see right now whereas any

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.580 
can't quite see right now whereas any
images<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.330> have<00:04:30.420> come<00:04:30.630> up<00:04:30.780> full<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.380> the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
images that have come up full in the

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.710 
images that have come up full in the
random<00:04:31.920> shuffle<00:04:32.130> seem<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.120> be<00:04:33.240> kind<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.540> more

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
random shuffle seem to be kind of more

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.480 
random shuffle seem to be kind of more
obvious<00:04:34.140> messages<00:04:34.650> or<00:04:34.860> more<00:04:35.040> present

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
obvious messages or more present

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.640 
obvious messages or more present
energies<00:04:35.940> at<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> time<00:04:36.450> of<00:04:36.600> the<00:04:36.690> reading<00:04:37.050> so

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
energies at the time of the reading so

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.770 
energies at the time of the reading so
that's<00:04:37.830> kind<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.100> how<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.490> it<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.030> that's

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
that's kind of how I do it and that's

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.050 
that's kind of how I do it and that's
how<00:04:39.840> I<00:04:39.960> prefer<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.650> but<00:04:41.220> they<00:04:41.370> do<00:04:41.430> actually

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
how I prefer it but they do actually

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.760 
how I prefer it but they do actually
have<00:04:42.180> different<00:04:42.600> meanings<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.350> book<00:04:43.560> they

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
have different meanings in the book they

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.050 
have different meanings in the book they
do<00:04:43.830> take<00:04:44.250> you<00:04:44.400> through<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.730> different

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
do take you through the different

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.810 
do take you through the different
meanings<00:04:45.390> for<00:04:45.570> upright<00:04:46.280> upside<00:04:47.280> down<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
meanings for upright upside down and

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.730 
meanings for upright upside down and
then<00:04:47.940> left<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.300> right<00:04:48.480> as<00:04:48.630> well<00:04:48.900> but<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.500> must

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
then left and right as well but I must

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.440 
then left and right as well but I must
say<00:04:49.890> those<00:04:50.070> meanings<00:04:50.490> are<00:04:50.610> quite<00:04:50.850> mechanistic

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
say those meanings are quite mechanistic

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.730 
say those meanings are quite mechanistic
in<00:04:51.570> this<00:04:51.720> book<00:04:51.900> which<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.170> another<00:04:52.350> reason

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
in this book which is another reason

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.800 
in this book which is another reason
that<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.860> don't<00:04:53.070> really<00:04:53.490> favor<00:04:53.820> that

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
that I don't really favor that

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.500 
that I don't really favor that
particular<00:04:55.610> way<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.730> doing<00:04:57.030> things<00:04:57.270> I'll<00:04:57.480> just

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
particular way of doing things I'll just

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.170 
particular way of doing things I'll just
show<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.810> some<00:04:57.930> of<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.260> other<00:04:58.350> images<00:04:58.620> that

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
show you some of the other images that

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.250 
show you some of the other images that
are<00:05:00.560> around<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.770> this<00:05:01.890> deck<00:05:02.190> so<00:05:02.220> you've<00:05:02.580> got

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.040 
are around in this deck so you've got

you've got a horse here is one of the

you've got a horse here is one of the
one<00:05:07.050> of<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.200> pictures<00:05:08.130> you<00:05:08.160> can<00:05:08.460> get<00:05:09.590> what

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
one of the pictures you can get what

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.820 
one of the pictures you can get what
else<00:05:10.740> can<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.040> see<00:05:12.080> where's<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.260> Sun<00:05:13.530> I<00:05:13.560> like

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830

else can I see where's the Sun I like
here<00:05:14.160> me<00:05:14.310> such<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.580> happy<00:05:14.880> chap<00:05:15.800> not<00:05:16.800> sure<00:05:17.010> where

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
here me such a happy chap not sure where

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.210 
here me such a happy chap not sure where
the<00:05:17.250> other<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:17.610> of<00:05:17.730> him<00:05:17.880> is<00:05:18.950> but<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.070> know

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
the other one of him is but you know

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.550 
the other one of him is but you know
they're<00:05:20.430> very<00:05:20.460> playful<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.600> they<00:05:22.140> do<00:05:22.200> follow

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
they're very playful and they do follow

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.940 
they're very playful and they do follow
a<00:05:22.740> completely<00:05:23.310> different<00:05:24.260> kind<00:05:25.260> of<00:05:25.380> system<00:05:25.800> to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
a completely different kind of system to

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.560 
a completely different kind of system to
Tarot<00:05:26.220> which<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.610> really<00:05:26.910> interesting<00:05:27.390> so<00:05:27.540> I

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
Tarot which is really interesting so I

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.060 
Tarot which is really interesting so I
thought<00:05:27.810> I<00:05:27.840> would<00:05:27.960> just<00:05:28.169> show<00:05:28.380> them<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.830> you

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
thought I would just show them to you

really quite interesting and I do find

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.630 
really quite interesting and I do find
that<00:05:46.320> these<00:05:46.770> readings<00:05:47.160> can<00:05:47.340> be<00:05:47.430> quite

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
that these readings can be quite

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.700 
that these readings can be quite
expansive<00:05:48.479> because<00:05:48.870> you're<00:05:49.110> working<00:05:49.530> with<00:05:49.680> a

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
expansive because you're working with a

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.880 
expansive because you're working with a
kind<00:05:50.160> of<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.280> different<00:05:50.400> premise<00:05:50.850> and<00:05:51.890> these

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
kind of a different premise and these

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.040 
kind of a different premise and these
images<00:05:53.520> give<00:05:53.700> off<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:53.880> certain<00:05:54.210> energy<00:05:54.419> I<00:05:54.690> think

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
images give off a certain energy I think

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.830 
images give off a certain energy I think
