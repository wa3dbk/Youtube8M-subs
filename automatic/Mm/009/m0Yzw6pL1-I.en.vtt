00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 we continue in the magnifying glass to see you better 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.420
 placing our magnifying glass at school 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.670
 waters in the corregimiento of montebello 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.500
 here in the city of Cali and in this 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.450
 moment I meet with Simon to her the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.460
 rector of this beautiful place 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 So, thank you very much for this 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.600
 invitation that makes us and we tell you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 gives viewers how the idea is born 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.519
 from school the waters good school 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.310
 of the waters was born in 2004 in 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.840
 September with the idea of ​​having a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 educational institution that will house 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
 many children in the sector who did not have 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 possibility of continuing education 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 children discover scarce resources 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.149
 economic problems with a family dysfunction 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 with special educational needs 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.270
 that's how 9 years ago was born, good simona and 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.210
 idea of construction as such because 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.610
 It is totally built in guaduas of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 where the idea is born is that 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 we met andreeva for our 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.239
 German architect and then thinking about 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.710
 what kind of construction do that make 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 very special for children who 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
 offered warmth that offered much 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 aeration lighting rest 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.210
 tranquility then thought of the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.130
 bus 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.590
 and it's cheaper than building in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 brick with cement then it has been 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.430
 as how we started this construction and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.440
 what is the support that the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.750
 educational institution good we 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.960
 when we started with andrés in germany 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.759
 he looked for an institution that will contribute 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 for educational institutions 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.780
 and specials like this then he 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.040
 found the bmc is that is the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
 ministry the international corporation 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.899
 and then that's how we started with a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 building that for children after not 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.320
 they audited and they were very 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.570
 happy with the handling we give to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.800
 the resources the type of construction and 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.020
 then they brought us for the 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.460
 Butterfly restaurant after seeing 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.200
 that restaurant and see how the kids 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 they were fascinated with that space 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.340
 then they decided to give us for another 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.920
 and so we are already building five as 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.229
 excellent congratulations on really 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.119
 For this great effort we will continue 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.590
 Well, the tour of the school because 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.720
 I want all our ledantes 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.110
 know the beauty of the school 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.110
 waters 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.560
 and continuing our tour of the 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.230
 school the waters I found the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.420
 arquitecta greta is already a specialist in 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.220
 the theme of guadua creta so many 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.319
 thank you for attending this call the magnifying glass 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.599
 with pleasure to take viewers 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.849
 because they handle the wadding because they work 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.569
 with her good the guadua is a material 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.890
 constructively spectacularly good 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.750
 mainly for two reasons for its 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.790
 enormous resistance to the wada meets some 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.099
 very high resistance coefficients 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.380
 similar to steel, that's why it's 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.980
 the so-called vegetable steel 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.370
 second for environmental reasons 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.620
 she is the plant species that has a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.140
 Higher dioxide co2 exchange 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.410
 carbon for oxygen and well it is also 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.750
 call as 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.840
 the sustainable alternative to wood and 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.180
 that's because it comes to be a material 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.890
 organic construction but in what 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.200
 a tree to build is delayed in 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.180
 grow between 20 and 40 years of watering in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.610
 four years we have it crack list and 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.010
 this construction that we have here in it 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.380
 next tell us a bit about what is 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.810
 is how it was built good this 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.460
 building is the last one we have here 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.870
 built in the school the waters already 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.750
 with him we will have the whole school 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.600
 Well the complex is eight buildings a 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.060
 bridge bridge footbridge and a few landmarks and 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.400
 this is going to be the culmination also to 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.500
 time is the biggest building will 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.330
 be a very emblematic building in all 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.220
 what is the world of guadua because 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.890
 there are very few experiences of 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.330
 Guadua use buildings as unique 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.620
 structural element here only 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.870
 we have concrete for the foundation 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.069
 all the rest is guagua all the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.349
 pillars or columns all beams 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.819
 and are three heights we have not reached 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.819
 a ceiling height of up almost 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.409
 twelve meters then here we are going to have 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.810
 the program of the two new workshops 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.180

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.829
 of computer music we are going to have 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.129
 four hotel rooms we are going to 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.739
 have a study hall library and a 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.599
 open space at the top is going to 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.430
 be with a railing and the roof and that 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.919

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.310
 350 people 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.240
 well we have gone about 15 kilometers 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.460
 of water nothing bad not excellent in chalk 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.470

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.150
 construction so beautiful and so you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.949

 really us here in colombia 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.949
 we have to value what we have and the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.380
 guagua is one of the gold as they 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.900
 they say the gold of inhabiting simona 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.389

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.490
 we have to also enjoy I do not know if 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.289
 they have to realize that they have a 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.330
 treasure in the educational institution the 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:02.400
 waters of the corregimiento of montebello 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.560

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.389
 was made at that time with ewan he is

 meaning in this workshop and they teach you 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.830
 Well I felt very well in the workshop 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.800
 part is everything related to the 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:27.410
 wood everything that is wood work 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.510
 what is floor finished in movable wood 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.680
 and wood everything you may need 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.100
 for a house made of wood 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.560
 and good and why did you decide to enter 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.949
 this workshop because something that I like 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.400
 true and I saw it as something to be able to 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:47.080
 develop my skills as 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.090
 carpenter and likewise you can get 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.100
 some resource but other than those 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.539
 skills as a carpenter to me for there are 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.009
 a little bird told me that you too 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.960
 quickly see that he has a beautiful song 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.419
 about water water because on purpose that 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.130
 we are in a school built in pure 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.460
 watery then we give away a little bit of 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.710
 that song says like that I make my way between 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.990
 the earth that you work with your hands 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.580
 seen give me shapes and colors that is that 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.919
 are the human eye I became 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.720
 craftsmanship and in that construction I am 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.120
 the dream of the architect who me 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.130
 he interpreted he thought it was just a branch and 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.740
 I'm in the planes of the industry is 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.840

 let's count the viewers who are 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.030
 the children who come to study out 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.640
 Well first of all thank you very much 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:43.050
 you welcome the children that 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.950
 study here are children that usually 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:47.020
 belong to the corregimiento of 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.440
 montebello that is to say we are talking about 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.170
 children socioeconomic stratum one 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:55.350
 they usually come from populations 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.530
 also displaced 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.890
 are families that have had to flee from 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.810
 other parts of the country and find in 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:10.320
 this space a very good opportunity 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:12.480
 to educate yourself with different emphases and 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.860
 with other options such as the medium 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.900
 artistic education environment and very 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.360
 soon we will bet also 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.970
 to technology and I also have 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.220
 understood that some are edited here 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.980
 workshops at a technical level which are 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.620
 these workshops if they are programs that 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:36.360
 last two years based on the 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.840
 learning by doing 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.000
 and basically they are gastronomy 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:46.050
 construction joinery with guadua 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.719
 marketing and sales so that the issue of 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.719
 food is not an impediment the 

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:54.270
 institution supplies you breakfast the
