about<00:00:03.300> my<00:00:03.570> latest<00:00:03.899> acquisition<00:00:04.370> this<00:00:05.370> is

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
about my latest acquisition this is

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.850 
about my latest acquisition this is
known<00:00:05.819> as<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:08.189> trucker's<00:00:08.550> friend<00:00:09.559> this<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.830> a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
known as the trucker's friend this is a

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.740 
known as the trucker's friend this is a
combination<00:00:11.639> tool<00:00:12.349> designed<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.530> be<00:00:13.830> an<00:00:14.040> ax<00:00:14.340> a

hammer<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:17.100> nail<00:00:17.340> pull<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:19.170> pry<00:00:19.470> bar<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
hammer the nail pull and a pry bar and I

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
hammer the nail pull and a pry bar and I
guess<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.580> theory<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.390> could<00:00:21.539> use<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.080> both

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
guess in theory you could use this both

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.529 
guess in theory you could use this both
as<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.529> pry<00:00:22.769> bar<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.010> potentially<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> bottle

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
as a pry bar and potentially as a bottle

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.720 
as a pry bar and potentially as a bottle
opener<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.869> suppose<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:26.070> got<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> notch<00:00:26.460> here

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
opener I suppose it's got a notch here

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.400 
opener I suppose it's got a notch here
for<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.750> spike<00:00:27.990> pulling<00:00:29.300> so<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.380> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
for for spike pulling so that one is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.310 
for for spike pulling so that one is
probably<00:00:31.859> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.820> more<00:00:33.300> useful

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
probably going to be more useful

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.139 
probably going to be more useful
the<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.579> hammer<00:00:35.820> head<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.890> sloped<00:00:38.030> which<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the the hammer head is sloped which I

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.910 
the the hammer head is sloped which I
suppose<00:00:39.480> will<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.320> easier<00:00:40.530> as

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
suppose will make it a little easier as

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220 
suppose will make it a little easier as
far<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.340> you'll<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.910> broad<00:00:42.420> swings<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
far as you'll get broad swings with this

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.920 
far as you'll get broad swings with this
tool<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.760> rather<00:00:45.090> large<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
tool because it is is rather large you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
tool because it is is rather large you
can<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> scale<00:00:46.860> I've<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:47.969> next<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
can see from the scale I've got next to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.029 
can see from the scale I've got next to
it<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> small<00:00:49.410> tool<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
it it's not a small tool and in

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.810 
it it's not a small tool and in
comparison<00:00:50.550> comparing<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> trench

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
comparison comparing it to the trench

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.020 
comparison comparing it to the trench
axe<00:00:55.129> from<00:00:56.129> cold<00:00:56.850> steel<00:00:57.320> they<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:59.030> very

axe from cold steel they are very
similar<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.780> overall<00:01:01.289> length

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
similar in overall length

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
similar in overall length
now<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.149> trench<00:01:03.629> tool<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:05.010> my<00:01:05.189> mind<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.790> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
now the trench tool to my mind is a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.950 
now the trench tool to my mind is a
weapon<00:01:07.560> which<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.250> potential<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.450> used<00:01:09.720> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
weapon which has potential to be used as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000 
weapon which has potential to be used as
a<00:01:10.020> tool<00:01:10.610> whereas<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.270> tool<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.680> has

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a tool whereas this is a tool that has

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.590 
a tool whereas this is a tool that has
the<00:01:14.130> potential<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:15.659> used<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.040> weapon<00:01:17.600> I'm

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the potential to be used as a weapon I'm

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.630 
the potential to be used as a weapon I'm
assuming<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> hole<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.009> hanging

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
assuming this hole here is for hanging

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.950 
assuming this hole here is for hanging
in<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:20.880> something<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.240> can't<00:01:21.509> figure<00:01:21.659> out<00:01:21.810> what

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
in or something I can't figure out what

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160 
in or something I can't figure out what
else<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.229> might<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.979> used<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:24.630> says<00:01:24.840> made

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
else that might be used for it says made

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
else that might be used for it says made
in<00:01:25.200> USA<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> guess<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.820> guess<00:01:27.090> that's<00:01:27.299> good

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
in USA so I guess I guess that's good

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.960 
in USA so I guess I guess that's good
but<00:01:28.380> frankly<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.070> doesn't<00:01:29.310> give<00:01:29.520> me<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> lot<00:01:29.850> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
but frankly it doesn't give me a lot of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030 
but frankly it doesn't give me a lot of
faith<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.479> our<00:01:30.659> current<00:01:31.200> manufacturing

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
faith in our current manufacturing

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
faith in our current manufacturing
skills<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.689> two<00:01:33.869> reasons<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
skills and there's two reasons for that

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.730 
skills and there's two reasons for that
firstly<00:01:35.220> there's<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:37.369> object<00:01:38.369> which<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
firstly there's this object which is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.050 
firstly there's this object which is
laughingly<00:01:40.740> referred<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> as<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.320> sheath<00:01:43.320> I

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
laughingly referred to as a sheath I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
laughingly referred to as a sheath I
wouldn't<00:01:45.060> want<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.270> use<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:46.009> even<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.280> were

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
wouldn't want to use this even if I were

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.910 
wouldn't want to use this even if I were
carrying<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> truck<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.740> not

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
carrying this in a truck I would not

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.730 
carrying this in a truck I would not
feel<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.049> offer<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.500> any

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
feel that this was going to offer me any

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.660 
feel that this was going to offer me any
kind<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.310> protection<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> object<00:01:55.770> at<00:01:56.460> all

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
kind of protection of this object at all

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.630 
kind of protection of this object at all
just<00:01:57.210> know<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> it's<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.430> piece

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just know this is this is a it's a piece

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.319 
just know this is this is a it's a piece
of<00:02:00.350> plastic<00:02:01.350> vinyl<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.549> clear<00:02:02.909> piece<00:02:03.149> of

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
vinyl it is is it is useless I would

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.410 
vinyl it is is it is useless I would
feel<00:02:08.009> much<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.369> secure<00:02:08.429> storing<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
feel much more secure storing this in a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.889 
feel much more secure storing this in a
truck

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

if<00:02:10.200> for<00:02:10.709> example<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.700> made<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.209> sheet<00:02:12.450> at<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
if for example I just made a sheet at a

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520 
if for example I just made a sheet at a
cardboard<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
cardboard and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.940

have a knight a decent edge it's not
razor<00:02:47.190> sharp<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.750> I've<00:02:49.050> taken<00:02:49.470> off<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.740> grind

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
razor sharp but I've taken off the grind

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.830 
razor sharp but I've taken off the grind
lines<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:51.030> were<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:51.270> most<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> grind

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
lines that were on there because they

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.230 
lines that were on there because they
were<00:02:53.010> very<00:02:53.280> obvious<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.910> see<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.150> it's

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
were very obvious you can see that it's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.020 
were very obvious you can see that it's
like<00:02:54.300> sheen<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.020> there<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.290> I've<00:02:55.380> put<00:02:55.590> on<00:02:55.620> it

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
like sheen on there and I've put on it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.650 
like sheen on there and I've put on it
and<00:02:57.030> I've<00:02:57.770> put<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> decent<00:02:59.100> working<00:02:59.610> ax<00:03:00.000> edge<00:03:00.360> on

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and I've put a decent working ax edge on

and I've put a decent working ax edge on
this<00:03:00.780> tool<00:03:01.050> I<00:03:01.380> did<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.220> with<00:03:02.370> my<00:03:02.550> angle<00:03:02.940> grinder

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
this tool I did it with my angle grinder

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.690 
this tool I did it with my angle grinder
and<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.570> small<00:03:03.930> hand<00:03:04.410> stone<00:03:04.920> which<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.430> used

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and a small hand stone which I then used

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.650 
and a small hand stone which I then used
to<00:03:05.850> take<00:03:06.030> off<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.390> burrs

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.600 

it's<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> light<00:03:10.170> tool<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.830> gotta<00:03:11.220> tell<00:03:11.459> you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it's not a light tool I gotta tell you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.820 
it's not a light tool I gotta tell you
it's<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.690> fairly<00:03:13.080> hefty<00:03:13.350> device

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
it's it's a fairly hefty device

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.220 
it's it's a fairly hefty device
it<00:03:16.830> weighs<00:03:17.070> very<00:03:17.310> similar<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.360> to<00:03:19.050> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
it weighs very similar to the to the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
it weighs very similar to the to the
trench<00:03:19.560> axe<00:03:19.769> frankly<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.400> may<00:03:20.640> be<00:03:20.700> ever<00:03:21.209> so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
trench axe frankly this may be ever so

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.540 
trench axe frankly this may be ever so
slightly<00:03:21.810> heavy<00:03:22.230> because<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> way<00:03:23.400> it's

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
slightly heavy because of the way it's

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.000 
slightly heavy because of the way it's
constructed<00:03:23.959> you've<00:03:24.959> got<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.230> lot<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.590> weight

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
constructed you've got a lot of weight

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.920 
constructed you've got a lot of weight
right<00:03:26.400> here<00:03:26.430> so<00:03:27.180> you're<00:03:27.330> gonna<00:03:27.420> be<00:03:27.630> able<00:03:27.780> to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
right here so you're gonna be able to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.990 
right here so you're gonna be able to
get<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.140> whole<00:03:28.590> lot<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.950> impact<00:03:29.400> with<00:03:29.580> this<00:03:29.790> I

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
get a whole lot of impact with this I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.960 
get a whole lot of impact with this I
mean<00:03:30.360> some<00:03:30.900> severe<00:03:31.500> impact<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.670> were<00:03:32.820> gonna

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
mean some severe impact you were gonna

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
mean some severe impact you were gonna
be<00:03:33.150> able<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.510> hack<00:03:33.720> things<00:03:34.110> apart<00:03:34.500> quite

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
be able to hack things apart quite

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.009 
be able to hack things apart quite
efficiently<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> quite<00:03:36.480> like<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.870> fact

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
efficiently and I quite like the fact

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.080 
efficiently and I quite like the fact
that<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.350> handles<00:03:37.769> right<00:03:37.920> here<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.400> think<00:03:38.760> it

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that this handles right here I think it

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.000 
that this handles right here I think it
would<00:03:39.209> help<00:03:39.420> guide<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.680> were<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.920> hold

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
would help guide if you were to hold

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.800 
would help guide if you were to hold
this<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.370> my<00:03:41.400> little<00:03:41.730> in<00:03:42.060> your<00:03:42.180> left<00:03:42.390> hand<00:03:42.480> and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
this in your right hand you could guide

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.720 
this in your right hand you could guide
this<00:03:45.060> pry<00:03:45.480> bar<00:03:45.930> section<00:03:46.560> right<00:03:47.310> into
