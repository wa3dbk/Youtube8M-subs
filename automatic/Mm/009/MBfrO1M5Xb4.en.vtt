00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
involved with career connection i think

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
involved with career connection i think
is<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> fact<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.780> actually<00:01:51.990> screen<00:01:52.590> our

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
is the fact that we actually screen our

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
is the fact that we actually screen our
students<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.549> everybody<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.210> gets

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
