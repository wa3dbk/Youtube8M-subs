00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
as far as low temperatures we're talking

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.700 
as far as low temperatures we're talking
about<00:01:12.900> temperatures<00:01:13.140> they're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> get

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
about temperatures they're going to get

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.240 
about temperatures they're going to get
below<00:01:14.310> zero<00:01:14.729> again<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.470> records<00:01:16.860> around<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
below zero again the records around the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.039 
below zero again the records around the
area<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.240> most<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> lower

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
area are for the most part in the lower

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.929 
area are for the most part in the lower
single<00:01:19.619> digit<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.430> easily

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
single digit so this should be easily

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.510 
single digit so this should be easily
broken<00:01:21.060> records<00:01:21.840> once<00:01:22.080> again<00:01:22.530> should<00:01:23.189> we<00:01:23.250> but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
broken records once again should we but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
broken records once again should we but
many<00:01:23.729> records<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.750> broken<00:01:24.990> tonight<00:01:25.439> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
many records that are broken tonight and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670 
many records that are broken tonight and
then<00:01:26.540> after<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.659> point<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.590> not

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
then after that point it's really not

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
then after that point it's really not
going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> moderate<00:01:29.250> too<00:01:29.490> much<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.909> moderates

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
going to moderate too much it moderates

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.840 
going to moderate too much it moderates
but<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> moderate<00:01:31.650> stew<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.070> 20s<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.759> not

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
but it moderate stew the 20s so it's not

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.420 
but it moderate stew the 20s so it's not
really<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.479> warm<00:01:34.350> all<00:01:34.560> week<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.340> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
we'll just let go with the idea that it

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.750

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.960 
idea then there's going to be a third
system<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:15.160> one<00:03:15.400> actually<00:03:15.609> is

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
system here and this one actually is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.699 
system here and this one actually is
going<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.209> be<00:03:16.329> cutting<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.870> through<00:03:17.319> the<00:03:17.500> Great

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
going to be cutting in through the Great

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.879 
going to be cutting in through the Great
Lakes<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.109> according<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
Lakes here so this is according to the

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.289 
Lakes here so this is according to the
code<00:03:21.100> this<00:03:21.310> models<00:03:21.639> projection<00:03:22.090> error<00:03:22.239> I

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
code this models projection error I

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.520 
code this models projection error I
really<00:03:22.660> don't<00:03:22.840> think<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.200> going<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.440> be

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
really don't think that's going to be

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.140 
really don't think that's going to be
the<00:03:23.650> case<00:03:23.829> but<00:03:24.069> we'll<00:03:24.280> see<00:03:24.489> what<00:03:24.639> what

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
the case but we'll see what what

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.940 
the case but we'll see what what
transpires<00:03:25.690> with<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.930> as<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:26.500> head<00:03:26.590> into<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
transpires with that as we head into the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.610 
transpires with that as we head into the
weekend<00:03:27.420> we're<00:03:28.420> talking<00:03:28.750> about<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:29.290> system

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
weekend we're talking about a system

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.870 
weekend we're talking about a system
that<00:03:29.799> could<00:03:29.920> affect<00:03:30.190> us<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> Sunday

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
that could affect us in the Sunday

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.390 
that could affect us in the Sunday
Monday<00:03:31.090> timeframe<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.900> next<00:03:32.889> week<00:03:33.040> here<00:03:33.250> with

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
Monday timeframe of next week here with

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.039 
Monday timeframe of next week here with
some<00:03:33.579> snow<00:03:33.790> but<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.510> looks<00:03:34.630> just<00:03:34.900> like<00:03:35.019> a

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
some snow but this looks just like a

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.240 
some snow but this looks just like a
cold<00:03:35.319> front<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:35.650> because<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.040> head<00:03:36.220> thing

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
cold front here because this head thing

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.819 
cold front here because this head thing
I<00:03:36.459> was<00:03:36.579> already<00:03:36.880> cut<00:03:37.209> well<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.380> west<00:03:38.530> year

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
I was already cut well to the west year

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.520 
I was already cut well to the west year
so<00:03:39.269> high<00:03:40.269> pressure<00:03:40.569> sitting<00:03:40.840> over<00:03:41.049> top<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.290> us

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
so high pressure sitting over top of us

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.960 
so high pressure sitting over top of us
but<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.250> know<00:03:42.340> there's<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.549> lot<00:03:42.639> of<00:03:42.669> different

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
but you know there's a lot of different

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.009 
but you know there's a lot of different
solutions<00:03:43.299> that<00:03:43.359> are<00:03:43.419> on<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.630> table<00:03:43.750> this<00:03:43.959> is

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
solutions that are on the table this is

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.599 
solutions that are on the table this is
going<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> change<00:03:44.319> a<00:03:44.680> million<00:03:45.040> times<00:03:45.250> I<00:03:45.489> really

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
going to change a million times I really

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:46.830 
going to change a million times I really
don't<00:03:45.819> want<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> get<00:03:46.090> into<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.389> long<00:03:46.540> range

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
don't want to get into the long range

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.659 
don't want to get into the long range
too<00:03:47.019> much<00:03:47.200> because<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:48.220> models<00:03:48.549> have<00:03:48.639> been

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
too much because the models have been

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.520 
too much because the models have been
going<00:03:48.940> back<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.180> forth<00:03:49.419> back<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:49.930> forth<00:03:50.139> back

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
going back and forth back and forth back

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.470 
going back and forth back and forth back
and<00:03:50.560> forth<00:03:50.799> and<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.760> know<00:03:51.849> any<00:03:52.030> one<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.329> these

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
and forth and you know any one of these

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.809 
and forth and you know any one of these
storms<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.169> could<00:03:54.069> decide<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.459> come<00:03:54.609> up<00:03:54.730> a

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
storms I could decide to come up a

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.309 
storms I could decide to come up a
little<00:03:54.910> bit<00:03:55.120> closer<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.630> coastline<00:03:55.989> here

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
little bit closer to the coastline here

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.979 
little bit closer to the coastline here
and<00:03:56.470> give<00:03:56.590> us<00:03:56.620> some<00:03:56.739> snow<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.430> interior

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
and give us some snow and the interior

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.819 
and give us some snow and the interior
you<00:03:58.989> know<00:03:59.079> if<00:03:59.139> he<00:03:59.200> decides<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.530> come<00:03:59.709> out

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
you know if he decides to come out

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.229 
you know if he decides to come out
tracks<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.280> little<00:04:00.400> bit<00:04:00.579> further<00:04:00.790> north<00:04:00.849> west

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
tracks a little bit further north west

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.360 
tracks a little bit further north west
there<00:04:01.450> is<00:04:01.630> still<00:04:02.019> big<00:04:02.319> storm<00:04:02.590> potential<00:04:02.919> here

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
there is still big storm potential here

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.610 
there is still big storm potential here
in<00:04:04.329> that<00:04:04.510> time<00:04:04.690> frame<00:04:04.720> we've<00:04:05.079> always<00:04:05.290> liked

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
in that time frame we've always liked

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.839 
in that time frame we've always liked
that<00:04:05.739> right<00:04:06.040> arrive<00:04:06.250> at<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.549> end<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
that right arrive at the end of the

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.909 
that right arrive at the end of the
month<00:04:07.000> here<00:04:07.359> as<00:04:07.480> we<00:04:08.019> head<00:04:08.139> into<00:04:08.169> early<00:04:08.440> March

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
month here as we head into early March

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.530 
month here as we head into early March
so<00:04:09.190> we<00:04:09.310> will<00:04:09.370> keep<00:04:09.519> a<00:04:09.609> not<00:04:09.760> close<00:04:10.030> eye<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.209> it

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
so we will keep a not close eye on it

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.379 
so we will keep a not close eye on it
right<00:04:11.500> now<00:04:11.530> not<00:04:11.859> showing<00:04:12.130> much<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.549> there<00:04:12.790> but

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
right now not showing much on there but

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.569 
right now not showing much on there but
that<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.720> certainly<00:04:13.870> subject<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.620> change<00:04:14.919> here

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
that is certainly subject to change here

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:16.860 
that is certainly subject to change here
is<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.060> look<00:04:16.269> at<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.510> reason<00:04:16.690> why<00:04:16.780> we're

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
is the look at the reason why we're

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.349 
is the look at the reason why we're
gonna<00:04:16.959> be<00:04:17.079> so<00:04:17.200> cold<00:04:17.440> today<00:04:17.620> very<00:04:18.519> very<00:04:18.700> cold

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
gonna be so cold today very very cold

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.120 
gonna be so cold today very very cold
air<00:04:19.599> sitting<00:04:19.959> right<00:04:20.200> over<00:04:20.229> top<00:04:20.560> of<00:04:20.620> us<00:04:20.859> this<00:04:21.070> is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
air sitting right over top of us this is

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.410 
air sitting right over top of us this is
actually

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
actually

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.760 
actually
you<00:04:22.570> can<00:04:22.720> actually<00:04:22.870> see<00:04:23.020> the<00:04:23.170> chart<00:04:23.380> here<00:04:23.590> but

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
you can actually see the chart here but

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.650 
you can actually see the chart here but
this<00:04:23.860> is<00:04:23.950> actually<00:04:24.130> temperate<00:04:25.000> departures

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
this is actually temperate departures

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.110 
this is actually temperate departures
from<00:04:25.840> normal<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.610> our<00:04:27.610> departure<00:04:27.940> from

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
from normal and our departure from

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.110 
from normal and our departure from
normal<00:04:28.180> or<00:04:28.510> somewhere<00:04:28.840> between<00:04:29.280> 15<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.310> 20

degrees<00:04:31.960> Celsius<00:04:32.640> below<00:04:33.640> normal<00:04:34.000> what<00:04:34.450> it's

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
degrees Celsius below normal what it's

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.850 
degrees Celsius below normal what it's
supposed<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:34.960> be<00:04:35.080> for<00:04:35.200> this<00:04:35.260> time<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.500> year<00:04:35.620> up

supposed to be for this time of year up
