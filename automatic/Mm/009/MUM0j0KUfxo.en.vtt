00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.380
 bolt and bothered box and claims 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.010

 thanks to the box and do not do crazy 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.579

 today he hit him and there he left the hat 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.250
 hence the teaser 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.530
 for you told him to be good this is the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.770
 idea of ​​font cinema of how it is 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.780
 that is strong and occurs when poker so 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.479
 how much more or less poker did not and they were 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.539

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.959
 something rather silly but good 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.769
 basically in animations to do 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.000
