00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.519
 piet app that's why I see what comes 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 if ordinary poland offers app opens 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.010
 of free and tweak installing on 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.010
 phone eathorne samsung galaxy s4 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.510
 the rabbi meir so what can you do 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.649
 we click on it then you will see it here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 polar h6 appears and clicks on per 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.140
 and then you have to think 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.329
 has a little to the right yes he is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.920
 also visible 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.969
 so we can just go the app 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.300
 use 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.559
 you see that the last one is now 61 a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.559
 can we start 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.450
 but now you see the master now 59 is that 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.780
 upper heartbeat 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.420
 table because then are zones and I can do whole 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.330
 click and you will see the image switch 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.180
 between heartbeat of 51 and this is 32 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.420
 percent of my maximum result 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.710
 I then heartbeat again we go 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 adjust for example in the zones 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 yes so of course and a straight line 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.049
 without a boss state has not changed 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.700
 so not so fascinating picture but now 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.970
 well you get to see this image like 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.090
 see below the text cartridge from 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.079
 just say how long you are in which sun 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.759
 have run but now is this graph 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.320
 you just want the actual result 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.520
 more interesting 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.520

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.090
 that he just yes see you very small 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.500
 I'll give you signs 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.590
 of course if you walk that it goes 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.659
 much faster up and serious 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.489
 freak music more interesting 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.710
