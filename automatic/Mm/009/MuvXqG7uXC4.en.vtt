00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:16.620 

they'll<00:00:53.530> go<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.740> sleep<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.340> kind<00:00:54.550> of<00:00:54.670> slow

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
one servo drives the front and back left

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.560 
one servo drives the front and back left
leg<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:22.509> the<00:01:22.810> right<00:01:23.770> center<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.880> other<00:01:25.030> servo

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
leg in the right center the other servo

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.940 
leg in the right center the other servo
drives<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:27.180> front<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.270> back<00:01:28.450> right<00:01:28.810> leg<00:01:29.619> in

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
drives the front and back right leg in

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.139 
drives the front and back right leg in
the<00:01:30.130> left<00:01:30.369> center<00:01:30.939> and<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.250> third<00:01:33.579> servo

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
the left center and the third servo

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.069 
the left center and the third servo
tilts<00:01:34.720> it<00:01:35.439> centered<00:01:35.920> legs<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.299> raises<00:01:37.630> one

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
tilts it centered legs so it raises one

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.340 
tilts it centered legs so it raises one
side<00:01:38.409> and<00:01:38.619> then<00:01:38.710> raises<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.310> other<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
side and then raises the other the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.740 
side and then raises the other the
center<00:01:42.220> legs<00:01:42.490> are<00:01:42.819> slightly<00:01:43.179> higher<00:01:43.450> than<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
center legs are slightly higher than the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.499 
center legs are slightly higher than the
outer<00:01:46.750> legs<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.829> that's<00:01:48.189> necessary<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.330> make

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
outer legs and that's necessary to make

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.589 
outer legs and that's necessary to make
it<00:01:49.539> turn<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.640> think<00:01:51.640> you'll<00:01:51.819> see<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.240> here<00:01:52.479> in

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
it turn I think you'll see that here in

00:01:52.599 --> 00:02:02.330 
it turn I think you'll see that here in
just<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.990> minute<00:01:53.200> if<00:01:53.470> if<00:01:54.130> it<00:01:54.280> does<00:01:54.490> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.400 

it<00:02:02.759> doesn't<00:02:03.179> go<00:02:03.270> quite<00:02:03.509> straight

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.380 

alright<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.340> starting<00:02:09.730> to<00:02:09.820> turn<00:02:10.030> now<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
alright is starting to turn now you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.280 
alright is starting to turn now you
notice<00:02:14.910> when<00:02:15.910> it<00:02:16.060> puts<00:02:16.300> both<00:02:16.570> Center<00:02:17.080> legs

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
notice when it puts both Center legs

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.890 
notice when it puts both Center legs
down<00:02:17.590> then<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.220> turn<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:19.480> has<00:02:19.720> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
down then it can turn it has to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.260 
down then it can turn it has to
reposition<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.650> center<00:02:20.980> legs<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.610> then

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
reposition the center legs and then

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.880 
reposition the center legs and then
earth<00:02:23.220> continue<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.440> does<00:02:26.650> it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
earth continue to do that and it does it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.590 
earth continue to do that and it does it
for<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.280> many<00:02:27.460> cycles<00:02:30.270> hopefully<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.480> then

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
for so many cycles hopefully and then

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:58.000 
for so many cycles hopefully and then
it'll<00:02:31.780> start<00:02:31.870> walking<00:02:32.560> again

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.030 

alright<00:02:58.849> it's<00:02:59.120> on<00:02:59.299> its<00:02:59.480> way<00:02:59.540> back<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.349> just

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
alright it's on its way back I just

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.190 
alright it's on its way back I just
sensors<00:03:01.489> alone

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.290 

god<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:06.239> think<00:03:07.770> 8km<00:03:08.770> membrane<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.730> using<00:03:10.060> about

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
god I think 8km membrane and using about

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:18.949 
god I think 8km membrane and using about
forty<00:03:11.140> percent<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.670> far<00:03:16.500> mega<00:03:17.500> eight

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
forty percent of it so far mega eight

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:34.280 
forty percent of it so far mega eight
that<00:03:19.959> male<00:03:20.170> mega

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.759 

got<00:03:34.950> one<00:03:35.189> battery<00:03:35.430> pack<00:03:35.849> two<00:03:36.239> switches<00:03:36.810> one<00:03:37.560> to

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
got one battery pack two switches one to

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.830 
got one battery pack two switches one to
turn<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.189> microprocessor<00:03:38.700> on<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.629> other

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
turn the microprocessor on and the other

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.979 
turn the microprocessor on and the other
for<00:03:40.049> servo<00:03:40.469> when<00:03:41.340> you're<00:03:41.489> programming<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:42.269> you

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
for servo when you're programming it you

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.020 
for servo when you're programming it you
need<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.290> turn<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> processor<00:03:44.280> on<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.760> keeps

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
need to turn the processor on and keeps

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.140 
need to turn the processor on and keeps
herbals<00:03:45.569> off<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:47.129> it<00:03:47.250> don't<00:03:47.430> kick<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.819> over

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
herbals off so so it don't kick all over

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:58.260 
herbals off so so it don't kick all over
the<00:03:48.209> place

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.120 

well<00:03:58.840> look<00:03:59.050> like<00:03:59.080> it's<00:03:59.440> going<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.980> return

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
well look like it's going to return

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.490 
well look like it's going to return
within<00:04:00.580> about<00:04:00.940> 20<00:04:01.360> feet<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.870> where<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.080> started

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
within about 20 feet of where it started

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:13.140 
within about 20 feet of where it started
out<00:04:10.020> let's<00:04:11.020> see
