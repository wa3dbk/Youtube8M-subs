00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
word code on them that's a security

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.870 
word code on them that's a security
system<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.660> actor<00:00:15.929> has<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.350> place<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.920> what

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
system that actor has in place and what

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.790 
system that actor has in place and what
they<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.750> want<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.140> insert<00:00:19.500> the

they want is they want you to insert the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.609 
they want is they want you to insert the
special<00:00:20.520> radio<00:00:20.760> code<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.900> my<00:00:22.109> goal<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.529> today

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
special radio code so my goal here today

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
special radio code so my goal here today
is<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> show<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.189> where<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> find<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
is to show you where you can find that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.000 
is to show you where you can find that
code<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.810> how<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.230> enter<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.650> into<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
code and how you can enter it into the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.400 
code and how you can enter it into the
car<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:27.000> follow<00:00:27.300> me<00:00:27.539> into<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> car<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> I'll

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
car so follow me into the car and I'll

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.470 
car so follow me into the car and I'll
show<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.650> how<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> work<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.179> get

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
show you how to work that so now you get

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.400 
show you how to work that so now you get
in<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.689> car<00:00:30.949> and<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.099> go<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> turn<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:33.410> and

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
in the car and you go to turn it on and

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.110 
in the car and you go to turn it on and
your<00:00:35.309> radio<00:00:35.520> says<00:00:36.180> code<00:00:36.710> okay<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:38.640> when

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
your radio says code okay so now when

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
your radio says code okay so now when
you<00:00:39.239> see<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> code<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.379> simply<00:00:40.800> means<00:00:41.010> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
you see the code that simply means that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
you see the code that simply means that
the<00:00:41.940> security<00:00:42.480> system<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.500> radio<00:00:43.829> kicked

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the security system in the radio kicked

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610 
the security system in the radio kicked
on<00:00:44.489> since<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.360> had<00:00:45.539> lost<00:00:45.809> power<00:00:46.140> with<00:00:46.500> your

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
on since it had lost power with your

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.069 
on since it had lost power with your
dead<00:00:46.860> battery<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.879> now<00:00:48.030> when<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.539> says<00:00:48.570> code

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
dead battery so now when it says code

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.680 
dead battery so now when it says code
it's<00:00:49.440> asking<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> security<00:00:51.239> code<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it's asking you for the security code so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.110 
it's asking you for the security code so
now<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.379> might<00:00:52.680> say<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
now you might say well what is that and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
now you might say well what is that and
how<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.840> well<00:00:55.500> there's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> few

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
how do I get it well there's a few

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.920 
how do I get it well there's a few
different<00:00:56.100> ways<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.539> get<00:00:57.750> it

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
different ways that you can get it

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.590 
different ways that you can get it
number<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.100> pull<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.090> your<00:01:00.120> owner's<00:01:00.570> manual

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you find a card like this hopefully

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.250 
you find a card like this hopefully
inside<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> owner's<00:01:09.360> manual<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.750> find<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> car

audio code in this book in this case

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
audio code in this book in this case
they<00:02:07.770> did<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.640> three<00:02:08.940> three<00:02:09.119> five<00:02:09.450> four

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810

three so that's the second place to find

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.290 
three so that's the second place to find
that<00:02:12.750> code

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
that code

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.200 
that code
