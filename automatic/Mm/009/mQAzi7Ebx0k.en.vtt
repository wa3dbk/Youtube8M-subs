a little bit so now I'm going to start

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.070 
a little bit so now I'm going to start
applying<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.120> little<00:01:21.270> bit<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.480> foundation<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
applying a little bit of foundation to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.930 
applying a little bit of foundation to
Valerie<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.070> foundation<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> really

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
Valerie but this foundation is really

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.120 
Valerie but this foundation is really
great<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.440> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.010> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
great just because it is kind of a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.860 
great just because it is kind of a
medium<00:01:26.310> coverage<00:01:26.730> but<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> still<00:01:27.480> lets<00:01:27.720> your

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
medium coverage but it still lets your

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.080 
medium coverage but it still lets your
skin<00:01:28.170> glow<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.010> because<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.490> most<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
skin glow so because we have most of the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
skin glow so because we have most of the
coverage<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.080> concealer<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.740> don't

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
coverage from the concealer we don't

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.250 
coverage from the concealer we don't

layer of foundation or would you rather
layer<00:01:46.620> at<00:01:46.830> the<00:01:46.950> concealer<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> like

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
layer at the concealer I'm do you like

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.490 
layer at the concealer I'm do you like
more<00:01:48.510> than<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.720> they<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.870> foundation<00:01:49.409> but

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
more than when they are foundation but

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.260 
more than when they are foundation but
it<00:01:49.620> always<00:01:49.770> depends<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> look<00:01:50.670> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it always depends on the look for

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.460 
it always depends on the look for
something<00:01:51.630> like<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.080> think<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
something like this I think it is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050 
something like this I think it is
important<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> use<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> foundation<00:01:53.580> that's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
important to use a foundation that's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
important to use a foundation that's
very<00:01:54.330> glowy<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.900> very<00:01:55.229> luminous<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:56.070> just

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
very glowy and very luminous and just

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.640 
very glowy and very luminous and just
layer<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.460> over<00:01:56.820> concealer<00:01:57.440> but<00:01:58.440> in<00:01:58.530> other

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
layer it over concealer but in other

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.250 
layer it over concealer but in other
situations<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.520> think<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.940> is<00:02:00.060> important<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
situations I do think it is important to

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.609 
situations I do think it is important to
kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> wet<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.490> layer<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.510> foundation<00:02:03.659> dry<00:02:04.320> or

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
to set a layer a foundation with a

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.149 
to set a layer a foundation with a
translucent<00:02:06.659> powder<00:02:06.690> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:07.680> go<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.129> a

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159

translucent powder and then go in with a
second<00:02:08.549> or<00:02:08.670> third<00:02:08.879> depending<00:02:09.269> on<00:02:09.360> how<00:02:09.479> much

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
second or third depending on how much

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.749 
second or third depending on how much

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
gradient effect as opposed to just a

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.009 
gradient effect as opposed to just a
color<00:03:25.069> so<00:03:25.849> next<00:03:26.209> we're<00:03:26.329> going<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.540> move<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.930> to
