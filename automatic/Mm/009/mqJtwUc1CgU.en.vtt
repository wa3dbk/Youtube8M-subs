 a force 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:23.890
 playing the world means power 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.970
 Kl, you can play a game 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.220
 but if through that the whole life is complete 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 real life comes to a standstill that does not make more sense people 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.830

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.690

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.259
