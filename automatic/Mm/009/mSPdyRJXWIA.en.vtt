 to make the video today I'm going to 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.550
 teach how to make pancakes that are 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.040
 healthier healthy does not mean 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.360
 have 5 calories but if they are much 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.550
 healthier than if you do some 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.190
 regular pancakes because these are a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.110
 oatmeal base and we're going to put chÃ­a 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.390
 on many occasions I wear spinach 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.250
 I make them with spinach but they come out 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 and I know that many of you do not 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.950
 like 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 so that it comes out green but is given a 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 super delicious 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.810
 so if you feel like learning to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.200
 making a breakfast is what this 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.460

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.290
 spinach a banana and a cup of milk 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.350
