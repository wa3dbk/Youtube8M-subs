wouldn't<00:01:55.970> imagine<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.450> he<00:01:56.570> would<00:01:56.600> after<00:01:57.080> you

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
wouldn't imagine that he would after you

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.779 
wouldn't imagine that he would after you
know<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.560> works<00:01:57.740> successfully<00:01:58.280> one<00:01:58.460> game<00:01:58.640> but

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
know it works successfully one game but

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.310 
know it works successfully one game but
usually<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.270> don't<00:01:59.390> she<00:01:59.690> well<00:01:59.899> you<00:02:00.050> don't<00:02:00.170> at

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
usually you don't she well you don't at

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.260 
usually you don't she well you don't at
least<00:02:00.350> rush<00:02:00.740> two<00:02:01.190> times<00:02:01.429> in<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.670> row<00:02:01.850> it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
least rush two times in a row it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.550 
least rush two times in a row it
definitely<00:02:02.690> would<00:02:02.929> be<00:02:03.080> weird<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.380> see<00:02:03.530> him

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
definitely would be weird to see him

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.109 
definitely would be weird to see him
throw<00:02:03.950> down<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.159> barracks<00:02:04.550> already<00:02:04.880> although

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
throw down a barracks already although

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.309 
throw down a barracks already although
he<00:02:05.270> has<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.810> looks<00:02:05.899> like<00:02:06.020> he's<00:02:06.200> actually

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
he has it looks like he's actually

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.960 
he has it looks like he's actually
saving<00:02:06.679> up<00:02:06.860> for<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:07.069> hundred<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.399> fifty<00:02:07.670> again

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
saving up for a hundred and fifty again

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.609 
saving up for a hundred and fifty again
so<00:02:08.149> he<00:02:08.269> may<00:02:08.450> be<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:09.019> a<00:02:09.050> very<00:02:09.259> similar

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
so he may be going for a very similar

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.590 
so he may be going for a very similar
build<00:02:09.890> yet<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.580> barracks<00:02:10.850> is<00:02:10.970> going<00:02:11.239> down<00:02:11.420> at

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
build yet the barracks is going down at

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.300 
build yet the barracks is going down at
10<00:02:11.900> almost<00:02:12.290> 11<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.769> i'll<00:02:12.830> have<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> see<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.220> he

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
10 almost 11 so i'll have to see if he

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.130 
10 almost 11 so i'll have to see if he
does<00:02:13.519> get<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.880> early<00:02:14.150> gas<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.870> i<00:02:14.900> want<00:02:15.110> to

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
does get that early gas but i want to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.930 
does get that early gas but i want to
mention<00:02:15.290> we've<00:02:15.620> been<00:02:15.650> saying<00:02:16.190> how<00:02:16.430> last<00:02:16.700> game

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
mention we've been saying how last game

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.940 
mention we've been saying how last game
went<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> specific<00:02:18.080> reason<00:02:18.380> because

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
went for a specific reason because

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.039 
went for a specific reason because
really<00:02:19.190> if<00:02:19.430> ret<00:02:19.940> just<00:02:20.420> goes<00:02:20.570> for<00:02:20.780> earlier

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
really if ret just goes for earlier

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.170 
really if ret just goes for earlier
zerglings<00:02:21.680> keeps<00:02:21.980> him<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.340> creep<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.910> mean

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
zerglings keeps him on the creep I mean

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.160 
zerglings keeps him on the creep I mean
the<00:02:23.329> Reapers<00:02:23.660> they're<00:02:23.930> pretty<00:02:24.110> much

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the Reapers they're pretty much

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.130 
the Reapers they're pretty much
ineffective<00:02:24.829> so<00:02:25.130> if<00:02:25.459> if<00:02:26.060> Wright<00:02:26.750> is<00:02:26.870> able<00:02:27.049> to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
ineffective so if if Wright is able to

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.930 
ineffective so if if Wright is able to
find<00:02:27.320> this<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:27.829> he<00:02:28.100> should<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.549> able<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
find this then he should be able to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.819 
find this then he should be able to
defend<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.450> if<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.989> is<00:02:30.140> indeed<00:02:30.410> going<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.739> be

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
defend it if it is indeed going to be

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.500 
defend it if it is indeed going to be
that<00:02:30.980> early<00:02:31.100> reaper<00:02:31.519> again<00:02:31.730> yeah<00:02:32.120> but<00:02:32.329> this

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
that early reaper again yeah but this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.120 
that early reaper again yeah but this
time<00:02:32.570> he's<00:02:33.079> moving<00:02:33.380> his<00:02:33.440> Overlord<00:02:33.890> in<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
time he's moving his Overlord in the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.009 
time he's moving his Overlord in the
completely<00:02:34.760> wrong<00:02:35.030> direction<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.750> he's

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
completely wrong direction so he's

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.780 
completely wrong direction so he's
basically<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> get<00:02:36.829> to<00:02:36.950> elsies<00:02:37.340> base<00:02:37.549> at

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
basically going to get to elsies base at

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.870 
basically going to get to elsies base at
the<00:02:38.269> very<00:02:38.510> very<00:02:38.600> last<00:02:39.049> point<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.829> he<00:02:40.070> might<00:02:40.310> get

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
the very very last point so he might get

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.970 
the very very last point so he might get
caught<00:02:41.090> off<00:02:41.239> guard<00:02:41.269> yet<00:02:41.690> again<00:02:41.959> he<00:02:42.590> does<00:02:42.799> have

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
caught off guard yet again he does have

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.830 
caught off guard yet again he does have
an<00:02:43.130> extractor<00:02:43.579> going<00:02:43.790> down<00:02:43.910> right<00:02:44.510> after<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
an extractor going down right after the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.030 
an extractor going down right after the
spawning<00:02:45.109> pools<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.500> he's<00:02:45.650> probably<00:02:45.799> not

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
spawning pools so he's probably not

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.560 
spawning pools so he's probably not
going<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.310> going<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> fast<00:02:47.000> expo<00:02:47.359> this

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
going to be going for a fast expo this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.330 
going to be going for a fast expo this
time<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.200> means<00:02:48.350> he's<00:02:48.500> he<00:02:48.799> is<00:02:48.950> going<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> have

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
time that means he's he is going to have

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.250 
time that means he's he is going to have
a<00:02:49.430> chance<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.760> hold<00:02:50.030> off<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.299> Reapers<00:02:50.630> if<00:02:50.810> he's

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
a chance to hold off the Reapers if he's

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.599 
a chance to hold off the Reapers if he's
got<00:02:51.500> his<00:02:51.650> Queen<00:02:51.859> coming<00:02:52.130> out<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.400> if<00:02:52.519> he

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
got his Queen coming out and if he

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.729 
got his Queen coming out and if he
starts<00:02:52.880> pumping<00:02:53.269> zerglings<00:02:53.660> he<00:02:53.780> can't<00:02:54.079> last

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
starts pumping zerglings he can't last

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.080 
starts pumping zerglings he can't last
game<00:02:55.010> what<00:02:55.280> was<00:02:55.370> different<00:02:55.519> as<00:02:55.730> he<00:02:55.820> went<00:02:55.970> for

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
game what was different as he went for

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.130 
game what was different as he went for
that<00:02:56.180> hatchery<00:02:56.510> he<00:02:56.600> didn't<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.959> enough

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
that hatchery he didn't have enough

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.660 
that hatchery he didn't have enough
minerals<00:02:57.410> for<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.859> zerglings<00:02:58.100> this<00:02:58.370> time<00:02:58.549> he

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
minerals for the zerglings this time he

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.190 
minerals for the zerglings this time he
should<00:02:58.730> be<00:02:58.910> able<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.239> defend<00:02:59.390> we'll<00:03:00.019> see

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
should be able to defend we'll see

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.569 
should be able to defend we'll see
though<00:03:00.350> he<00:03:00.739> might<00:03:00.890> throw<00:03:01.070> hatchery<00:03:01.459> or

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
though he might throw hatchery or

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.460 
though he might throw hatchery or
something<00:03:01.820> who<00:03:01.910> knows<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.660> very<00:03:02.959> crucial<00:03:03.410> to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
something who knows it's very crucial to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.140 
something who knows it's very crucial to
see<00:03:03.620> if<00:03:03.799> he<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.280> going<00:03:04.489> to<00:03:04.640> get<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.820> hatchery

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
see if he is going to get that hatchery

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.670 
see if he is going to get that hatchery
which<00:03:05.299> like<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.720> said<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.989> don't<00:03:06.290> think<00:03:06.470> he<00:03:06.530> is

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
which like I said I don't think he is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.590 
which like I said I don't think he is
going<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.730> he's<00:03:07.880> kind<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.239> playing<00:03:08.510> a

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
going to so he's kind of playing a

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.140 
going to so he's kind of playing a
little<00:03:08.690> gamble<00:03:09.230> here<00:03:09.470> as<00:03:09.709> he<00:03:10.280> decided<00:03:10.730> not<00:03:11.000> to

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
little gamble here as he decided not to

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.490 
little gamble here as he decided not to
get<00:03:11.209> that<00:03:11.359> early<00:03:11.540> hatchery<00:03:11.900> right<00:03:12.079> here<00:03:12.350> and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
get that early hatchery right here and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.410 
get that early hatchery right here and
that's<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.370> far<00:03:13.579> it's<00:03:13.730> gonna<00:03:13.820> pay<00:03:14.060> off<00:03:14.090> for<00:03:14.359> him

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
that's so far it's gonna pay off for him

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.300 
that's so far it's gonna pay off for him
because<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.870> tech<00:03:15.049> add-on<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.680> on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.190> way

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
because the tech add-on is on the way

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.069 
because the tech add-on is on the way
right<00:03:16.519> now<00:03:16.549> so<00:03:16.880> he<00:03:16.940> sees<00:03:17.239> it<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.540> yeah<00:03:17.840> he<00:03:17.989> is

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
right now so he sees it now yeah he is

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.449 
right now so he sees it now yeah he is
going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.320> scout<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.769> he<00:03:18.890> did<00:03:19.040> last<00:03:19.070> time

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
going to scout it like he did last time

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.069 
going to scout it like he did last time
but<00:03:19.640> he<00:03:19.700> made<00:03:19.940> a<00:03:19.970> crucial<00:03:20.359> mistake<00:03:20.540> last<00:03:20.989> time

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
but he made a crucial mistake last time

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.750 
but he made a crucial mistake last time
so<00:03:21.290> hopefully<00:03:21.380> he<00:03:21.680> doesn't<00:03:21.890> repeat<00:03:22.280> his<00:03:22.519> same

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
so hopefully he doesn't repeat his same

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.369 
so hopefully he doesn't repeat his same
mistakes<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.870> don't<00:03:24.019> think<00:03:24.109> he<00:03:24.230> will

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
mistakes and I don't think he will

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.320 
mistakes and I don't think he will
though<00:03:24.560> I'm<00:03:25.010> sure<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.670> time<00:03:25.849> he's<00:03:26.090> going<00:03:26.239> to

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
though I'm sure this time he's going to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.970 
though I'm sure this time he's going to
know<00:03:26.450> what's<00:03:26.690> up<00:03:26.870> he's<00:03:27.110> probably<00:03:27.409> saving<00:03:27.769> up

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
know what's up he's probably saving up

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.860 
know what's up he's probably saving up
minerals<00:03:28.129> for<00:03:28.550> gas<00:03:28.819> for<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.090> circling<00:03:29.510> speed

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
minerals for gas for that circling speed

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.660 
minerals for gas for that circling speed
and<00:03:30.170> he's<00:03:30.680> going<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.890> start<00:03:31.069> pumping<00:03:31.370> out<00:03:31.459> mass

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
and he's going to start pumping out mass

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:32.979 
and he's going to start pumping out mass
lings<00:03:31.909> I<00:03:32.030> would<00:03:32.150> imagine<00:03:32.330> well<00:03:32.629> maybe<00:03:32.840> not

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
lings I would imagine well maybe not

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.509 
lings I would imagine well maybe not
mass<00:03:33.230> but<00:03:33.470> enough<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.830> deal<00:03:34.010> with<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.190> couple

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
mass but enough to deal with a couple

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.699 
mass but enough to deal with a couple
initial<00:03:34.879> Reapers<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.900> queen<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:36.379> pretty

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
initial Reapers and a queen is pretty

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.259 
initial Reapers and a queen is pretty
darn<00:03:36.950> good<00:03:37.040> against<00:03:37.400> Reapers<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:37.849> well<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:38.150> do

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
darn good against Reapers as well we do

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.149 
darn good against Reapers as well we do
have<00:03:38.299> a<00:03:38.480> queen<00:03:38.750> building<00:03:39.680> inside<00:03:40.010> the

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
have a queen building inside the

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.530 
have a queen building inside the
hatchery<00:03:40.519> as<00:03:40.640> well<00:03:40.849> so<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.060> think<00:03:41.180> he's<00:03:41.420> going

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
hatchery as well so I think he's going

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.750 
hatchery as well so I think he's going
to<00:03:41.599> be<00:03:41.659> pretty<00:03:41.900> well<00:03:42.080> off<00:03:42.110> this<00:03:42.440> time<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.519> he's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
to be pretty well off this time and he's

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.430 
to be pretty well off this time and he's
probably<00:03:44.090> not<00:03:44.299> gonna<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.810> know<00:03:44.930> die<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.349> the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
probably not gonna you know die in the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.690 
probably not gonna you know die in the
first<00:03:45.590> couple<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:46.010> minutes<00:03:46.280> hopefully<00:03:46.459> he

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
first couple of minutes hopefully he

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.890 
first couple of minutes hopefully he
gives<00:03:46.849> us<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.060> better<00:03:47.150> game<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.690> there

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
gives us a better game this one there

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.600 
gives us a better game this one there
goes<00:03:48.079> the<00:03:48.110> surging<00:03:48.560> speed<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.459> way

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
goes the surging speed it is on the way

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.160 
goes the surging speed it is on the way
right<00:03:49.909> now<00:03:49.940> so<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.510> exactly<00:03:50.840> what<00:03:51.140> you

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
right now so this is exactly what you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.750 
right now so this is exactly what you
have<00:03:51.319> to<00:03:51.440> do<00:03:51.560> as<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.860> Zerg<00:03:52.010> player<00:03:52.280> against

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
have to do as the Zerg player against

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.729 
have to do as the Zerg player against
these<00:03:52.879> early<00:03:53.269> Reaper<00:03:53.599> build<00:03:53.840> because<00:03:54.440> like<00:03:54.620> we

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
these early Reaper build because like we

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.050 
these early Reaper build because like we
were<00:03:54.829> saying<00:03:54.980> just<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.280> second<00:03:55.579> ago<00:03:55.640> then<00:03:55.940> here

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
were saying just a second ago then here

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.220 
were saying just a second ago then here
comes<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.299> reap<00:03:56.420> right<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:56.659> he's<00:03:56.810> hopping<00:03:57.140> on

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
comes to reap right now he's hopping on

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.600 
comes to reap right now he's hopping on
his<00:03:57.379> way<00:03:57.470> over<00:03:57.500> here<00:03:57.860> if<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.310> keep<00:03:58.459> the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
his way over here if you keep the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.039 
his way over here if you keep the
zerglings<00:03:58.849> on<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.239> creep<00:03:59.510> the<00:03:59.690> Reaper<00:04:00.019> they

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
zerglings on the creep the Reaper they

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.809 
zerglings on the creep the Reaper they
can't<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.829> that<00:04:00.950> much<00:04:01.099> because<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.519> or<00:04:01.640> gangs

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
can't do that much because this or gangs

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.339 
can't do that much because this or gangs
are<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.180> incredibly<00:04:02.569> fast<00:04:02.810> especially<00:04:03.019> with

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
are so incredibly fast especially with

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.380 
are so incredibly fast especially with
that<00:04:03.379> zorbing<00:04:03.769> speed<00:04:04.069> mm-hmm<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:04.730> here<00:04:05.150> comes

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
that zorbing speed mm-hmm and here comes

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.030 
that zorbing speed mm-hmm and here comes
the<00:04:05.510> first<00:04:05.660> Reaper<00:04:06.079> right<00:04:06.230> now<00:04:06.349> it<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.680> moving

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
the first Reaper right now it is moving

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.500 
the first Reaper right now it is moving
into<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.430> Zerg<00:04:07.579> players<00:04:07.790> based<00:04:08.030> i'm<00:04:08.180> not<00:04:08.329> sure

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
into the Zerg players based i'm not sure

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.759 
into the Zerg players based i'm not sure
if<00:04:08.629> there<00:04:08.750> was<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.870> second<00:04:09.319> Reaper<00:04:09.530> already

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
if there was a second Reaper already

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.770 
if there was a second Reaper already
moving<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.220> it<00:04:10.940> looks<00:04:11.269> like<00:04:11.390> just<00:04:11.569> going<00:04:11.629> to

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
moving in it looks like just going to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.970 
moving in it looks like just going to
dance<00:04:11.989> through<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.200> moon<00:04:12.410> walk<00:04:12.590> back<00:04:12.950> and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
dance through the moon walk back and

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.770 
dance through the moon walk back and
forth<00:04:13.190> across<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.640> rocks<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.239> now<00:04:14.720> the

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
forth across the rocks and now the

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.629 
forth across the rocks and now the
circling<00:04:15.319> is<00:04:15.409> coming<00:04:15.709> in<00:04:15.799> there<00:04:15.980> and<00:04:16.160> fending

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
circling is coming in there and fending

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.310 
circling is coming in there and fending
off<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.789> Reaper<00:04:17.120> exactly<00:04:17.630> what<00:04:17.780> Rhett<00:04:18.019> needed

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
off the Reaper exactly what Rhett needed

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.449 
off the Reaper exactly what Rhett needed
the<00:04:18.380> first<00:04:18.530> game<00:04:18.799> but<00:04:18.949> this<00:04:19.100> time<00:04:19.220> he's<00:04:19.400> gonna

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
the first game but this time he's gonna

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.099 
the first game but this time he's gonna
be<00:04:19.579> able<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.820> hold<00:04:19.910> it<00:04:20.030> off<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.389> we'll<00:04:20.930> see

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
be able to hold it off and we'll see

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.540 
be able to hold it off and we'll see
what<00:04:21.260> he<00:04:21.320> decides<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.680> go<00:04:21.799> to<00:04:21.859> gonna<00:04:22.130> be<00:04:22.310> going

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
what he decides to go to gonna be going

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.180

just<00:06:09.020> they're<00:06:09.320> melting<00:06:09.919> away<00:06:10.010> extremely

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
just they're melting away extremely

quickly<00:06:11.000> this<00:06:11.120> is<00:06:11.300> so<00:06:11.510> bad<00:06:11.660> for<00:06:11.720> LZ<00:06:12.110> yeah<00:06:12.530> I

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
quickly this is so bad for LZ yeah I

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.620 
quickly this is so bad for LZ yeah I
think<00:06:12.770> LZ<00:06:13.400> right<00:06:13.580> now<00:06:13.669> has<00:06:13.850> lost<00:06:14.150> probably

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
think LZ right now has lost probably

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.590 
think LZ right now has lost probably

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
LZ go that same bill that he went in

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.420 
LZ go that same bill that he went in
game<00:06:44.750> number<00:06:44.900> one<00:06:45.229> and<00:06:45.770> so<00:06:46.010> Rhett<00:06:46.190> just

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
game number one and so Rhett just

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.920

straight-up<00:06:46.669> countered<00:06:47.180> it<00:06:47.300> with<00:06:47.540> a<00:06:47.570> his

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
straight-up countered it with a his

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.080 
straight-up countered it with a his
opening<00:06:48.260> build<00:06:48.410> yeah<00:06:48.890> he<00:06:49.130> saw<00:06:49.430> it<00:06:49.490> and<00:06:49.700> I<00:06:49.880> mean

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
opening build yeah he saw it and I mean

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.969 
opening build yeah he saw it and I mean
I<00:06:50.270> guess<00:06:50.479> elsies<00:06:50.960> of<00:06:51.140> the<00:06:51.229> mindset<00:06:51.650> is<00:06:51.800> you

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
I guess elsies of the mindset is you

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:53.469 
I guess elsies of the mindset is you
know<00:06:52.070> you<00:06:52.130> don't<00:06:52.370> fix<00:06:52.580> what<00:06:52.790> ain't<00:06:52.880> broke<00:06:53.150> so

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
know you don't fix what ain't broke so

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.850 
know you don't fix what ain't broke so
first<00:06:53.840> game<00:06:53.990> it<00:06:54.260> worked<00:06:54.440> he<00:06:54.590> thought<00:06:54.740> he'd

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
first game it worked he thought he'd

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.440 
first game it worked he thought he'd
tried<00:06:55.040> again<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:55.340> second<00:06:55.640> game<00:06:55.760> alright<00:06:56.330> so

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.450 
tried again the second game alright so
