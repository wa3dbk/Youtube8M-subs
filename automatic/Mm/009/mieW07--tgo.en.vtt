00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.140
 the Japanese honda engine factory said it hopes to become even more 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.660
 ecological with its next generation of electric vehicles and stations 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.119
 solar recharge 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.119
 On Monday the company offered the media 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.550
 advancement of the new technology with a demonstration at its center 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.689
 Research published outside of Tokyo 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.499
 here we have the report honda says he is looking to create a system of 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.510
 transport solar energy 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.620
 that you can use your electric vehicles plug-in hybrids t2 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.800
 and four wheels 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.210
 it is a line that the company calls personal mobility 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.040
 is conducting a series of tests with the local government of setama japan 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.950
 honda hopes to establish the viability of its electric vehicles and stations 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
 of recharge converged solar for daily use on a national scale 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.950
 the ingenious 10-kilowatt solar panel installed on the roof of the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:52.640
 station 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.970
 can invent four electric vehicles at the same time for one day 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.730
 of use 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.610
 It was designed by Honda for its line of electric cars including panels 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.140
 solar are manufactured by honda j &amp; j with the prisoners 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 this is a situation of necessity a part of these experiments of our 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.220
 electric vehicles are charged with electricity in gin of 15 if 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.400
 It takes less than six hours to fully charge an electric vehicle 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.990
 with 220 volts montero which allows the vehicle to circulate up to 100 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.320
 miles 160 kilometers 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 fujimoto said that an application for smartphones that monitors the capacity 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.649
 The vehicle's driver also owes convenience to drivers 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.030
 among other things 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 the phone can show the map to the driver to where he can drive the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.439
 vehicle with its remaining battery charge 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.370
 and look for the nearest recharge station 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.260
 then the phone will transmit the information to the computer on board the 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.560
 vehicle that then the driver comes into space 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.350
 1 using a smartphone the driver after the defeats of the batteries or 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.370
 the untiring childhood cobain 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.440
 one or provincial or wheels the tc meo and a montcoal outboard motor in the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.430
 200 were made known 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.920
 they will also be rechargeable with the same system 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 the CEO of honda hopes that this project will test ensure the 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.759
 ecological credentials of honda 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.850
 based on the results of this experiment 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.020
 added to two wheels to four-wheel drive technology 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.299
 outboard 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.249
 and allowing households to be able to generate stored energy 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.299
 decisive to sell the vehicles efficiently honda will continue with its 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.369
 fiction plan everything to the parade 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:32.449
 honda bring their innovations from the us and china as part of their 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.809
 plan at the beginning of the new year
