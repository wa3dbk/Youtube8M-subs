six<00:01:37.710> minutes<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:40.220> generally<00:01:41.220> they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
six minutes on here and generally they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.639 
six minutes on here and generally they
tighten<00:01:42.240> up<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.430> become<00:01:44.670> pink<00:01:45.649> I'm

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
tighten up and they become pink I'm

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
tighten up and they become pink I'm
going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.189> freezer<00:01:47.540> let

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
going to put these in the freezer let

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
going to put these in the freezer let
them<00:01:48.630> cool<00:01:48.750> off<00:01:49.880> all<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.030> I'm<00:01:51.240> gonna<00:01:51.390> let

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
them cool off all right I'm gonna let

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.780 
them cool off all right I'm gonna let
these<00:01:51.689> cool<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.320> probably<00:01:52.680> 15<00:01:53.009> 20<00:01:53.369> minutes

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
these cool for probably 15 20 minutes

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.880 
these cool for probably 15 20 minutes
and<00:01:54.000> I'm<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.270> stir<00:01:54.479> them<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.740> an

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and I'm going to stir them so it's an

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.039 
and I'm going to stir them so it's an
even<00:01:56.250> cooling<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.850> don't<00:01:57.420> freeze<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.780> don't

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
even cooling and don't freeze them don't

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.359 
even cooling and don't freeze them don't
let<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.350> frozen<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.159> i'm<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
let them get frozen all right i'm just

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.660 
let them get frozen all right i'm just
using<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> freezer<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.270> save<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.869> time

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
using the freezer to save a little time

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.440 
using the freezer to save a little time
all<00:02:02.670> right<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.500> we've<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> scallops

sufficiently<00:02:08.759> cooled<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:10.289> our<00:02:10.410> next

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
sufficiently cooled and in our next

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.199 
sufficiently cooled and in our next
segment<00:02:10.739> we're<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.520> dice<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.150> up

segment we're going to dice these up

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
segment we're going to dice these up
we're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> throw<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.290> together

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
we're going to throw this all together
