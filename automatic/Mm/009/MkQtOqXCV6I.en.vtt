00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.610
 hi i am marcel hustings 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 guitar builder and repairer at alphenaar 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.309
 music store I'm going to tell something about 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.539
 tuning guitars with Dutch 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.449
 they are also called after such a done 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.910
 spanish guitar or classical guitar and 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.160
 with adjustment actually do that he so 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.420
 well playable is made that one 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.420
 player can handle it 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.920
 traditionally have this type of instrument 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.579
 no neck pin that is an adjustable 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.640
 Rod 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.520
 with which the hollow link can be adjusted 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.309
 In that case you can adjust the top 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.870
 You can adjust this and the height 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.870
 of the bone 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.800
 in determining the height of the strings 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.800
 relative to the neck 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.890
 this is a guitar from the later class 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.579
 later generation that does have one 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.529
 With that we can make the turn 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.709
 adjust the curvature of the neck 

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:14.999
 I'm going to show what that or what effect 

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:18.529
 has noises about playability 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:18.529
 and therefore how the guitar behaves 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.110
 now becomes all kinds of noise buzz 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.049
 that arise because the string vibrates 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.259
 and the string goes 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.860
 zoom against another from your this 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.860
 they call ferrets 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.560
 this is the adjustable key and this is 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.240
 the place where with this guitar 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.240
 the neck pin can be adjusted 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.610
 so enter the key in the relevant one 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.060
 put the bus weary and let's take a look 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:19.530
 what happens when I do something about the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:23.400
 adjustment of this guitar okay 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.120
 except is now in a sort of bend 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.120
 small plate 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.530
 and the guitar now sounds like us 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.470
 actually want to have 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.390
 so he runs pretty pretty no noise 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.210
 that's what you want on one 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.940
 classical guitar 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.790
 the height of the summit is important 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.900
 so how deep the slots 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.320
 if it is stained that the high then I can 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.320
 do something about it 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.980
 so a small adjustment that the guitar 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.480
 optimizes 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.210
 making that are not too heavy playable 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 and as pure as possible with the 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.970
 better instruments can make it interesting 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.240
 to continue the intonation 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.550
 improve by light string length 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.110
 vary certain way of it can 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.930
 little editing which makes the string length 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.720
 in a certain pattern and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.340
 the guitar is pure all 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.440
 instruments here in the store that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.870
 look this way well on time it 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.500
 all is optimal then you can go for years 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.500
 have fun with it
