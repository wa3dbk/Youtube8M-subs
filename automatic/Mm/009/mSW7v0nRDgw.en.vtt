 Occasion I come bringing you windows 7 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.150
 bits the last good 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.920
 this is a windows that is modified and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.279
 what modifies takes away a lot of things 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.619
 then to look at what things take away from us 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.890
 I tell you the management of the video a post 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 what I did then here are what it says 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.500
 the modifications that are made to him what is 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.860
 what it takes away from him and the things that I know not 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.290
 I think I'll see you here in the requirements of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 system then that's so good the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.160
 processor and the no minimum boot 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:52.079
 512 ram space hard 10 gigas and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.010
 departure was it should have 128 mb us 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:00.600
 is going well and will come in Spanish is going to 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.140
 660 megabyte imputable and good not 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.530
 has everything turned on manually and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.610
 well, this one 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.850
 it's the same as windows 7 and what has 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.850
 changed many things and the truth is not going 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.060
 to have all the issues that have porte 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.400
 wildlife of our windows normally 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.490
 we have to carry per found 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.170
 is loved windows 7 and the others not for 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.840
 characters messages update this is not going 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.600
 to open up in theory this alone well the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.820
 verb in patching to install systems 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.640
 third-party or installing in no 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.610
 problem and neither to live producers 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.320
 are going to deactivate or carlos 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.830
 of sale min removes this there are some a 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.640
 weights a misunderstanding is lighter with the 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.649
 internet everything will be the same everything but 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.780
 will not have some tools what 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.540
 who have 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.560
 and windows I think also this windows 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.450
 the defect that it has is young is that it 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.069
 resolution point is made 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.819
 automatically touch it manually 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.340
 I am sure but good you will say already 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.690
 not proven and good would happen if 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.510
 winrar and windows 7 live and you're going to 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.380
 give live that folder we are going to open it and 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.380
 good will contain 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.830
