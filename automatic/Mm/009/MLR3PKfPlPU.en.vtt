00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.500
 user if it is not serious now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 force only for administrative 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.590
 references are beautiful words from 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.299
 a women's magazine 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.860
 usually these magazines in things of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.750
 know that your partner is

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.390
 restless and think you're here are all 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.329

 all establishes a book on which 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.680
 literary critics said ahead 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.960
 watching a video that is circulating through 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.659
 that you did not want to delete the news on 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.479
 site did not respect the English newspaper I 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.189
 I swear I thought the video was 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.689
 a joke made with special effects or 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 most talked about video is that has a 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.469
 happy end this is that it is not visible in the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.210
 video but you know that yes 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.770
 that which bathes the images were 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.180
 captured by security cameras from the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.509
 past traffic 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.410
 on October 8 and people on cushion in the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.490
 China 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.040
 the man called we so typical is very 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.680
 difficult but silva province is a man 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.080
 called and tried to cross a road 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.940
 pretty busy and I think 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.280
 sincerely that the newest pro 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 Then was the sins in the midst of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.350
 transit and then I is across 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.170
 for the first time is another moment 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.540
 frankly silly a car goes by so 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.910
 slow and I behind him that manga 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.300
 low touching the tail a car is 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.660
 according to both I am flying for a second 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.160
 car and finally happens the most 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.989
 unbelievable mind forever in this 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 by now are people back is my 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.520
 try to understand what has happened and 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.060
 to note that the band not to sit on 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.800
 neither the passersby who are helping 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.180
 and hangs very much on top of it and 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.470
 think a frontal crash now goes 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.390
 reverse 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.310
 clearly the man does not engage the march 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.480
 behind and avoid back goes forward 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.600
 another plan to a third time the summer 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.120
 I've never seen anything like this I've never been 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.570
 Moment the man is alive, it 's to endure. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:24.060
 buy it there the video on facebook 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.060
 little and now great css innovations 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:36.290
 How did I make a video look at the i1? 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:44.990
 shin koike the shell is the with full cable 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:47.390
 is this is gael Liel and great 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.700
 science in a story full of intrigue 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.020
 and scientific tension and I know that 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.760
 it's at the start it may seem annoying 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.970
 initially but does not turn off the story 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.860
 is very bizarre and involves intimate parts 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.500
 so it gets green 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.170
 years ago a young woman of 20 years called 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.690
 odre American ratings 12 alone one 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.400
 company called sue pitt in Portuguese 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.680
 of the neck looks like the name of a 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.110
 fine pastry but not a company 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.150
 women-oriented science 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.790
 in particular for the creation of 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.100
 probiotic medications to improve the 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.890
 woman's intimate health 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.840
 which realize that summarizing case it 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.669
 associated with that of his male colleagues 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.440
 incompatibilized with it ended up 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.480
 away from the very company it 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.710
 created their pizza and so when I 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.169
 I left homes presenting the news 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.010
 of the company in a center is 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.020
 California 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.760
 It is time that you have very new ideas of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.160
 women around the world to have more 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.870
 health at the level of his to the producer 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.750
 she was horrified 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.970
 the two types picking themselves up in the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.760
 company announce the creation of 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.960
 a new probiotic medicine that 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.710
 doing justice to the company's name sue pizza 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.620
 can generate god official in the organ 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.740
 common sexual desire is to want 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:09.830
 enters the computer system and can 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:12.140
 so change to beat the scent 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.080
 and why we used the company 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.160
 because for this once again these two 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.740
 types say the drug can 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.780
 to make the private parts of the 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.910
 ladies I started to have the greatest weight is 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.590
 that God held the idea in this 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.870
 conference is scary euro said 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.750
 basically the smell you 're lord 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.610
 is at stake is not human 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.000
 is a scent produced by creatures that 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.890
 live within you is not clearly 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.600
 most scientific language in the world 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.420
 the same group is developing a 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.420
 biotechnological product that once again 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:52.940
 prepare if the parties 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:56.650
 of the ladies leaving and roses and 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.650
 know the coca-cola diet option 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.180
 I wanted to comment 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.880
 witty that no one yet but not 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.470
 found nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing at all. 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.660
 which we can only do on the second 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.100
 Today's session, humanity tries to 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.340
 improve the smell of another function 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.340
 body and is also very very rich. 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:26.990
 drank rock it's and the river images of 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.200
 another unfortunate moment that all right 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.140
 the third vehicle that yes and yes in 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.270
 I do not want to be 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:41.780
 rich you clear ask me only what 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:44.920
 also will only find the Swiss already 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.920
 Did we know better? 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.450
 I was so fascinated entered it's only in the 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.640
 figure without the man river 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.169
 I had not realized that the reason for 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.620
 that go ahead because they hit by 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.720
 back 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.910
 I think I 'll learn a non-action 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.460
 mattress not if on the street did not say so with 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.340
 the shell does not mean that this is not what 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.880
 Are you going to call the man alive? 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.690
 besides the elements that also came together 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.140
 with michael w 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.140
 ae
