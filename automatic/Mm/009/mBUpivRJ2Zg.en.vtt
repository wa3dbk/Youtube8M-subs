00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.970 
think some orange could have been maybe
a<00:00:43.140> different<00:00:43.290> color<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> think<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
a different color like I think the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.170 
a different color like I think the

straps should have been this dark

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.450 
straps should have been this dark
emerald<00:00:45.539> by<00:00:45.750> mean<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.710> being<00:00:46.950> kind<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
emerald by mean that's being kind of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.029
