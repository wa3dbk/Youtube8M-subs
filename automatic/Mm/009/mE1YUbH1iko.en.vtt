00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
hated doing stuff like that like in it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
hated doing stuff like that like in it
it<00:01:26.670> frustrates<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.869> had<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.259> download

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it frustrates me that I had to download

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.560 
it frustrates me that I had to download
something<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.759> fight<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.270> boss

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
something like that to fight that boss

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770 
something like that to fight that boss
like<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.579> because<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> time<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.090> play<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
like I because of the time I play the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
like I because of the time I play the
game<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.290> always<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.280> three<00:01:35.939> or

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
game I don't always have for three or

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.740 
game I don't always have for three or
four<00:01:36.119> players<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> invite<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:38.750> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
four players I can invite in so it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
four players I can invite in so it
boggles<00:01:40.229> my<00:01:40.380> mind<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.799> gearbox<00:01:41.100> wouldn't

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
boggles my mind that gearbox wouldn't

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
boggles my mind that gearbox wouldn't
add<00:01:41.820> something<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> game<00:01:43.140> to

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
add something like that to the game to

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
add something like that to the game to
just<00:01:43.860> allow<00:01:44.369> us<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.820> bump<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> difficulty<00:01:45.840> up

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
just allow us to bump the difficulty up

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
just allow us to bump the difficulty up
it<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.350> really<00:01:46.619> make<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.189> game<00:01:47.430> much<00:01:48.270> much

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it would really make the game much much

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.810 
it would really make the game much much
more<00:01:49.259> user<00:01:49.530> friendly<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:50.070> people<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.640> play

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
more user friendly to people that play

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380
