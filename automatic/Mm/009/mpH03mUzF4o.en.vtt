some crash
they<00:02:10.610> might<00:02:10.789> have<00:02:10.909> had<00:02:10.970> what<00:02:11.870> are<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> things

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
they might have had what are the things

what<00:02:12.709> is<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:12.860> thought<00:02:13.099> process<00:02:13.640> that<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.879> go

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
through to recover mentally from from a

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.960 
through to recover mentally from from a
big<00:02:16.549> crash<00:02:17.079> well<00:02:18.079> I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:19.370> hard<00:02:19.549> at

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
big crash well I think it's hard at

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.240 
big crash well I think it's hard at
first<00:02:20.360> when<00:02:20.989> you're<00:02:21.260> trying<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.739> accept<00:02:22.099> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
first when you're trying to accept the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.869 
first when you're trying to accept the
fact<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.720> either<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.870> you're<00:02:24.319> injured<00:02:24.739> or<00:02:25.040> B

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
fact that either a you're injured or B

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.569 
fact that either a you're injured or B
you're<00:02:26.090> scared<00:02:26.450> or<00:02:27.010> three<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.159> have<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.459> go

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
you're scared or three you have to go

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.539 
you're scared or three you have to go
back<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.930> at<00:02:30.109> first<00:02:30.260> usually<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:31.040> mean<00:02:31.340> this

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
back so at first usually I mean this

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.660 
back so at first usually I mean this
time<00:02:31.819> especially<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.659> just<00:02:33.470> kind<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.829> took<00:02:34.489> it

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
time especially I just kind of took it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.130 
time especially I just kind of took it
really<00:02:34.849> really<00:02:35.000> easy<00:02:35.180> for<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.629> couple<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.959> days

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
really really easy for a couple of days

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.110 
really really easy for a couple of days
and<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.620> know<00:02:36.769> I<00:02:37.040> thought<00:02:37.489> about<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.879> a<00:02:37.939> lot

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
and you know I thought about it a lot

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.550 
and you know I thought about it a lot
I<00:02:38.299> thought<00:02:38.480> about<00:02:38.720> crashing<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.230> thought<00:02:39.409> about

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
I thought about crashing I thought about

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.500 
I thought about crashing I thought about
what<00:02:39.739> happened<00:02:40.099> I<00:02:40.250> thought<00:02:40.370> about<00:02:40.519> what<00:02:41.269> could

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
what happened I thought about what could

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.830 
what happened I thought about what could
happen<00:02:41.750> next<00:02:42.319> time<00:02:42.620> but<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:44.000> think<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.659> have

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
happen next time but I I think you have

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.720 
happen next time but I I think you have
to<00:02:45.019> just<00:02:45.230> come<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.859> accept<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.340> fact<00:02:46.430> that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
to just come to accept the fact that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.149 
to just come to accept the fact that
you're<00:02:46.940> taking<00:02:47.359> those<00:02:47.480> risks<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.200> this<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.129> a

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 
you're taking those risks and this is a

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.869 
you're taking those risks and this is a
very<00:02:49.819> risky<00:02:50.060> sport<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:51.049> safe<00:02:51.379> so

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
very risky sport and it's not safe so

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.670 
very risky sport and it's not safe so
you<00:02:52.879> you<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.079> you<00:02:54.590> know

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
you you have to know that you know

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.470 
you you have to know that you know
everybody<00:02:55.159> takes<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.489> crash<00:02:55.700> everybody<00:02:56.269> gets
