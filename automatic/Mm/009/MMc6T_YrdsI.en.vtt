from<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.110> only<00:00:52.140> apps

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
from you these are really the only apps

from you these are really the only apps
that<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> need<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> concern<00:00:53.100> yourself<00:00:53.129> with

that you need to concern yourself with
so<00:00:54.090> these<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> best<00:00:54.629> candidates<00:00:55.140> for

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
so these are the best candidates for

so these are the best candidates for
hibernation<00:00:55.469> other<00:00:56.340> actually<00:00:56.820> don't<00:00:57.000> start

up on their own won't have this big of
an<00:00:58.859> impact<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.430> battery<00:00:59.730> life<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
an impact on your battery life so you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.549 
an impact on your battery life so you
don't<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.629> need<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> worry<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.230> them

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
don't really need to worry about them

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
don't really need to worry about them
but<00:01:02.219> for<00:01:02.340> me<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.760> select<00:01:02.969> any<00:01:03.359> apps<00:01:03.600> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
but for me or just select any apps that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.080 
but for me or just select any apps that
you<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> force<00:01:04.500> into<00:01:04.739> hibernation

you would like to force into hibernation

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.190 
you would like to force into hibernation
again<00:01:06.090> hibernation<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.720> prevent<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.140> from

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
again hibernation will prevent them from

again hibernation will prevent them from
running<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> background<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.460> may<00:01:08.610> not

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
running in the background so you may not

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.980 
running in the background so you may not
want<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.390> apps<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> you'd<00:01:09.900> like
