00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
use that flared design right there so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.049 
use that flared design right there so
you<00:00:34.079> see<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.410> kind<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> angles<00:00:35.519> up<00:00:35.699> right<00:00:35.879> there

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
you see it kind of angles up right there

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.860 
you see it kind of angles up right there
in<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.210> corner

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
in that corner

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.119 
in that corner
so<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.260> allow<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.620> deflect

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
so that's gonna allow you to deflect

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.009 
so that's gonna allow you to deflect
some<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.430> pucks<00:00:38.699> into<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.179> pocket<00:00:39.929> a

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
some of those pucks into the pocket a

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.229 
some of those pucks into the pocket a
little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.379> easier<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.699> they<00:00:41.820> also<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
little bit easier and then they also are

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.750 
little bit easier and then they also are
using<00:00:42.570> their<00:00:42.719> full<00:00:42.989> flex<00:00:43.379> seam<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.519> basically

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
using their full flex seam so basically

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.579 
using their full flex seam so basically
what<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.449> there's<00:00:46.019> a<00:00:46.109> seam<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> runs

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
what that is is there's a seam that runs

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.130 
what that is is there's a seam that runs
all<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.219> through<00:00:47.339> right<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.359> where<00:00:49.019> you

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
all the way through right here where you

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
all the way through right here where you
do<00:00:49.350> flex<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> open<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> close<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> catcher

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
do flex the open and close the catcher

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.630 
do flex the open and close the catcher
so<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.379> really<00:00:52.679> allows<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> open<00:00:53.519> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so it really allows you to open and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
so it really allows you to open and
close<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.999> very<00:00:54.449> easily<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
close it very easily right out of the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
close it very easily right out of the
box<00:00:55.769> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> nice<00:00:56.280> feature<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:56.940> on

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
box so it's a nice feature to see on

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.840 
box so it's a nice feature to see on
this<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.649> into<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> main

microbial lining right there so again

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.020 
microbial lining right there so again
gonna<00:02:17.010> help<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> wick<00:02:17.490> away<00:02:17.520> some<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.910> the
