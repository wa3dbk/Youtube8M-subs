can't<00:00:00.299> we've<00:00:01.020> got<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.199> wild<00:00:01.650> bill's<00:00:01.860> mare<00:00:02.190> in

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
can't we've got a wild bill's mare in

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.880 
can't we've got a wild bill's mare in
here<00:00:02.490> now<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:03.030> so<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.230> it<00:00:04.350> takes<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.650> fit

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
here now and so is what it takes to fit

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.280 
here now and so is what it takes to fit
tree<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.220> horse<00:00:05.460> well<00:00:06.390> first<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.839> all<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.259> of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
tree to horse well first of all one of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.799 
tree to horse well first of all one of
them<00:00:07.700> interesting<00:00:08.700> things<00:00:08.940> about<00:00:09.090> saddle<00:00:09.599> fit

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
them interesting things about saddle fit

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.980 
them interesting things about saddle fit
is<00:00:09.990> if<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:10.650> look<00:00:10.860> at<00:00:11.010> most<00:00:11.250> horses<00:00:11.580> backs<00:00:12.000> from

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
is if you look at most horses backs from

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.589 
is if you look at most horses backs from
behind<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.440> shoulder<00:00:13.920> back<00:00:14.599> their

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
behind the shoulder back their

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.269 
behind the shoulder back their
conformation<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.650> their<00:00:16.830> backs<00:00:17.039> are

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
conformation of their backs are

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.910 
conformation of their backs are
surprisingly<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.029> same<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:19.230> tends<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.740> be

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
surprisingly the same what tends to be

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.130 
surprisingly the same what tends to be
an<00:00:20.369> issue<00:00:20.520> with<00:00:20.789> saddle<00:00:21.300> fit<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.720> where<00:00:21.990> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
an issue with saddle fit is where the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
an issue with saddle fit is where the
scapula<00:00:22.710> comes<00:00:22.949> into<00:00:23.220> play<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
scapula comes into play and then of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.890 
scapula comes into play and then of
course<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.869> height<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> wither<00:00:25.609> so

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
course the height of the wither so

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.630 
course the height of the wither so
whenever<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.109> set<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.010> horses<00:00:29.429> back

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
whenever we set this on this horses back

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.400 
whenever we set this on this horses back
the<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.480> want<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.170> locate

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
the first thing we want to do is locate

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.520 
the first thing we want to do is locate
this<00:00:31.859> marriage<00:00:32.189> scapula<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.260> marriage

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
this marriage scapula so this marriage

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.139 
this marriage scapula so this marriage
back<00:00:34.739> comes<00:00:35.040> back<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.489> about<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.940> here

behind<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.180> scapula<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.020> we're

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
behind the scapula and what we're

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 
behind the scapula and what we're
looking<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.340> we've<00:00:44.489> got<00:00:44.760> no

staying away from the spine so we've got

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.649 
staying away from the spine so we've got

explain<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> us<00:01:47.909> those<00:01:48.090> two<00:01:48.299> positions<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
explain to us those two positions and I

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.330 
explain to us those two positions and I
know<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.290> hard<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.530> show<00:01:49.710> them<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.130> tree

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
know it's hard to show them just a tree

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.980 
know it's hard to show them just a tree
but<00:01:50.850> explain<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.180> us<00:01:51.450> those<00:01:51.630> two<00:01:51.810> positions

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
but explain to us those two positions

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.569 
but explain to us those two positions
and<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.799> into<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.189> more<00:01:53.460> when

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
and we can get into a little more when

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.160 
and we can get into a little more when
we<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.939> full<00:01:54.119> leather<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.659> saddle

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
we have the full leather on this saddle

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.850 
we have the full leather on this saddle
okay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
okay

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
okay
well<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> set<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.299> tree<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.930> mares<00:01:58.229> back

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
well I set this tree on this mares back

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.630 
well I set this tree on this mares back
without<00:01:59.250> any<00:02:00.020> conscious<00:02:01.020> thought<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.710> where

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
without any conscious thought of where

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.670 
without any conscious thought of where
to<00:02:02.790> rig<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.869> her<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to rig it because her back is going to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
to rig it because her back is going to
tell<00:02:04.920> us<00:02:05.070> where<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> rig<00:02:05.549> needs<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.060> placed

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
tell us where the rig needs to be placed

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
tell us where the rig needs to be placed
and<00:02:06.719> that's<00:02:07.229> one<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.590> issues<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.129> think

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and that's one of the issues I think

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.750 
and that's one of the issues I think
with<00:02:08.640> with<00:02:09.119> saddle<00:02:09.509> making<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.979> many<00:02:11.190> times<00:02:11.520> is

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
with with saddle making so many times is

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
with with saddle making so many times is
that<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:12.030> before<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:12.959> even<00:02:13.200> know<00:02:13.410> how<00:02:13.590> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
that we before we even know how the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.470 
that we before we even know how the
idle<00:02:14.040> needs<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> fit<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> horse<00:02:14.820> we<00:02:15.030> dictate

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
idle needs to fit the horse we dictate

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.360 
idle needs to fit the horse we dictate
where<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.750> saddle<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.260> ride<00:02:16.500> we've

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
where the saddle is going to ride we've

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.690 
where the saddle is going to ride we've
come<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> concept<00:02:18.800> rod<00:02:19.800> Peterson<00:02:20.070> that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
come up with a concept rod Peterson that

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.340 
come up with a concept rod Peterson that
heads<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.120> our<00:02:21.270> saddle<00:02:21.660> shop<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.080> Marten

saddlery<00:02:22.910> has<00:02:23.910> been<00:02:24.120> working<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.600> this<00:02:24.810> in

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
saddlery has been working on this in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.400 
saddlery has been working on this in
conjunction<00:02:25.170> with<00:02:25.620> his<00:02:25.740> wife<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:28.200> about

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
conjunction with his wife and for about

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.210 
conjunction with his wife and for about
two<00:02:28.590> years<00:02:28.830> now

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
two years now

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.520 
two years now
and<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.850> think<00:02:30.090> we've<00:02:30.270> perfected<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.930> rigging

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and we think we've perfected a rigging

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.270 
and we think we've perfected a rigging
system<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.430> accommodates<00:02:33.090> basically<00:02:34.280> every

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
system that accommodates basically every

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.150 
system that accommodates basically every
horse<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:36.450> now<00:02:36.690> again<00:02:36.900> one<00:02:37.440> of<00:02:37.470> your<00:02:37.650> concepts

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
horse and now again one of your concepts

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460 
horse and now again one of your concepts
is<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.880> finish<00:02:39.240> saddle<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.810> only<00:02:40.080> as<00:02:40.290> good

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
is is the finish saddle is only as good

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.140 
is is the finish saddle is only as good
as<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.740> tree<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.760> some<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
as the tree what are some of the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.060 
as the tree what are some of the
detrimental<00:02:42.720> things<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> tree<00:02:43.710> can<00:02:43.890> cause

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
detrimental things that a tree can cause

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.710 
detrimental things that a tree can cause
to<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> horse<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.790> messing<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.570> their

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to a horse and messing up their

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.020 
to a horse and messing up their
performance<00:02:46.470> well<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> lot<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.280> things<00:02:47.550> there's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
performance well a lot of things there's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.420 
performance well a lot of things there's
basically<00:02:48.600> about<00:02:49.110> four<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.620> five<00:02:49.650> things<00:02:50.160> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
basically about four to five things that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.320 
basically about four to five things that
happen<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.180> bad<00:02:51.390> fit<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:53.280> mayor<00:02:53.580> has<00:02:53.850> had

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
happen with bad fit this mayor has had

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.970 
happen with bad fit this mayor has had
some<00:02:54.570> fit<00:02:54.750> issues<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.320> can<00:02:55.560> see<00:02:55.740> some

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
some fit issues as you can see some

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.380 
some fit issues as you can see some
white<00:02:56.010> hairs<00:02:56.370> popping<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:56.940> her<00:02:57.180> right

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
white hairs popping out on her right

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.800 
white hairs popping out on her right
here

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
here

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.520 
here
so<00:02:58.350> that's<00:02:58.980> too<00:02:59.250> much<00:02:59.430> pressure<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.320> the

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
so that's too much pressure we have the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.010 
so that's too much pressure we have the
the<00:03:01.980> situation<00:03:02.640> where<00:03:02.940> there's<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.810> dry

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
the situation where there's the dry

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.949 
the situation where there's the dry
spots<00:03:04.350> or<00:03:04.740> the<00:03:05.220> beginning<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.060> white<00:03:06.300> hairs<00:03:06.600> a

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
spots or the beginning of white hairs a

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.170 
spots or the beginning of white hairs a
lot<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.560> ruffled<00:03:08.010> hair<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> tree<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
lot of ruffled hair with the tree and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.040 
lot of ruffled hair with the tree and
how<00:03:09.300> it<00:03:09.390> fits<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.920> lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.700> times<00:03:11.910> within<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
how it fits a lot of times within a

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.540 
how it fits a lot of times within a
seven<00:03:13.380> eight<00:03:13.500> saddle<00:03:13.920> or<00:03:14.040> if<00:03:14.130> just<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.430> a

seven eight saddle or if just if a
saddle<00:03:14.880> doesn't<00:03:15.209> necessarily<00:03:15.750> fit<00:03:16.020> the

horses back with full even flat contact

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.259 
horses back with full even flat contact
the<00:03:19.110> bars<00:03:19.380> end<00:03:19.739> up<00:03:19.860> riding<00:03:20.190> on<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.880> point<00:03:21.150> of

the bars end up riding on the point of

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
the bars end up riding on the point of
the<00:03:21.420> lawn<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.080> up<00:03:22.650> here<00:03:22.830> on<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> shoulder

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
the lawn and up here on the shoulder

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.640 
the lawn and up here on the shoulder
basically<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.030> four<00:03:24.269> spots<00:03:24.540> bridging<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.470> what

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
basically in four spots bridging is what

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.580 
basically in four spots bridging is what
we<00:03:25.739> call<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.970> other<00:03:27.150> issue<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:28.200> where<00:03:28.440> we

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
we call it the other issue is where we

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.860 
we call it the other issue is where we
have<00:03:28.739> too<00:03:28.950> much<00:03:29.100> rock<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> bar<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.180> so

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
have too much rock in the bar and so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.570 
have too much rock in the bar and so
it's<00:03:31.050> rocking<00:03:31.500> back<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.739> forth<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.489> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
it's rocking back and forth here in the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.550 
it's rocking back and forth here in the
center<00:03:32.940> without<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.900> full<00:03:34.080> contact

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
center without the full contact

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.990 
center without the full contact
throughout<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.220> entire<00:03:35.489> length<00:03:35.760> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
throughout the entire length so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.850 
throughout the entire length so
basically<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:36.720> portion<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.380> tree<00:03:37.650> is

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
basically this portion of the tree is

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.340 
basically this portion of the tree is
the<00:03:38.430> only<00:03:39.000> part<00:03:39.269> that's<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.570> contact<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
the only part that's in contact with the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.330 
the only part that's in contact with the
horse's<00:03:40.709> back<00:03:41.660> trees<00:03:42.660> can<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.900> too<00:03:43.230> narrow<00:03:43.500> so

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
horse's back trees can be too narrow so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.890 
horse's back trees can be too narrow so
that<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.940> tree<00:03:45.209> tends<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.720> ride

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
that the the tree tends to ride

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720 
that the the tree tends to ride
basically<00:03:46.650> on<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.920> edge<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> bar<00:03:47.550> in

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
basically on the edge of the bar in

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.970 
basically on the edge of the bar in
contact<00:03:48.180> with<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.450> horse's<00:03:48.810> back<00:03:49.050> or<00:03:49.739> they

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
contact with the horse's back or they

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.400 
contact with the horse's back or they
can<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.340> so<00:03:50.610> wide<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.630> tree<00:03:52.019> falls<00:03:52.290> down

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
can be so wide that the tree falls down

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.410 
can be so wide that the tree falls down
onto<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.070> back<00:03:53.310> there's<00:03:53.640> not<00:03:53.760> enough<00:03:54.030> gullet

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
onto the back there's not enough gullet

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.720 
onto the back there's not enough gullet
clearance<00:03:54.810> here<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.230> so<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:55.620> have<00:03:55.730> contact

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
clearance here and so we have contact

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.699 
clearance here and so we have contact
with<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.030> spine<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.170> mentioned<00:03:58.590> the

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
about the role that we sometimes get

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.449 
about the role that we sometimes get
