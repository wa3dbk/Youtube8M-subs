high-paying missions I also recommend

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
high-paying missions I also recommend
playing<00:01:07.980> on<00:01:08.190> hard<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.970> way<00:01:09.120> you'll<00:01:09.270> get

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
playing on hard as that way you'll get

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.360 
playing on hard as that way you'll get
the<00:01:09.510> most<00:01:09.690> money<00:01:09.900> possible<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.250> can

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
the most money possible so as you can

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.400 
the most money possible so as you can
see<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> chose<00:01:11.940> potshot<00:01:12.540> because<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.050> payout

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
see I chose potshot because the payout

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.380 
see I chose potshot because the payout
is<00:01:13.680> high<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.730> also<00:01:14.850> doesn't<00:01:15.150> take<00:01:15.300> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is high on it and it also doesn't take a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.510 
is high on it and it also doesn't take a
lot<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.660> time<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> complete<00:01:16.260> and<00:01:16.800> it's<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> lower

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
lot of time to complete and it's a lower

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
lot of time to complete and it's a lower
level<00:01:17.820> mission<00:01:18.270> as<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.260> see<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
level mission as you can see I got a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.320 
level mission as you can see I got a
pretty<00:01:19.980> good<00:01:20.190> amount<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.550> money<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
pretty good amount of money and this is

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.910 
pretty good amount of money and this is
the<00:01:21.540> part<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.780> makes<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.680> good

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the part that makes it a really good

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.370 
the part that makes it a really good
trick<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:24.030> since<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.510> added<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.870> job<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.260> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
trick so since we added the job to the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
trick so since we added the job to the
playlist<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.220> many<00:01:26.400> times<00:01:26.670> instead<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.300> having

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
playlist so many times instead of having

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.510 
playlist so many times instead of having
to<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:28.290> free<00:01:28.620> roam<00:01:28.830> or<00:01:29.040> wait<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to go back to free roam or wait for the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.730 
to go back to free roam or wait for the
intermission<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.660> now<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.380> replay

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
intermission it's now going to replay

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.770

the<00:01:31.920> mission<00:01:32.220> over<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:33.030> making<00:01:33.660> it

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the mission over and over making it

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.500 
the mission over and over making it
extremely<00:01:34.290> efficient<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.190> farm<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510
