00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
I don't know where this buys like

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.400 
I don't know where this buys like
illness<00:00:55.660> clubs<00:00:56.080> on<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.350> one<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:58.200> here<00:00:59.200> you

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
illness clubs on the one and here you

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.430 
illness clubs on the one and here you
see<00:00:59.650> that<00:00:59.920> there<00:01:00.780> detect<00:01:01.780> by<00:01:01.930> gain<00:01:02.170> of<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
see that there detect by gain of the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.550 
see that there detect by gain of the
raindrops<00:01:04.770> anyway<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:07.140> clouds<00:01:08.140> are<00:01:08.320> kind<00:01:08.530> of

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
raindrops anyway the clouds are kind of

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.040 
raindrops anyway the clouds are kind of
like<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.860> flower<00:01:09.640> platforms<00:01:10.630> you'll<00:01:10.870> see

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050

like the flower platforms you'll see
here<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.290> second<00:01:11.740> where<00:01:11.890> you<00:01:11.920> can't<00:01:12.370> step<00:01:12.910> on

you're not in the bee suit when you step

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.920 
you're not in the bee suit when you step
on<00:01:30.760> a<00:01:33.210> couple<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> stages<00:01:34.420> you'll<00:01:34.660> see<00:01:34.810> these

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
on a couple of stages you'll see these

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.450 
on a couple of stages you'll see these
little<00:01:35.020> green<00:01:35.320> pods<00:01:35.619> here<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.070> if<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:36.250> have

been<00:01:36.640> smacking<00:01:37.410> return<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> vine<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.160> if

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
been smacking return to a vine and if

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.900 
been smacking return to a vine and if
you<00:01:39.460> shake<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.060> remote<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:42.040> can<00:01:42.280> do<00:01:42.880> a

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
you shake the remote we can do a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:52.649 
you shake the remote we can do a
gymnastic<00:01:43.840> thing<00:01:44.430> findable

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.899 

actually<00:01:53.659> only<00:01:53.780> wisp<00:01:54.170> are<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> gameplay

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
actually only wisp are the gameplay

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.069 
actually only wisp are the gameplay
really<00:01:55.909> convinced<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.479> the<00:01:56.630> rain<00:01:56.810> clouds

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
really convinced that the rain clouds

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.690 
really convinced that the rain clouds
will<00:01:57.380> knock<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:57.950> out<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.189> bee<00:01:58.310> suit<00:01:58.549> if<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
will knock you out the bee suit if you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.660 
will knock you out the bee suit if you
step<00:01:59.000> on<00:01:59.149> there<00:01:59.329> because<00:02:00.250> well<00:02:01.250> they<00:02:01.399> made<00:02:01.579> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
step on there because well they made the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
step on there because well they made the
watterson<00:02:02.299> water<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.840> turns<00:02:03.020> off<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.380> bee

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
watterson water it turns off the bee

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.590 
watterson water it turns off the bee
suit<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:03.979> I'm<00:02:04.039> gonna<00:02:04.130> figure<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:05.420> not

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
suit so I'm gonna figure that you not

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.559 
suit so I'm gonna figure that you not
supposed<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.869> step<00:02:06.079> on<00:02:06.259> them<00:02:07.269> but<00:02:08.269> you<00:02:08.390> see<00:02:08.539> a

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
supposed to step on them but you see a

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.300 
supposed to step on them but you see a
point<00:02:08.810> here<00:02:09.019> where<00:02:11.590> there's<00:02:12.590> no<00:02:12.739> option<00:02:12.950> but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
point here where there's no option but

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.670 
point here where there's no option but
to<00:02:13.370> use<00:02:13.700> them<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.269> that's<00:02:15.230> when<00:02:15.379> I<00:02:15.440> finally

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
to use them so that's when I finally

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.470 
to use them so that's when I finally
figure<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.519> you're<00:02:16.670> supposed<00:02:16.879> to<00:02:17.000> step

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
figure out that you're supposed to step

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:24.220 
figure out that you're supposed to step
on<00:02:17.629> there<00:02:17.780> not<00:02:18.019> just<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.440> boring<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:23.360> right

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
on there not just a boring and right

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.089 
on there not just a boring and right
here<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:25.660> lot<00:02:26.660> cuz<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:26.989> see<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.829> way<00:02:27.950> that

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
here a lot cuz you see that the way that

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.550 
here a lot cuz you see that the way that
that<00:02:28.250> camera<00:02:28.610> angle<00:02:28.819> was<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.299> could<00:02:29.870> not<00:02:30.049> change

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
that camera angle was I could not change

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.500 
that camera angle was I could not change
the<00:02:30.920> camera<00:02:31.160> employer<00:02:31.730> that's<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.180> only<00:02:32.360> time

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the camera employer that's the only time

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.880 
the camera employer that's the only time
in<00:02:32.660> this<00:02:32.750> game<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.140> far<00:02:33.319> I've<00:02:33.470> had<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> body

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
in this game so far I've had a body

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.589 
in this game so far I've had a body
camera<00:02:34.099> angle<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.680> had<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.400> kind<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.209> H<00:02:38.390> my

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
camera angle but I had to kind of H my

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.110 
camera angle but I had to kind of H my
way<00:02:38.810> up<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.890> I<00:02:39.980> didn't<00:02:40.579> fall<00:02:40.730> off<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:41.000> cliff

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
way up so I didn't fall off the cliff

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.630 
way up so I didn't fall off the cliff
them<00:02:41.829> because<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:42.920> couldn't<00:02:43.160> see<00:02:43.310> where<00:02:43.549> I<00:02:43.579> was

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
going it took me like 30 seconds so I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:57.220

they're<00:03:18.590> almost<00:03:18.739> get<00:03:18.980> nailed<00:03:19.370> by<00:03:19.459> rain<00:03:19.790> cloud

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:23.469 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.709 

probably<00:03:24.469> just<00:03:24.650> flung<00:03:24.920> over<00:03:25.129> to<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.459> but

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:25.719 
probably just flung over to that but

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.030 
probably just flung over to that but
instead<00:03:26.719> of<00:03:26.870> trying<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.200> run<00:03:27.650> this<00:03:27.799> gauntlet

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
instead of trying to run this gauntlet

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:39.760 
instead of trying to run this gauntlet
of<00:03:28.340> rain<00:03:29.209> clouds<00:03:29.510> but

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.920 

these<00:03:40.770> leaves<00:03:41.220> up<00:03:41.640> on<00:03:41.819> the<00:03:41.910> molecular<00:03:42.120> choking

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
these leaves up on the molecular choking

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.110 
these leaves up on the molecular choking
here<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:45.180> silver<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.520> no<00:03:47.520> I<00:03:48.180> believe<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:50.120> don't

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
here in silver and no I believe I don't

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.720 
here in silver and no I believe I don't
think<00:03:51.270> I<00:03:51.420> do<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.080> right<00:03:52.260> here<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.770> here<00:03:53.580> in<00:03:53.670> a

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
think I do it right here but here in a

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.059 
think I do it right here but here in a
second<00:03:54.000> I'm<00:03:54.090> gonna<00:03:54.380> cut<00:03:55.380> out<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.530> lot<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.830> fridge

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
second I'm gonna cut out a lot of fridge

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.150 
second I'm gonna cut out a lot of fridge
but<00:03:56.459> we<00:03:56.640> own<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.910> tower<00:03:57.150> because<00:03:57.769> as<00:03:58.769> you<00:03:58.950> see

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
but we own this tower because as you see

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.710 
but we own this tower because as you see
I'm<00:03:59.280> Senor<00:03:59.670> goofing<00:04:00.000> around<00:04:00.209> turn<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> figure

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
I'm Senor goofing around turn the figure

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.100 
I'm Senor goofing around turn the figure
out<00:04:00.780> what's<00:04:00.959> going<00:04:01.140> on<00:04:02.599> you<00:04:03.599> obviously<00:04:03.900> can't

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
out what's going on you obviously can't

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.300 
out what's going on you obviously can't
fly<00:04:04.410> up<00:04:04.620> there<00:04:06.410> so<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.709> has<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.860> be<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.190> way

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
fly up there so it has to be the way

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.300 
fly up there so it has to be the way
around<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.670> other<00:04:08.730> side<00:04:12.680> at<00:04:13.680> first<00:04:13.860> I<00:04:14.040> think

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
around the other side at first I think

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.550 
around the other side at first I think
these<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.640> water<00:04:15.510> trails<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.989> can't<00:04:16.169> step<00:04:16.380> in

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
these a water trails you can't step in

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.879 
these a water trails you can't step in
them<00:04:16.680> because<00:04:17.419> well<00:04:18.470> I'm<00:04:19.470> really<00:04:19.650> paranoid

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
them because well I'm really paranoid

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.550 
them because well I'm really paranoid

about losing the bee suit but it turns
out<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.800> can't<00:04:23.040> step<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:25.760> we<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:26.790> don't<00:04:27.180> want

off me so I can see how you're supposed
to<00:06:00.660> beat<00:06:00.840> him<00:06:00.960> if<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.170> don't<00:06:01.290> match<00:06:01.500> you<00:06:01.650> keep

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
to beat him if you don't match you keep

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.399 
to beat him if you don't match you keep
the<00:06:01.950> bc<00:06:04.370> you<00:06:05.370> have<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.610> run<00:06:05.970> back<00:06:06.120> this<00:06:06.270> way

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409 
the bc you have to run back this way

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.219 
the bc you have to run back this way
and<00:06:08.589> hit<00:06:08.739> that<00:06:08.949> switch<00:06:09.249> and<00:06:09.729> it<00:06:10.689> will<00:06:11.110> make

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
and hit that switch and it will make

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.359 
and hit that switch and it will make
these<00:06:11.349> platforms<00:06:11.559> where<00:06:11.889> I<00:06:11.919> put<00:06:12.249> the

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:12.369 
these platforms where I put the

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:14.279 
these platforms where I put the
platform's<00:06:12.789> only<00:06:13.029> stay<00:06:13.209> up<00:06:13.360> for<00:06:13.989> a<00:06:14.019> short

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:14.289 
platform's only stay up for a short

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:15.780 
platform's only stay up for a short
while

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
while

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.660 
while
so<00:06:16.420> he<00:06:16.480> kind<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.780> hurry<00:06:16.990> about<00:06:17.200> it<00:06:17.470> and<00:06:18.280> in

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
so he kind of a hurry about it and in

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.520 
so he kind of a hurry about it and in
the<00:06:18.880> end<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.390> idea<00:06:19.630> for<00:06:19.870> and<00:06:20.170> I<00:06:20.230> don't<00:06:20.440> really

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
the end the idea for and I don't really

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:21.750 
the end the idea for and I don't really
care<00:06:20.770> about<00:06:20.890> get<00:06:21.100> hit<00:06:21.220> by<00:06:21.340> these<00:06:21.400> spikes

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
care about get hit by these spikes

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.290 
care about get hit by these spikes
because<00:06:22.150> he's<00:06:23.050> got<00:06:23.230> one<00:06:23.380> hit<00:06:23.500> left<00:06:23.740> yes<00:06:24.490> I

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
because he's got one hit left yes I

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.780 
because he's got one hit left yes I
would<00:06:25.540> you<00:06:25.680> we<00:06:26.680> just<00:06:26.830> jump<00:06:27.220> over<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:27.550> last

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
would you we just jump over the last

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:38.130 
would you we just jump over the last
time<00:06:30.540> his<00:06:31.540> camp<00:06:31.780> blows<00:06:31.990> up<00:06:36.300> finally<00:06:37.300> in<00:06:38.110> the

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140 
time his camp blows up finally in the

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.030 
time his camp blows up finally in the
last<00:06:38.700> normal<00:06:39.700> star<00:06:39.940> on<00:06:40.150> this<00:06:40.270> stage<00:06:40.510> and<00:06:41.350> I<00:06:41.740> cut

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
last normal star on this stage and I cut

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.550 
last normal star on this stage and I cut
out<00:06:42.240> about<00:06:43.240> 30<00:06:43.510> seconds<00:06:43.930> here<00:06:44.080> because<00:06:44.410> his

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
out about 30 seconds here because his

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.000 
out about 30 seconds here because his
platform<00:06:44.800> Smith<00:06:45.220> really<00:06:45.730> slowly<00:06:46.030> and<00:06:47.010> this

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
platform Smith really slowly and this

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.310 
platform Smith really slowly and this
wasn't<00:06:48.280> worthwhile<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.820> see<00:06:49.000> me<00:06:49.320> jumping

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
wasn't worthwhile to see me jumping

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.600 
wasn't worthwhile to see me jumping
around<00:06:50.410> like<00:06:50.590> an<00:06:50.770> idiot<00:06:50.830> wait<00:06:51.160> for<00:06:51.340> the<00:06:51.400> me<00:06:51.550> to

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
around like an idiot wait for the me to

00:06:51.610 --> 00:07:02.940 
around like an idiot wait for the me to
show<00:06:51.760> up<00:06:52.680> I<00:06:57.360> know<00:06:58.360> I'm<00:06:58.480> staight<00:06:58.870> there<00:07:00.600> but

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
show up I know I'm staight there but

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.240 
show up I know I'm staight there but
that's<00:07:03.280> the<00:07:03.370> third<00:07:03.550> star<00:07:03.760> from<00:07:03.910> gold<00:07:04.060> leaf
