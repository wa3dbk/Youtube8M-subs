00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.380
 4 minutes 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.150
 n Bo 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.230
 me 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.070
 The 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.070
 tee 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.450
 Well then 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:30.780
 Let's use the brakes to create a marker or a trigger for yes. 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:35.610
 Clog the you make in the brake to bend 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:39.700
 Even though it is said that the brakes are not used at the time of principle 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:44.710
 And also referred to as I somehow the province in particular and without focus 1-year-old 2 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.960
 But Ai rider everyone to make an opportunity to turn using the brake 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.570
 I am doing sharp cornering 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:57.010
 It is a brake that is essential to such rising, but in the first place what kind of principle is on the brake 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.010
 Will there is a nature 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920
 Well probably 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:10.190
 I think what just know is straight down but I think that the experience 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.659
 Reiko is a bit like Saru and a sound fly 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.110
 Mars 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 I Oh that 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 It 's a minute and a brake to touch a little straight 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 About say no 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.470
 I wonder I'm so Wacha about Tteyuu yo bad Oh something bad time of herbs 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.410
 It is understood 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:35.680
 So bike competed raw won and fork called caster angle is longer design 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:39.940
 When you apply the brake , you get the power to stand upright 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.510
 So if you apply the brake while in the bank the bike will get up 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:50.190
 I will try to stand upright 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:51.470
 It But Kotonan that because that would restoring force up really well Gyakuryo its it 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.740
 Double 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.740
 For example, while I know carver 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.010
 About it was not with the authority even though he had left the cheon come now Kan' 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.540
 Hey, the reaction is good, is n't it? 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:15.810
 Why is it really lightly going -because this play is over now a little really really 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:22.010
 I do n't think of a clutch, but I really have the power to cut off the clutch 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:27.330
 When I'll saw Innovation win motorcycle is that a force to be Kiyo the straight is Kakukara 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.100
 When I let go of the guy that happened with it, I get back to it again 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.380
 To return to the original 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.110
 In the corner 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.180
 Let's create a bending shape 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.250
 The there doing this so not 's in the curve 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:49.030
 I wonder if the bike will start to bend if I do it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.510
 At first you start getting up, and if you talk it you wake it up and it gets into that position 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.610
 right 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.220
 I see 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.630
 Let's summarize the nature of cold 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:06.390
 There is a property of the rich-operators like First, make a bike bad example machine 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:10.560
 So , by applying the bank tune brake, I will try to get up by fluffy 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.040
 But turn the system when you release one the bonus station 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.530
 If the power that was about to rise is released, how much again 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.830
 Do you going to start Am machine 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.830
 Well then , get on the Aike and practice right away 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.140
 When it's snowing, I see that it's smoother that the motorcycle will wake up 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:37.610
 Please turn left over there when you are left bent and cut the cherry blossoms with brake r and bike on 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.610
 Iinda If Re Janyame 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.790
 Hey hold the brake 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.610
 Place the more than I thought I I I your child like Hyahha 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.390
 Well that Well yeah because I felt it 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.390
 Reiko Main Hall 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:18.620
 When you let go 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.620
 I thought I was going to sleep, I just thought I was selling it 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:29.200
 If you apply the brakes while the bike is leaning, Niyuki 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:34.880
 When you release the geisha one stuffy 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:39.980
 Single to Oboekoma the body to practice the nature of the brake many times 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.280
 It has been well understood that Reiki can be used not only as a principle but also as a bending tool 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.330
 It seems 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:52.669
 If this sense is understood, the next step 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.669
 Next week I will explain how to make a turn in the brake release Look forward to 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.020
 No
