GMC we have another vehicle very similar
to<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.979> there<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.280> direct<00:02:02.550> competition

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.630 

the<00:02:07.630> doors<00:02:08.630> here<00:02:08.899> in<00:02:08.930> the<00:02:09.080> back<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.530> our<00:02:09.800> truck

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the doors here in the back of our truck

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.160 
the doors here in the back of our truck
like<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:12.440> can<00:02:12.590> see<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.040> large<00:02:14.170> area

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
like and you can see the large area

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.850 
like and you can see the large area
behind<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:16.060> backseat

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.420 

in<00:02:23.280> fact

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
in fact

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.369 
in fact
if<00:02:25.790> my<00:02:26.030> eyes<00:02:26.060> don't<00:02:26.569> deceive<00:02:26.689> me<00:02:27.049> I<00:02:27.079> think

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
if my eyes don't deceive me I think

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.970 
if my eyes don't deceive me I think
that's<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.709> third<00:02:27.950> row<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.579> seating<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:30.829> that's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
that's a third row of seating and that's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's a third row of seating and that's
indeed<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:32.329> this<00:02:32.569> has<00:02:32.780> three<00:02:33.140> rows<00:02:33.379> of<00:02:33.650> seating

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:52.270 

I<00:02:39.599> slipped<00:02:40.349> up<00:02:40.500> on<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.890> originally

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:07.760 

okay<00:02:52.880> there's<00:02:53.120> another<00:02:53.330> view<00:02:53.570> of<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.840> dash

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.000 

very<00:03:08.310> nice<00:03:08.580> truck
