00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.609 
the long strips because if you keep the
long<00:01:54.000> strips<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.420> they're<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
long strips on they're all it's going to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
long strips on they're all it's going to
do<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.219> keep<00:01:56.880> deflecting<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.570> water

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
do is just keep deflecting the water

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.170 
do is just keep deflecting the water
away<00:01:58.439> from<00:01:58.890> the<00:02:00.200> tire<00:02:01.200> itself<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.040> watch<00:02:02.969> out

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
away from the tire itself and watch out

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.370 
away from the tire itself and watch out
because<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> spray<00:02:03.899> back<00:02:04.079> into

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
because it's going to spray back into

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.819 
because it's going to spray back into
you<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.460> ah<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.960> get<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.229> started<00:02:07.680> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you so ah you just get it started and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.949 
you so ah you just get it started and
then<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> wd-40<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.629> don't<00:02:09.750> know<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
then with the wd-40 I don't know if I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.150 
then with the wd-40 I don't know if I
should<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.229> touching<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.739> bare<00:02:10.920> hands

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
should be touching it with bare hands

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.199 
should be touching it with bare hands
but<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.670> know

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
but you know

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.199 
but you know
I<00:02:12.239> ain't<00:02:12.629> gonna<00:02:12.750> die<00:02:12.930> ah<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:14.760> know<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:14.970> can

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I ain't gonna die ah you know you can

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.270 
I ain't gonna die ah you know you can
just<00:02:15.239> start<00:02:15.720> peeling<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.319> long<00:02:16.620> long<00:02:17.040> long

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
just start peeling it in long long long

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.149 
just start peeling it in long long long
strips<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.989> goes<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> lot<00:02:19.439> faster<00:02:19.709> than<00:02:20.040> if

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
strips and it goes a lot faster than if

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.470 
strips and it goes a lot faster than if
you<00:02:20.250> were<00:02:20.340> trying<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.610> use<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.909> power<00:02:21.030> washer

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
you were trying to use the power washer

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.140 
you were trying to use the power washer
at<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.720> point<00:02:22.049> ah<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.939> power

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
at that point ah because the power

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.550 
at that point ah because the power
washes<00:02:24.510> are<00:02:24.629> just<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:25.110> nothing<00:02:25.439> but

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
washes are just going to do nothing but

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.960 
washes are just going to do nothing but
break<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:25.890> all<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.549> have<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.760> keep

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
break it all up then you have to keep

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.270 
break it all up then you have to keep
you<00:02:27.239> know<00:02:27.269> trying<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.049> get<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> new<00:02:28.439> start<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:29.069> it

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
off the tire and I did move the car a

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.899 
off the tire and I did move the car a
little<00:03:09.569> bit<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.019> order<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.739> get<00:03:11.010> spots<00:03:11.370> you

little bit in order to get spots you

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.960 
little bit in order to get spots you
know<00:03:12.409> you<00:03:13.409> know<00:03:13.530> there<00:03:14.040> are<00:03:14.250> hard-to-reach

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
know you know there are hard-to-reach

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.430 
know you know there are hard-to-reach
with<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.420> power<00:03:15.599> washer<00:03:15.750> unless<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.230> really

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
with the power washer unless you really

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.589 
with the power washer unless you really
want<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.799> bend<00:03:16.949> down<00:03:17.209> but<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.359> know<00:03:18.449> it's

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
want to bend down but you know it's

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.270 
want to bend down but you know it's
easier<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.109> move<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.440> car<00:03:19.620> but

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
easier just to move the car but

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.119 
easier just to move the car but
basically<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.120> took<00:03:21.209> me<00:03:21.359> ten<00:03:21.540> minutes<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:23.010> do

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
basically it took me ten minutes to do

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.099 
basically it took me ten minutes to do
all<00:03:23.250> four<00:03:23.370> tires<00:03:23.699> probably<00:03:24.000> about<00:03:24.329> half<00:03:24.989> a

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
all four tires probably about half a

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.860 
all four tires probably about half a
bottle<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.730> wd-40<00:03:26.730> which<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.449> know<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.599> lot<00:03:27.690> of

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
bottle of wd-40 which I know a lot of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.390 
bottle of wd-40 which I know a lot of
