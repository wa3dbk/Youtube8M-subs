position those with average penises
identified<00:01:34.799> themselves<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.430> versatile<00:01:36.000> so

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
identified themselves as versatile so

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270 
identified themselves as versatile so
now<00:01:36.689> when<00:01:36.990> gay<00:01:37.200> guys<00:01:37.439> come<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.189> they

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
now when gay guys come in here and they

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
now when gay guys come in here and they
to<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.670> we're<00:01:38.850> versatile<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.930> can<00:01:40.110> figure<00:01:40.290> out

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
to say we're versatile we can figure out

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
to say we're versatile we can figure out
what<00:01:40.710> their<00:01:40.860> penis<00:01:41.250> sizes<00:01:41.490> can<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> imagine
