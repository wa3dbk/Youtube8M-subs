00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello I shoot another video of mine 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.740
 find this week's find 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.160
 was very much completely different from 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.660
 computer finds of printers yes here 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.070
 There are such Soviet calculators 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 electronics 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.380
 eco c 1/5 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.189
 here is his dirty condition 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 as it is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.640
 not washed yet just brought did not include not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.880
 I know it works or not, in principle, this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550
 rarity let's say such a calculator and 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.940
 I see this for the first time did not come across 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:46.910
 never calculator 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:51.899
 That's how it looks in such a state 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:01:07.530
 network light liters shown do not know for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:09.479
 what do you make this calculations but we will 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.820
 look see on the internet what is it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.939
 so let's figure it out 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.920
 another find is such a dream 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:26.250
 nineties youth audio player a little bit 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.009
 he has a cracked glass 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 one side of it was 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.110
 play stop and rewind in one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.460
 the side this just hit was the nineties 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.140
 every schoolboy dreamed of such a player and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.729
 whom did he appear at once schoolgirls 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.909
 becoming lovers of the company this 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.560
 the person did not turn it on I donâ€™t know it works 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.030
 whether or not my condition works in principle 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.189
 good glass to seal 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 You will need to try to turn it on under 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.689
 hand unfortunately no batteries so he 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.149
 show think make a video of him 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 turning on so another find was 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.450
 found such a transformer working 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.160
 already tested it 220 watts has 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 principle, a good transformer can 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.520
 make power supply for pro 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.500
 Orcs small such low-power equipment 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.290
 Good find is pleased with this find 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.230
 and here was found such a box with 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.530
 mobile phones like this 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.930
 the box looked like a photo roll and but in 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.050
 she had a bunch of nokia mobiles 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.780
 gsm standard also did not include not 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.239
 checked because only brought here 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.239
 so in my opinion nokia too 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.900
 cot 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 but it doesn't look like that either 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 a bunch of batteries another nokia 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.060
 apparently the owner was a fan Noky 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.060
 motorola 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.880
 noke cap 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.640
 my keyboard is also one ken 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.730
 silicone case parts 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.590
 so here is such a find, too, took on 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:18.900
 Parts come across many phones 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.030
 mobile and something may suit the way 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.019
 this one nokia was once very 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.190
 popular was considered a cool phone its 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:32.220
 put in the car in black and white 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.769
 a good phone was once another 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.810
 Nakhodochka is such a state 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.620
 with her 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:44.940
 let's say so bad someone cut off the plug 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.160
 but the cord did not turn on and I do not know 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.680
 will work or will not see what 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.109
 she has a backlash 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 In my problem will be with gear but 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.209
 so at the first inspection 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.040
 one drill I have already restored angel 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.400
 she was called I shot already about her 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.560
 video try to restore this drill and 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.980
 show how it works or not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.359
 still working on the course 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.290
 found such a watch 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:15.359
 I will say at once they included them 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.970
 the only problem is they 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.599
 fully work on this screen 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.490
 round here is a transparent screen 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.480
 time is displayed second temperature in 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.080
 indoors 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.420
 on this ray like this he projects on 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.940
 the ceiling either on white something on the wall 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.650
 can be projected 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.090
 Click here on this button on top 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:41.070
 and he projects you shows all the same 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.190
 the thing that is shown on this screen 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.280
 there is a temperature a second problem 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:54.560
 They were now open here. 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:05:00.720
 the cap was a battery problem 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.530
 more precisely now I will show not in batteries 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.130
 and he 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:09.920
 rotted contacts here these contacts are me 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.830
 already took from the baby toys you see 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:16.320
 1 spring is not enough for just rotted 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.370
 that is to me, I put these watches left 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.700
 battery and have to change it and watch 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:26.250
 there will be workers and another video about the clock 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.010
 which I did not show accounted for 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.540
 press here now we made the screen 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.030
 fully working hours fully 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.030
 restored all thanks to all bye
