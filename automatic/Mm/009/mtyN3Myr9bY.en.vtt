00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
okay so we're going to look at this age

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.550 
okay so we're going to look at this age
defense<00:00:04.529> Street<00:00:05.370> knife<00:00:06.120> thrust<00:00:06.509> okay<00:00:07.080> coming

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
defense Street knife thrust okay coming

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.039 
defense Street knife thrust okay coming
towards<00:00:07.980> us<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.639> going<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:09.049> anywhere

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:10.049 
towards us we're going to see anywhere

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.090 
towards us we're going to see anywhere
from<00:00:11.090> waist<00:00:12.090> high<00:00:12.389> up<00:00:12.600> towards<00:00:13.049> your<00:00:13.170> face<00:00:13.440> we

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
from waist high up towards your face we

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.010 
from waist high up towards your face we
can<00:00:14.280> reckon<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.670> confined<00:00:15.240> by<00:00:15.449> the<00:00:15.480> camera

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
can reckon it confined by the camera

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.109 
can reckon it confined by the camera
here<00:00:16.199> so<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.680> movement<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.610> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:17.910> cut

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
here so our movement is going to be cut

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.109 
here so our movement is going to be cut
somewhat<00:00:18.480> short<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.380> basically<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> attacker

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
somewhat short so basically the attacker

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
somewhat short so basically the attacker
is<00:00:21.630> coming<00:00:22.230> out<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.589> it's<00:00:22.740> going<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.919> be<00:00:23.039> going

stages you can play you can milk it get
a<00:04:57.910> lot<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.150> your<00:04:58.270> training<00:04:58.540> area<00:04:58.870> ok<00:04:59.320> I've<00:05:00.100> gone

a lot of your training area ok I've gone
this<00:05:01.150> way<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:02.020> can<00:05:02.230> also<00:05:02.410> go<00:05:02.770> this<00:05:02.980> way<00:05:03.190> okay

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
this way you can also go this way okay

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.970 
this way you can also go this way okay
you<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.390> go<00:05:04.660> watch<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.230> other<00:05:05.410> hand<00:05:05.770> again

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
you they're like oh this way is almost
