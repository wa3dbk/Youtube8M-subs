remember<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> way<00:01:13.350> Apple<00:01:13.560> works<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.189> you're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
remember the way Apple works this you're

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
remember the way Apple works this you're
gonna<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.820> using<00:01:15.030> half<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> resolution

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
gonna be using half of that resolution

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.590 
gonna be using half of that resolution
because<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.400> high<00:01:17.610> DPI<00:01:18.030> same<00:01:18.390> number

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
because you use the high DPI same number

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.149 
because you use the high DPI same number
of<00:01:18.630> pixels<00:01:18.780> per<00:01:19.080> inch<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.439> actually<00:01:19.950> makes

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
of pixels per inch that actually makes

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.880 
of pixels per inch that actually makes
it<00:01:20.340> look<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.939> little<00:01:21.030> crisper<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.500> battery

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890

OS 10 speaking of keys that's something

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.550 
OS 10 speaking of keys that's something
a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.570> people<00:01:33.720> have<00:01:34.049> complained<00:01:34.409> about

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
might take some getting used to because

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.600 
might take some getting used to because
it's<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.960> thin<00:01:37.259> apple's<00:01:37.920> redesign<00:01:38.430> its

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
it's so thin apple's redesign its

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.880 
it's so thin apple's redesign its
keyboard<00:01:39.119> you'll<00:01:39.479> notice<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.990> bigger<00:01:40.500> key

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
keyboard you'll notice the bigger key

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.639 
keyboard you'll notice the bigger key
caps<00:01:41.250> means<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.880> easier<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> find<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.720> key<00:01:42.930> but

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
caps means it's easier to find a key but

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.850 
caps means it's easier to find a key but
there<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:45.030> little<00:01:45.450> travel<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
there is very little travel on here and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.069 
there is very little travel on here and
that<00:01:46.920> means<00:01:47.909> you're<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.180> believe<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.020> or

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that means you're gonna believe it or

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
that means you're gonna believe it or
not<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.320> hitting<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.680> harder<00:01:50.130> than<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.610> think

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
not be hitting it harder than you think

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.969 
not be hitting it harder than you think
it's<00:01:51.030> also<00:01:51.180> harder<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:51.720> accurate<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.619> first

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's also harder to be accurate at first

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.160 
it's also harder to be accurate at first
you<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.280> used<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.360> i<00:01:54.600> would<00:01:54.990> recommend

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you get used to it but i would recommend

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.620 
you get used to it but i would recommend
trying<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.100> keyboard<00:01:56.670> before<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> buy

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trying the keyboard before you buy

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.719 
trying the keyboard before you buy
because<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.619> people<00:01:58.860> who<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:58.979> can't

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
because there are people who just can't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
because there are people who just can't
take<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.509> keyboard<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:01.140> happen<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

the one where even though it doesn't

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.550 
the one where even though it doesn't
move<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.420> feels<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> clicks<00:02:07.290> when<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
move it feels like it clicks when you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.529 
move it feels like it clicks when you
tap<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.429> also<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> press<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.479> hold

headphones and microphones are these two
little<00:02:37.920> bitty<00:02:38.310> ports<00:02:38.790> they're<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.110> all

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
little bitty ports they're the the all

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
the connectivity comes through this type

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.770 
the connectivity comes through this type
C<00:02:43.350> port<00:02:43.380> not<00:02:44.310> just<00:02:44.580> power<00:02:44.880> for<00:02:45.270> charging<00:02:45.660> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
C port not just power for charging and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.449 
C port not just power for charging and
by<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> way<00:02:46.050> if<00:02:46.530> it's<00:02:46.739> fully<00:02:46.950> charged<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.430> can

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
by the way if it's fully charged you can

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.760 
by the way if it's fully charged you can
connect<00:02:48.390> your<00:02:48.510> phone<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.320> iPhone<00:02:49.650> and

charge it right back if you have the
right<00:02:51.390> cable<00:02:51.810> also<00:02:52.290> video<00:02:52.769> comes<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.220> of

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
right cable also video comes out of

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.660 
right cable also video comes out of
there<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.700> USB<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.870> Apple<00:02:55.290> sells<00:02:55.560> an<00:02:55.830> $80

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.440 
type C connector a single connector
means<00:05:50.500> this<00:05:50.890> is<00:05:51.130> not<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.580> choice<00:05:51.790> for<00:05:52.060> a<00:05:52.090> pro

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
means this is not the choice for a pro

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.930 
means this is not the choice for a pro
on<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.530> other<00:05:53.680> hand<00:05:53.980> this<00:05:54.310> is<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.640> first

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
on the other hand this is the first

Apple laptop connector not to be
proprietary<00:05:58.150> and<00:05:58.420> that's<00:05:58.660> huge<00:05:59.170> I<00:05:59.410> expect<00:06:00.130> to

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
proprietary and that's huge I expect to

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.340 
proprietary and that's huge I expect to
see<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.400> wide<00:06:00.820> range<00:06:01.240> of<00:06:01.360> type-c<00:06:01.840> connectors

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
see a wide range of type-c connectors

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.020 
see a wide range of type-c connectors
and<00:06:02.500> that<00:06:03.040> will<00:06:03.190> bring<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.460> cost<00:06:03.700> of

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
and that will bring the cost of

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.870 
and that will bring the cost of
additional<00:06:04.450> adapters<00:06:05.200> down<00:06:05.410> quite<00:06:05.800> a<00:06:05.830> bit<00:06:05.950> the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
additional adapters down quite a bit the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.110 
additional adapters down quite a bit the
other<00:06:06.910> con<00:06:07.330> is<00:06:07.930> the<00:06:08.170> really<00:06:08.590> terrible<00:06:09.370> front

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
other con is the really terrible front

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.350 
other con is the really terrible front
facing<00:06:10.620> camera<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:11.860> I<00:06:12.430> gotta<00:06:12.610> admit<00:06:12.700> the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
facing camera and I gotta admit the

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.290 
facing camera and I gotta admit the
price<00:06:13.720> it<00:06:14.080> is<00:06:14.280> very<00:06:15.280> expensive<00:06:15.850> this<00:06:15.940> is<00:06:16.090> kind

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300
