to the outer corner and I'm using black
but<00:03:35.890> very<00:03:36.070> stiff<00:03:36.400> sparingly<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.060> want<00:03:37.270> to

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
but very stiff sparingly you want to

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330 
but very stiff sparingly you want to
make<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.600> too<00:03:37.810> obvious<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.440> you<00:03:38.890> just<00:03:39.160> got<00:03:39.280> to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
make it too obvious so you just got to

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.770 
make it too obvious so you just got to
look<00:03:39.520> like<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:39.970> now<00:03:40.090> it's<00:03:40.210> got<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.360> bit<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.570> depth

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
look like so now it's got a bit of depth

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.990 
look like so now it's got a bit of depth
