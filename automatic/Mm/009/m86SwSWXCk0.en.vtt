00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.180
 we were therefore able to build the complex 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.340
 in the supporting structure with the foundations all the torments all 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.539
 mounting all the joists 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.199
 going to verify the correctness of the geometry that match logic 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.640
 structural by 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 animation window that performs its task 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.009
 d be a current weight control window because we can see 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.640
 much better on 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.989
 this window 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.210
 the coherence is of all the nodes of the whole system 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.040
 all the objects we made were made not only with one 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.229
 parameters of representation that I see I have decided but 

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.679
 we have attributed each of these elements 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.670
 a description and relative 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.120
 at work 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.630
 among the attributes 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.960
 a type of calculation and a material that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
 mm stands for quality with use 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.530
 this information is not immediately useful when laying 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.790
 I come back extremely useful at a later stage 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.360
 but product control phase is worth allowing us to extract all the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.970
 amount used 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.740
 essential data of course in any project 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.740
 photos are only price ratio 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.840
 adam made these prescriptions not only on the elenia minds but also on 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.830
 foundation elements 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.580
 at this point we can recall a series of specific example lists for 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.630
 wood 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.630
 which make it possible to propose a list 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 is a detailed description of all the quantities used in this case de 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.390
 shown but list that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.320
 to write then the sleepers for fields 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.530
 and joists 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.220
 distinct for folded sections 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.330
 200 for 40 mm the lengths number of pieces used of the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.280
 linear mt length 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.490
 and the cubic meters of wood 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.750
 thus obtaining a table of this kind that allows us to 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.269
 to know that until now we have used sleepers 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.689
 and joists 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.370
 just over 14 cubic meters of wood for the entire structure 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.869
 recall of specific lists for 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.869
 concrete and reinforced concrete 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.829
 since we had distinguished between the continuous foundations the audience of 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:32.849
 foundation 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.969
 we have table of this kind 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.969
 where we distinguished from the continuous foundation 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.009
 depending on the section used with 20 20 of internal functions 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:52.229
 1 single piece that was the dirt network element we reported goes 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.789
 people thick but 40 always that height 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 + all the bohr foundations 33 40 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.969
 also in this case we have 18 cubic meters 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.769
 Total 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.769
 and the cubic meters of the audience too 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.699
 in the first case we have extracted a list for the type of elements 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.949
 in that case we have chopped sleepers and priests therefore making them 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.159
 a form leader 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.229
 specific reality but that brings with it a series of ste in the second case 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:27.549
 we have structuralist 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.669
 by type of work 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.179
 taken we can extract a list with the column overview that is in the 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.639
 our simulation 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.859
 they take the place of the uprights 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.769
 also in this case we can extract a list of computation then 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:46.869
 solar type of complaint we used 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:51.819
 to have a detail d all the elements that are described 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.309
 as well as us 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.849
 we have identified them in the creation phase, they are all uprights 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 distinct in this case earth number of pieces 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.679
 finally the quantities 

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:08.349
 this type of table also leads us to make order considerations 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.989
 practical not to be a project for which 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.929
 it will be much easier to get 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:17.079
 of the tall pillars 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.209
 one meter rather than one meter, 0 44 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.089
 and the form of design control that clearly goes beyond coherence 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.199
 of the model can push us 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.319
 to render defects in all dimensions of the elements 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.710
 to facilitate 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.180
 therefore it is not at the time of construction of the construction site 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.129
 in the project 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.409
 we therefore have 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.539
 eleven cubic meters sexo martini 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.680
 in the previous 14 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.689
 tell us that so far from intel atom 25 cubic meters 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:52.339
 wooden
