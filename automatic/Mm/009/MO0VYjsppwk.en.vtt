right<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.480> I'm<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> talk<00:00:34.110> about

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
right here I'm just going to talk about

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.590 
right here I'm just going to talk about
it<00:00:34.590> let's<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.550> 40<00:00:35.880> minutes<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.360> an

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
it let's take about 40 minutes to an

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.139 
it let's take about 40 minutes to an
hour<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.960> build<00:00:37.309> pretty<00:00:38.309> much<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.670> centralized

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
hour to build pretty much I centralized

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.060 
hour to build pretty much I centralized
the<00:00:39.329> base<00:00:39.510> put<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> Town<00:00:40.469> Hall<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.800> center

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
the base put the Town Hall in the center

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.930 
the base put the Town Hall in the center
so<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.610> should<00:00:41.790> be<00:00:41.820> no<00:00:41.969> easy<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.670> one

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so there should be no easy you know one

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.470 
so there should be no easy you know one
star<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.600> your<00:00:46.500> base<00:00:47.090> then<00:00:48.090> there's<00:00:48.300> three

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
star on your base then there's three

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.540 
star on your base then there's three
mortars<00:00:48.870> covering<00:00:49.379> almost<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.010> entire<00:00:50.280> base

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
mortars covering almost the entire base

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.610 
mortars covering almost the entire base
or<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.030> almost<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.570> pretty<00:00:51.840> much<00:00:52.010> other<00:00:53.010> than

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
or not almost but pretty much other than

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.860 
or not almost but pretty much other than
these<00:00:55.620> buildings<00:00:56.070> outside<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> might

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
these buildings outside now you might

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540 
these buildings outside now you might
ask<00:00:57.899> why<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.680> put<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.160> far<00:00:59.370> away

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
ask why is it up put them so far away

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.080 
ask why is it up put them so far away
