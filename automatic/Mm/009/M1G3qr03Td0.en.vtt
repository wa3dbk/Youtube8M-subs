basically redesigned the website so yeah

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
basically redesigned the website so yeah
without<00:00:17.310> further<00:00:17.550> ado<00:00:17.730> let's<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:20.390> okay

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
without further ado let's get to it okay

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.300 
without further ado let's get to it okay
so<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.840> thought<00:00:22.140> I'd<00:00:22.320> start<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> artwork

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
so I thought I'd start with the artwork

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.640 
so I thought I'd start with the artwork
first<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.420> know<00:00:24.570> we've<00:00:24.900> seen<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> image

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
first and I know we've seen this image

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.009 
first and I know we've seen this image

many times now of craven holding a
crossbow<00:00:28.560> but<00:00:29.189> i<00:00:29.220> thought<00:00:29.429> i<00:00:29.490> would<00:00:29.580> throw<00:00:29.699> it

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.049 
crossbow but i thought i would throw it
in<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.230> anyway<00:00:31.230> because<00:00:31.439> well<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.730> part

just<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> wait<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:50.870> next<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.140> get

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just have to wait and see next up we get

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.069 
just have to wait and see next up we get
this<00:00:52.469> awesome<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:54.239> how<00:00:54.570> spider-man

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
this awesome look at well how spider-man

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
this awesome look at well how spider-man
will<00:00:55.260> look<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> game<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> honestly<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
will look in the game and honestly I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
will look in the game and honestly I
think<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.660> could<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.140> next<00:00:58.320> gen<00:00:59.960> model

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
think this could be the next gen model

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
think this could be the next gen model
of<00:01:01.230> peak<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> spider-man<00:01:01.949> because<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.090> much

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
of peak of spider-man because it's much

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.929 
of peak of spider-man because it's much
darker<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.680> looks<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.189> more<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
darker and it looks a lot more like the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.570 
darker and it looks a lot more like the
well<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> trailer<00:01:07.580> besides

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
well what we see in the trailer besides

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.500 
well what we see in the trailer besides
the<00:01:08.760> screenshots<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.200> think<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:12.030> could<00:01:12.360> be

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the screenshots so I think it could be

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230 
the screenshots so I think it could be
either<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.470> had<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.520> theory<00:01:14.850> where

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
either that or I had this theory where

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.020 
either that or I had this theory where
the<00:01:15.960> hero<00:01:16.170> are<00:01:16.439> menaced<00:01:16.770> system<00:01:17.159> perhaps<00:01:17.430> um

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the hero are menaced system perhaps um

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
the hero are menaced system perhaps um
if<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:19.580> you<00:01:20.580> know<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.790> don't<00:01:21.060> do<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.360> much

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
if you you know you don't do as much

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
if you you know you don't do as much
crime<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.140> suit<00:01:22.320> starts<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.890> darker<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
crime your suit starts to get darker and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
crime your suit starts to get darker and
if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> lot<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> crime<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.530> becomes

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
if you do a lot of crime it becomes

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
if you do a lot of crime it becomes
brighter<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:26.850> vibrant<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.840> because

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
brighter and more vibrant and because

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
brighter and more vibrant and because
you're<00:01:28.619> doing<00:01:28.890> nicer<00:01:29.159> things<00:01:29.490> rather<00:01:29.970> than

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you're doing nicer things rather than

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.719 
you're doing nicer things rather than
ignoring<00:01:30.829> your<00:01:31.829> responsibilities<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

time<00:01:57.329> around<00:01:57.630> every<00:01:58.200> suit<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> game<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
time around every suit in the game is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
time around every suit in the game is
going<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.790> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> damaged

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
going to be is going to have a damaged

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.990 
going to be is going to have a damaged
system<00:02:01.259> that's<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.009> nice<00:02:02.280> so

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
system that's so that's really nice so

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.240 
system that's so that's really nice so
yeah<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.299> see<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.630> baseball<00:02:04.200> bat<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.070> guy

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
yeah we see a baseball bat the guy

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.770 
yeah we see a baseball bat the guy
swinging<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.820> baseball<00:02:05.909> bat<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.540> see

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
swinging a baseball bat and we also see

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.109 
swinging a baseball bat and we also see
what<00:02:07.740> appears<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.280> be<00:02:08.310> maybe<00:02:08.610> an<00:02:08.759> assault

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
what appears to be maybe an assault

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.280 
what appears to be maybe an assault
rifle<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> ground<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.770> perhaps

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
rifle on the ground so perhaps

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.979 
rifle on the ground so perhaps
either<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:14.090> logical<00:02:14.540> thing<00:02:14.599> would<00:02:14.780> be

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
either the logical thing would be

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.660 
either the logical thing would be
probably<00:02:15.260> spider-man<00:02:15.980> has<00:02:16.159> just<00:02:16.370> defeated

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
probably spider-man has just defeated

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.330 
probably spider-man has just defeated
someone<00:02:17.060> who<00:02:17.239> had<00:02:17.420> assault<00:02:17.870> rifle<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.469> maybe

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
someone who had assault rifle or maybe

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.179 
someone who had assault rifle or maybe
enemies<00:02:20.329> can<00:02:20.569> pick<00:02:20.780> up<00:02:20.930> multiple<00:02:21.319> weapons<00:02:21.500> so

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
enemies can pick up multiple weapons so

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.920 
enemies can pick up multiple weapons so
if<00:02:22.579> they<00:02:22.879> drop<00:02:23.090> their<00:02:23.239> baseball<00:02:23.420> bat<00:02:23.780> they

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
if they drop their baseball bat they

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.420 
if they drop their baseball bat they
might<00:02:24.109> run<00:02:24.319> over<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.739> pick<00:02:24.769> up<00:02:25.010> an<00:02:25.129> assault

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
might run over and pick up an assault

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.729 
might run over and pick up an assault
rifle<00:02:25.569> similar<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.719> how<00:02:26.900> i<00:02:27.170> think<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:27.680> in

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
rifle similar to how i think it was in

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.220 
rifle similar to how i think it was in
Arkham<00:02:28.099> City<00:02:28.390> Batman<00:02:29.390> Arkham<00:02:29.689> City<00:02:29.959> they

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
Arkham City Batman Arkham City they

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.819 
Arkham City Batman Arkham City they
would<00:02:30.349> run<00:02:30.590> over<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> crate<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.640> pick<00:02:31.849> up

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
would run over to a crate and pick up

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.050 
would run over to a crate and pick up
pick<00:02:33.829> up<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.099> nearest<00:02:34.280> weapon<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.909> shoot

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
pick up the nearest weapon to shoot

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.940 
pick up the nearest weapon to shoot
Batman<00:02:35.269> with<00:02:35.689> so<00:02:36.109> maybe<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.500> going<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:36.859> be

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
Batman with so maybe it's going to be

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.849 
Batman with so maybe it's going to be
similar<00:02:37.129> like<00:02:37.459> that<00:02:37.900> next<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.200> probably<00:02:39.680> my

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
of the city which looks much bigger than

of the city which looks much bigger than
the<00:03:32.479> previous<00:03:32.840> game<00:03:32.959> I<00:03:33.109> have<00:03:33.199> to<00:03:33.349> say<00:03:33.530> even

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.979 
the previous game I have to say even
just<00:03:34.159> by<00:03:34.340> this<00:03:34.549> image<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:35.030> a<00:03:35.599> lot<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.780> the

just by this image and a lot of the

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.809 
just by this image and a lot of the
buildings<00:03:36.169> look<00:03:36.500> very<00:03:36.889> different<00:03:37.129> compared

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
buildings look very different compared

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.759 
buildings look very different compared
to<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.629> amazing<00:03:38.900> spider-man<00:03:39.169> 1<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.500> mean

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659

where<00:05:26.389> the<00:05:26.479> health<00:05:26.659> bar<00:05:26.810> is<00:05:27.020> that's

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
where the health bar is that's

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.890 
where the health bar is that's
interesting<00:05:28.029> it<00:05:29.029> seems<00:05:29.330> like<00:05:29.509> there's<00:05:29.779> now

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
interesting it seems like there's now

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.159 
interesting it seems like there's now
kind<00:05:30.289> of<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.710> timer<00:05:31.129> for<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.819> car<00:05:32.629> to<00:05:32.659> escape

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
kind of a timer for the car to escape

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.740 
kind of a timer for the car to escape
because<00:05:33.319> it<00:05:33.500> says<00:05:33.680> distance<00:05:34.279> until<00:05:34.610> escape<00:05:35.330> so

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
because it says distance until escape so

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.649 
because it says distance until escape so
maybe<00:05:36.590> when<00:05:36.889> you're<00:05:37.039> not<00:05:37.310> on<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.699> car<00:05:37.909> it<00:05:38.210> will

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
maybe when you're not on the car it will

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.600 
maybe when you're not on the car it will
go<00:05:38.870> down<00:05:39.139> meaning<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.039> have<00:05:40.190> to<00:05:40.310> speed

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
go down meaning that you have to speed

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.769 
go down meaning that you have to speed
up<00:05:40.789> and<00:05:40.969> try<00:05:41.180> you<00:05:41.419> know<00:05:41.509> stop<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.199> vehicle<00:05:42.349> but

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:43.779 
up and try you know stop the vehicle but

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:47.829 
up and try you know stop the vehicle but
that's<00:05:44.779> all<00:05:45.289> really<00:05:45.860> to<00:05:46.490> say<00:05:46.699> about<00:05:46.849> this<00:05:47.150> this

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:47.839 
that's all really to say about this this

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.510 
that's all really to say about this this
video<00:05:48.139> I<00:05:48.169> mean<00:05:48.349> it<00:05:48.469> doesn't<00:05:48.740> really<00:05:48.979> show<00:05:49.250> much

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
video I mean it doesn't really show much

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.420 
video I mean it doesn't really show much
apart<00:05:49.969> from<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.360> car<00:05:50.539> chase<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:52.039> graphics

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
apart from the car chase the graphics

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.980 
apart from the car chase the graphics
look<00:05:52.550> nice<00:05:52.759> even<00:05:53.089> though<00:05:53.389> it's<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.750> video

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
look nice even though it's the video

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.680 
look nice even though it's the video
isn't<00:05:54.560> taken<00:05:54.979> in<00:05:55.099> the<00:05:55.129> best<00:05:55.339> quality<00:05:55.690> still
