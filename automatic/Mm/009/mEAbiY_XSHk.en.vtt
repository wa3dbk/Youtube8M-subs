00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
almost any size fly and apply a lot of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
almost any size fly and apply a lot of
pressure<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.530> really<00:00:38.430> crank<00:00:38.760> down<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
pressure to really crank down on the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.280 
pressure to really crank down on the
materials<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.110> it's<00:00:40.500> nice<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> small<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.290> we

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
materials and it's nice and small so we

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.010 
materials and it's nice and small so we
won't<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.620> lot<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> buildup<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.840> got<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
won't have a lot of buildup so we got a

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
won't have a lot of buildup so we got a
nice<00:00:46.200> thread<00:00:46.610> base<00:00:47.610> later<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.120> will<00:00:48.270> cut

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
nice thread base later there will cut

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.979 
nice thread base later there will cut
off<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.809> excess<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> here's<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> material

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
off that excess so here's the material

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.580 
off that excess so here's the material
that<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.410> mentioned<00:00:52.620> earlier<00:00:54.410> it's<00:00:55.410> called

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

that I mentioned earlier it's called
micro<00:00:55.980> straggle<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.940> very<00:00:57.149> very<00:00:57.390> fine

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
micro straggle it's a very very fine

micro straggle it's a very very fine
chenille<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> lot<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> sparkle<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
chenille has a lot of sparkle to it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.380 
chenille has a lot of sparkle to it
gives<00:01:02.160> us<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> ability<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.969> tie<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> lot

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gives us the ability to tie a lot

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.240 
gives us the ability to tie a lot
smaller<00:01:03.719> flies<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.500> were<00:01:04.619> used<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.010> with

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
smaller flies and we were used to with

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.350 
smaller flies and we were used to with
the<00:01:05.430> regular<00:01:06.030> chenille<00:01:08.030> I'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> move

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the regular chenille I'm going to move

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
the regular chenille I'm going to move
the<00:01:09.510> thread<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:12.380> just<00:01:13.380> tie<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.100> behind

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the thread back just tie that in behind

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.350 
the thread back just tie that in behind
the<00:01:14.790> eye<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.280> makes<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.880> secure

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the eye this just makes it more secure

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.649 
the eye this just makes it more secure
and<00:01:18.770> bulks<00:01:19.770> up<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> body<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.430> slightly<00:01:20.850> now

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and bulks up the body just slightly now

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.300 
and bulks up the body just slightly now
you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.869> certainly<00:01:22.080> tie<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.470> add<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.100> lead

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you can certainly tie this add some lead

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.429 
you can certainly tie this add some lead
to<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> hook<00:01:23.850> or<00:01:24.090> even<00:01:24.360> even<00:01:24.900> tie<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.110> with<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to the hook or even even tie this with a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.450 
to the hook or even even tie this with a
bead<00:01:25.710> head<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.250> would<00:01:26.369> be<00:01:26.460> fine<00:01:28.460> now

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
bead head and that would be fine now

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.800 
bead head and that would be fine now
simply<00:01:29.850> all<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> do<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
simply all you have to do with this

simply all you have to do with this
micro<00:01:31.560> straggle<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:33.020> wrap<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.229> forward<00:01:36.290> just

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
micro straggle is wrap it forward just

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.289 
micro straggle is wrap it forward just
but<00:01:37.619> each<00:01:37.829> turn<00:01:38.130> up<00:01:38.340> against<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> previous

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
but each turn up against the previous

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.550 
but each turn up against the previous
one<00:01:40.400> so<00:01:41.400> create<00:01:41.700> some<00:01:41.880> nice<00:01:42.090> flash<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.960> yet<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
one so create some nice flash and yet it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
one so create some nice flash and yet it
keeps<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> body<00:01:44.070> nice<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> slender<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.780> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
keeps the body nice and slender and I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.889 
keeps the body nice and slender and I
like<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> traditional<00:01:46.710> soft<00:01:47.369> hackle<00:01:47.790> pattern

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.410 

comes<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> whole<00:01:52.259> bunch<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.619> colors<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.270> is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
comes in a whole bunch of colors this is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.020 
comes in a whole bunch of colors this is
just<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.810> standard<00:01:55.170> yellow<00:01:55.530> color<00:01:55.909> I'm<00:01:56.909> going

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
just a standard yellow color I'm going

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
just a standard yellow color I'm going
to<00:01:57.090> leave<00:01:57.240> myself<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.659> pretty<00:01:57.899> good<00:01:58.049> gap<00:01:58.259> there

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to leave myself a pretty good gap there

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.569 
to leave myself a pretty good gap there
behind<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.100> eye<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> we're<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.340> going<00:02:02.549> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
behind the eye and we're just going to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.380 
behind the eye and we're just going to
secure<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.479> some<00:02:03.659> thread<00:02:03.899> wraps<00:02:05.390> cut

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
secure that with some thread wraps cut

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.460 
secure that with some thread wraps cut
off<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.750> excess<00:02:07.170> material

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.060 

now<00:02:09.950> we<00:02:10.009> want<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.340> create<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.640> slight<00:02:11.480> little

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
now we want to create a slight little

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.800 
now we want to create a slight little
bump<00:02:13.070> right<00:02:13.280> here<00:02:13.340> some<00:02:13.850> dubbing<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.420> that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
bump right here some dubbing and that

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.350 
bump right here some dubbing and that
will<00:02:14.930> help<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.610> give<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.790> feather<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.240> we're

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
will help to give the feather that we're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.910 
will help to give the feather that we're
going<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.510> tie<00:02:17.810> in<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> little<00:02:18.080> bit<00:02:18.380> later<00:02:18.590> some

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
going to tie in a little bit later some

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.340 
going to tie in a little bit later some
stability<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.810> I'm<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:20.990> going<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.200> use<00:02:21.320> a

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
stability so I'm just going to use a

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.040 
stability so I'm just going to use a
piece<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.680> dubbing<00:02:22.460> brush<00:02:22.720> it's<00:02:23.720> just<00:02:23.900> an

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
piece of dubbing brush it's just an

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.680 
piece of dubbing brush it's just an
olive<00:02:24.410> dubbing<00:02:24.710> brush<00:02:24.920> here<00:02:25.160> we've<00:02:25.340> got<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
olive dubbing brush here we've got this

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.750 
olive dubbing brush here we've got this
is<00:02:26.930> basically<00:02:27.410> has<00:02:27.650> all<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> dubbing<00:02:28.430> trapped

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
is basically has all the dubbing trapped

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.780 
is basically has all the dubbing trapped
between<00:02:29.000> some<00:02:29.960> thread<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:31.580> real

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
between some thread so it's just real

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
between some thread so it's just real
fast<00:02:32.090> real<00:02:32.270> easy<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.780> use<00:02:34.270> all<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.660> do

fast real easy to use all I have to do

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.050 
fast real easy to use all I have to do
is<00:02:35.960> simply<00:02:36.350> catch<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.840> exposed<00:02:38.840> thread

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
is simply catch that exposed thread

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.560 
is simply catch that exposed thread

section of the brush secure that down

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.330 
section of the brush secure that down
now<00:02:44.570> I'll<00:02:44.720> just<00:02:44.930> take<00:02:45.170> oh<00:02:46.060> maybe<00:02:48.310> three<00:02:49.310> or

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
now I'll just take oh maybe three or

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.440 
now I'll just take oh maybe three or
four<00:02:50.260> wraps<00:02:51.580> kind<00:02:52.580> of<00:02:52.700> almost<00:02:52.820> right<00:02:53.120> on<00:02:53.150> top

of<00:02:53.480> each<00:02:53.750> other<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.320> create<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.709> little

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
of each other just to create that little

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.420

sound<00:02:55.940> a<00:02:55.970> little<00:02:56.060> ball<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.690> dubbing<00:02:57.430> you're

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
sound a little ball of dubbing you're

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.800 
sound a little ball of dubbing you're
just<00:02:58.670> using<00:02:58.850> regular<00:02:59.000> double<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.660> could

just using regular double you could

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.360 
just using regular double you could
probably<00:02:59.990> just<00:03:00.230> spin<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.709> right<00:03:00.920> onto<00:03:01.220> your

probably just spin that right onto your

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.990 
probably just spin that right onto your
thread<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.880> create<00:03:02.840> that<00:03:02.990> same<00:03:03.290> little<00:03:04.000> same

strip away some of these webby fibers on
the<00:03:22.310> bottom<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.670> we<00:03:22.850> don't<00:03:23.030> need<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:26.030> then

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
the bottom that we don't need and then

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.270 
the bottom that we don't need and then
we're<00:03:26.330> going<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.500> hold<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:27.680> feather<00:03:27.980> by<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
we're going to hold this feather by the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.310 
we're going to hold this feather by the
point<00:03:29.680> much<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.830> we<00:03:30.950> can<00:03:31.160> here<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:32.050> strip<00:03:33.050> back

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
point much as we can here and strip back

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.540 
point much as we can here and strip back
all<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.890> other<00:03:34.040> fibers<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:37.190> way<00:03:37.400> you've

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
all the other fibers that way you've

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.199 
all the other fibers that way you've
created<00:03:37.820> this<00:03:38.120> nice<00:03:38.390> little<00:03:39.459> tie<00:03:40.459> in<00:03:40.730> section

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
created this nice little tie in section

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.949 
created this nice little tie in section
you<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.540> see<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.510> we're<00:03:44.630> just<00:03:44.660> going<00:03:44.870> to

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
you can see that so we're just going to

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.640 
you can see that so we're just going to
lay<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:47.239> little<00:03:47.540> space<00:03:47.900> we<00:03:48.170> made<00:03:48.380> right

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
lay that that little space we made right

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.970 
lay that that little space we made right
up<00:03:48.769> there<00:03:48.950> behind<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.370> eye<00:03:50.440> trap<00:03:51.440> that<00:03:51.739> nice

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
up there behind the eye trap that nice

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.780 
up there behind the eye trap that nice
and<00:03:52.340> easily<00:03:52.630> then<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.750> can<00:03:53.900> apply<00:03:54.140> some<00:03:54.790> some

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and easily then you can apply some some

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.840 
and easily then you can apply some some
more<00:03:55.970> attention<00:03:56.420> to<00:03:56.450> lock<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.580> then<00:03:58.580> all<00:03:58.730> we

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
more attention to lock it in then all we

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.780 
more attention to lock it in then all we
have<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.209> is<00:03:59.360> come<00:03:59.810> in<00:03:59.840> here<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.790> grip

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
have to do is come in here and grip

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.610 
have to do is come in here and grip
these<00:04:02.000> little<00:04:02.239> tip<00:04:02.480> fibers<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.140> trim<00:04:03.470> these

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
these little tip fibers and trim these

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.380 
these little tip fibers and trim these
away<00:04:05.860> another<00:04:06.860> good<00:04:07.130> little<00:04:07.910> trick<00:04:08.120> here<00:04:08.180> is

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
away another good little trick here is

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.740 
away another good little trick here is
to<00:04:08.480> kind<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:09.190> stroke<00:04:10.190> these<00:04:10.400> fibers<00:04:10.940> back<00:04:11.209> they

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
to kind of stroke these fibers back they

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.110 
to kind of stroke these fibers back they
have<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:11.930> natural<00:04:12.470> curve<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.610> we<00:04:13.700> want<00:04:13.940> these

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
have a natural curve and we want these

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.020 
have a natural curve and we want these
two<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.660> curve<00:04:15.380> back<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.100> finished<00:04:16.430> fly<00:04:16.700> so

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
two to curve back on the finished fly so

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.430 
two to curve back on the finished fly so
I<00:04:17.090> just<00:04:17.239> kind<00:04:17.450> of<00:04:17.510> pinch<00:04:17.780> them<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.109> hold<00:04:18.289> it

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
I just kind of pinch them and hold it

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.029 
I just kind of pinch them and hold it
there<00:04:19.450> now<00:04:20.450> what<00:04:20.599> you<00:04:20.690> can<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:20.959> too<00:04:21.169> is<00:04:21.200> some

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
there now what you can do too is some

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.260 
there now what you can do too is some
people<00:04:22.190> strip<00:04:22.550> off<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:22.970> five

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
people strip off the five

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.820 
people strip off the five
vers<00:04:23.389> on<00:04:23.509> one<00:04:23.720> side<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.229> feather<00:04:24.440> just

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
vers on one side of the feather just

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.330 
vers on one side of the feather just
just<00:04:25.520> depends<00:04:25.879> on<00:04:25.940> how<00:04:26.030> much<00:04:26.210> you<00:04:26.360> want<00:04:27.340> does

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
just depends on how much you want does

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.070 
just depends on how much you want does
it<00:04:28.460> really<00:04:28.580> matter<00:04:28.849> I<00:04:29.240> usually<00:04:29.599> just<00:04:29.780> leave

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080
