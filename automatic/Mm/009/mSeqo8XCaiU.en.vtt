really<00:00:13.139> short<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> key

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
really short so you really get a key

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.060 
really short so you really get a key
understanding<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.020> main<00:00:16.170> point<00:00:16.529> even<00:00:16.859> put

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
understanding of the main point even put

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.189 
understanding of the main point even put
them<00:00:17.160> into<00:00:17.310> action<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.820> get<00:00:18.000> great<00:00:18.210> results<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
them into action to get great results so

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.550 
them into action to get great results so
the<00:00:19.289> question<00:00:19.439> here<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> how<00:00:20.930> quickly<00:00:21.930> can<00:00:22.500> you

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
the question here is how quickly can you

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.679 
the question here is how quickly can you
expect<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.460> results<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.150> gain<00:00:24.449> lean

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
expect to get results and gain lean

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
expect to get results and gain lean
muscle<00:00:24.810> weight<00:00:25.260> by<00:00:25.439> following<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.099> good<00:00:26.519> weight

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760

muscle weight by following a good weight
gain<00:00:27.029> program<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> when<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.240> comes<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.510> how

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
gain program so when it comes to how

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
gain program so when it comes to how
quickly<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> expect<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.800> game<00:00:31.980> wait<00:00:32.250> as

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
quickly you can expect a game wait as

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
quickly you can expect a game wait as
long<00:00:32.630> as<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.750> training<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> eating

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
long as your training and eating

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.430 
long as your training and eating
properly<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.670> gain<00:00:35.880> weight<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:37.050> expect

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
properly to gain weight you can expect

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.150 
properly to gain weight you can expect
to<00:00:37.530> gain<00:00:37.829> between<00:00:38.399> four<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> five<00:00:40.379> pounds<00:00:41.010> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to gain between four and five pounds of

anything<00:00:44.579> more<00:00:44.760> than<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.570> likely

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
anything more than that is just likely

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.560 
anything more than that is just likely

to be fat and another important fact to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
to be fat and another important fact to
know<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.320> 75%<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.610> muscle<00:00:50.969> tissue

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
know is that about 75% of muscle tissue

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
know is that about 75% of muscle tissue
is<00:00:51.360> made<00:00:51.539> up<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> water<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.770> want<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> make
