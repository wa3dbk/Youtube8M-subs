 technicians with you sergey beams 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.830
 this is weekly news from the world 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480
 gadgets and start with wearable news 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.389
 mobile devices big swiss 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.549
 watch manufacturer which 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.809
 called swatch prepares to exit their 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.640
 smart watch 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.250
 while it is known only that they will 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.400
 called swatch smart watch will be 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.529
 work with android and windows background and weight 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.410
 there will be no support either 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.990
 nfc support to pay for any purchases and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.480
 also they will not need to be charged 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 it is far from clear how they are 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.370
 going to implement but see 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.879
 closer to the end of the year as not actually 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.590
 made 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 meanwhile, another firm by 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.340
 producing smart watches 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.010
 also going to release something 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.030
 absolutely new this year this firm 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 called pebble 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.559
 and now they have two different sales 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.410
 watch types simple pebble watch 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 and pebble steel which is made of 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 metal but closer to fall 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 we are promised to show something 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.719
 fundamentally new and what wearable 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.970
 electronics you generally never 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.590
 Seen with this all also in the new pebble 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.720
 will support the app from 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 third party developers 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 waterproof case and time 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.500
 battery life from 7 to 10 days 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.049
 while they will also work with ios 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 and android and here is some new mega 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.759
 the thing we will see soon is holding it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.490
 secret from the company lg is going to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.130
 present a new smartphone with a display 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.900
 whose resolution will be three 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.920
 how this screen will have 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 a resolution of 2880 by 1600 20 pixels and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 the density of the same pixels 605 sounds 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 cool but is it worth it because 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 need to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.799
 cram a very powerful iron and battery 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.810
 will sit pretty fast 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.110
 other details about the new smartphone 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.939
 better yet unknown, I personally do not at all 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.579
 I understand this race for quality 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.180
 permission to have all sorts of retina and wait 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.570
 screens are even full and the idea makes more sense 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.090
 what is there 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.270
 Do not see the third time in a row we do not manage 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.070
 no news about windows 10 and today we 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.950
 let's talk about a small computer 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.530
 which is called rasberry pi and stands 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.870
 only 35 dollars will remind you that 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.209
 this baby is very small 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.440
 credit card sized computer 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.030

 RAM 4 ports usb 20 output 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 for internet 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.380
 hdmi output micro sd card slot and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.989
 many other outputs for screen sound and 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.489
 other things you ask what has the company 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.709
 microsoft and windows 10 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.180
 the thing is that specifically for 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.989
 rasberry pi 2 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.120
 microsoft will customize its 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.870
 proper windows 10 so it was
