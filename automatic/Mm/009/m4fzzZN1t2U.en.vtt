00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.230
 he is a happy guy 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.539
 when I call the technique of carving in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.869
 the gelatine intalio many people 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.119
 they said that that said Jim Turley or 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.210
 also called the vile and cast or 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.460
 Chalcography is a figure carved in 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.300
 very hard materials like stones 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.950
 woods glasses or precious stones and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 semiprecious for jewelries where the 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.530
 sculpted wing is only shaping its 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 that is to say, it is a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.079
 sculptural technique that creates images 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.150
 highlight the edges of the drawing and lower 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.239
 the crystal or stone or the material that is 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 I'm using carving the figures and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.460
 standing out slightly from the bottom 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.259
 obtaining a three-dimensional effect 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.380
 this word of intalio comes from 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.689
 Italian language the integrity is 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.290
 originally created to add in the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.950
 rings and other jewelry and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.020
 press also on the hot wax 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.150
 and so use it as a seal for 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.150
 letters 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.190
 it was like something like a signature was 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.950
 an art of luxury of the most important 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.100
 of the ancient world and they will see it a lot 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.800
 in Italian art that's why the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.920
 word intalio suits the method 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.380
 of sculpting in gelatin and that's why 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.060
 that I name this technique so integrate 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.850
 it also refers to the technique of 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.670
 engraving and varieties of technique 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.040
 of the inta I include the dry tip 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.760
 aquatint to the table ink and the 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.350
 etching that in English is said to chin 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.690
 it is wonderful to know that nowadays 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.729
 These techniques can not only be used in 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.610
 solid materials but also in 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.220
 edibles like the multi monkey that is the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.600
 carving of fruits and vegetables and in this 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.600
 case also in gelatin
