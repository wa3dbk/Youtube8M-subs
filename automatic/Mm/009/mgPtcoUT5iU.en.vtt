00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.249 
actually a little different than the
initial<00:01:51.299> launch<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> eight<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.229> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
initial launch of the eight which is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.280 
initial launch of the eight which is
kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> interesting<00:01:53.060> as<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.600> detailed<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
kind of interesting as they detailed in

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.959 
kind of interesting as they detailed in
previous<00:01:55.920> videos<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.399> guys<00:01:56.520> already<00:01:56.790> know

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
previous videos you guys already know

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.719 
previous videos you guys already know
you've<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.710> sparse<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.610> know

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
you've got the kind of sparse you know

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.569 
you've got the kind of sparse you know
bladed<00:02:00.299> studs<00:02:00.450> all<00:02:01.409> over<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> outsole<00:02:02.159> still

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
bladed studs all over the outsole still

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.100 
bladed studs all over the outsole still
at<00:02:02.700> FX<00:02:03.030> outsold<00:02:03.540> they<00:02:03.630> found<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
at FX outsold they found that that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
at FX outsold they found that that
material<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.680> really<00:02:05.270> satisfied<00:02:06.270> people<00:02:06.509> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
material is really satisfied people so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.770 
material is really satisfied people so
that's<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.550> two<00:02:08.550> rear<00:02:08.789> studs<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.390> hollowed

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that's good two rear studs all hollowed

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.480 
that's good two rear studs all hollowed
out<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:10.950> no<00:02:11.069> super<00:02:11.459> fly

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
out there is no super fly

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.160 
out there is no super fly
more<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.880> that's<00:02:13.030> actually<00:02:13.450> pretty<00:02:13.780> good<00:02:13.960> for

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
more so that's actually pretty good for

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.870 
more so that's actually pretty good for
everybody<00:02:14.350> because<00:02:14.590> now<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.190> know<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> don't

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
everybody because now you know you don't

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.220 
everybody because now you know you don't
have<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> worry<00:02:16.180> about<00:02:16.270> dropping<00:02:16.480> 400<00:02:17.050> bucks

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
have to worry about dropping 400 bucks

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.600 
have to worry about dropping 400 bucks
on<00:02:17.440> getting<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.800> same<00:02:17.950> shoe<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.370> pros

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
on getting the same shoe that the pros

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.940 
on getting the same shoe that the pros
wear<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.660> truth<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.350> heck<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.710> lot<00:02:20.830> of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
wear and in truth not a heck of a lot of

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.790 
wear and in truth not a heck of a lot of
pros<00:02:21.100> or<00:02:21.310> super<00:02:21.580> flies<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.810> shouldn't<00:02:23.530> say<00:02:23.650> that

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
pros or super flies I shouldn't say that

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.000 
pros or super flies I shouldn't say that
super<00:02:24.220> flies<00:02:24.400> were<00:02:24.610> pretty<00:02:24.940> popular<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.440> on

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
super flies were pretty popular and on

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.380 
super flies were pretty popular and on
the<00:02:27.400> insole<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.810> have<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
the insole you have just like in the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.030 
the insole you have just like in the
super<00:02:31.720> flies<00:02:31.960> you<00:02:32.140> got<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.440> perforated

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
super flies you got the perforated

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.300 
super flies you got the perforated
insole<00:02:33.660> obviously<00:02:34.660> with<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.810> desire<00:02:35.170> of

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
insole obviously with the desire of

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.740 
insole obviously with the desire of
creating<00:02:36.310> some<00:02:36.520> ventilation<00:02:36.970> some<00:02:37.360> air<00:02:37.510> flow

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
creating some ventilation some air flow

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.420 
creating some ventilation some air flow
through<00:02:37.780> your<00:02:38.140> foot<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.890> bottom<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
through your foot and the bottom of the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.250 
through your foot and the bottom of the
shoe<00:02:39.610> because<00:02:39.850> tip<00:02:40.570> X<00:02:40.750> isn't<00:02:40.900> exactly

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
shoe because tip X isn't exactly

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.720 
shoe because tip X isn't exactly
airtight<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:42.460> bit<00:02:42.610> more

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
airtight so you get a little bit more

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.790 
airtight so you get a little bit more
breathability<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.600> outsole<00:02:43.990> that's

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
breathability in that outsole that's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.590 
breathability in that outsole that's
definitely<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.250> plus<00:02:45.400> there<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:45.940> mercurial

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
definitely a plus there it is mercurial

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.860 
definitely a plus there it is mercurial
as<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.990> won't<00:02:47.140> know<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:49.390> of<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.570> cool<00:02:49.720> little

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
as you won't know one of the cool little

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.810 
as you won't know one of the cool little
things<00:02:50.080> about<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.380> shoe<00:02:50.590> actually<00:02:50.830> noticed

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
things about this shoe actually noticed

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.430 
things about this shoe actually noticed
straight<00:02:52.600> out<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> box<00:02:52.960> I<00:02:53.230> don't<00:02:53.380> know

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
straight out of the box I don't know

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
straight out of the box I don't know
it's<00:02:53.560> kind<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:53.770> gimmicky<00:02:54.340> gets<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.730> little<00:02:54.940> bit

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
it's kind of gimmicky gets a little bit

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.630 
it's kind of gimmicky gets a little bit
silly<00:02:55.300> but<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.780> thought<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.680> was<00:02:56.770> somewhat<00:02:57.430> fun

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
silly but I thought it was somewhat fun

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.700 
silly but I thought it was somewhat fun
here<00:02:57.970> you've<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.420> actual<00:02:58.780> RGB<00:02:59.470> color

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
here you've got the actual RGB color

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.160 
here you've got the actual RGB color
code<00:02:59.980> for<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.370> solar<00:03:01.300> red<00:03:01.600> right<00:03:01.840> there<00:03:02.020> I

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
code for the solar red right there I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.360 
code for the solar red right there I
guess<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:02.590> them<00:03:02.770> trying<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.040> prove<00:03:03.250> that

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
guess it's them trying to prove that

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.580 
guess it's them trying to prove that
it's<00:03:03.520> not<00:03:03.670> pink<00:03:03.970> but<00:03:04.210> trust<00:03:04.690> me<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.290> very

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
it's not pink but trust me this is very

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.200 
it's not pink but trust me this is very
much<00:03:05.910> pink<00:03:06.910> like<00:03:07.240> neon<00:03:07.690> pink<00:03:08.370> but<00:03:09.370> yeah<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.760> the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
much pink like neon pink but yeah so the

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.730 
much pink like neon pink but yeah so the
cool<00:03:10.390> thing<00:03:10.420> about<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.840> upper<00:03:11.110> that's

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
cool thing about the upper that's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.350 
cool thing about the upper that's
actually<00:03:12.100> new<00:03:12.250> on<00:03:12.460> these<00:03:12.640> ones<00:03:12.850> it's<00:03:13.000> a<00:03:13.060> little

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
actually new on these ones it's a little

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.690 
actually new on these ones it's a little
bit<00:03:13.480> different<00:03:13.870> than<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.650> initial<00:03:14.920> launch<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
bit different than the initial launch of

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.110 
bit different than the initial launch of
the<00:03:15.910> vapor<00:03:16.090> 8<00:03:16.360> uppers<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:18.280> can<00:03:18.490> kind<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.940> get<00:03:19.090> a

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
the vapor 8 uppers you can kind of get a

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.700 
the vapor 8 uppers you can kind of get a
little<00:03:19.300> feel<00:03:19.600> for<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.900> little<00:03:20.170> bit<00:03:20.350> here<00:03:20.680> but

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
little feel for a little bit here but

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.740 
little feel for a little bit here but
there's<00:03:21.430> actually<00:03:21.580> a<00:03:21.790> bit<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.090> grain<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
there's actually a bit of a grain to the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.150 
there's actually a bit of a grain to the
upper<00:03:22.960> here<00:03:23.140> it's<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.320> really<00:03:23.620> really<00:03:23.890> thin

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
upper here it's a really really thin

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.640 
upper here it's a really really thin
upper<00:03:24.490> just<00:03:24.730> like<00:03:24.940> on<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.470> initial<00:03:26.470> launch

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
upper just like on the initial launch

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.920 
upper just like on the initial launch
and<00:03:26.890> everything<00:03:27.250> there's<00:03:27.790> no<00:03:28.090> backing<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.780> any

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
and everything there's no backing of any

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.480 
and everything there's no backing of any
kind<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.620> way<00:03:29.710> through<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:29.950> shoe<00:03:30.250> it's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
kind all the way through the shoe it's

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.520 
kind all the way through the shoe it's
just<00:03:30.840> straight<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:31.870> what<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.260> see<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.500> what

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
just straight up what you see is what

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.850 
just straight up what you see is what
you<00:03:32.800> get<00:03:32.980> as<00:03:33.520> far<00:03:33.700> as<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> material<00:03:34.390> itself

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
you get as far as the material itself

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.410 
you get as far as the material itself
but<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:36.010> one<00:03:36.190> actually<00:03:36.220> has<00:03:36.520> more<00:03:36.640> of<00:03:37.000> almost

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
but this one actually has more of almost

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.090 
but this one actually has more of almost
like<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> candlelight<00:03:38.200> feel<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.710> it<00:03:38.950> is

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
like a candlelight feel to it it is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.700 
like a candlelight feel to it it is
still<00:03:39.370> taejun<00:03:39.730> synthetics<00:03:40.270> technically<00:03:41.050> but

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
still taejun synthetics technically but

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.980 
still taejun synthetics technically but
it's<00:03:41.920> really<00:03:42.280> it's<00:03:42.640> got<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.690> said<00:03:43.870> like

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
it's really it's got a like I said like

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's really it's got a like I said like
a<00:03:44.050> bit<00:03:44.230> of<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.350> grain<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.830> it<00:03:44.860> it<00:03:45.070> definitely

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
a bit of a grain to it it definitely

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.320 
a bit of a grain to it it definitely
feels<00:03:45.520> different<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.800> having<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:49.030> having

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
feels different and having now having

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.580 
feels different and having now having
tried<00:03:49.540> them<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:49.840> can't<00:03:50.110> really<00:03:50.200> tell<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.500> if

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
tried them on I can't really tell you if

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.350 
tried them on I can't really tell you if
there's<00:03:50.740> any<00:03:50.860> effect<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:51.460> ball<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.910> mean<00:03:52.300> it

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
there's any effect on the ball I mean it

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.820 
there's any effect on the ball I mean it
doesn't<00:03:52.630> really<00:03:52.720> it<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.380> truthful<00:03:53.560> it

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
doesn't really it to be truthful it

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.130 
doesn't really it to be truthful it
feels<00:03:54.310> just<00:03:54.880> like<00:03:54.970> candlelight<00:03:55.570> so<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.840> can't

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
feels just like candlelight so I can't

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.660 
feels just like candlelight so I can't
imagine<00:03:56.200> there's<00:03:56.590> too<00:03:56.680> too<00:03:57.010> much<00:03:57.040> effect<00:03:57.520> to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
imagine there's too too much effect to

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.420 
imagine there's too too much effect to
it<00:03:57.700> but<00:03:58.570> um<00:03:58.750> nevertheless<00:03:59.560> i<00:03:59.950> went<00:04:00.280> back<00:04:00.370> and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
it but um nevertheless i went back and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.830 
it but um nevertheless i went back and
double<00:04:00.760> check<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.150> make<00:04:01.240> sure<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.690> yeah

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
double check just to make sure and yeah

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.810 
double check just to make sure and yeah
it<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.050> still<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.650> asian<00:04:03.070> upper<00:04:03.640> and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
it is still that asian upper and

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.640 
it is still that asian upper and
everything<00:04:04.210> but<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:05.050> just<00:04:05.260> it's<00:04:05.410> kind<00:04:05.560> of

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
everything but it's just it's kind of

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.960 
everything but it's just it's kind of
crazy<00:04:05.830> you<00:04:05.980> really<00:04:06.310> can't<00:04:06.520> escape<00:04:06.790> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
crazy you really can't escape the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.030 
crazy you really can't escape the
feeling<00:04:07.150> that<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> that<00:04:08.709> it's<00:04:08.860> really

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
feeling that it is a that it's really

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.190 
feeling that it is a that it's really
closer<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.520> candlelight<00:04:09.940> so<00:04:10.270> but<00:04:11.080> yeah<00:04:11.170> other

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
closer to candlelight so but yeah other

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.840 
closer to candlelight so but yeah other
than<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.620> um<00:04:11.920> they<00:04:12.220> are<00:04:12.340> still<00:04:12.550> a<00:04:12.610> really

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
than that um they are still a really

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.730 
than that um they are still a really
narrow<00:04:13.030> fit<00:04:13.360> they're<00:04:13.660> not<00:04:13.810> you<00:04:14.440> know<00:04:14.470> they're

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
narrow fit they're not you know they're

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.520 
narrow fit they're not you know they're
certainly<00:04:15.040> not<00:04:15.100> as<00:04:15.370> as<00:04:15.850> narrow<00:04:16.690> actually

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
certainly not as as narrow actually

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.810 
certainly not as as narrow actually
there<00:04:17.650> are<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.770> little<00:04:17.950> bit<00:04:18.130> more<00:04:18.430> narrow<00:04:18.670> than

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
there are a little bit more narrow than

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.290 
there are a little bit more narrow than
the<00:04:19.090> sevens<00:04:19.420> i<00:04:19.540> should<00:04:19.720> say<00:04:20.190> still<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.460> bit<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.150> a

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
have about a half size up on the sizing

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.420 
have about a half size up on the sizing
just<00:04:26.030> like<00:04:26.180> normal<00:04:26.330> as<00:04:27.199> it<00:04:27.379> is<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> with
