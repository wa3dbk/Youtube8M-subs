only a couple key differences and how
those<00:00:22.170> key<00:00:22.410> differences<00:00:22.859> are<00:00:23.100> pretty<00:00:23.130> much

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
those key differences are pretty much

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.790 
those key differences are pretty much
gone<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.420> new<00:00:24.539> 2015<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.410> fit<00:00:25.590> versions<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
gone in the new 2015 can fit versions so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
gone in the new 2015 can fit versions so
first<00:00:28.800> way<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.340> could<00:00:29.490> tell<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.939> by<00:00:30.330> checking

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
first way you could tell is by checking

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.209 
first way you could tell is by checking
out<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.560> blackness<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.870> otter<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
out the the blackness of the otter the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
out the the blackness of the otter the
real<00:00:35.399> ones<00:00:35.640> never<00:00:36.149> change<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.809> not<00:00:37.050> changed

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
real ones never change have not changed

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
real ones never change have not changed
so<00:00:37.590> far<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> they're<00:00:39.390> pretty<00:00:39.660> much<00:00:39.780> like<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
so far so they're pretty much like that

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
so far so they're pretty much like that
now<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> fake<00:00:40.980> ones<00:00:41.219> are<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> lot<00:00:41.730> more<00:00:41.760> black

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
now the fake ones are a lot more black

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.709 
now the fake ones are a lot more black
as<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.660> tell<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.670> however<00:00:44.719> all

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
new counterfeit ones I've gotten I think

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.889 
doesn't match you know the other
counterfeit<00:02:08.879> but<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.270> said<00:02:09.330> sometimes

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
counterfeit but like I said sometimes

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.600 
counterfeit but like I said sometimes
they<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.140> sometimes<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.619> don't

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
they do sometimes I don't

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.860 
they do sometimes I don't
the<00:02:11.849> newer<00:02:12.030> counterfeits<00:02:12.480> now<00:02:12.660> they're<00:02:12.780> just

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the newer counterfeits now they're just

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.360 
the newer counterfeits now they're just
match

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
match

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.670 
match
the<00:02:13.580> same<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:14.120> UPC<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.659> same<00:02:14.870> however

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the same that UPC the same however

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.199 
the same that UPC the same however
sometimes<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.190> package<00:02:16.459> was<00:02:16.610> lazy<00:02:16.760> lost<00:02:17.060> out

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
sometimes the package was lazy lost out

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.570 
sometimes the package was lazy lost out
in<00:02:17.239> some<00:02:17.510> random<00:02:17.780> commuter<00:02:18.080> case<00:02:18.290> or<00:02:18.470> some<00:02:18.650> now

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
in some random commuter case or some now

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.039 
in some random commuter case or some now
as<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.120> tell<00:02:20.180> his<00:02:20.390> counterfeit<00:02:20.810> case

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
as you can tell his counterfeit case

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.009 
as you can tell his counterfeit case
also<00:02:21.319> was<00:02:22.060> easy<00:02:23.060> way<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.239> tell<00:02:23.450> because<00:02:23.659> this

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
also was easy way to tell because this

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.809 
also was easy way to tell because this
is<00:02:24.170> rare<00:02:24.349> too<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.099> think<00:02:25.310> until<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.700> is

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
is rare too but I think until this is

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.059 
is rare too but I think until this is
real<00:02:26.030> tree<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.540> obviously<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.769> people<00:02:27.860> are

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
real tree so obviously the people are

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.699 
real tree so obviously the people are
trying<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.400> put<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:28.670> in<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.879> wrong<00:02:29.030> packaging

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
trying to put this in a wrong packaging

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.710 
trying to put this in a wrong packaging
so<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:33.709> know<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:33.890> sides<00:02:34.159> are<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.310> same<00:02:34.720> tops

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
so you know the sides are the same tops

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.009 
so you know the sides are the same tops
the<00:02:35.959> same<00:02:36.170> sides<00:02:37.000> back<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.390> same<00:02:38.659> it's

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
the same sides back it's the same it's

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.259 
the same sides back it's the same it's
not<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.230> go<00:02:39.379> inside<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.799> case<00:02:40.010> so<00:02:40.730> in<00:02:41.060> case

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
not one go inside the case so in case

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.880 
not one go inside the case so in case
you<00:02:41.360> can<00:02:41.480> get<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.629> packaging<00:02:42.049> because<00:02:42.140> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
you can get the packaging because you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.110 
you can get the packaging because you
know<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.010> ain't<00:02:43.159> gonna<00:02:43.340> let<00:02:43.549> Sarge<00:02:43.909> you<00:02:44.000> the

you guys gonna see a blog post if you
want<00:04:46.759> to<00:04:46.849> see<00:04:47.000> more<00:04:47.500> maybe<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.620> picture<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:49.099> it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
want to see more maybe a picture of it

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.820 
want to see more maybe a picture of it
but<00:04:49.659> like<00:04:50.659> I<00:04:50.780> said<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:51.020> counterfeits<00:04:51.409> look<00:04:51.590> so

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
but like I said the counterfeits look so

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:52.990 
but like I said the counterfeits look so
much<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.069> same<00:04:52.250> there's<00:04:52.550> only<00:04:52.669> that's<00:04:52.879> the

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
much the same there's only that's the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.619 
much the same there's only that's the
only<00:04:53.180> difference

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:53.629 
only difference

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:56.020 
only difference
so<00:04:53.810> hopefully<00:04:54.409> you<00:04:54.650> will<00:04:54.770> tell<00:04:55.099> the<00:04:55.610> fake<00:04:55.819> ones

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
so hopefully you will tell the fake ones

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.909 
so hopefully you will tell the fake ones
a<00:04:56.120> lot<00:04:56.300> more<00:04:56.539> dimmer<00:04:56.810> than<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.139> real<00:04:57.289> one<00:04:57.470> but

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
a lot more dimmer than the real one but

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.080 
a lot more dimmer than the real one but
unless<00:04:58.129> you<00:04:58.729> have<00:04:58.759> a<00:04:58.849> side-by-side

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
unless you have a side-by-side

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.730 
unless you have a side-by-side
