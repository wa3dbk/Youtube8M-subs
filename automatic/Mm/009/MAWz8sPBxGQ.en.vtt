00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
have a four-wheel drive unit it's going

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.780 
have a four-wheel drive unit it's going
to<00:01:39.410> be<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.590> its<00:01:39.740> side<00:01:39.950> two-wheel<00:01:40.430> drive<00:01:40.670> it

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
to be on its side two-wheel drive it

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.790 
to be on its side two-wheel drive it
semi<00:01:41.030> up<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:41.300> down<00:01:41.479> obviously<00:01:42.170> it's<00:01:42.650> going<00:01:42.740> to

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
semi up and down obviously it's going to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.820 
semi up and down obviously it's going to
be<00:01:42.950> easier<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.050> two-wheel<00:01:45.050> drive<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
be easier if it's two-wheel drive and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.859 
be easier if it's two-wheel drive and
you<00:01:45.979> might<00:01:46.670> need<00:01:46.850> an<00:01:46.970> oil<00:01:47.060> filter<00:01:47.540> wrench<00:01:47.570> you

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
you might need an oil filter wrench you

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.180 
you might need an oil filter wrench you
might<00:01:48.080> not<00:01:48.290> just<00:01:48.590> turn<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.860> counterclockwise

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
might not just turn it counterclockwise

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.150 
might not just turn it counterclockwise
and<00:01:49.790> see<00:01:49.940> if<00:01:50.030> it'll<00:01:50.180> come<00:01:50.330> off<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:51.009> have<00:01:52.009> your

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
and see if it'll come off I have your

you're going to need to use about both
of<00:04:50.640> these<00:04:50.729> on<00:04:51.090> there's<00:04:51.479> their<00:04:52.229> gallon

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
of these on there's their gallon

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.350 
of these on there's their gallon
containers<00:04:53.250> there's<00:04:53.520> four<00:04:53.760> quarts<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.240> each

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
containers there's four quarts in each

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.780 
containers there's four quarts in each
gallon<00:04:54.810> so<00:04:55.050> like<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.800> said<00:04:55.979> it's<00:04:56.100> between<00:04:56.250> seven

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
gallon so like I said it's between seven

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.360 
gallon so like I said it's between seven
and<00:04:56.850> eight<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.240> closer<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.690> seven<00:04:58.080> but<00:04:58.740> um<00:04:58.950> I

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
and eight it's closer to seven but um I

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.080 
and eight it's closer to seven but um I
taught<00:05:00.210> my<00:05:00.390> oil<00:05:00.660> off<00:05:01.010> because<00:05:02.010> I<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.580> burn<00:05:03.060> a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
taught my oil off because I I burn a

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.040 
taught my oil off because I I burn a
little<00:05:03.240> oil

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
little oil

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.649 
little oil
so<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:04.770> mean<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.639> had<00:05:05.759> already<00:05:05.909> used<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> little<00:05:06.479> of

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
so I mean I had already used a little of

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.570 
so I mean I had already used a little of
it<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.050> mean<00:05:07.289> if<00:05:08.069> you<00:05:08.220> don't<00:05:08.370> know<00:05:08.430> how<00:05:08.520> to

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
it so I mean if you don't know how to

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.710 
it so I mean if you don't know how to
check<00:05:08.759> a<00:05:08.819> dipstick<00:05:09.210> what<00:05:09.479> you're<00:05:09.569> going<00:05:09.690> to

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
check a dipstick what you're going to

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.930 
check a dipstick what you're going to

the<00:06:06.690> oil<00:06:07.020> filters<00:06:07.520> secure<00:06:08.520> and<00:06:09.210> you're<00:06:09.330> just

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
the oil filters secure and you're just

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.839 
the oil filters secure and you're just
going<00:06:09.569> to<00:06:09.630> come<00:06:09.810> around<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.349> ignition<00:06:10.849> and

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
going to come around to the ignition and

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:12.860 
going to come around to the ignition and
we're<00:06:12.029> just<00:06:12.090> going<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.300> go<00:06:12.449> ahead<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.750> make

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
we're just going to go ahead and make

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.959 
we're just going to go ahead and make
sure<00:06:13.020> we<00:06:13.169> have<00:06:13.289> oil<00:06:13.529> pressure<00:06:13.889> so<00:06:14.729> we're<00:06:14.880> going

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
sure we have oil pressure so we're going

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.689 
sure we have oil pressure so we're going
to<00:06:15.029> go<00:06:15.150> ahead<00:06:15.389> and<00:06:15.889> when<00:06:16.889> we<00:06:17.039> start<00:06:17.340> it<00:06:17.460> we<00:06:17.550> are

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 
to go ahead and when we start it we are

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:24.830 
to go ahead and when we start it we are
hoping<00:06:18.029> for<00:06:18.090> oil<00:06:18.599> pressure

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.750 

and<00:06:25.110> then<00:06:25.770> it<00:06:25.919> moves<00:06:26.360> you're<00:06:27.360> good<00:06:27.600> to<00:06:27.780> go

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.879 

so<00:06:32.760> that's<00:06:33.750> how<00:06:33.960> to<00:06:33.990> change<00:06:34.230> the<00:06:34.440> oil<00:06:34.470> on<00:06:34.710> your

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
so that's how to change the oil on your

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.520 
so that's how to change the oil on your
6.5<00:06:35.520> turbo<00:06:35.910> diesel<00:06:36.300> you're<00:06:37.200> going<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.410> go

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
6.5 turbo diesel you're going to go

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.720 
6.5 turbo diesel you're going to go
ahead<00:06:37.650> and<00:06:37.889> want<00:06:38.040> to<00:06:38.100> just<00:06:38.220> clean<00:06:38.520> off

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:38.730 
ahead and want to just clean off

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.340 
ahead and want to just clean off
everything<00:06:39.180> in<00:06:39.300> here<00:06:39.570> while<00:06:40.080> you're<00:06:40.230> at<00:06:40.320> it

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
everything in here while you're at it

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.659 
everything in here while you're at it
you<00:06:40.470> can<00:06:40.620> check<00:06:40.800> some<00:06:40.950> fluids<00:06:41.280> if<00:06:41.370> you'd<00:06:41.520> like

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:41.669 
you can check some fluids if you'd like

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.909 
you can check some fluids if you'd like
power<00:06:42.060> steering<00:06:42.180> fluid<00:06:42.780> is<00:06:43.050> right<00:06:43.230> down<00:06:43.440> there

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
power steering fluid is right down there

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.590 
power steering fluid is right down there
brake<00:06:44.460> fluid<00:06:44.490> up<00:06:44.940> here<00:06:45.150> if<00:06:45.240> you're<00:06:45.419> driving

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
brake fluid up here if you're driving

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.900 
brake fluid up here if you're driving
stick<00:06:46.020> your<00:06:46.169> clutch<00:06:46.350> fluid<00:06:46.590> is<00:06:46.830> up<00:06:46.980> here<00:06:47.250> so<00:06:47.880> I

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 
stick your clutch fluid is up here so I

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.520 
stick your clutch fluid is up here so I
mean<00:06:48.120> you<00:06:48.450> can<00:06:48.600> just<00:06:48.630> go<00:06:48.900> through<00:06:48.930> your<00:06:49.230> fluids

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
mean you can just go through your fluids
