00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:16.440
 and now we present missions for 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.859
 young and with several paula on side 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.859
 villamize 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.120
 well today we are going to see two 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.790
 types of face one is the round and the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.410
 another is the square these two types of 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.110
 face are similar because they are the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 faces that need more corrections and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 that's why today we're going to meet you 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.060
 so I hope you like it and let's see 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.600
 what corrections do we need? 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.270
 let's start with the square face 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.910
 remember that dark tones are for 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.110
 hide or disguise those things that 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.990
 we do not like them so we're going to start 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.020
 hiding part of the forehead as 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.800
 can see the same in the bottom 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.390
 of the jaw to tune the slightly 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 more and that is not seen as so 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.050
 pronounced is what we want to do 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.080
 because remember that we love each other 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.330
 resemble an oval face after 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.780
 this we are going to put blush like in a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.660
 shape of c the cheekbone towards the sky of 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.910
 the temple to the cheekbone as you want 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:33.560
 but in a form of c so that like 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:35.960
 we curve our face more and here 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.110
 I'm just blurring it a little 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.340
 after that I will catch the bright 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:51.530
 hair clarito to tune a little more the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:58.460
 traits to the nose and heart 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:02.509
 the lip here you can see the before and the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.150
 then later we will continue with the face 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.959
 in round and in this case what we will do 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.140
 is to hide our beautiful cheeks 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.450
 we want to disguise them a little and they are 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 a highlight our cheekbone 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.350
 that's why under the cheekbone 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.430
 we will mark the darkness of the ros and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.400
 we will refine the features a little more 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.670
 slightly delineating the edges of the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 pink partition of our nose to 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.410
 that it looks much thinner that faction in 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.640
 our face we will put the blush 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.739
 just like in the manzanitas 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.290
 when you smile that those are formed 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.700
 balls in the cheeks that's where 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.800
 we must put the blush 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.810
 remember that here I have it a little more 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.580
 marking what should be in our 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.350
 face so that you what 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.750
 visualize better 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.060
 and then how can you see the before and the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.980
 then good and I hope you have them 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.400
 liked today's program 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.590
 remember that if they become one of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 the previous videos as they can 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.610
 send us your photo here to td at 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.220
 mission success point heretics so that 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.860
 can participate in the raffle of some 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.930
 products that we have seen in the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.180
 course of the program so I hope 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.070
 that they dare to do it and remember that 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.390
 you and I see you next 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.390
