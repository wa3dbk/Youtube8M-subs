than the normal height lifting which

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.270 
than the normal height lifting which
means<00:00:58.710> i<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> move<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.430> hand<00:01:00.329> faster

after the throw to get it down to make
the<00:01:03.930> catch<00:01:04.189> so<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.339> we're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> do<00:01:05.790> it's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the catch so what we're going to do it's
