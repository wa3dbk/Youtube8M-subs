00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.080
 After Kirn's 60 acts, the wait had finally come to an end on Saturday 

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:10.340
 Stadtwerke Energie jena-pößneck dissolved the ice block bet and the 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.090
 two differently insulated wooden houses anatomy gate opened us 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.529
 in fact, despite the hot summer, ICE House is still passively passive 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.109
 Part of ice block trapped in early June 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.269
 he survived four to five degrees in winter 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.019
 After the melt water was drained words, the result was then fixed 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.070
 a total of 28 point 3 percent that was originally one cubic meter 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.470
 Ice block thing left over after a good two months 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.300
 with the ice block bet just wanted to show something 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.429
 good contemporary heat room insulation standard can afford 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.830
 and there are many 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.670
 Lectures or literature on this topic and we just wanted it 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.769
 Let's just point out in a very graphic way 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.820
 to reach a lot of people 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.890
 on June 5, the two scanners were packed against the two wooden houses 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.080
 a house corresponded to the sobering current ones 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.460
 Energy Saving Ordinance NF 2009 the other house was passive house standard 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480
 insulated the actual state of the art 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.350
 Via a temperature gauge, the evolution of the internal temperature in 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 both houses are tracked analogously to the outside temperature 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.840
 The temperatures in the NFV were about twice as high as in the beginning 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
 passive house 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.120
 Accordingly, only melt water can be found here after 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.880
 Apparently the ice was completely melted here already in the middle of July 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.070
 the difference come percent through the different sources strengthen 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.560
 percent 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.390
 conditions 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.340
 due to the higher band the heat input slows down more 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.770
 all this out 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.980
 As a result, the ice melts slower 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.540
 the tenant couple she Mrs. Hoss that is now out in the meadow yes or on 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.190
 The road still has percentages and benefits 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.750
 compared to the normal construction standard so that's easy too 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.880
 Nazaire airtight construction that means it could therefore be less stressful 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.470
 Structural damage or drafts 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.710
 Harnisch Ventilation helps with the fresh air 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 Heat recovery 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.769
 I have optimized layout that is the living rooms he is after 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.130
 Oriented south or west so I put it over the windows 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.789
 a lot of heat gains 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.049
 To the exit haunted weather, a total of 250 participants have their tips 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:22.910
 submitted 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.500
 the winners were also announced on Saturday eighth place and thus one 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.990
