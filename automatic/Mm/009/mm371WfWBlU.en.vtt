00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
so here we have the new Garrett 80 Pro

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.990 
so here we have the new Garrett 80 Pro
it<00:00:09.690> arrived<00:00:09.990> yesterday

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
it arrived yesterday

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.900 
it arrived yesterday
I've<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:13.160> got<00:00:14.160> around<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.490> doing<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.759> little

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I've just got around to doing a little

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.310 
I've just got around to doing a little
bit<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.120> testing<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:17.300> one<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.810> just

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
bit of testing on it one thing I just

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.179 
bit of testing on it one thing I just
want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:20.840> illustrate<00:00:21.840> with<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
want to illustrate with this is that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.470 
want to illustrate with this is that
basically<00:00:24.119> there's<00:00:24.359> two<00:00:24.420> modes<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:26.480> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
basically there's two modes one is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.130 
basically there's two modes one is
standard<00:00:27.900> mode<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> one<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.650> pro<00:00:29.490> mode<00:00:30.019> at<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
standard mode and one is pro mode at the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.200 
standard mode and one is pro mode at the
moment<00:00:31.219> it's<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.369> standard<00:00:32.969> mode<00:00:33.680> which<00:00:34.680> is

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
moment it's in standard mode which is

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.970 
moment it's in standard mode which is
indicated<00:00:36.210> by<00:00:39.110> STD<00:00:40.110> up<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.530> left-hand

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
indicated by STD up in this left-hand

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
indicated by STD up in this left-hand
corner<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:42.960> I've<00:00:43.079> got<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:44.149> piece<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> wood

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
corner so what I've got is piece of wood

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:54.950 
corner so what I've got is piece of wood
here<00:00:45.629> marked<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.789> inches<00:00:52.940> nine<00:00:53.940> inches<00:00:54.780> is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
here marked off in inches nine inches is

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
here marked off in inches nine inches is
about<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.379> 10<00:00:55.620> inches<00:00:55.890> about<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.930> I

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
about there 10 inches about there so I

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.189 
about there 10 inches about there so I
have<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:59.030> hammered<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:02.719> let's<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.809> give

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
have a hammered here let's just give

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
have a hammered here let's just give
this<00:01:04.320> wave<00:01:04.589> about<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.250> front<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.820> see

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
this wave about in front of it and see

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
this wave about in front of it and see
what<00:01:06.150> happens<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:13.080> about<00:01:13.290> nine

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
what happens so you have about nine

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:27.020 
what happens so you have about nine
inches<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> you'll<00:01:19.259> observe<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:26.030> in

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
inches and you'll observe that in

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
inches and you'll observe that in
relation<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> coil<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.700> actual<00:01:30.920> volume

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
relation to the coil the actual volume

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.380 
relation to the coil the actual volume
of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.640> doesn't<00:01:33.000> change<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.670> if<00:01:36.329> we

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
of the time doesn't change now if we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.469 
of the time doesn't change now if we
find<00:01:39.390> them<00:01:39.509> put<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.810> into<00:01:39.990> pro<00:01:40.350> mode<00:01:44.420> okay<00:01:45.420> so

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
find them put this into pro mode okay so

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.069 
find them put this into pro mode okay so
this<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> change<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.530> TD<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.100> prod<00:01:51.079> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
this is change from this TD to prod and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.179 
this is change from this TD to prod and
go<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:55.490> with<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.520> hammered<00:01:56.939> again<00:01:58.189> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
go back with that hammered again and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:09.880 
go back with that hammered again and
we'll<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.490> that's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.119> proportional<00:02:00.840> there

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.770 

so<00:02:10.280> further<00:02:10.970> Wyatt<00:02:11.270> gets<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:14.210> quarter<00:02:14.690> is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so further Wyatt gets the quarter is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.350 
so further Wyatt gets the quarter is
gets<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:15.950> nine<00:02:16.130> inches<00:02:16.460> there<00:02:19.060> but<00:02:20.060> you

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
gets so it's nine inches there but you

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:37.900 
gets so it's nine inches there but you
can<00:02:20.510> just<00:02:23.020> hear<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:25.000> at<00:02:30.850> North<00:02:31.850> 10<00:02:32.720> inches<00:02:36.910> 10

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
can just hear it at North 10 inches 10

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.690 
can just hear it at North 10 inches 10
inches<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:41.230> okay<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.160> would<00:02:43.340> seem<00:02:43.670> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
inches here okay so it would seem that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.400 
inches here okay so it would seem that
the<00:02:44.410> promo<00:02:45.410> gives<00:02:45.770> about<00:02:46.430> an<00:02:46.550> inch<00:02:47.260> more<00:02:48.260> on

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the promo gives about an inch more on

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.729 
the promo gives about an inch more on
depth<00:02:48.650> admit<00:02:49.220> Lee<00:02:49.310> this<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.610> ear<00:02:49.760> tests<00:02:50.739> not

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
depth admit Lee this is ear tests not

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.830 
depth admit Lee this is ear tests not
always<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:53.870> best<00:02:55.090> illustration<00:02:56.090> but

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
always the best illustration but

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.160 
always the best illustration but
nonetheless<00:02:58.180> they<00:02:59.180> will<00:02:59.360> give<00:02:59.510> an<00:02:59.600> idea<00:02:59.959> what

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
nonetheless they will give an idea what

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.740 
nonetheless they will give an idea what
will<00:03:00.560> happen<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.950> field<00:03:01.750> okay<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:04.750> that's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
will happen in the field okay so that's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.300 
will happen in the field okay so that's
that<00:03:06.020> one<00:03:06.260> feature<00:03:06.560> I'm<00:03:06.920> sure<00:03:07.070> we're<00:03:07.220> doing

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
that one feature I'm sure we're doing

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.490 
that one feature I'm sure we're doing
some<00:03:07.550> more<00:03:07.700> testing<00:03:08.090> later<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:12.170> that's<00:03:12.350> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
some more testing later and that's the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.070 
some more testing later and that's the
80<00:03:12.620> Pro
