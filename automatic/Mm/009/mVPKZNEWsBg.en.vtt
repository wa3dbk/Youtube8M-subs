00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:02.480
 we will start talking 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.740
 of the whole numbers set 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.219
 or set is expected 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.909
 which is made up of negative numbers and numbers 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:13.729
 positives 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.249
 oo natural numbers as we traditionally know it 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.630
 but a better understanding 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.089
 we are going to represent 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.310
 graphically these are 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.329
 this number set 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.989
 a numerical scale 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.900
 where the numbers 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.270
 from 0 asia the left 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.970
 sheeran considers 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.900
 the negative numbers 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.830
 the numbers from 0 to the right will be considered positive numbers 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.140
 the numbers 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.620
 towards the situation is that two 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.720
 we will begin body 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.480
 one two three until the psoe values â€‹â€‹today and so nikkei index indefinitely 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.540
 from the right sidewalk we will also start with him 1 2 3 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.510
 Castro 5 and 6 we leave until today 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.960
 and this continues indefinitely 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.590
 the numbers on the left we put the negative sign 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 so that we all know that they are negative 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 it is important to keep in mind that those numbers a state 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760
 to the left are less than the numbers were nothing 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.240
 so that 6-6 and that is less than minus five 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
 - 4 is less than minus three 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 is less than two 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.210
 it does not matter the inter quartets all are command the whole listed will be 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.079
 numerical we do not always find the numbers of each of them are greater 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.280
 that those that are located on the left and the one on the left are less 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.690
 those on the right 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 this so as not to cause confusion with 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.130
 massa assured 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.130
 the desire to be 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.239
 we were behind him 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.269
 if we have 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.339
 temperatures 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.339
 recently in the congress and in the senate 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.719
 is opposed but to be 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.819
 otherwise the temperature is below zero 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.399
 one of them 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:39.259
 these elections 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 the amount of temperature 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:51.119
 the time that allows us 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.469
 if we ourselves 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.139
 5th floor experts 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.639
 we had min 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.809
 otherwise we arrive 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.679
 we would be retreating 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.999
 if we win the first basement 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.629
 2002 - 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.039
 seara assured 

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:34.659
 why yes watching - 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.159
 the leader clarified 3 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.279
 it will be 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.689
 is much higher menchÃº 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.689
 the second basement the second basement 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.119
 always remember that he 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.329
 never more to the left 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.329
 alien vs 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.939
 in this situation the holder 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.939
 briefly how would it be done 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:03.379
 add up of numerous integers or positive numbers and negative numbers 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.669
 Moreno has previously explained the negative numbers 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.459
 they identify with the sign - 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.329
 it's a number like positive 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.709
 with the plus sign 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.489
 we have less one 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.509
 and if not more one although this sign 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.909
 not always 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:27.719
 be placed in front of the moment 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.590
 let's see then a small example what would be a sum 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.710
 we have less one 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.370
 once again all 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
 kresic the same 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.659
 because there we have less one more all 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.669
 chediak match 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.979
 a whole world 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.759
 because I had when some cougars add up 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.849
 sum of different numbers 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.759
 they counteract the numbers jose to serra experts and 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.909
 the positive and negative numbers that must be defended 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.909
 the highest number is that the remaining 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.180
 your sign 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.180
 we have at least the case of +5 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.349
 -5 + 4 this is equal to - 1 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.669
 let's see another example 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.159
 plus 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.979
 3 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.979
 - 2 is the same 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.799
 let's give an example if we have - all 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:32.650
 - 3 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.589
 this is going to be equal to at least five 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:40.339
 we have two numbers of the same sign you will see and add when the same sign 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.270
 we have the case in addition 3 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.789
 more 2 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.939
 this is equal to five more positive we can put him or we can not put him the 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:53.789
 sign both this one and it's 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.789
 we have the case of -6 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.520
 more 7 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.610
 this is immoral 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.319
 to a positive because 6 is less than the site to prevail the site the number 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:08.379
 higher 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.789
 let's be another example we have the case 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:14.789
 35 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.539
 positive this series would not doubt a total of 25 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.900
 because it slows down 25 and more than 10 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.719
 we have the case now 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.409
 d 5 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.779
 - 10 this is done in fourth to five 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:38.639
 negative because it's because 10 is superior to singh 

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.159
 hundred and seventy there case is going to be the same and will always want to prevail 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:45.150
 case 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.150
 of the cycle you have of the number you have 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.649
 that is greater wished to remain the cinemark cycle case of five - 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.939
 6 the one that will be the same 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:05.819
 however 5-6 in five rounds and the sign that predominates the presence of 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:08.819
 minor therefore pitcher Jason Thompson 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:17.159
 temoac case of seven - 4 there will be three because because the site but mine before the 

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:19.990
 predominant number greater number 4 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.509
 this means that 7-4 are three 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:26.620
 if it were the other way around if they were less 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.349
 more 4 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:34.099
 the result was also three megatv goalies with the motto is the case 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:36.059
 that is - 5 

00:07:36.059 --> 00:07:38.279
 + 0 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:44.589
 a +0 presented to be titular to five more in the places at least five 

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:46.539
 always maradona 

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:50.710
 win the number that had the largest number in which you will keep for 

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.940
 hundred
