00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.109
 talk and welcome to one more 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.790
 tutorial here on the channel today tutorial 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.469
 different there that I do not usually do 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.259
 so much where trade 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.940
 I hope you like good editorial 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.369
 that it is about three for those who do not 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 you know it 's already 33 when you do 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.800
 trading for items here in the ultimate 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.539
 team and is always aiming, do not 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 times for at least the profit for 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.050
 you stay with more money every time 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
 power every time you buy more players 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 expensive to make the goal of the game 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.890
 have the coolest things and I'll bring 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 this video here to explain how 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.020
 I do a method that I find out here. 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.899
 how to make some great money 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.030
 well this method uses 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.710
 players like you can see me there 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.489
 I bought some contracts 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.860
 look there for 200 dogs these contracts 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 here is not uncommon gold 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.670
 only if we observe in the market of 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.020
 transfer contracts are valid 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.699
 O 300 dogs at the banal ie the purchase 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.199
 that is when you do not participate 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.799
 an auction you buy already have a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.260
 item 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.060
 eight minutes to go here and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.490
 soon this contract will be 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.930
 bought because the Friday when I 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.729
 I record this video here 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 and the closer it gets to the end of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.060
 week more people play and more people 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.850
 seek contracts 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 maybe maybe I can not say with 100% 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 of course if we put a contract 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.659
 to be sold tomorrow to us 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.490
 would get up to more than 300 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.740
 I could get to 350 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.259
 You can see that the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 contract someone bought 300 dogs 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.079
 now make a basic account with me if I 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.560
 I am buying a contract for 200 million 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.170
 seeing him for 300 dogs withdraws and the 5% 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 which then receives for each negotiation 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.759
 you do is the equivalent of 15 of which 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.170
 300 correct 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.290
 if I take 300 - 15 - two hundred eu 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 I get 85 colors for each contract 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.310
 You might think it's a little bit to do. 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.729
 with a contract just think more if 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.530
 you do with 100 contracts go from 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.899
 8,500 if you do with a thousand contracts 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.740
 You'll get 85 home in a way. 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.660
 It's totally simple and safe that I 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.040
 how can you do the first 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.690
 thing you have to do is buy 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.670
 the contracts then you have to come here 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.880
 in the transfer market in the area of 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.850
 consumables put here the contract type 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:29.060
 Put quality you want is gold and 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.210
 Here there in the country that puts 150 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.980
 maximum in the bid or in the auction and 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.320
 So I'll get to the pages more than 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.380
 background his gaze intent on without page 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:42.050
 contract has a contract for 151 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.720
 came to place 200 between an auction 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.500
 I put 200 in the other entered the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 auction 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.930
 I have put 200 in another one already 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 they got that from 200 then they have to 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.560
 advance and take the contract for no 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.220
 maximum 200 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.990
 So people are going there and on your list. 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.910
 transfer of contract that you do not 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.250
 will win everyone for example had me 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.080
 given this here ended up 300 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.420
 I'm going to give myself four minutes 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.480
 Look I'm going to get results and there if I 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.570
 I managed to give 30 beauty all crazy because 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.820
 if I sell there 15 contracts won 85 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.670
 run on top of them and win back 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.220
 about 1 km and something of 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.930
 profit after you have done this you can 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.920
 send the contracts to your list of 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.100
 transfers 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.520
 I have these contracts here and you 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.630
 comes put his beach start from 251 by 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.380
 now 300 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:40.670
 You can put it there and there you do it with 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.770
 all the contacts you have 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.370
 important detail is you leave here 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.870
 250 and 300 and allow the duration of the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.660
 one hour maximum 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.700
 because people will always buy the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.490
 contacts at the end of this one hour because 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.800
 she does not keep calling the page that 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.410
 there are the contracts of 59 minutes 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.410
 understood that they do 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.330
 they come here and buy it later when they 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.150
 arriving there in ten minutes five 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.530
 minutes if you end up putting here 63 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.860
 12 hours 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.400
 the contracts will be sold here 12 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.400
 63 hours 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.170
 understood then after a time there 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.570
 that you wait a little bit 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.930
 see that I was able to sell all 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.820
 My contracts for 300 dogs, how are you? 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.270
 I can see that 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.460
 I made a basic core with these contracts 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.470
 so this is a very simple and 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.140
 safe and also to make trade as 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.820
 it's virtually impossible for you to lose 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.590
 money would at least sell 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.380
 produce 50 which recover all 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.660
 maybe I could just 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.910
 sell for 350 million at the end of 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.770
 week for example to get more 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.230
 money if you have multiple accounts 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.210
 Why can not you just give me one 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.440
 certain limit there of number of 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.600
 item transfers 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.590
 transfers if we have to suppose 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.450
 yes bills and you buy 30 40 50 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.890
 contracts of each of those accounts and 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.700
 put everybody to sell for a day 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.180
 to the other 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.120
 you get 200 comes from 250 280 dogs 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.890
 contracts means in a 20 here from 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.240
 money so you have a little bit of 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.980
 I work only for and until the page sem cento 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.530
 and little to get the 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.810
 dollar contracts contracts and much 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.830
 profit in the end with little 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.930
 job 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.180
