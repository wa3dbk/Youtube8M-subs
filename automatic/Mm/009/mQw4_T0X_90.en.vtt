00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.750 
now my skin got better each run but I
wasn't<00:02:55.960> quite<00:02:56.200> fast<00:02:56.710> enough<00:02:56.890> in<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> final

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
run and I was a little bit stiff so my

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.750 
run and I was a little bit stiff so my
skiing<00:02:59.800> could<00:02:59.950> have<00:03:00.040> been<00:03:00.160> smoothed<00:03:00.430> out<00:03:00.550> but

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
skiing could have been smoothed out but
