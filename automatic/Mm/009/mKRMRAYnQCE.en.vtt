00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
takes time to develop a decent rushing

searching<00:02:06.340> destroy<00:02:06.670> here<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:08.830> um<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:11.110> know<00:02:11.260> I

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
searching destroy here but um you know I

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
searching destroy here but um you know I
think<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.830> pull<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.550> together<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.090> next<00:02:13.210> few

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
think I pull it together the next few

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.630 
think I pull it together the next few

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
corner nice nice and it takes a little

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.589 
corner nice nice and it takes a little
bit<00:05:40.039> more<00:05:40.310> time<00:05:40.610> than<00:05:40.969> if<00:05:41.150> you<00:05:41.300> were<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.449> pull

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
bit more time than if you were to pull

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:44.879 
bit more time than if you were to pull
out<00:05:41.749> a<00:05:41.779> side<00:05:42.020> arm<00:05:42.729> but<00:05:43.729> I'll<00:05:44.240> get<00:05:44.419> used<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.659> it

out a side arm but I'll get used to it
it's<00:05:45.889> probably<00:05:46.009> equivalent<00:05:46.430> time<00:05:46.849> to<00:05:47.210> pull

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
it's probably equivalent time to pull

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.600 
it's probably equivalent time to pull
