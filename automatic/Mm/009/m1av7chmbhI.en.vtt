00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
basically well would the good thing with

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.330 
basically well would the good thing with
that<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.900> could<00:03:34.080> cancel<00:03:34.290> anytime<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.160> did

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
that I could cancel anytime like I did

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.520 
that I could cancel anytime like I did
without<00:03:35.820> paying<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.180> big<00:03:36.390> fee<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:37.170> editing

without paying a big fee for editing

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.070 
without paying a big fee for editing
software<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.220> yeah<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> reckon<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.600> movie<00:03:40.050> I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
software so yeah I reckon I movie I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.560 
software so yeah I reckon I movie I
believe<00:03:40.410> that's<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.860> Mac<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.570> reckon

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
believe that's on the Mac so I reckon

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.820 
believe that's on the Mac so I reckon
that<00:03:42.720> could<00:03:42.840> be<00:03:42.930> all<00:03:43.050> good<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.410> when<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.590> get

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
that could be all good so when I get

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:44.990 
that could be all good so when I get
that<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.370> said<00:03:44.430> maybe<00:03:44.670> around<00:03:44.880> the

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
that like I said maybe around the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.880 
that like I said maybe around the
christmas<00:03:45.420> new<00:03:45.720> year<00:03:45.930> time<00:03:46.170> it's<00:03:46.739> probably

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
christmas new year time it's probably

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.860 
christmas new year time it's probably
the<00:03:47.100> perfect<00:03:47.370> time<00:03:47.820> for<00:03:48.030> me<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.270> be<00:03:48.420> honest<00:03:48.660> and

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the perfect time for me to be honest and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.140 
the perfect time for me to be honest and
then<00:03:49.350> i<00:03:49.380> can<00:03:49.709> get<00:03:49.950> edit<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.700> stuff<00:03:50.880> so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
then i can get edit on that and stuff so

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.610 
then i can get edit on that and stuff so
that<00:03:51.360> will<00:03:51.780> be<00:03:51.870> like<00:03:52.050> i<00:03:52.110> was<00:03:52.260> mentioning

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
that will be like i was mentioning

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.110 
that will be like i was mentioning
before<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:53.010> style<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.400> videos<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.940> will<00:03:54.000> be

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
before the style of videos it will be

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.790 
before the style of videos it will be
the<00:03:54.209> same<00:03:54.360> playing<00:03:54.720> games<00:03:54.959> live<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.440> kind<00:03:55.739> of

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
the same playing games live and kind of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.710 
the same playing games live and kind of
late<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.280> fee<00:03:56.489> 14<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.060> well<00:03:57.209> when<00:03:57.300> I<00:03:57.390> did<00:03:57.690> that

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
late in fee 14 as well when I did that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.420 
late in fee 14 as well when I did that
Newcastle<00:03:58.560> career<00:03:58.800> mode<00:03:58.950> if<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.160> remember

Newcastle career mode if you remember
that<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.850> i<00:04:00.060> guess<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.570> can<00:04:00.630> leave

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
probably record it like pre-record it

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.110 
probably record it like pre-record it
until<00:04:07.110> then<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:07.590> then<00:04:08.340> obviously<00:04:08.580> start

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
until then and then obviously start

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.729 
until then and then obviously start
editing<00:04:09.450> when<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.630> get<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.840> new<00:04:10.019> computer<00:04:10.200> so
