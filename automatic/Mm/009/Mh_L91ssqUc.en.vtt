now<00:01:01.070> my<00:01:02.070> theory<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.969> well<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.870> took<00:01:04.170> place<00:01:04.199> in

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
now my theory as well this took place in

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
now my theory as well this took place in
Louisiana<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.590> more<00:01:07.590> than<00:01:07.830> likely<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.760> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
Louisiana so more than likely it was a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.539 
Louisiana so more than likely it was a
voodoo<00:01:09.330> priest<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> Buddha<00:01:11.040> priest<00:01:11.310> was

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
voodoo priest and the Buddha priest was

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.240 
voodoo priest and the Buddha priest was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
could reach his tainted place and topple

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
could reach his tainted place and topple
the<00:01:54.180> dark<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> dark<00:01:54.990> master<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.009> place

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the dark the dark master of that place

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.679 
the dark the dark master of that place
wherever<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.329> may<00:01:57.509> be

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
wherever that may be

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.749 
wherever that may be
I<00:01:57.930> mean<00:01:58.469> that's<00:01:58.619> probably<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.979> only<00:01:59.280> logical

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
I mean that's probably the only logical

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.920 
I mean that's probably the only logical
explanation<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.509> mean<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.200> had<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.189> been

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
explanation I mean it had to have been

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.319 
explanation I mean it had to have been
it<00:02:03.930> can't<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.740> had<00:02:04.890> open<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.399> had<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.210> have

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
it can't be it had open that had to have

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:06.820 
it can't be it had open that had to have
been<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
been that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.820 
been that
because<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.190> could<00:02:07.430> not<00:02:07.760> have<00:02:08.000> possibly<00:02:08.680> to<00:02:09.680> do

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
because it could not have possibly to do

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.090 
because it could not have possibly to do
anything<00:02:10.520> with<00:02:10.940> bad<00:02:11.270> or<00:02:11.690> negligent<00:02:12.470> parenting

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
anything with bad or negligent parenting

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.880 
anything with bad or negligent parenting
because<00:02:13.670> well<00:02:14.090> bad<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.080> negligent<00:02:15.500> parenting

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
because well bad and negligent parenting

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.150 
because well bad and negligent parenting
just<00:02:16.220> doesn't<00:02:17.000> exist
