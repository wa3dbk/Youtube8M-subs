00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 they spotted 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.570
 we went through a stage of 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.850
 presentation of photos and others and we 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.710
 had the great chance to be 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.879
 selected for this challenge is here 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.020
 you have a production team with 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.699
 you on the back for two days which 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.899
 do everything you do with it all 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.719
 Coptic press that everything we do 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 but an absolutely adorable team so 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.899
 we do not really feel we want 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.830
 to show his house the whole France 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.939
 it's a question I push myself as 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.260
 since just now we want that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.030
 everyone sees what's in the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.350
 living room the kitchen the rooms it arises 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000
 not in these terms make it a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.250
 new start this is not a desire to 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.860
 show what's everywhere it's true 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.020
 we were asked for it and then that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.150
 starts small by a picture after it's 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.170
 a little movie is someone we are 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.799
 so proud of what we did 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.420
 want to 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.700
 no it's not your pride i think the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 people want to have duty and here we go 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 respond to their asking them in their 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.820
 presenting our house simply 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.229
 what is a special this house I 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.250
 do not know this is something 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.829
 special let's say it's a little bit 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.960
 to be a little revised and corrected we have 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.600
 we wanted to keep a little bit 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.250
 Alsatian authenticity but in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 modernizing a little bit so we're 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 not stay in the dark studs on 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.820
 did not stay in the dark wood at 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.729
 inside we're almost gone on a 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.020
 little style a bit just to come so I 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.640
 think that's what differentiates it a 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 little bit and that makes only one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.219
 some curiosity about our 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.350
 House 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.330
 the principle is still to call 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.850
 actually vote it happens 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.690
