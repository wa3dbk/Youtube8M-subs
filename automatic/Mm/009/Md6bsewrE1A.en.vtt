00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.800
 Hello everyone, I’m a tap and today we 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.870
 look at a small such bug 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.570
 glitches custom map mines with 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.570
 lower respawn on the example tank fcm and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.060
 this map mines the lowest respawn and the whole 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.700
 our task is the beginning of the battle is to be 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.989
 on some more or less quick 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.059
 tanks and take square c9 there is 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.019
 wonderful bush about which we are now 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.179
 just talk in more detail on 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.319
 in principle, any tanks even on such 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:49.390
 huge as in cm but I will immediately say that 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.219
 That peak let this tactic 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.319
 a little harder to do because there 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.089
 the gun does not bend at all and as we see 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.909
 just drive up the bush shoot to 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.649
 destroy this little shed that will 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.659
 prevent us from being shot through right away 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.519
 see us immediately flash and 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:06.340
 shoot through absolutely with ease and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.320
 here on me they are already shooting blind 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.430
 there is light already passed but they saw 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 me and bummed on abum and fall and 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.760
 then we look at what position is 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.650
 engaged in this position see that here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.290
 there is a bush here there is a stone and 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.740
 small bald spot between 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.010
 look between stone and custom up to 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.110
 seemingly enough distance to 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.810
 the bush has become opaque and that means that 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 we do not eat masked when fired 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.290
 and I want to say that in the patch 086 rather 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.660
 in total this place will no longer be relevant 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.450
 because the light system is not light 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.370
 about masking bushes change but now 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.620
 tactic works perfect see what 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.560
 super first ride like the total distance 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.100
 only up to 200 kopecks meters we stand 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.530
 on such a huge tanks in cm like 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.020
 would yes there is again this gap between 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.090
 bush and stone such clearance but even 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.280
 if enemy tanks will be right here 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.619
 go and it would seem one hundred percent should 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.840
 enlighten us but no tank here 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.489
 shines he stands we stand shoot then 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.819
 there is absolutely everything shot under 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.410
 as we see it slides over houses 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.530
 without much difficulty 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.490
 and for the light there are no enemies in shock 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.200
 such coefficient 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.530
 doesn't even shine on a little bit 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.560
 repeat harder and so the tactic works 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:37.240
 well, 70 percent to 75 percent of cases 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.330
 up to 225 punctures happen so if the enemies 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.340
 it is the village that will be crushed 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.230
 Well, still a small drawback if the enemies do not 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.930
 stand here in that square under 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.520
 the city to i'll start stopping by a bit further and 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.260
 and they will be hidden behind houses but in 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.070
 either way you're here in save you here 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.440
 nobody shines 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.120
 art also throws but again you can 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.720
 tucked under a stone if that or 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.270
 slide down here is a very cool place 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.830
 I advise everyone to use it but also not 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.260
 forget to glance because here 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.910
 here, too, can pass the bullshit highlight 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.860
 you and generally not bad 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.560
 the developers generally burned what exactly 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.780
 here are these 15 meters from the bush hotel in any 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.300
 beach cases, there’s more to come 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.490
 it turns out the thing is worth and pocky but 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.520
 still hides you perfectly on any 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.240
 barn so enjoy enjoy 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.890
 win 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.180
 good luck to everyone in random place put like if
