card series I in this section I will

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.960 
card series I in this section I will
talk<00:00:18.660> about<00:00:18.780> data<00:00:19.410> wrangling<00:00:19.890> or<00:00:20.100> onset<00:00:20.760> data

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
talk about data wrangling or onset data

talk about data wrangling or onset data
management<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> very<00:00:22.350> important<00:00:22.770> job

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
for many di TS onset so it's important

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
for many di TS onset so it's important
to<00:00:25.349> have<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> right<00:00:25.770> tools<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.310> offload<00:00:27.060> data

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

macbook pro here to get the most speed

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.830 
macbook pro here to get the most speed
out<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.950> it<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:02.219> also<00:01:02.570> connectivity<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> other

out of it and also connectivity to other
hard<00:01:04.259> drives<00:01:04.559> etc<00:01:04.800> so<00:01:05.430> USB<00:01:06.330> 3<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.600> better<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> a

attached<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.509> my<00:01:09.570> computer<00:01:09.660> also<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> raid

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
attached to my computer also is a raid

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.249 
attached to my computer also is a raid
here<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> promise<00:01:12.240> Pegasus<00:01:12.750> raid<00:01:13.020> I

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
here this is a promise Pegasus raid I

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.990 
here this is a promise Pegasus raid I
think<00:01:14.009> it's<00:01:14.100> very<00:01:14.190> important<00:01:14.550> every<00:01:14.729> raid<00:01:14.850> on

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
think it's very important every raid on

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
think it's very important every raid on
set<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.840> much<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> would<00:01:16.289> give<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
set not so much that you would give it

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
set not so much that you would give it
into<00:01:16.800> post<00:01:17.039> as<00:01:17.310> much<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:17.940> it'll<00:01:18.300> be<00:01:18.390> able

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
into post as much as that it'll be able

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.430 
into post as much as that it'll be able
you<00:01:18.690> to<00:01:18.780> quickly<00:01:19.050> offload<00:01:19.709> a<00:01:20.300> card<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:22.289> it

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
you to quickly offload a card on to it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.559 
you to quickly offload a card on to it
and<00:01:22.590> then<00:01:23.069> later<00:01:23.369> copy<00:01:23.789> it<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.119> drive<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
and then later copy it to drive that

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.449 
and then later copy it to drive that

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:26.459 
would maybe go into post reason being

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:27.740 
would maybe go into post reason being
that<00:01:26.580> sometimes<00:01:27.179> you<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.479> turn

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that sometimes you have to just turn

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.020 
that sometimes you have to just turn
around<00:01:27.899> cards<00:01:28.380> quickly<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.950> having<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.700> small

might<00:01:31.679> give<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.039> could<00:01:33.030> slow<00:01:33.179> you<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
might give you could slow you down you
