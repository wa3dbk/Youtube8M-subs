now<00:01:00.100> it<00:01:00.519> seems<00:01:00.850> even<00:01:01.239> the<00:01:01.269> electrical<00:01:01.839> system

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
now it seems even the electrical system

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.560 
now it seems even the electrical system
is<00:01:02.440> no<00:01:02.620> longer<00:01:02.649> functioning<00:01:03.549> yeah

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
is no longer functioning yeah

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.649 
is no longer functioning yeah
it's<00:01:04.869> pitch<00:01:05.110> black<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.680> here<00:01:05.710> as<00:01:06.190> a<00:01:06.700> cyborg<00:01:07.360> I

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
it's pitch black in here as a cyborg I

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:18.840 
it's pitch black in here as a cyborg I
trust<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.440> is<00:01:08.649> not<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:08.860> serious<00:01:09.340> concern

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.929 

they<00:01:19.840> still<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.320> not<00:01:20.439> noticed<00:01:20.619> you<00:01:20.979> do<00:01:21.729> not

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
they still have not noticed you do not

00:01:21.939 --> 00:02:21.520 
they still have not noticed you do not
expose<00:01:22.509> yourself

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.140 

there<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> maintenance<00:02:23.099> shaft<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.819> ahead

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
there is a maintenance shaft up ahead

00:02:24.150 --> 00:03:42.809 
there is a maintenance shaft up ahead
use<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.200> return<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.920> surface

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.729 

right<00:03:43.819> it<00:03:44.390> would<00:03:44.629> appear<00:03:44.959> your<00:03:45.170> only<00:03:45.590> way

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
right it would appear your only way

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.580 
right it would appear your only way
forward<00:03:46.099> is<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.580> return<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.420> surface<00:03:47.660> you

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
forward is to return to the surface you

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.740 
forward is to return to the surface you
will<00:03:48.769> exit<00:03:49.160> into<00:03:49.459> an<00:03:49.580> evacuated<00:03:50.150> commercial

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
will exit into an evacuated commercial

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.230 
will exit into an evacuated commercial
district
