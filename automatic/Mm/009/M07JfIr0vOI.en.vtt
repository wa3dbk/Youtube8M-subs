00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.220 
things are a modern miracle boy can have
so<00:00:16.190> much<00:00:16.309> more<00:00:16.850> success<00:00:17.330> you<00:00:17.540> absolutely<00:00:17.990> and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
so much more success you absolutely and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.020 
so much more success you absolutely and
in<00:00:18.380> fact<00:00:18.560> I<00:00:18.680> first<00:00:18.950> learned<00:00:19.160> about<00:00:19.280> them<00:00:19.550> back

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.030 
in fact I first learned about them back

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.880 
in fact I first learned about them back
in<00:00:20.180> the<00:00:20.270> early<00:00:20.510> 90s<00:00:20.900> when<00:00:21.290> people<00:00:21.590> are<00:00:21.710> putting

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
in the early 90s when people are putting

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.590 
in the early 90s when people are putting
him<00:00:22.040> in<00:00:22.340> the<00:00:22.520> ground<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:22.940> then<00:00:23.060> putting<00:00:23.330> salt

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
him in the ground and then putting salt

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.390 
him in the ground and then putting salt
on<00:00:23.780> top<00:00:23.840> as<00:00:24.260> a<00:00:24.289> way<00:00:24.470> of<00:00:24.620> water<00:00:25.070> conservation

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
on top as a way of water conservation

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.950 
on top as a way of water conservation
for<00:00:25.940> golf<00:00:26.119> courses<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:26.660> I'll<00:00:26.750> introduce

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
for golf courses so I'll introduce

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.960 
for golf courses so I'll introduce
everybody<00:00:27.320> to<00:00:27.500> him<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:28.010> material<00:00:28.460> here<00:00:28.789> is<00:00:28.940> a

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
everybody to him the material here is a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.330 
everybody to him the material here is a
super<00:00:29.539> absorbent<00:00:30.080> polymer<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:30.949> so<00:00:31.220> these

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
super absorbent polymer and so these

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.069 
super absorbent polymer and so these
little<00:00:31.460> crystals<00:00:31.970> here<00:00:32.239> are<00:00:32.480> actually<00:00:33.050> a

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
little crystals here are actually a

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.800 
little crystals here are actually a
polymer<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.890> short<00:00:34.579> for<00:00:34.760> a<00:00:34.790> long<00:00:35.420> chain<00:00:35.780> of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:35.810 
polymer a short for a long chain of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.479 
polymer a short for a long chain of
molecules<00:00:35.930> and<00:00:36.650> consider<00:00:37.160> them<00:00:37.280> little

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
molecules and consider them little

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.010 
molecules and consider them little
sponges<00:00:37.970> so<00:00:38.149> as<00:00:38.210> soon<00:00:38.360> as<00:00:38.450> you<00:00:38.540> add<00:00:38.720> them<00:00:38.870> to

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
sponges so as soon as you add them to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.110 
sponges so as soon as you add them to
water<00:00:39.230> they<00:00:39.710> will<00:00:39.860> fluff<00:00:40.160> up<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:40.760> about<00:00:40.850> a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
water they will fluff up it's about a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.850 
water they will fluff up it's about a
half<00:00:41.329> hour<00:00:41.450> 45<00:00:41.989> minutes<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:42.410> they<00:00:42.739> will

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
half hour 45 minutes and they will

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.950 
half hour 45 minutes and they will
expand<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:43.790> about<00:00:43.940> a<00:00:44.000> pound<00:00:44.360> that<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:44.809> see

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
expand so about a pound that you see

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.389 
expand so about a pound that you see
here<00:00:45.140> about<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> pound<00:00:45.649> of<00:00:45.829> these<00:00:45.920> will<00:00:46.130> absorb

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
here about a pound of these will absorb

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.970 
here about a pound of these will absorb
about<00:00:46.760> 25<00:00:47.420> gallons<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.140> water<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:48.860> you

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
about 25 gallons of water and what you

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.470 
about 25 gallons of water and what you
get<00:00:49.220> take<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.430> look<00:00:49.610> at<00:00:49.670> this<00:00:49.790> when<00:00:50.210> you<00:00:50.300> feel

get take a look at this when you feel
inside<00:00:50.809> here<00:00:51.079> are<00:00:51.200> these<00:00:51.410> little<00:00:51.559> jelly<00:00:51.980> like

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
inside here are these little jelly like

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.610 
inside here are these little jelly like
crystals<00:00:52.730> just<00:00:53.300> amazing<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:54.200> doesn't<00:00:54.469> take<00:00:54.590> a

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
crystals just amazing it doesn't take a

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.380 
crystals just amazing it doesn't take a
lot<00:00:54.829> of<00:00:54.860> water<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.340> hydrate<00:00:55.460> them<00:00:55.880> no<00:00:56.210> it's

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
lot of water to hydrate them no it's

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.430 
lot of water to hydrate them no it's
always<00:00:56.510> kind<00:00:56.750> of<00:00:56.809> fun<00:00:56.870> when<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.260> do<00:00:57.350> it

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
then a handful of the crystals that go

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.139 
then a handful of the crystals that go
down<00:01:15.439> inside<00:01:15.799> go<00:01:16.279> inside<00:01:16.579> for<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.789> lemonade

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
down inside go inside for a lemonade

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.639 
down inside go inside for a lemonade
well<00:01:17.450> stirred<00:01:17.749> around<00:01:17.990> first<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.350> course<00:01:18.529> in

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
well stirred around first of course in

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.169 
well stirred around first of course in
go<00:01:18.740> inside<00:01:19.009> for<00:01:19.130> a<00:01:19.189> lemonade<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.670> voila<00:01:19.939> yeah

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
go inside for a lemonade and voila yeah

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.239 
go inside for a lemonade and voila yeah
there<00:01:20.479> they<00:01:20.689> are<00:01:20.719> now<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.439> secret<00:01:21.829> is<00:01:21.920> you<00:01:21.950> dig

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
there they are now the secret is you dig

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:23.889 
there they are now the secret is you dig
the<00:01:22.369> hole<00:01:22.399> for<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.880> plant<00:01:23.090> ahead<00:01:23.389> of<00:01:23.509> time<00:01:23.719> and

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
the hole for the plant ahead of time and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:24.969 
the hole for the plant ahead of time and
now<00:01:23.990> you've<00:01:24.139> got<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:24.380> mix<00:01:24.619> some<00:01:24.829> of<00:01:24.920> the

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
now you've got to mix some of the

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.069 
now you've got to mix some of the
crystals<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.700> ground<00:01:25.969> and<00:01:26.299> mix<00:01:26.840> them<00:01:26.959> with

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
crystals in the ground and mix them with

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.690 
crystals in the ground and mix them with
the<00:01:27.200> dirt<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:27.560> they<00:01:27.619> don't<00:01:27.829> go<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.069> top<00:01:28.279> but

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the dirt so they don't go on top but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.039 
the dirt so they don't go on top but
they<00:01:28.789> actually<00:01:28.939> mix<00:01:29.329> underneath<00:01:29.689> there<00:01:29.899> and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
they actually mix underneath there and

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.019 
they actually mix underneath there and
then<00:01:30.409> of<00:01:30.499> course<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.310> plant<00:01:31.609> goes<00:01:31.819> right

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029 
then of course the the plant goes right

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:33.459 
then of course the the plant goes right
underneath<00:01:32.329> there<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.689> pack<00:01:32.929> it<00:01:33.109> in<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
underneath there and you pack it in and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.980 
underneath there and you pack it in and
you<00:01:33.770> have<00:01:34.009> got<00:01:34.249> now<00:01:35.149> our<00:01:35.299> water<00:01:35.539> conservation

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
you have got now our water conservation

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.660 
you have got now our water conservation
kind<00:01:36.439> of<00:01:36.499> technique<00:01:36.920> there<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.279> you<00:01:37.369> can<00:01:37.490> see

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
kind of technique there that you can see

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.249 
kind of technique there that you can see
and<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.209> kind<00:01:38.389> of<00:01:38.420> goes<00:01:38.599> down<00:01:38.869> inside<00:01:39.139> the

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
and just kind of goes down inside the

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.199 
and just kind of goes down inside the
ground<00:01:39.469> so<00:01:39.950> it's<00:01:40.099> perfect<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:40.789> be<00:01:40.909> able<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.119> do

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
ground so it's perfect to be able to do

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:42.669 
ground so it's perfect to be able to do
it<00:01:41.359> but<00:01:41.450> you<00:01:41.630> can't<00:01:41.869> just<00:01:42.289> put<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.499> dry

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
it but you can't just put the dry

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.050 
it but you can't just put the dry
crystals<00:01:43.099> in<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> lot<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.639> people<00:01:43.880> we<00:01:43.939> get

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
crystals in so a lot of people we get

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.429 
crystals in so a lot of people we get
emails<00:01:44.450> where<00:01:44.630> people<00:01:44.840> just<00:01:44.990> sprinkle<00:01:45.319> in<00:01:45.409> the

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
emails where people just sprinkle in the

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.529 
emails where people just sprinkle in the
dry<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.709> can't<00:01:46.069> hydrator<00:01:46.579> literally<00:01:47.329> just

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
dry you can't hydrator literally just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.149 
dry you can't hydrator literally just
start<00:01:47.810> with<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.079> dirt<00:01:48.259> there<00:01:48.499> and<00:01:48.649> throw<00:01:49.039> in

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
start with the dirt there and throw in

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.379 
start with the dirt there and throw in
the<00:01:49.189> crystals<00:01:49.609> and<00:01:49.729> on<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.909> website<00:01:50.270> I've

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
the crystals and on the website I've

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:51.969 
the crystals and on the website I've
given<00:01:50.689> you<00:01:50.779> all<00:01:51.049> of<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.319> information<00:01:51.469> in

for<00:02:13.650> me<00:02:13.800> they<00:02:14.070> didn't<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.310> how<00:02:14.400> long<00:02:14.520> they

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
for me they didn't know how long they

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.070 
for me they didn't know how long they
would<00:02:14.790> last<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.540> they<00:02:15.630> didn't<00:02:15.780> realize<00:02:16.050> that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
would last and they didn't realize that

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.830 
would last and they didn't realize that

absolutely<00:02:18.840> well<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.320> you<00:02:19.440> want<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> get

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
absolutely well and if you want to get

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.780 
absolutely well and if you want to get
the<00:02:19.830> kids<00:02:20.010> involved<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:20.490> lots<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the kids involved there's lots of

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.040 
the kids involved there's lots of
teachers<00:02:21.060> out<00:02:21.240> there<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.630> using<00:02:21.780> them

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
teachers out there that are using them

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.540 
teachers out there that are using them
you<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.560> simply<00:02:22.800> take<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.130> put<00:02:23.250> some<00:02:23.400> food

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
you just simply take and put some food

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
you just simply take and put some food
coloring<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:24.150> with<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> water<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:25.080> put<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
coloring in with the water then put the

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.600 
coloring in with the water then put the
crystals<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.950> look<00:02:26.040> at<00:02:26.130> what<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.460> you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
crystals in and look at what you get you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.040 
crystals in and look at what you get you
get<00:02:26.730> these<00:02:26.910> three<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.630> see<00:02:27.780> over<00:02:28.020> here

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
get these three that you see over here

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.410 
get these three that you see over here
so<00:02:28.830> here<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.190> our<00:02:29.340> red<00:02:29.550> yellow<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:29.880> blue<00:02:30.300> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
so here is our red yellow and blue and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.150 
so here is our red yellow and blue and
so<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.050> primary<00:02:31.500> colors<00:02:31.800> like<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
so we just do primary colors like this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.920 
so we just do primary colors like this
and<00:02:32.430> now<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.180> build<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.660> color

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and now you can build the little color

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.510 
and now you can build the little color
rainbow<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.680> take<00:02:34.830> our<00:02:34.950> little<00:02:34.980> test<00:02:35.340> tubes

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
rainbow so we take our little test tubes

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.920 
rainbow so we take our little test tubes
and<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:35.940> jam<00:02:36.150> some<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.570> crystals

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and you just jam some of the crystals

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.330 
and you just jam some of the crystals
down<00:02:37.050> inside<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.830> we<00:02:37.920> start<00:02:38.100> with<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> little

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
down inside so we start with a little

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340 
down inside so we start with a little
yellow<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.090> then<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.270> mix<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.600> little<00:02:40.170> bit<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
yellow and then you mix a little bit of

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.690 
yellow and then you mix a little bit of
red<00:02:40.530> inside<00:02:40.890> there<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.250> finally<00:02:41.460> a<00:02:41.610> little

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
red inside there and finally a little

bit of blue you can see I'm really

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.930 
bit of blue you can see I'm really
really<00:02:43.920> careful<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.400> would<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.670> look<00:02:44.820> at

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
really careful but would you look at

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940 
really careful but would you look at
what<00:02:44.970> happens<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.630> it<00:02:45.750> is<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.380> as<00:02:46.500> soon<00:02:46.770> as

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
what happens with it is that as soon as

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.980 
what happens with it is that as soon as
they<00:02:47.130> touch<00:02:47.459> one<00:02:47.790> another<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.570> looks<00:02:48.840> like

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
they touch one another it looks like

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.660 
they touch one another it looks like
they're<00:02:49.140> mixing<00:02:49.470> not<00:02:49.650> yet<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:50.040> 24<00:02:50.520> hours

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
they're mixing not yet about 24 hours

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.160 
they're mixing not yet about 24 hours
and<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.030> literally<00:02:51.360> will<00:02:51.690> share<00:02:51.959> their

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
liquids back and forth so look at the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.890 
liquids back and forth so look at the
large<00:02:53.760> column<00:02:54.270> that<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.480> see<00:02:54.660> over<00:02:54.870> here
