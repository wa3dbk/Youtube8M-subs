00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
been testing it up on dev pro-indian

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.000 
been testing it up on dev pro-indian
ever<00:00:42.079> since<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.410> cars<00:00:42.620> were<00:00:42.770> made<00:00:42.890> available

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
ever since the cars were made available

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.760 
ever since the cars were made available
to<00:00:43.550> us<00:00:43.670> on<00:00:43.879> those<00:00:44.090> resources<00:00:44.690> I<00:00:45.050> was

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
to us on those resources I was

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
to us on those resources I was
definitely<00:00:45.920> thinking<00:00:46.100> about<00:00:46.370> picking<00:00:46.520> us<00:00:46.700> for

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
definitely thinking about picking us for

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.070 
definitely thinking about picking us for
the<00:00:46.880> cars<00:00:47.090> because<00:00:47.420> I<00:00:47.510> felt<00:00:47.750> like<00:00:47.780> it<00:00:47.960> would<00:00:48.020> be

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
the cars because I felt like it would be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.720 
the cars because I felt like it would be
somewhat<00:00:48.740> budget<00:00:49.100> considering<00:00:49.460> there's<00:00:49.610> only

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
somewhat budget considering there's only

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.370 
somewhat budget considering there's only
one<00:00:49.970> ultra<00:00:50.360> rare<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.630> one<00:00:50.750> super<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:51.350> the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
one ultra rare and one super and the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.290 
one ultra rare and one super and the
rest<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:51.980> cards<00:00:52.310> are<00:00:52.430> all<00:00:52.460> rares<00:00:52.880> in<00:00:53.180> that

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
rest of the cards are all rares in that

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.120 
rest of the cards are all rares in that
archetype<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:53.900> figured<00:00:54.230> it<00:00:54.530> can't<00:00:54.770> be<00:00:54.890> too

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
archetype so I figured it can't be too

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.100 
archetype so I figured it can't be too
expensive<00:00:55.490> plus<00:00:56.180> I<00:00:56.300> already<00:00:56.450> got<00:00:56.630> stuff<00:00:56.900> like

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110
