 hello everybody make another video that 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:10.840
 about the engine belt replacement 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:16.330
 point that jett similarity to the 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:22.990
 engine fire 1.3 and 1.0 16 alva galera 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:26.199
 basically the same engine system 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:34.019
 water pump has thought that the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:34.019
 support bracket that holds support 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.870
 that the same thing as the system 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:44.139
 which basically the same 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.190
 iacc the lagging tool that also 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:50.859
 is equal to where it hangs that the tip the command 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.260
 here did not give to the tool because 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:56.499
 gotta get the turbine bad guys 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.440
 but this system is the only difference is 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:02.519
 that I saw here is because they changed the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:07.090
 sql injection system uses coil here to 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.920

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.630
 coil that with the candle cables attached 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.140
 '' corners '' she was not even a coil 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.400
