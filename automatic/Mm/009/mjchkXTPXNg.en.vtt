leg they'll see in see in color so also
see<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.860> contrast<00:01:38.860> so<00:01:39.040> they<00:01:39.130> don't<00:01:39.340> actually

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
see in contrast so they don't actually

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.050 
see in contrast so they don't actually
see<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:42.159> yellow<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:42.640> just<00:01:42.820> see<00:01:42.909> that

to do is keep keep white a white fence

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.020 
to do is keep keep white a white fence
away<00:01:52.240> from<00:01:52.509> water<00:01:52.689> because<00:01:53.500> when<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:54.030> what

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
away from water because when the what

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.789 
away from water because when the what
you<00:01:55.119> can<00:01:55.240> see<00:01:55.420> there<00:01:55.659> when<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.350> see<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.649> light

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
you can see there when you see the light

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.889 
you can see there when you see the light
on<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.189> water<00:01:57.399> see<00:01:57.909> how<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.149> goes<00:01:58.299> sort<00:01:58.840> of

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
on the water see how it goes sort of

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.020 
on the water see how it goes sort of
white<00:01:59.079> then<00:01:59.799> if<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.009> put<00:02:00.219> a<00:02:00.250> white<00:02:00.490> rail<00:02:00.789> in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
white then if you put a white rail in

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.090 
white then if you put a white rail in
front<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.200> horses<00:02:02.560> don't<00:02:02.740> see<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
front of that the horses don't see the

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.039 
front of that the horses don't see the
contrast<00:02:03.520> between<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.090> white<00:02:04.270> on<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.750> water

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
contrast between the white on the water

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.770 
contrast between the white on the water
and<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:06.070> white<00:02:06.280> on<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.490> white<00:02:06.759> rail<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.630> then

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
and the white on the white rail and then

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.880 
and the white on the white rail and then
something<00:02:08.019> when<00:02:08.200> they<00:02:08.289> don't<00:02:08.410> read<00:02:08.679> it

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
something when they don't read it

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.199 
something when they don't read it
because<00:02:09.070> they<00:02:09.250> don't<00:02:09.459> read<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.789> contrast

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
because they don't read the contrast

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.849 
because they don't read the contrast
then<00:02:10.390> they<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.600> leave<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> legging<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.320> get

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:11.859 
then they can leave a legging and get

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.090 
then they can leave a legging and get
into<00:02:11.980> trouble<00:02:12.370> when<00:02:13.120> you've<00:02:13.269> had<00:02:13.329> a<00:02:14.100> problem

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
into trouble when you've had a problem

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.120 
into trouble when you've had a problem
or<00:02:15.609> a<00:02:16.120> difficult<00:02:16.600> fence<00:02:16.810> like<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.049> water<00:02:17.380> then

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
or a difficult fence like the water then

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.069 
or a difficult fence like the water then
give<00:02:18.340> them<00:02:18.430> an<00:02:18.519> easier<00:02:18.850> one<00:02:19.030> like<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> table

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
give them an easier one like the table

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:21.360 
give them an easier one like the table
back<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> trees<00:02:20.920> is<00:02:21.100> an<00:02:21.220> easy

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
back there in the trees is an easy

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.920 
back there in the trees is an easy
offense<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.570> sort<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.870> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
offense just to sort of get the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.640 
offense just to sort of get the
confidence<00:02:23.260> going<00:02:23.709> again<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.519> then<00:02:25.650> they

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
confidence going again and then they

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.930 
confidence going again and then they
come<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.070> these<00:02:27.250> two<00:02:27.880> angled<00:02:28.299> Barnes<00:02:29.049> here

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
come to these two angled Barnes here

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.280 
come to these two angled Barnes here
because<00:02:30.940> thread<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.480> eye<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> needle<00:02:31.930> there

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
because thread the eye of a needle there

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.059 
because thread the eye of a needle there
on<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.680> angle<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
on the angle and

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.959 
on the angle and
what<00:02:34.489> makes<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.939> difficult<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.629> that<00:02:35.659> the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:36.969 
what makes that difficult is that the

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.629 
what makes that difficult is that the
one<00:02:37.969> is<00:02:38.120> two<00:02:38.299> things<00:02:39.010> first<00:02:40.010> of<00:02:40.099> all<00:02:40.219> it's<00:02:40.430> down

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
one is two things first of all it's down

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.539 
one is two things first of all it's down
it's<00:02:40.969> down<00:02:41.420> hill<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.739> when<00:02:42.889> a<00:02:42.920> horse<00:02:43.099> jumps

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
it's down hill so when a horse jumps

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.879 
it's down hill so when a horse jumps
offense<00:02:43.879> you<00:02:44.420> know<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:45.049> comes<00:02:45.319> along<00:02:45.590> on<00:02:45.769> them

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
offense you know it comes along on them

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.920 
offense you know it comes along on them
on<00:02:46.069> the<00:02:46.579> flat<00:02:46.849> jumps<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.269> with<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.510> front<00:02:47.719> legs

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
on the flat jumps up with the front legs

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.720 
on the flat jumps up with the front legs
then<00:02:48.139> pushes<00:02:48.530> itself<00:02:48.829> over<00:02:49.129> with<00:02:49.280> with<00:02:49.639> the

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
then pushes itself over with with the

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.780 
then pushes itself over with with the
back<00:02:49.879> legs<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.340> when<00:02:52.340> you're<00:02:52.459> coming<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
back legs so that when you're coming a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.240 
back legs so that when you're coming a
little<00:02:52.879> bit<00:02:53.090> downhill<00:02:53.739> yeah<00:02:54.739> it's<00:02:55.010> more

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
little bit downhill yeah it's more

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.289 
little bit downhill yeah it's more
difficult<00:02:55.430> for<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:56.000> horse<00:02:56.209> to<00:02:57.790> push<00:02:58.790> up<00:02:58.969> but

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
difficult for the horse to push up but

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.080 
difficult for the horse to push up but
before<00:02:59.689> he<00:02:59.719> goes<00:03:00.500> across<00:03:00.739> but<00:03:01.700> also<00:03:01.879> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
before he goes across but also the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.209 
before he goes across but also the
converse<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.569> always<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.049> same<00:03:03.230> also<00:03:04.129> the

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
converse is always the same also the

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.250 
converse is always the same also the
same<00:03:04.400> way<00:03:04.519> they're<00:03:04.639> coming<00:03:04.879> up<00:03:04.999> hill<00:03:05.329> yeah

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
same way they're coming up hill yeah

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.869 
same way they're coming up hill yeah
that's<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.010> looks<00:03:07.310> big<00:03:07.549> from<00:03:07.760> us

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
that's all that looks big from us

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.369 
that's all that looks big from us
because<00:03:08.060> we<00:03:08.180> look<00:03:08.359> up<00:03:08.450> it<00:03:08.569> will<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.200> fence

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
because we look up it will see the fence

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.899 
because we look up it will see the fence
all<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.560> way<00:03:09.650> up<00:03:09.769> there<00:03:09.950> from<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.579> horse's

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
all the way up there from a horse's

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.300 
all the way up there from a horse's
point<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.239> view<00:03:11.359> it's<00:03:11.540> easier<00:03:11.959> because<00:03:12.310> coming

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
point of view it's easier because coming

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.550 
point of view it's easier because coming
up<00:03:13.489> hill<00:03:13.819> they're<00:03:14.719> already<00:03:15.049> in<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.319> right

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
up hill they're already in the right

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.819 
up hill they're already in the right
position<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.519> jump<00:03:17.359> the<00:03:17.449> fence<00:03:17.599> so<00:03:18.469> long<00:03:18.739> as

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
position to jump the fence so long as

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.050 
position to jump the fence so long as
like<00:03:19.189> a<00:03:19.219> track<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.549> long<00:03:19.639> as<00:03:19.699> you<00:03:19.760> got<00:03:19.849> enough

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
like a track of long as you got enough

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.599 
like a track of long as you got enough
revs<00:03:20.359> but<00:03:21.319> they<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.859> keep<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.280> they<00:03:22.430> don't

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
revs but they just keep going they don't

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.189 
revs but they just keep going they don't
have<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.819> push<00:03:23.000> off<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.480> much<00:03:23.599> with<00:03:23.840> them<00:03:23.959> with

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
have to push off so much with them with

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.470 
have to push off so much with them with
it<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.650> front<00:03:24.889> legs<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:26.209> other<00:03:26.359> thing

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
it with the front legs the other thing

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.119 
it with the front legs the other thing
is<00:03:26.510> when<00:03:26.719> you've<00:03:26.870> got<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:27.019> narrow<00:03:27.859> question

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
is when you've got a narrow question

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.179 
is when you've got a narrow question
like<00:03:28.549> that<00:03:28.579> so<00:03:29.389> you<00:03:29.480> where<00:03:29.829> where<00:03:30.829> predators

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
like that so you where where predators

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.740 
like that so you where where predators
we<00:03:31.489> have<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.760> eyes<00:03:31.879> on<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.269> front<00:03:32.480> of<00:03:32.599> our

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
we have the eyes on the front of our

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.439 
we have the eyes on the front of our
face<00:03:33.560> so<00:03:34.159> we<00:03:34.340> can<00:03:34.489> focus<00:03:35.409> and<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.239> horse

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
face so we can focus and but the horse

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.390 
face so we can focus and but the horse
is<00:03:38.599> a<00:03:38.629> prey<00:03:38.900> animal<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.409> has<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.680> high<00:03:39.829> eyes<00:03:40.129> on

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
is a prey animal it has the high eyes on

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.610 
is a prey animal it has the high eyes on
the<00:03:40.549> side<00:03:40.759> of<00:03:40.909> its<00:03:41.030> face<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.900> sees<00:03:42.169> front

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
the side of its face so it sees front

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.379 
the side of its face so it sees front
and<00:03:42.739> back<00:03:42.829> so<00:03:43.729> when<00:03:43.849> it's<00:03:43.970> coming<00:03:44.120> down<00:03:44.329> to

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
and back so when it's coming down to

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.439 
and back so when it's coming down to
jump<00:03:44.750> this<00:03:44.840> fence<00:03:44.900> out<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:46.009> the<00:03:46.069> right<00:03:46.280> eye

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449 
jump this fence out of the right eye

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.969 
jump this fence out of the right eye
it'll<00:03:47.449> see<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.780> right<00:03:47.989> white<00:03:48.319> flag<00:03:48.620> in<00:03:48.889> the

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979 
it'll see the right white flag in the

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.580 
it'll see the right white flag in the
trees<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.609> offense<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:51.079> I've<00:03:51.169> his<00:03:51.290> left

go here when it's much easier to go to
the<00:04:02.449> grass<00:04:02.659> field<00:04:02.959> I'm<00:04:03.590> seeing<00:04:03.889> out<00:04:04.009> of<00:04:04.129> my

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:04.189 
the grass field I'm seeing out of my

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.179 
the grass field I'm seeing out of my
left<00:04:04.370> eye<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:05.470> that's<00:04:06.470> what<00:04:06.620> makes<00:04:06.799> them<00:04:07.009> the

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
left eye and that's what makes them the

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:09.039 
left eye and that's what makes them the
narrow<00:04:07.489> fences<00:04:07.879> and<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.060> angles<00:04:08.419> more

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
narrow fences and the angles more

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.569 
narrow fences and the angles more
difficult<00:04:09.530> from<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.739> horses<00:04:10.069> perspective

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
difficult from the horses perspective

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.110 
difficult from the horses perspective
yeah<00:04:11.109> so<00:04:12.109> after<00:04:13.009> the<00:04:13.099> body<00:04:13.280> had<00:04:13.489> an<00:04:13.609> easy<00:04:13.759> fence

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
yeah so after the body had an easy fence

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.210 
yeah so after the body had an easy fence
out<00:04:14.329> in<00:04:14.449> the<00:04:14.540> country<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.620> then<00:04:15.769> they<00:04:15.859> come<00:04:15.889> to

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
out in the country and then they come to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.110 
out in the country and then they come to
them<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:18.130> water<00:04:19.130> probably<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.579> water<00:04:19.729> here

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
them the water probably the water here

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.610 
them the water probably the water here
is<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.299> focal<00:04:20.659> point<00:04:20.870> principally<00:04:21.530> because

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
is the focal point principally because

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.770 
is the focal point principally because
of<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.889> hill<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.219> the<00:04:22.310> spectators<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.909> so

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
of the hill and the spectators and so

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.120 
of the hill and the spectators and so
from<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:24.020> sort<00:04:24.199> of<00:04:24.229> course<00:04:24.440> design<00:04:24.740> point<00:04:25.039> of

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
from a sort of course design point of

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.390 
from a sort of course design point of
view<00:04:25.190> you've<00:04:25.969> tried<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.210> sort<00:04:26.539> of<00:04:27.159> put<00:04:28.159> as<00:04:28.280> many

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
view you've tried to sort of put as many

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.120 
view you've tried to sort of put as many
fans<00:04:28.699> as<00:04:28.849> you<00:04:29.479> can<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.139> sort<00:04:30.349> of<00:04:30.409> in<00:04:30.949> the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
fans as you can in the sort of in the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.159 
fans as you can in the sort of in the
focal<00:04:31.460> area<00:04:31.789> for<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.330> spectators<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:33.020> they

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
focal area for the spectators so they

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.680 
focal area for the spectators so they
can<00:04:33.349> see<00:04:33.560> as<00:04:34.340> many<00:04:34.580> fences<00:04:34.849> as<00:04:35.120> possible<00:04:35.570> from

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
can see as many fences as possible from

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.850 
can see as many fences as possible from
one<00:04:35.870> one<00:04:36.259> spot<00:04:36.849> so<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:38.380> they<00:04:39.380> come<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.740> and

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
one one spot so the they come in and

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.040 
one one spot so the they come in and
they<00:04:39.949> jump<00:04:40.159> the<00:04:40.280> two<00:04:40.430> fish<00:04:40.780> with<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.870> blue

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
they jump the two fish with the blue

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.700 
they jump the two fish with the blue
signs<00:04:42.860> on<00:04:43.099> them<00:04:43.219> in<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.210> first<00:04:44.479> water<00:04:44.719> but

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
signs on them in that first water but

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.290 
signs on them in that first water but
the<00:04:45.800> horses<00:04:46.010> won't<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:46.460> that<00:04:46.639> as<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.789> fish<00:04:47.060> the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
the horses won't see that as a fish the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.910 
the horses won't see that as a fish the
horses<00:04:47.599> would

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
horses would

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.580 
horses would
see<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.220> as<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.720> as<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.930> law<00:04:50.110> goes<00:04:50.320> another

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
see that as a as the law goes another

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.710 
see that as a as the law goes another
piece<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:51.040> piece<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.430> wood<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.390> anyway<00:04:52.600> they

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
piece of piece of wood so anyway they

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.440 
piece of piece of wood so anyway they
jump<00:04:53.160> 11<00:04:54.160> fish<00:04:54.370> they've<00:04:54.580> got<00:04:54.730> seven<00:04:55.090> strides

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
jump 11 fish they've got seven strides

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.450 
jump 11 fish they've got seven strides
then<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.330> next<00:04:58.480> fish<00:04:59.460> when

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
then to the to the to the next fish when

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.570 
then to the to the to the next fish when
you<00:05:00.490> get<00:05:00.700> a<00:05:00.730> sequence<00:05:01.630> of<00:05:01.750> fences<00:05:02.110> like<00:05:02.290> this

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
you get a sequence of fences like this

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.580 
you get a sequence of fences like this
the<00:05:03.580> if<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.570> make<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> mistake<00:05:04.810> at<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.350> first

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
the if you make a mistake at the first

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.850 
the if you make a mistake at the first
one<00:05:06.120> it's<00:05:07.170> going<00:05:08.170> to<00:05:08.290> catch<00:05:08.440> up<00:05:08.620> with<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.800> a

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
one it's going to catch up with you a

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.260 
one it's going to catch up with you a
bit<00:05:08.890> like<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.220> golf<00:05:09.400> shot<00:05:09.640> he's<00:05:09.940> making<00:05:10.150> bad

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
bit like the golf shot he's making bad

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.350 
bit like the golf shot he's making bad
cop<00:05:10.510> shot<00:05:10.750> it's<00:05:11.380> two<00:05:12.130> or<00:05:12.190> three<00:05:12.370> strikeouts

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
cop shot it's two or three strikeouts

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.670 
cop shot it's two or three strikeouts
later<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:13.750> make<00:05:13.900> your<00:05:14.050> bogey<00:05:14.230> or<00:05:14.440> whatever

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
later you make your bogey or whatever

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.350 
later you make your bogey or whatever
whatever<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:17.580> because<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.700> that's

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
whatever it is so the because the that's

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.810 
whatever it is so the because the that's
why<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.540> riders<00:05:20.050> are<00:05:20.170> walk<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.500> course<00:05:20.820> two

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
why the riders are walk the course two

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.540 
why the riders are walk the course two
or<00:05:21.940> three<00:05:22.180> times<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:24.070> they<00:05:24.190> walk<00:05:24.400> to

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
or three times and like they walk to

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.430 
or three times and like they walk to
love<00:05:24.700> them<00:05:24.880> rip<00:05:25.000> watch<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.300> yesterday<00:05:25.600> just<00:05:26.380> to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
love them rip watch it yesterday just to

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.430 
love them rip watch it yesterday just to
get<00:05:26.650> an<00:05:26.770> overview<00:05:27.070> of<00:05:27.340> what<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.820> feel<00:05:28.420> of<00:05:28.450> it<00:05:28.750> and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
get an overview of what a feel of it and

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.290 
get an overview of what a feel of it and
then<00:05:29.650> they'll<00:05:30.370> walk<00:05:30.550> it<00:05:30.700> again<00:05:30.910> today<00:05:31.060> and

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
then they'll walk it again today and

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.380 
then they'll walk it again today and
tomorrow<00:05:31.630> two<00:05:32.410> more<00:05:32.650> strategize<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:34.120> course

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
tomorrow two more strategize the course

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.780 
tomorrow two more strategize the course
so<00:05:35.050> they<00:05:35.080> know<00:05:35.350> exactly<00:05:35.470> which<00:05:36.070> part<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.580> which

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
so they know exactly which part of which

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.460 
so they know exactly which part of which
fence<00:05:37.060> they're<00:05:37.270> going<00:05:37.420> to<00:05:37.510> jump<00:05:37.720> at<00:05:38.260> what

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
fence they're going to jump at what

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.010 
fence they're going to jump at what
angle<00:05:38.680> at<00:05:39.070> which<00:05:39.100> speed<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:40.360> order<00:05:40.630> to<00:05:40.840> set

also<00:05:58.840> it<00:05:59.280> creates<00:06:00.280> an<00:06:00.760> element<00:06:01.180> of

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
also it creates an element of

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.860 
also it creates an element of
uncertainty<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:03.010> then<00:06:03.190> you<00:06:04.150> have<00:06:04.300> to<00:06:04.360> attack

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
uncertainty and then you have to attack

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.990 
uncertainty and then you have to attack
up<00:06:05.080> the<00:06:05.230> hill<00:06:05.410> then<00:06:06.100> always<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.580> worry<00:06:06.790> is

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
up the hill then always the worry is

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.540 
up the hill then always the worry is
when<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.240> jump<00:06:07.480> up<00:06:07.600> a<00:06:07.690> step<00:06:08.190> because<00:06:09.190> that<00:06:09.370> the

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
when you jump up a step because that the

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.310 
when you jump up a step because that the
horses<00:06:09.970> don't<00:06:10.120> have<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.390> stride<00:06:10.750> between<00:06:11.230> the

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
horses don't have a stride between the

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.190 
horses don't have a stride between the
step<00:06:11.530> in<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:11.770> house<00:06:11.950> so<00:06:12.960> when<00:06:13.960> they<00:06:14.050> don't

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
step in the house so when they don't

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.010 
step in the house so when they don't
have<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.440> stride<00:06:14.800> they<00:06:15.580> have<00:06:15.730> to<00:06:15.850> land<00:06:16.180> and<00:06:16.840> take

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
have a stride they have to land and take

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.230 
have a stride they have to land and take
off<00:06:17.230> again<00:06:17.410> with<00:06:17.740> the<00:06:17.860> front<00:06:18.070> feet<00:06:18.340> before<00:06:18.940> the

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
off again with the front feet before the

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.660 
off again with the front feet before the
back<00:06:19.540> feet<00:06:19.810> touch<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.080> ground<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:21.580> you

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
back feet touch the ground and if you

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.930 
back feet touch the ground and if you
think<00:06:21.910> about<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.240> that<00:06:23.070> that<00:06:24.070> makes<00:06:24.820> the

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
think about that that that makes the

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.690 
think about that that that makes the
horse<00:06:25.030> an<00:06:25.240> amazing<00:06:25.720> amazing<00:06:26.500> athlete<00:06:27.100> that

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
horse an amazing amazing athlete that

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.760 
horse an amazing amazing athlete that
they<00:06:27.850> can<00:06:28.000> land<00:06:28.930> on<00:06:29.110> their<00:06:29.260> front<00:06:29.380> legs<00:06:29.560> and

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
they can land on their front legs and

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.890 
they can land on their front legs and
take<00:06:29.920> off<00:06:30.070> again<00:06:30.220> before<00:06:31.090> the<00:06:31.450> back<00:06:31.660> feet

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
take off again before the back feet

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:39.640 
take off again before the back feet
touch<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.350> touch<00:06:32.590> the<00:06:32.620> ground

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.650 

you

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660 
you

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.120 
you
with<00:06:41.960> the<00:06:42.050> Trickett<00:06:42.380> that<00:06:42.530> with<00:06:42.830> the<00:06:42.920> trick

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130 
with the Trickett that with the trick

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.710 
with the Trickett that with the trick
here<00:06:43.460> is<00:06:43.520> obviously<00:06:44.000> when<00:06:44.120> you<00:06:44.180> come<00:06:44.330> down<00:06:44.510> the

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
here is obviously when you come down the

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.710 
here is obviously when you come down the
slope<00:06:44.960> that's<00:06:45.200> quite<00:06:45.670> that's<00:06:46.670> quite<00:06:47.450> steep

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
slope that's quite that's quite steep

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.790 
slope that's quite that's quite steep
there<00:06:47.900> for<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.080> horses<00:06:48.260> to<00:06:48.350> go<00:06:48.440> to<00:06:48.500> be<00:06:48.620> going

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
there for the horses to go to be going

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.430 
there for the horses to go to be going
quite<00:06:48.920> slowly<00:06:49.570> but<00:06:50.570> this<00:06:50.810> is<00:06:50.930> quite<00:06:51.050> a<00:06:51.140> long

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
quite slowly but this is quite a long

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.200 
quite slowly but this is quite a long
distance<00:06:51.890> so<00:06:52.400> what<00:06:52.580> the<00:06:52.670> riders<00:06:52.970> will<00:06:53.120> be

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.210 
distance so what the riders will be

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.870 
distance so what the riders will be
doing<00:06:53.480> is<00:06:53.600> is<00:06:53.870> coming<00:06:54.440> here<00:06:54.850> thinking<00:06:55.850> about

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
doing is is coming here thinking about

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.290 
doing is is coming here thinking about
that<00:06:56.750> I<00:06:57.020> want<00:06:57.770> to<00:06:57.860> get<00:06:57.920> my<00:06:58.040> horse<00:06:58.250> to<00:06:58.460> land<00:06:58.640> to

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 
that I want to get my horse to land to

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.390 
that I want to get my horse to land to
land<00:06:59.420> somewhere<00:06:59.810> here<00:07:00.200> and<00:07:00.860> then<00:07:01.040> they<00:07:01.160> then

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 
land somewhere here and then they then

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.810 
land somewhere here and then they then
they're<00:07:01.520> going<00:07:01.640> to<00:07:01.730> go<00:07:02.230> two<00:07:03.230> three<00:07:03.950> four<00:07:04.400> one

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
they're going to go two three four one

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:18.010 
they're going to go two three four one
two<00:07:05.890> I<00:07:13.720> finished<00:07:14.720> up<00:07:15.760> here<00:07:16.760> well<00:07:17.600> I<00:07:17.630> don't<00:07:17.720> want

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
two I finished up here well I don't want

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.080 
two I finished up here well I don't want
to<00:07:18.110> finish<00:07:18.260> out<00:07:18.530> here<00:07:18.890> because<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.460> way<00:07:19.550> if<00:07:19.970> I

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
to finish out here because the way if I

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.510 
to finish out here because the way if I
get<00:07:20.300> to<00:07:20.420> this<00:07:20.570> place<00:07:20.780> yeah<00:07:21.260> it's<00:07:22.070> easier<00:07:22.490> for

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
get to this place yeah it's easier for

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.040 
get to this place yeah it's easier for
the<00:07:22.730> horse<00:07:22.910> to<00:07:23.000> go<00:07:23.210> there<00:07:23.480> then<00:07:23.690> it's<00:07:23.810> just<00:07:23.870> to

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.050 
the horse to go there then it's just to

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.610 
the horse to go there then it's just to
go<00:07:24.170> here<00:07:24.580> if<00:07:25.580> I<00:07:25.670> can<00:07:25.790> get<00:07:25.880> to<00:07:26.030> this<00:07:26.180> place<00:07:26.620> it's

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
go here if I can get to this place it's

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.110 
go here if I can get to this place it's
now<00:07:27.800> easier<00:07:28.220> for<00:07:28.400> the<00:07:28.460> horse<00:07:28.610> to<00:07:28.670> jump<00:07:29.000> now

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
now easier for the horse to jump now

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.380 
now easier for the horse to jump now
just<00:07:29.360> to<00:07:29.450> go<00:07:29.540> run<00:07:29.720> around<00:07:30.110> the<00:07:30.890> side<00:07:31.150> so<00:07:32.150> that's

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390 
just to go run around the side so that's

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.140 
just to go run around the side so that's
the<00:07:32.450> puzzle<00:07:32.870> that<00:07:32.900> time<00:07:33.230> to<00:07:33.440> have<00:07:34.310> it<00:07:34.460> given

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.150 
the puzzle that time to have it given

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.990 
the puzzle that time to have it given
the<00:07:35.270> slow<00:07:35.540> speed<00:07:36.020> down<00:07:36.500> there<00:07:36.770> how<00:07:37.610> are<00:07:37.670> you<00:07:37.850> be

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 
the slow speed down there how are you be

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.550 
the slow speed down there how are you be
going<00:07:38.180> to<00:07:38.240> make<00:07:38.360> up<00:07:38.540> the<00:07:38.660> extra<00:07:38.990> yard<00:07:39.170> to<00:07:39.440> get

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 
going to make up the extra yard to get

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.910 
going to make up the extra yard to get
here<00:07:39.950> to<00:07:40.270> minimize<00:07:41.270> the<00:07:41.480> risk<00:07:41.690> of<00:07:41.870> the<00:07:42.050> of<00:07:42.800> the

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:42.920 
here to minimize the risk of the of the

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.770 
here to minimize the risk of the of the
glance<00:07:43.130> off<00:07:43.340> that's<00:07:44.180> the<00:07:44.360> sort<00:07:44.540> of<00:07:44.570> strategy

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 
glance off that's the sort of strategy

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.300 
glance off that's the sort of strategy
that's<00:07:45.310> was<00:07:46.310> going<00:07:46.580> on<00:07:46.670> in<00:07:46.820> the<00:07:46.880> riders<00:07:47.150> head
