00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:26.589 
much some new ones so we take the handle

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
here just like this

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.210 
here just like this
and<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:31.269> should<00:00:31.900> be<00:00:31.989> pointing<00:00:32.380> like<00:00:32.470> this<00:00:32.529> most

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
and it should be pointing like this most

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.470 
and it should be pointing like this most
of<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:33.340> time<00:00:33.460> sometimes<00:00:34.150> when<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.329> door

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
person who did the job puts it in this

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.500 
person who did the job puts it in this
way<00:00:38.920> but<00:00:39.520> it's<00:00:39.640> either<00:00:39.730> this<00:00:39.910> way<00:00:40.149> or<00:00:40.180> this<00:00:40.359> way

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
way but it's either this way or this way

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.029 
way but it's either this way or this way
you<00:00:40.809> call<00:00:40.989> ways<00:00:41.079> peek<00:00:41.260> back<00:00:41.410> here<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:41.890> see

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
you call ways peek back here and see

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.650 
you call ways peek back here and see
which<00:00:42.190> way<00:00:42.340> it's<00:00:42.460> pointing<00:00:42.609> this<00:00:43.359> one<00:00:43.539> is

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
which way it's pointing this one is

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.439 
which way it's pointing this one is
pointing<00:00:43.809> like<00:00:43.989> this<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:45.190> no<00:00:45.879> trick<00:00:46.180> and<00:00:46.359> I

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
pointing like this so no trick and I

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.400 
pointing like this so no trick and I
take<00:00:46.690> this<00:00:46.870> off<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.760> take<00:00:48.940> your<00:00:49.000> rag<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
take this off you take your rag you

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.720 
take this off you take your rag you
start<00:00:50.710> from<00:00:50.859> the<00:00:50.949> middle<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:56.460> put<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.579> in

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
start from the middle and put it in

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.229 
start from the middle and put it in
there<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.269> also<00:00:58.449> tool<00:00:58.809> for<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.140> but<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:01.059> DI

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
there it also tool for this but the DI

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.290 
there it also tool for this but the DI
wire<00:01:01.539> it's<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.140> best<00:01:02.350> way<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.530> do<00:01:02.739> it<00:01:02.859> and<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
wire it's the best way to do it and you

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.120 
wire it's the best way to do it and you
just<00:01:04.920> pop<00:01:05.920> right<00:01:05.950> out<00:01:08.130> just<00:01:09.130> like<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.880> man

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
just pop right out just like that man

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.620 
just pop right out just like that man
and<00:01:12.130> I<00:01:12.220> just<00:01:12.490> pop<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:12.880> out<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.729> okay<00:01:16.420> take

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
and I just pop this out and okay take

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.219 
and I just pop this out and okay take
that<00:01:16.659> out<00:01:18.149> didn't<00:01:19.149> have<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.360> put<00:01:19.509> the<00:01:19.689> door

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229

with the splines in here

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.550 
with the splines in here
just<00:01:43.630> by<00:01:43.719> turning<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:44.079> little<00:01:44.170> bit<00:01:44.290> once<00:01:44.500> you
