this<00:00:31.230> even<00:00:31.410> possible<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> wonder<00:00:32.820> if

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
this even possible you wonder if

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.370 
this even possible you wonder if
stacking<00:00:33.329> items<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.780> such<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> good<00:00:34.200> idea

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
stacking items with such a good idea

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.530

after<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.520> truth<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> much<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.360> than

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
after all but in truth is much more than

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.030 
after all but in truth is much more than
that<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:37.140> you're<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.649> layer<00:00:37.829> you're
