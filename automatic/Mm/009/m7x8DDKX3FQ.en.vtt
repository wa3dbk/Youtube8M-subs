00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.250 

I<00:00:03.120> mean<00:00:04.120> what<00:00:04.270> was<00:00:04.450> the<00:00:04.480> reason<00:00:04.900> behind<00:00:04.930> doing

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.260 
I mean what was the reason behind doing

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.490 
I mean what was the reason behind doing
the<00:00:05.590> same<00:00:05.770> time<00:00:06.069> at<00:00:06.370> probably<00:00:07.359> name<00:00:07.720> one<00:00:07.750> okay

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
the same time at probably name one okay

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.040 
the same time at probably name one okay
so<00:00:08.860> there<00:00:09.070> they<00:00:09.430> are<00:00:09.599> similar<00:00:10.599> looking<00:00:10.900> at

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 
so there they are similar looking at

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.560 
so there they are similar looking at
first<00:00:11.320> glance<00:00:11.590> of<00:00:11.890> course<00:00:12.130> and<00:00:12.520> the<00:00:13.120> reason<00:00:13.450> is

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
first glance of course and the reason is

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.480 
first glance of course and the reason is
we<00:00:13.720> have<00:00:13.840> a<00:00:13.870> whole<00:00:14.230> range<00:00:14.710> of<00:00:14.980> interior's

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
we have a whole range of interior's

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.130 
we have a whole range of interior's
devices<00:00:15.970> that<00:00:16.059> we<00:00:16.209> want<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.539> introduce<00:00:16.779> them

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.140 
devices that we want to introduce them

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.929 
devices that we want to introduce them
as<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.320> range<00:00:17.740> Nash<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.369> have<00:00:18.580> a<00:00:18.609> lot<00:00:18.910> of

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
as a range Nash and have a lot of

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.400 
as a range Nash and have a lot of
commonalities<00:00:19.660> well<00:00:19.869> then<00:00:19.990> of<00:00:20.110> course<00:00:20.289> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
commonalities well then of course the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.920 
commonalities well then of course the
differentiating<00:00:21.160> feature<00:00:21.430> so<00:00:21.850> I<00:00:22.060> mean<00:00:22.539> the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
differentiating feature so I mean the

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.660 
differentiating feature so I mean the
most<00:00:23.260> common<00:00:23.560> in<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.770> design<00:00:24.070> is<00:00:24.280> sort<00:00:24.460> of<00:00:24.520> the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
most common in the design is sort of the

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.120 
most common in the design is sort of the
got<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.090> black<00:00:25.300> front<00:00:25.600> all<00:00:25.960> very<00:00:26.350> smooth<00:00:26.860> very

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
got the black front all very smooth very

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.580 
got the black front all very smooth very
very<00:00:27.730> sleek<00:00:28.000> looking<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.690> then<00:00:29.109> this<00:00:29.289> band

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
very sleek looking and then this band

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.740 
very sleek looking and then this band
which<00:00:29.859> has<00:00:30.010> all<00:00:30.190> the<00:00:30.340> details<00:00:30.609> in<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.510> so<00:00:31.660> for

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
which has all the details in it so for

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.180 
which has all the details in it so for
example<00:00:31.869> if<00:00:32.109> I<00:00:32.259> show<00:00:32.439> you<00:00:32.500> in<00:00:32.739> the<00:00:32.800> band<00:00:32.949> so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
example if I show you in the band so

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.590 
example if I show you in the band so
here<00:00:33.340> we<00:00:33.460> have<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.670> memory<00:00:33.969> card<00:00:34.180> so<00:00:34.300> large

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
here we have the memory card so large

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.340 
here we have the memory card so large
dish<00:00:34.809> which<00:00:36.059> notice<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:37.239> has<00:00:37.269> 16gb<00:00:37.870> built-in

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
dish which notice it has 16gb built-in

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.200 
dish which notice it has 16gb built-in
and<00:00:38.769> it<00:00:39.039> has<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.280> memory<00:00:39.399> card<00:00:39.729> slot<00:00:39.969> which<00:00:39.999> is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
and it has the memory card slot which is

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.169 
and it has the memory card slot which is
very<00:00:40.390> unique<00:00:40.600> so<00:00:41.499> many<00:00:41.979> of<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.309> portable

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
very unique so many of the portable

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:45.419 
very unique so many of the portable
devices<00:00:43.449> don't<00:00:43.719> have<00:00:43.929> expandability<00:00:44.559> so<00:00:45.370> you

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:45.429 
devices don't have expandability so you

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.599 
devices don't have expandability so you
can<00:00:45.670> right<00:00:46.059> away<00:00:46.269> get<00:00:46.449> into<00:00:46.659> 24<00:00:47.109> and<00:00:47.920> 36<00:00:48.280> to

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
can right away get into 24 and 36 to

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.000 
can right away get into 24 and 36 to
fantastic<00:00:49.389> writer<00:00:49.600> so<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.350> then<00:00:50.559> support<00:00:50.949> you

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
hope there's a like it I mean like 32

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.259 
hope there's a like it I mean like 32
will<00:00:59.649> certainly<00:01:00.219> encourage<00:01:00.670> theoretically

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
will certainly encourage theoretically

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.059 
will certainly encourage theoretically
yes<00:01:01.449> but<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.839> course<00:01:02.079> say<00:01:02.260> we<00:01:02.619> don't<00:01:02.799> have<00:01:02.920> any

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
yes but of course say we don't have any

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.330 
yes but of course say we don't have any
samples<00:01:03.280> of<00:01:03.579> those<00:01:03.729> will<00:01:03.999> be<00:01:04.030> we<00:01:04.390> don't<00:01:05.100> type<00:01:06.100> I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
samples of those will be we don't type I

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.060 
samples of those will be we don't type I
can't<00:01:06.810> claim<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:08.050> just<00:01:08.230> if<00:01:08.410> that<00:01:08.620> we<00:01:08.770> have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
can't claim that just if that we have

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.560 
can't claim that just if that we have
theoretical<00:01:09.670> set<00:01:09.880> up<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.120> detect<00:01:10.420> those

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
theoretical set up to detect those

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.670 
theoretical set up to detect those
things<00:01:10.840> which<00:01:11.740> was<00:01:12.460> developed<00:01:12.700> first<00:01:13.300> 10<00:01:13.930> 96

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
things which was developed first 10 96

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.810 
things which was developed first 10 96
for<00:01:15.160> and<00:01:15.400> 981<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.770> sounded<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.280> bit<00:01:18.310> girly<00:01:18.580> with

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
for and 981 it sounded a bit girly with

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.310 
for and 981 it sounded a bit girly with
the<00:01:18.940> NAD<00:01:19.210> one<00:01:19.420> but<00:01:19.600> we<00:01:19.750> work<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.050> little<00:01:20.200> bit

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
the NAD one but we work a little bit

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.550 
the NAD one but we work a little bit
peer-to-peer<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.240> align<00:01:22.750> things<00:01:22.990> so

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
peer-to-peer so that we align things so

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.990 
peer-to-peer so that we align things so
for<00:01:23.680> example<00:01:23.740> again<00:01:24.130> on<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.370> design<00:01:24.640> features

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
for example again on the design features

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120 
for example again on the design features
we<00:01:25.180> have<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.390> lock<00:01:25.570> switch<00:01:25.810> then<00:01:26.620> the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
we have the lock switch then the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.670 
we have the lock switch then the
standard<00:01:27.790> audio<00:01:28.120> connector<00:01:28.810> then<00:01:29.290> here<00:01:29.650> we

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
standard audio connector then here we

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.290 
standard audio connector then here we
have<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:30.100> not<00:01:30.340> a<00:01:30.370> different<00:01:30.760> landscape<00:01:31.020> than

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
have this not a different landscape than

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.570 
have this not a different landscape than
remote<00:01:33.010> speakers<00:01:34.010> so<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.120> as<00:01:36.110> you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
remote speakers so it's as you

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.860 
remote speakers so it's as you
physically<00:01:37.580> move<00:01:37.790> optimized<00:01:38.240> for<00:01:38.270> let's<00:01:38.630> give

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
physically move optimized for let's give

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.080 
physically move optimized for let's give
oh<00:01:39.110> one<00:01:39.950> thing<00:01:39.980> I<00:01:40.220> think<00:01:40.460> yes<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.060> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
oh one thing I think yes this is the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.510 
oh one thing I think yes this is the
video<00:01:41.930> based<00:01:42.140> device<00:01:42.440> but<00:01:42.740> even<00:01:43.280> for<00:01:43.430> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
video based device but even for the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.330 
video based device but even for the
video<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.360> dual<00:01:45.170> LED<00:01:45.350> which<00:01:45.770> would<00:01:46.100> work

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
video you have dual LED which would work

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.090 
video you have dual LED which would work
for<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.640> google<00:01:46.940> also<00:01:47.180> so<00:01:47.930> video<00:01:48.320> when<00:01:49.010> you

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
for the google also so video when you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.950 
for the google also so video when you
record<00:01:49.430> video<00:01:49.580> with<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.000> do<00:01:50.180> anything<00:01:50.840> you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
record video with the do anything you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.740 
record video with the do anything you
work<00:01:51.200> yes<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.040> video<00:01:52.310> so<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.760> is<00:01:52.880> also<00:01:53.060> this

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
work yes the video so this is also this

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.600 
work yes the video so this is also this
is<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.930> video<00:01:54.170> light<00:01:54.650> as<00:01:54.860> well<00:01:55.040> so<00:01:55.310> when<00:01:55.460> you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
is a video light as well so when you

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.750 
is a video light as well so when you
video<00:01:55.940> recording<00:01:56.480> it<00:01:56.660> will<00:01:57.650> work<00:01:57.890> as<00:01:58.070> well<00:01:58.220> so

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
video recording it will work as well so

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.910 
video recording it will work as well so
that<00:01:58.790> was<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.840> device<00:02:00.380> is<00:02:00.560> more<00:02:00.740> focused

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that was the this device is more focused

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.460 
that was the this device is more focused
towards<00:02:01.430> video<00:02:01.760> dan<00:02:02.000> images<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.200> way<00:02:03.290> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
towards video dan images on the way the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.560 
towards video dan images on the way the
Xenon<00:02:03.770> flash<00:02:03.800> might<00:02:04.310> happen<00:02:04.580> it<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.030> actually

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
Xenon flash might happen it and actually

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.720 
Xenon flash might happen it and actually
let<00:02:05.960> me<00:02:06.050> clarify<00:02:06.230> with<00:02:06.560> sav<00:02:06.830> do<00:02:07.160> what<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.490> mean

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
let me clarify with sav do what I mean

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.300 
let me clarify with sav do what I mean
is<00:02:07.910> more<00:02:08.780> video<00:02:09.110> consumption<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.860> course<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
is more video consumption of course you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.330 
is more video consumption of course you
can<00:02:10.429> also<00:02:10.550> do<00:02:10.820> video<00:02:11.120> recording<00:02:11.740> but<00:02:12.740> the<00:02:13.130> main

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
can also do video recording but the main

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.010 
can also do video recording but the main
thing<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.550> it's<00:02:13.820> an<00:02:13.940> entertainment<00:02:14.570> device<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
even for example Barcelona anywhere you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.199 
even for example Barcelona anywhere you
go<00:02:35.420> even<00:02:35.750> quicker<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.860> can<00:02:36.890> receive<00:02:37.280> Holy

go even quicker you can receive Holy

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.920 
go even quicker you can receive Holy
nice<00:02:38.510> TV<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:40.550> he's<00:02:40.730> taking<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.390> will<00:02:41.570> see<00:02:41.720> I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
nice TV so he's taking and I will see I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.650 
nice TV so he's taking and I will see I
think<00:02:42.770> it's<00:02:42.920> about<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.459> well<00:02:44.000> actually<00:02:44.180> it's

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
think it's about it well actually it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.910 
think it's about it well actually it's
funny<00:02:44.750> because<00:02:44.989> here<00:02:45.320> we<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.770> many

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
funny because here we have so many

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.370 
funny because here we have so many
networks<00:02:46.670> up<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.030> running<00:02:47.270> so<00:02:47.720> as<00:02:47.930> many<00:02:48.170> many

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
networks up and running so as many many

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.500 
networks up and running so as many many
many<00:02:48.500> stations<00:02:48.800> but<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.790> rest<00:02:50.360> of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
many stations but I think in the rest of

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.800 
many stations but I think in the rest of
Barcelona<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.200> think<00:02:51.560> I

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.330 

we'll<00:02:54.810> never<00:02:54.990> your<00:02:55.230> future<00:02:55.620> version<00:02:55.980> maybe

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
we'll never your future version maybe

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.250 
we'll never your future version maybe
with<00:02:56.700> dvb-h<00:02:57.210> decked<00:02:57.630> out<00:02:57.810> for<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.080> other

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
with dvb-h decked out for the other

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.530 
with dvb-h decked out for the other
regions<00:02:58.740> which<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.370> really<00:02:59.670> supporting

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
regions which do not really supporting

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.130 
regions which do not really supporting
it<00:03:00.660> eh<00:03:00.870> no<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.740> our<00:03:01.890> plan<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:03.210> basically<00:03:03.690> we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
it eh no that's our plan we basically we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.900 
it eh no that's our plan we basically we
see<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.500> dvb-h<00:03:06.320> dvb-h<00:03:07.320> is<00:03:07.590> basically<00:03:08.130> an

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
see that dvb-h dvb-h is basically an

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.760 
see that dvb-h dvb-h is basically an
emerging<00:03:09.480> thing<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.020> spreading<00:03:10.560> all

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
emerging thing that is spreading all

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.140 
emerging thing that is spreading all
over<00:03:10.800> so<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.310> have<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.490> lot<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.820> couple<00:03:12.090> of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
over so we have a lot of a couple of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.870 
over so we have a lot of a couple of
countries<00:03:12.330> in<00:03:12.660> Asia<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:13.830> have<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.010> obviously

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
countries in Asia we have a obviously

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.690 
countries in Asia we have a obviously
Europe<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:15.540> well<00:03:15.570> that<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:17.070> are<00:03:17.520> now

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
Europe as well that that are now

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.390 
Europe as well that that are now
basically<00:03:18.090> banking<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.990> standard<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.590> we

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
basically banking on the standard and we

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.220 
basically banking on the standard and we
think<00:03:20.580> that<00:03:20.700> it's<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.480> nice<00:03:21.630> feature<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.080> have

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
think that it's a nice feature to have

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.610 
think that it's a nice feature to have
people<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.910> know<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.480> might<00:03:24.720> come<00:03:24.960> yeah

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
people that you know it might come yeah

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.770 
people that you know it might come yeah
you're<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.100> oblation<00:03:26.940> I'm<00:03:27.060> asking<00:03:27.450> me<00:03:27.570> see

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
you're the oblation I'm asking me see

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.860 
you're the oblation I'm asking me see
dvb-h<00:03:28.590> becomes<00:03:28.980> popular<00:03:29.220> in<00:03:29.640> one<00:03:29.970> year's<00:03:30.810> time

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
dvb-h becomes popular in one year's time

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.380 
dvb-h becomes popular in one year's time
why<00:03:31.710> would<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.190> want<00:03:32.430> something<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.940> pay<00:03:33.150> for

that's<00:04:50.909> actually<00:04:51.089> supported<00:04:51.749> as<00:04:51.869> well<00:04:52.019> it's

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
that's actually supported as well it's

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.379 
that's actually supported as well it's
just<00:04:52.619> a<00:04:52.679> bit<00:04:52.829> more<00:04:53.009> complicated<00:04:53.339> because<00:04:53.729> it's

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
just a bit more complicated because it's

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.389 
just a bit more complicated because it's
up<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.719> the<00:04:54.839> broadcaster<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:55.649> allow<00:04:55.859> it<00:04:55.889> or<00:04:56.129> not

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:56.399 
up to the broadcaster to allow it or not

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.639 
up to the broadcaster to allow it or not
allowed<00:04:56.699> and<00:04:57.569> so<00:04:57.629> if<00:04:57.839> the<00:04:57.959> bull<00:04:58.109> pastor<00:04:58.469> says

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:58.649 
allowed and so if the bull pastor says

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:00.109 
allowed and so if the bull pastor says
it's<00:04:58.829> okay<00:04:58.949> for<00:04:59.129> you<00:04:59.399> to<00:04:59.429> report<00:04:59.819> you<00:05:00.089> can

at<00:06:28.220> the<00:06:28.370> battery<00:06:28.670> life<00:06:28.940> think<00:06:29.270> two<00:06:29.450> ways<00:06:29.630> you

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
at the battery life think two ways you

at the battery life think two ways you
should<00:06:29.900> say<00:06:30.050> make<00:06:30.260> a<00:06:30.290> bigger<00:06:30.650> battery<00:06:30.890> but

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
should say make a bigger battery but

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.230 
should say make a bigger battery but
then<00:06:31.700> it's<00:06:31.850> a<00:06:31.940> very<00:06:32.090> bulky<00:06:33.430> I<00:06:34.430> know<00:06:34.550> but<00:06:34.640> I<00:06:34.730> so

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
then it's a very bulky I know but I so

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.420 
then it's a very bulky I know but I so
