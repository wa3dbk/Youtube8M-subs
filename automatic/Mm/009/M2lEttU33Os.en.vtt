00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.350 
hey guys my name is Spencer 9 and thanks

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.560 
hey guys my name is Spencer 9 and thanks
for<00:00:20.470> tuning<00:00:20.619> in<00:00:23.730> today<00:00:24.730> I'll<00:00:25.060> continue<00:00:25.390> my

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
for tuning in today I'll continue my

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.749 
for tuning in today I'll continue my
suggestions<00:00:26.260> for<00:00:26.260> how<00:00:26.500> stage<00:00:27.040> transitions

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
suggestions for how stage transitions

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.560 
suggestions for how stage transitions
can<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.000> like<00:00:28.330> in<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:28.660> storm<00:00:28.900> series<00:00:29.259> as

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
can be like in the storm series as

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.119 
can be like in the storm series as
suggestion<00:00:31.570> number<00:00:31.689> two<00:00:31.990> says<00:00:32.260> let's<00:00:32.800> modify

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
suggestion number two says let's modify

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.430 
suggestion number two says let's modify
the<00:00:33.309> ring<00:00:33.820> out<00:00:33.940> system<00:00:34.390> from<00:00:34.660> ending<00:00:35.020> matches

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
the ring out system from ending matches

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.920 
the ring out system from ending matches
to<00:00:35.830> creating<00:00:36.370> stage<00:00:36.640> transitions<00:00:37.420> instead

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
to creating stage transitions instead

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.320 
to creating stage transitions instead
what<00:00:38.590> it<00:00:38.710> basically<00:00:38.860> means<00:00:39.340> is<00:00:39.699> that<00:00:39.760> as<00:00:40.000> soon

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
what it basically means is that as soon

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.299 
what it basically means is that as soon
as<00:00:40.510> someone<00:00:40.750> is<00:00:40.930> ring<00:00:41.350> doubt<00:00:41.559> then<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.100> player

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
as someone is ring doubt then the player

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.490 
as someone is ring doubt then the player
won't<00:00:42.610> die<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.180> their<00:00:43.420> fight<00:00:43.629> moves<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:44.320> where

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
won't die and their fight moves to where

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.290 
won't die and their fight moves to where
the<00:00:44.650> player<00:00:44.860> gets<00:00:45.100> sent<00:00:45.400> to<00:00:45.460> instead<00:00:46.120> of

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
the player gets sent to instead of

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600 
the player gets sent to instead of
course<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.170> transitions<00:00:47.739> should<00:00:47.920> be<00:00:48.070> fast<00:00:48.340> so

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
course the transitions should be fast so

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.549 
course the transitions should be fast so
the<00:00:48.730> fast<00:00:48.969> paced<00:00:49.329> action<00:00:49.570> isn't<00:00:49.960> slowed<00:00:50.350> down

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
the fast paced action isn't slowed down

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.770 
the fast paced action isn't slowed down
depending<00:00:51.309> on<00:00:51.550> how<00:00:51.670> things<00:00:51.940> turn<00:00:52.180> out<00:00:52.329> the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
depending on how things turn out the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.450 
depending on how things turn out the
possibility<00:00:52.989> of<00:00:53.440> having<00:00:53.710> more<00:00:54.010> than<00:00:54.040> just<00:00:54.370> one

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
possibility of having more than just one

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.369 
possibility of having more than just one
stage<00:00:54.940> transition<00:00:55.570> happening<00:00:55.989> per<00:00:56.200> match

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
stage transition happening per match

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.280 
stage transition happening per match
should<00:00:56.920> be<00:00:57.100> higher<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.690> as<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:58.960> can<00:00:59.110> see

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
should be higher so that as you can see

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.350 
should be higher so that as you can see
here<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.190> stage<00:01:00.430> transition<00:01:01.090> feature

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
here the stage transition feature

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.270 
here the stage transition feature
doesn't<00:01:01.780> only<00:01:01.989> have<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.350> have<00:01:02.379> one<00:01:02.530> transition

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
doesn't only have to have one transition

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.210 
doesn't only have to have one transition
per<00:01:03.550> match<00:01:03.730> it<00:01:04.300> may<00:01:04.539> as<00:01:04.660> well<00:01:04.809> have<00:01:04.989> more<00:01:05.259> again

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
per match it may as well have more again

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.340 
per match it may as well have more again
this<00:01:06.640> all<00:01:06.880> depends<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.420> how<00:01:07.479> things<00:01:07.960> turn<00:01:08.200> out

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
this all depends on how things turn out

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.380 
this all depends on how things turn out
and<00:01:08.560> no<00:01:08.890> one<00:01:09.039> says<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.310> they<00:01:09.759> have<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.090> happen

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
and no one says that they have to happen

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.420 
and no one says that they have to happen
all<00:01:10.509> the<00:01:10.539> time<00:01:10.660> or<00:01:11.140> very<00:01:11.350> frequently<00:01:11.920> it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
all the time or very frequently it's

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.370 
all the time or very frequently it's
merely<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.820> feature<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.360> enables<00:01:13.600> players<00:01:13.990> to

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
merely a feature that enables players to

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.820 
merely a feature that enables players to
explore<00:01:14.710> better<00:01:14.979> sceneries<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:16.590> being<00:01:17.590> said

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
explore better sceneries that being said

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.280 
explore better sceneries that being said
this<00:01:18.250> stage<00:01:18.759> transition<00:01:19.479> feature<00:01:19.750> shouldn't

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
this stage transition feature shouldn't

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.530 
this stage transition feature shouldn't
only<00:01:20.470> go<00:01:20.740> from<00:01:20.979> horizontally<00:01:21.790> flat<00:01:22.030> surfaces

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
only go from horizontally flat surfaces

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
me show you some simpler examples of how

00:01:31.090 --> 00:02:11.030 
me show you some simpler examples of how
this<00:01:31.299> may<00:01:31.509> work

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.740 

let's<00:02:12.040> move<00:02:12.189> on<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.549> suggestion<00:02:13.180> number<00:02:13.329> three

let's move on to suggestion number three
with<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.680> newly<00:02:14.860> modified<00:02:15.280> ring<00:02:15.760> out<00:02:15.879> system

stage instead of dying let's enable this

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.520 
stage instead of dying let's enable this
feature<00:02:21.189> to<00:02:21.519> happen<00:02:21.939> more<00:02:22.090> frequently<00:02:22.530> for

feature to happen more frequently for

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.170 
feature to happen more frequently for
instance<00:02:23.920> let's<00:02:24.250> make<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.579> wall<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:25.120> are

system<00:02:34.000> should<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.569> more<00:02:34.930> likely<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.409> happen

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
system should be more likely to happen

let<00:02:36.280> me<00:02:36.400> show<00:02:36.579> you<00:02:36.640> what<00:02:36.939> I<00:02:36.970> mean<00:02:37.030> with<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
let me show you what I mean with the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:54.910 
let me show you what I mean with the
following<00:02:37.900> examples

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:15.690 

so<00:02:55.920> bloody

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.310 

okay<00:03:16.700> as<00:03:16.880> my<00:03:17.270> last<00:03:17.450> suggestion<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:18.170> this

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
okay as my last suggestion for this

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.110 
okay as my last suggestion for this
video<00:03:18.590> says<00:03:18.860> let's<00:03:19.430> make<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.820> ring<00:03:20.000> out

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
video says let's make the ring out

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.150 
video says let's make the ring out
system<00:03:20.510> deal<00:03:20.720> damage<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.380> players<00:03:21.620> who<00:03:21.950> get

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
system deal damage to players who get
