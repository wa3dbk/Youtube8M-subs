00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so then just stick to the left and once

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.510 
so then just stick to the left and once
you<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:37.920> gonna<00:01:38.040> zoom<00:01:38.340> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you get up here you're gonna zoom in

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
you get up here you're gonna zoom in
with<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.759> pistol<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.570> don't<00:01:39.869> jump

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
with your pistol just so you don't jump

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
with your pistol just so you don't jump
to<00:01:40.380> follow<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.979> jump<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.360> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to follow the do jump you don't have to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.069 
to follow the do jump you don't have to
but<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> suggested<00:01:43.799> um<00:01:44.310> after<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.960> up

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
but I suggested um after that you get up

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.490 
but I suggested um after that you get up
here<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.799> jump<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.930> at

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
here and then jump right up here and at

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.249 
here and then jump right up here and at
this<00:01:49.649> point<00:01:49.890> you're<00:01:50.130> gonna<00:01:50.220> walk<00:01:50.520> forward<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
this point you're gonna walk forward and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.660 
this point you're gonna walk forward and
once<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.649> hit<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.829> invisible<00:01:53.310> wall<00:01:53.460> you're

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
once you hit the invisible wall you're

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.580 
once you hit the invisible wall you're
