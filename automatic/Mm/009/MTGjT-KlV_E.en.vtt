00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.670
 hello everyone welcome today we are going to 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.070
 teach how to make a chocolate brownie 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.830
 white and pistachios for processing 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 of the white chocolate brownie and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.830
 pistachios in this case we will need 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.140
 3 eggs covered with chocolate flour 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.920
 white sugar pistachios that we 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.129
 We've semi-split a little bit of 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.930
 butter a pinch of salt and a half 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.550
 vanilla pod if you do not have pod 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.530
 vanilla you can buy extract from 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.020
 vanilla well also forward 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.960
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.570
 put to melt the chocolate coverage 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.620
 white to the bain-marie together with 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 the butter 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.450
 while this is melting let's go 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.979
 whitening these eggs until they go 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.550
 doubling the volume and taking good 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550
 sponginess 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 we are going to incorporate the egg and the an 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 the vanilla bean 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.120
 with the help of a knife and a table 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.120
 we're just going to make a cut 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.120
 longitudinal 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.659
 we split in half 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.530
 and from one extreme 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.560
 stretch 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.060
 until the seed of the vanilla 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.770
 which is where most of the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.299
 of the taste 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.299
 and the same with the other half 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.980
 we will also put and point d 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.230
 of salt 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.370
 and we will continue working the 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.370
 to the egg mass 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.300
 we would have practically melted the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.860
 chocolate coverage we will pay with 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.020
 the residual heat itself has the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.020
 water will finish melting 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.910
 we are going to move it and this is how we help it 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.530
 sheath 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.090
 and at the same time that you are losing a bit of 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.520
 temperature to then incorporate this 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.130
 mix the eggs and the sugar and do not 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.280
 have any kind of risk that you 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.280
 us 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.420
 we get to curdle the egg 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.420
 It's worth it, it 's already perfectly 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.870
 diluted both the coverage and the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.870
 Butter 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.700
 and we are going to incorporate it 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.260
 to the mixture that we had of egg and 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 sugar 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.280
 let's work it 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.280
 that you get well 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.440
 and then we are going to put the flour 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.630
 that we have previously sifted 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.910
 avoid forming any group 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.830
 we put it all at once 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.380
 and we are going around and little by little 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.380
 so it will be incorporated into the mixture 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.330
 well you see that the result is a mass 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.580
 pretty thick 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.990
 here unlike the brownie of 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.120
 chocolate change a little 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.730
 proportions 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.739
 because white chocolate coverage 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.890
 it has a lot more fat then we have 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.010
 removed part of the butter and we have 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.220
 slightly increased the proportion of 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.220
 flour 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.400
 Now what we are going to do is going to be 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.620
 incorporate these pistachios we mix 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.090
 all right 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.470
 and with the help of the spatula 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.470
 we are going to put it 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.210
 in a silicone mold us to 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.550
 avoid any kind of problem we have 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.910
 we have given a brush a bit of 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 Butter 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.160
 so then in the process we must 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.340
 come out of a good piece we go with 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.340
 it 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.010
 because once we have it ready in 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.710
 the mold we're going to go to the oven that 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.420
 we have preheated to 175 degrees and what 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.140
 We will keep there for space 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:38.720
 about 30 minutes and right now we'll be back 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.840
 and we show you the result 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.430
 Well, we left the oven with 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.610
 our beige white chocolate baroni 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.680
 that takes a golden color all the bark 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.780
 but the interior once we opened it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.540
 will keep white is important before 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.270
 to unmold, leave them for 5 minutes or 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.620
 ten minutes to rest so that then there 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.110
 lost a little temperature and be 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.360
 much easier dow downswing and what 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 we run the risk that we are 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.630
 get stuck or break us then 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.190
 we're just going to let it rest 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.650
 here on marble 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.780
 Well, we just demold it already 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.090
 you see we have cut a small portion 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.290
 so you can see the texture of the color 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.820
 and also the cut of the pistachio itself 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.380
 this is still hot 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.560
 would be to put it in the camera leave it 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.750
 refrigerate and cool and then already 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.040
 consume it and this would be our brownie 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.040
 of white chocolate and pistachios
