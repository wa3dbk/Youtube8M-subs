00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.430
 now you can step to the next that 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.179
 I feel so strong now when I print this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.639
 want to make you feel like it 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.469
 men is illuminated from below 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 really 100 percent cover is here to come 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 this etf films use 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 we use the black ones now 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 is also available in white if you are wise 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 wants to create scripts right there now 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 the same steps are the only thing 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 Do you do it instead of the black ones? 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.609
 foil the white flag 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.019
 The police has a shiny silk and 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.120
 be the math once 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.030
 the matte side is always on the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.790
 project but we put it first now 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.230
 on the side because the ttf paper must first 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.690
 also be dried 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.399
 when we work with these slides 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.350
 really important that this pressure completely 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 So fresh is that you should do this 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.460
 should not have stored pressure for a long time 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.190
 fresh from the printer and right on 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.550
 work we do once again the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.550
 paper 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 It's really important that you do that 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.649
 All paper was not just that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.049
 pressure itself comes here the study 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.780
 You do not have to be women with this film 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.189
 so careful about the voter 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.819
 then the envelope Rhine through again 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.819
 the long applause 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.070
 one sees very well when pulling off 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.720
 this really on the 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:23.610
 font black color printed on it 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.610
 is as once in the lays 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.950
 It sometimes happens that you are under pressure 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.320
 still on the normal paper acts 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.850
 Keeps this is for this 3m track there 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.220
 I always pushed her most 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.150
 bit off that it starts networks and 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.460
 then go over the corresponding 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.080
 put it over but here you need that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.620
 nothing is not growing now 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.780
 is stuck there now comes 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.700
 me the cleaned mehler paper on it 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.700
 and the same step as before 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.590
 Do not own the paper only once 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.590
 twice 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.620
 the interest for the wall the same 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.629
 steps ahead 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.629
 by and with it 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.379
 really wait for you 100 of 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.450
 the water has already been solved by itself 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.499
 not as warm as before him for it 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.499
 It takes a bit longer 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.520
 on 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.050
 now is exactly the same as before 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.870
 only that one also a more intense one 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.459
 black pro card the legal 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.459
 Steps are the same as before
