00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
not as good like the sound it makes a

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
not as good like the sound it makes a
lot<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.899> not<00:01:55.229> good<00:01:55.439> sounds<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
lot of just not good sounds in the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830

bit<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.909> advanced<00:02:03.149> than<00:02:03.270> sugar<00:02:03.509> bees<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
bit more advanced than sugar bees on it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.569 
bit more advanced than sugar bees on it
