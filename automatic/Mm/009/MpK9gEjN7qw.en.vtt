00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.500
 a love that you will not like clear which is not given up 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 then a fashion that I don't like is that I didn't give up a little bit of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 long ago fortunately quite a long time ago are dating shoes 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.070
 remained kind of shoes with this. especially we have meches ilaria 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 xx 'pay off in the corner 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.829
 what a lousy thing to go 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.210
 however it is a fashion I never liked. a pair of shoes like that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.290
 if I love you because in the end 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.730
 a sandwich in reverse 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 well, antonio Albanian, because I found cheese tables among you 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.350
 I find you number 26 pieri games and they are very small they are bassina 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.210
 id here really looks more like a bastard diagram 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.460
 dentist 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.690
 eh you ask for a love that you will not like and that eventually followed 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.140
 ebay 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.159
 maiorana 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.909
 something I did not like until recently and that I am now 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.969
 using a lot because not revalued without a doubt first sip 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.299
 I thought it also seems to me this was a schoolchild pope 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.390
 but the new models are that they are now I have to tell you that they smile at 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.660
 more so he's using me with gamedesire 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.730
 eleventh question the fashion that is over lived with no in the sense a fashion too 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.570
 type sh belonging to the past 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.860
 here is a very complicated question because that is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.080
 There are various types of fashion that I liked from the past 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.600
 then if I really have to choose between these s ... 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.590
 environments 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.680
 and the 50s are certainly the fashion styles that I like best 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.549
 I am very feminine 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.010
 elegant redtube details 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.070
 because a place in the sun 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.869
 please that anyway 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.070
 because there were details in this 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.909
 immediately 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.150
 20s fashion look installs very very beautiful fashion 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.770
 many refined refined and feminine first 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:14.529
 you are in favor or not wearing heels before 14 years 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:16.279
 then 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.179
 first of all, babette's good lunch has so many things because I believe 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.099
 which is something like it can be 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.229
 more or less tasteful 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:34.340
 let's go over the dead wedge twists above all 100 embroidery that a pack 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.549
 bass 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.139
 for which the heel on rai 4 5 cm can also be worn by one 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.469
 14-year-old girl in a non-vulgar way only 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.089
 and I believe that perhaps if I had done so today I will be able to bring 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.939
 heeled shoes which I am definitely not. why me 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:53.669
 like them but then 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:59.699
 to put a tragedy on it I can't walk and eventually 3d, always the 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:00.739
 comfort 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.739
 * put on a nice pair of samba miranda dancers 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.020
 toast question 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.319
 in your fashion icon 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.319
 hot your source of inspiration for fashion 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.250
 then equity 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.970
 to say that they were years that saying no because we say that my fashion icons 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.289
 do not belong to this age 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.239
 a train that passes by three belongs 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.069
 and here it will be really very very trivial 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.769
 but definitely a memorable fashion icon pm odry hepburn 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:39.509
 because being able to always be sophisticated alim. fortnightly 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.689
 hey to give life to anything you put on is 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.359
 it is not simply about wearing wear anyway they were gorgeous 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.979
 for the most part they were clothes created by the known percular angry 

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.629
 first that passes the life 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.829
 but it was yesterday 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.470
 his way of wearing those ilariadot clothes that I don't live anyway beautiful 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:05.409
 very much from the personality of the wearer I do not even dream of saying it is 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.129
 that I draw inspiration from silvio de podria airbourne because it would be like 

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:13.349
 % then I think model that I was flag 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.739
 civil, however, disguise himself as his girlfriend no way 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.109
 these natural and also bring an evening dress 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.479
 what you think is desirable for all women 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.349
 penultimate question what do you like the banana you do not have the fashion 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.330
 so the thing I like most about fashion is the creative side I like 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.319
 so much to notice all the little details because doing both a job and a 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.419
 school that houses anyway. this scope required by trying to 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.069
 become a modeller cad the figure that laughs the designer's drawing 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:48.879
 being able to create a model 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:54.449
 The paper that will then be delivered will be the seamstress. sew the pattern 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.379
 so I like to imagine reasoning about how they were made with clothes 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.350
 on 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.630
 read all the technical creative side of the year of the matter today what not 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.510
 I like fashion in absolute I don't like it is something more than fashion 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.259
 regards the shops 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.259
 he knows that when it is fashionable one thing is in stockholm 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.849
 a color is in fashion 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.059
 site everything of that color and suddenly maybe 7 likes another 

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:26.889
 from another color note that shop is why I rely on the markets 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.889
 write in a few words about your style 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.150
 Oh God, the first word that comes to my mind is to describe yourself investing 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.550
 schizophrenic because I sincerely grass ass online then I wake up there 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.550
 absolutely many morning types like what 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.469
 I don't think I have a style that can be defined in any way 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:50.349
 we say that I am a vez anxiously costs a lot to the tires that tends to 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.799
 favor by far a state-of-the-art clothing 

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:55.349
 ads that isohunt 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.139
 But I really like wearing a pair of jeans, too 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.930
 T-shirt. it absolutely depends on frog tire specialists 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.680
 guys this was why my first attempt at ipantellas 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.610

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.409
 enel is about to leave tomorrow morning cartellate will be an aruba week 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:17.619
 they are doing too much damage 

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:21.659
 so if you are having trouble seeing the vast video in 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.080
 answer below do not worry because 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.990
 I don't often have the ability to access the internet as I have to 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.560
