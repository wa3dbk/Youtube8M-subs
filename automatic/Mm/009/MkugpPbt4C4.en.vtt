they're able to sell heard of what they
grow<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.569> these<00:02:47.959> sacks<00:02:48.319> really

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
grow and so the these sacks really

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.369

turned<00:02:48.890> out<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.190> be<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.690> crucial<00:02:50.690> source<00:02:51.140> of
