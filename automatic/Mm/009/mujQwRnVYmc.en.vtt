best<00:02:21.700> right<00:02:22.270> after<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.630> apply<00:02:22.990> it<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:23.410> I've<00:02:23.650> been

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
best right after I apply it so I've been

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.130 
best right after I apply it so I've been
trying<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.250> find<00:02:24.430> ways<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.700> make<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.240> line<00:02:25.540> so

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
trying to find ways to make that line so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.070 
trying to find ways to make that line so
here's<00:02:26.410> my<00:02:26.500> foundation<00:02:27.010> so<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.280> find<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.120> it

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
here's my foundation so I find that it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140 
here's my foundation so I find that it
does<00:02:29.410> give<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:30.130> little<00:02:30.370> bit<00:02:30.610> of<00:02:30.670> light

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
does give a little bit of light

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.430 
does give a little bit of light
reflection<00:02:31.660> that<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.900> can<00:02:32.050> see<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.320> my

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
reflection that you can see in my

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.710 
reflection that you can see in my
lighting<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.920> little<00:02:33.250> bit<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.000> not<00:02:34.240> a<00:02:34.270> flat

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
lighting a little bit it's not a flat

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.110 
lighting a little bit it's not a flat
finish<00:02:35.590> which<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.040> really<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.730> like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
finish which I really like to the like

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.640 
finish which I really like to the like
it<00:02:40.240> doesn't<00:02:40.450> quite<00:02:40.870> set<00:02:41.380> on<00:02:41.620> me<00:02:42.330> completely<00:02:43.650> so

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
it doesn't quite set on me completely so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.460 
it doesn't quite set on me completely so
I<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.130> sort<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:45.610> feel<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.810> feels<00:02:47.140> like<00:02:47.350> I

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
I can sort of feel the it feels like I

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.350 
I can sort of feel the it feels like I
have<00:02:47.620> a<00:02:47.650> moisturizer<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.520> that's<00:02:49.090> how<00:02:49.210> I'd

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
have a moisturizer on that's how I'd

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.110 
have a moisturizer on that's how I'd
describe<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.020> feels<00:02:50.260> like<00:02:50.850> almost<00:02:51.850> like<00:02:52.000> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
describe it it feels like almost like I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.760 
describe it it feels like almost like I
have<00:02:52.270> my<00:02:52.390> night<00:02:52.600> cream<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.050> which<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.680> don't

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
have my night cream on which I don't

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.400 
have my night cream on which I don't
know<00:02:54.250> if<00:02:54.490> I'm<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.670> huge<00:02:54.880> fan<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:55.690> like

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
know if I'm a huge fan of that I like

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.020 
know if I'm a huge fan of that I like
the<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.840> effect<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.110> gives<00:02:59.320> but<00:02:59.740> I<00:03:00.130> just

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the the effect that it gives but I just

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.700 
the the effect that it gives but I just
like<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> feel<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.570> little<00:03:01.810> bit<00:03:01.990> more<00:03:02.140> secure

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
like to feel a little bit more secure

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.080 
like to feel a little bit more secure
with<00:03:02.890> my<00:03:03.010> foundation<00:03:03.550> like<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:03.850> not<00:03:03.940> going

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
with my foundation like it's not going

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.000 
with my foundation like it's not going
to<00:03:04.180> slip<00:03:04.420> off<00:03:04.630> if<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.110> blow<00:03:05.290> my<00:03:05.410> nose<00:03:05.440> which<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:05.950> do

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
to slip off if I blow my nose which I do

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.790

and brightman this is in the shade of
fair<00:03:15.790> which<00:03:16.630> is<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.810> great<00:03:17.050> match<00:03:17.290> for<00:03:17.620> me<00:03:17.709> this

it<00:03:26.620> sets<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.130> just<00:03:27.580> like<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.910> it's<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.120> really

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
it sets it just like that it's a really

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.110 
it sets it just like that it's a really
nice<00:03:28.510> color<00:03:28.780> match<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.560> sets<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.120> very

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
nice color match and it sets it very

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.990 
nice color match and it sets it very
very<00:03:31.420> nicely<00:03:31.920> okay<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:32.980> my<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.700> rest<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.940> my

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
very nicely okay so my the rest of my

so we can get a really good look at okay
so<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.510> think<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:41.020> as<00:03:41.170> classes<00:03:41.740> I<00:03:41.860> can<00:03:42.070> get

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
so I think this is as classes I can get

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.350 
so I think this is as classes I can get
um<00:03:42.990> its<00:03:43.990> full<00:03:44.230> coverage<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:45.190> nice<00:03:45.730> coverage

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
um its full coverage it is nice coverage

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.970 
um its full coverage it is nice coverage
my<00:03:46.600> skin<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.900> doing<00:03:47.170> okay<00:03:47.440> right<00:03:47.470> now<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:47.920> I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
my skin is doing okay right now so I

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.060 
my skin is doing okay right now so I
don't<00:03:48.100> have<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.220> ton<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.520> spots<00:03:48.970> to<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:50.070> deal

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
don't have a ton of spots to to deal

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.540 
don't have a ton of spots to to deal
with<00:03:51.310> but<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:53.350> it's<00:03:53.770> full<00:03:53.920> coverage<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.459> you

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
with but it's it's full coverage and you

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.220 
with but it's it's full coverage and you
can<00:03:54.670> see<00:03:54.910> especially<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:55.420> my<00:03:55.540> nose<00:03:55.750> how<00:03:56.080> it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
can see especially on my nose how it

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.320 
can see especially on my nose how it
still<00:03:56.500> reflects<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.459> bit<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.700> light<00:03:57.910> I

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
still reflects a little bit of light I

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.360 
still reflects a little bit of light I
don't<00:03:58.930> have<00:03:59.020> any<00:03:59.140> highlighter<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.310> do

feel like my skin looks like skin

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.160 
feel like my skin looks like skin
especially<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.060> natural<00:04:04.540> light<00:04:04.720> this<00:04:04.959> light

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
especially in natural light this light

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.000 
especially in natural light this light
may<00:04:05.590> not<00:04:05.770> be<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:07.420> most<00:04:07.600> accurate<00:04:09.480> kind<00:04:10.480> of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
may not be the most accurate kind of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.050 
may not be the most accurate kind of
