 Half an hour I'm going to travel again 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.090

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.070

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.660
 multiplayer of call of duty ghosts in 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.040
 xbox one in addition to it so I'm going to 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.140
 be in the game and in addition to it 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.940
 new generation console I'm not going to 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.890
 be able to test the call of duty in a 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.060
 new generation console 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.340
 previous tests that have gone 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.260
 doing through different events 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.579
 that have been held in Europe have been 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.700
 on platforms of the current generation 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.980
 that is to say a xbox 360 usually and 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.649
 good as well as well I said 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.990
 I'm sorry I'll be able to prove it as a team 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.250
 xbox so nothing and I'll tell you 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.829
 I probably upload some video with my 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.329
 impressions and others but good this 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.520
 video recorded it before I left because 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.079
 just like I did with the people of Barcelona 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.880
 so to speak I'm going to do it with the 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:24.420
 people of madrid and is that you are going to be able 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.789

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.520
 and October 20 is saying this Saturday and 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.880
 this Sunday I will be in the English court 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.679
 Callao is worth it, so I'll be there 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 two guides of the whole day I imagine that 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.030
 I will be more or less from very early 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.240
 until very late maybe eight o'clock 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 nine at night and well a little more 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.179
 who told the truth I will try 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.560
 that does not get long because I have 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.869
 that I would go on a trip as if well 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.229
 As I told you, I have been one day 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.329
 at home literally and on Wednesday if 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 do not arrive on Tuesday sorry and in the 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.799
 Tuesday night on Wednesday I was 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.110
 at home and today I leave you Thursday as 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 right now at 6 and I'm going to Madrid 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.679
 so nothing a little more these days 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.149
 you're going to have videos I hope there's no 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.799
 no problem with programming 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 videos from youtube so I do not expect anything 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.400
 that you liked like and favorites and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.850
