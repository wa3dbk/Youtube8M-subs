00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
and I'm applying that right into the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.000 
and I'm applying that right into the
crease<00:02:13.060> right<00:02:13.360> into<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.690> eye<00:02:13.720> socket<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
crease right into the eye socket so you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.070 
crease right into the eye socket so you
can<00:02:15.430> definitely<00:02:15.580> build<00:02:15.880> up<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.150> color<00:02:16.420> now

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
can definitely build up that color now

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080 
can definitely build up that color now
it's<00:02:17.320> very<00:02:17.500> pigmented<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.400> share<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:18.970> out

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
it's very pigmented you can share it out

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.570 
it's very pigmented you can share it out
and<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.230> as<00:02:20.410> dark<00:02:20.650> so<00:02:21.520> I

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and so that it's not as dark so I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:31.530 
and so that it's not as dark so I
definitely<00:02:21.820> like<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.330> biggest

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
definitely like that the biggest

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.050 
definitely like that the biggest
downfall<00:02:31.960> for<00:02:32.440> this<00:02:32.590> trio<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.520> there<00:02:33.880> are

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
downfall for this trio is that there are

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.870 
downfall for this trio is that there are
no<00:02:34.300> matte<00:02:34.570> shades<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.950> personally<00:02:36.400> like<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
no matte shades so I personally like to

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.510 
no matte shades so I personally like to
mix<00:02:37.090> up<00:02:37.270> different<00:02:37.990> textures<00:02:38.410> otherwise<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
mix up different textures otherwise it

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760 
mix up different textures otherwise it
just<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.420> way<00:02:40.690> too<00:02:40.750> shimmery<00:02:41.200> all<00:02:41.470> over<00:02:41.680> the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
just it's way too shimmery all over the

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.180 
just it's way too shimmery all over the
eye<00:02:41.800> it's<00:02:42.160> overkill<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.590> that's<00:02:44.590> why<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> will

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
eye it's overkill so that's why you will

black and
it's<00:04:19.930> pretty<00:04:20.079> tough<00:04:20.290> and<00:04:20.620> I<00:04:20.650> have<00:04:20.829> to<00:04:20.949> say<00:04:21.130> just

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
it's pretty tough and I have to say just

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.990 
it's pretty tough and I have to say just
wet-and-wild<00:04:22.710> really<00:04:23.710> inexpensive<00:04:24.400> cream

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
wet-and-wild really inexpensive cream

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.409 
wet-and-wild really inexpensive cream
liner<00:04:25.240> is<00:04:25.510> very<00:04:25.840> very<00:04:26.110> black<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:27.180> noticed<00:04:28.180> that

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
liner is very very black I noticed that

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.020 
liner is very very black I noticed that
it<00:04:28.570> isn't<00:04:28.900> quite<00:04:29.050> as<00:04:29.440> creamy<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.699> fluid

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
it isn't quite as creamy as the fluid

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.230 
it isn't quite as creamy as the fluid
line<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.740> still<00:04:33.190> glides<00:04:33.550> on<00:04:33.820> really

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
line but it still glides on really

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.560 
line but it still glides on really
really<00:04:34.870> well<00:04:35.050> and<00:04:35.830> another<00:04:36.790> thing<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.210> notice

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
really well and another thing I notice

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.980 
really well and another thing I notice
is<00:04:37.780> that<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:39.100> also<00:04:39.280> shows<00:04:39.790> up<00:04:40.000> much<00:04:40.300> darker<00:04:40.780> on

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
is that it also shows up much darker on

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.840 
is that it also shows up much darker on
the<00:04:41.050> waterline<00:04:41.650> so<00:04:42.220> for<00:04:42.400> those<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.669> who

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
the waterline so for those of you who

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.700 
the waterline so for those of you who
are<00:04:43.000> having<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.360> hard<00:04:43.389> time<00:04:43.720> finding<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.500> good

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.320 
are having a hard time finding a good
eye<00:04:44.770> liner<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.280> stays<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:45.880> waterline

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
eye liner that stays on the waterline

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.420 
eye liner that stays on the waterline
and<00:04:46.570> actually<00:04:47.229> shows<00:04:47.470> up<00:04:47.650> really<00:04:47.830> dark<00:04:48.190> on<00:04:48.340> the

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
and actually shows up really dark on the

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.900 
and actually shows up really dark on the
waterline

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
waterline

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.090 
waterline
I'm<00:04:49.810> pretty<00:04:50.320> impressed<00:04:50.680> with<00:04:50.800> what<00:04:51.010> in

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
I'm pretty impressed with what in

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.370 
I'm pretty impressed with what in
Wilde's<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.669> even<00:04:52.270> noticed<00:04:52.419> that<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.930> lasts

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
Wilde's I even noticed that it lasts

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.500 
Wilde's I even noticed that it lasts
like<00:04:53.919> longer<00:04:54.460> it<00:04:54.610> doesn't<00:04:54.880> fade<00:04:55.090> out<00:04:55.300> as

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
like longer it doesn't fade out as

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.820 
like longer it doesn't fade out as
quickly<00:04:55.810> as<00:04:56.260> Mac<00:04:56.650> tracks<00:04:56.979> fluid<00:04:57.400> line

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
quickly as Mac tracks fluid line

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.890 
quickly as Mac tracks fluid line
they're<00:04:59.830> both<00:05:00.040> great<00:05:00.400> products<00:05:00.970> but<00:05:01.450> there

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
they're both great products but there

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.230 
they're both great products but there
are<00:05:02.050> obvious<00:05:02.800> differences<00:05:03.280> between<00:05:03.490> them<00:05:03.910> and

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
are obvious differences between them and

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.330 
are obvious differences between them and
so<00:05:04.990> I<00:05:05.290> thought<00:05:05.440> I<00:05:05.500> would<00:05:05.740> show<00:05:05.919> you<00:05:05.950> how<00:05:06.310> I

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
so I thought I would show you how I

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.340 
so I thought I would show you how I
apply<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.000> wet<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.690> wild<00:05:07.780> what<00:05:08.110> I'd<00:05:08.200> like<00:05:08.260> to

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
apply the wet and wild what I'd like to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.710 
apply the wet and wild what I'd like to
do<00:05:08.470> is<00:05:08.680> use<00:05:08.950> like<00:05:09.160> a<00:05:09.190> pencil<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.389> don't

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
do is use like a pencil that I don't

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.779 
do is use like a pencil that I don't
really<00:05:10.990> use<00:05:11.260> that<00:05:11.289> has<00:05:11.889> pretty<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.520> doesn't

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
really use that has pretty that doesn't

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.700 
really use that has pretty that doesn't
work<00:05:12.880> very<00:05:13.060> well<00:05:13.120> on<00:05:13.240> me<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:14.169> just<00:05:14.350> dip<00:05:14.560> it

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
work very well on me and I just dip it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.830 
work very well on me and I just dip it
into<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.100> pot<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.580> then<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.210> just<00:05:16.389> glide<00:05:16.660> it

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
into the pot and then I just glide it

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:28.980 
into the pot and then I just glide it
right<00:05:17.080> across<00:05:17.350> my<00:05:17.800> waterline<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:28.300> also<00:05:28.660> tight

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
right across my waterline and also tight

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.990 
right across my waterline and also tight
line<00:05:29.229> with<00:05:29.440> this<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.950> it<00:05:30.130> just<00:05:30.340> stays<00:05:30.639> really

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
line with this and it just stays really

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.589 
line with this and it just stays really
well

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.089 

so<00:05:38.599> as<00:05:38.719> you<00:05:38.839> can<00:05:38.959> see<00:05:39.019> it's<00:05:39.619> really<00:05:39.949> really

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
so as you can see it's really really

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.769 
so as you can see it's really really
black<00:05:40.519> and<00:05:40.759> really<00:05:41.179> pigmented

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:41.779 
black and really pigmented

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.399 
black and really pigmented
I<00:05:42.159> also<00:05:43.159> notice<00:05:43.729> with<00:05:43.969> this<00:05:44.239> the<00:05:45.019> first<00:05:45.229> time<00:05:45.379> I

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
I also notice with this the first time I

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.129 
I also notice with this the first time I
had<00:05:45.619> worn<00:05:45.829> it<00:05:46.039> with<00:05:46.579> that<00:05:46.789> I<00:05:47.059> also<00:05:47.329> applied<00:05:47.929> it

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
had worn it with that I also applied it

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.219 
had worn it with that I also applied it
onto<00:05:48.529> my<00:05:48.769> upper<00:05:49.099> lash<00:05:49.279> line<00:05:49.309> and<00:05:49.909> it<00:05:50.539> barely

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
onto my upper lash line and it barely

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.679 
onto my upper lash line and it barely
smudged<00:05:51.889> I<00:05:52.189> think<00:05:52.579> it<00:05:52.819> didn't<00:05:53.209> really<00:05:53.329> smudge

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689 
smudged I think it didn't really smudge

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.429 
smudged I think it didn't really smudge
until<00:05:54.049> maybe<00:05:54.259> after<00:05:54.789> nine<00:05:55.789> hours<00:05:56.269> it<00:05:56.569> just<00:05:57.259> had

00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:57.439 
until maybe after nine hours it just had

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.709 
until maybe after nine hours it just had
the<00:05:57.589> tiniest<00:05:58.159> smudging<00:05:59.059> going<00:05:59.299> on<00:05:59.449> right<00:05:59.689> in

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
the tiniest smudging going on right in

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.989 
the tiniest smudging going on right in
the<00:06:00.049> inner<00:06:00.229> corner<00:06:00.649> and<00:06:01.009> I<00:06:01.369> have<00:06:01.549> really

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
the inner corner and I have really

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.449 
the inner corner and I have really
really<00:06:02.029> greasy<00:06:02.479> lines<00:06:02.899> so<00:06:03.349> that's<00:06:04.159> quite

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:04.459 
really greasy lines so that's quite

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:06.759 
really greasy lines so that's quite
impressive<00:06:04.639> I<00:06:05.179> would<00:06:06.019> really<00:06:06.229> recommend<00:06:06.379> this

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:06.769 
impressive I would really recommend this

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
impressive I would really recommend this
this<00:06:07.099> cost<00:06:07.369> about<00:06:07.579> 399<00:06:08.649> but<00:06:09.649> on<00:06:09.829> BOGO<00:06:10.339> you<00:06:10.669> can

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
this cost about 399 but on BOGO you can

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.059 
this cost about 399 but on BOGO you can
get<00:06:10.909> it<00:06:10.969> for<00:06:11.059> less<00:06:11.239> so<00:06:11.989> I<00:06:12.019> technically<00:06:12.709> got

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
get it for less so I technically got
