00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
like this and I think that if you have

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.520 
like this and I think that if you have
light<00:00:56.820> skin<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.930> um<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.520> you're<00:00:59.670> pale

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
light skin like um like if you're pale

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.200 
light skin like um like if you're pale
then<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:02.100> won't<00:01:02.340> really<00:01:02.550> show<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.180> your

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
then it won't really show up on your

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
then it won't really show up on your
skin<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.719> well<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.470> won't<00:01:04.799> um<00:01:05.210> really

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
