what<00:02:26.400> fallout<00:02:26.880> 4<00:02:27.180> could<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.080> like<00:02:28.319> with<00:02:28.560> three

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739

dog<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.550> in<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.030> don't<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:30.959> he<00:02:31.080> will

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
dog if he is in it I don't think he will

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229 
dog if he is in it I don't think he will
actually<00:02:31.590> his<00:02:31.800> character<00:02:32.310> will<00:02:32.519> directly<00:02:32.940> be

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
actually his character will directly be

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.390 
actually his character will directly be
there<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.569> i<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.440> character<00:02:35.190> in

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
there but i think we are character in

there but i think we are character in
fallout<00:02:35.819> 4<00:02:35.849> could<00:02:36.750> have<00:02:37.050> there<00:02:37.410> could<00:02:37.590> be<00:02:37.620> like

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
this would be a great thing for the

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560 
this would be a great thing for the
series<00:04:44.490> if<00:04:44.640> they<00:04:44.790> brought<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.240> New<00:04:45.390> York

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
series if they brought it to New York

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.570 
series if they brought it to New York
and<00:04:45.780> Massachusetts<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.710> obviously<00:04:47.340> if<00:04:47.460> they

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
and Massachusetts and obviously if they

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.980 
and Massachusetts and obviously if they
were<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.820> do<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:47.970> i<00:04:48.150> don't<00:04:48.270> think<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.720> data

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
were to do that i don't think the data

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.890 
were to do that i don't think the data
or<00:04:49.410> the<00:04:49.440> graphics<00:04:50.130> would<00:04:50.340> fit<00:04:50.820> onto<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.150> disk<00:04:51.540> so

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
or the graphics would fit onto a disk so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.480 
or the graphics would fit onto a disk so
obviously<00:04:52.410> this<00:04:52.650> does<00:04:52.890> look<00:04:53.070> like<00:04:53.220> it's<00:04:53.400> gonna

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
obviously this does look like it's gonna

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.580 
obviously this does look like it's gonna
be<00:04:53.640> a<00:04:53.670> next<00:04:53.880> gen<00:04:54.180> game<00:04:54.390> two<00:04:54.630> guys<00:04:54.870> I<00:04:55.200> would

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
be a next gen game two guys I would

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.620 
be a next gen game two guys I would
expect<00:04:55.920> it<00:04:56.100> coming<00:04:56.340> up<00:04:56.430> for<00:04:56.610> an<00:04:56.670> xbox<00:04:56.850> 360<00:04:57.540> or

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
expect it coming up for an xbox 360 or

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.780 
expect it coming up for an xbox 360 or
ps3<00:04:57.780> but<00:04:58.650> for<00:04:58.830> what<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.070> know<00:04:59.160> crazy<00:04:59.490> things

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
ps3 but for what you know crazy things

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.970 
ps3 but for what you know crazy things
happen<00:05:00.150> so<00:05:00.330> it<00:05:00.390> could<00:05:00.570> happen<00:05:00.720> but<00:05:01.530> uh<00:05:01.590> I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
happen so it could happen but uh I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.770 
happen so it could happen but uh I
really<00:05:02.430> do<00:05:02.550> expect<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:03.090> coming<00:05:03.300> out<00:05:03.390> on<00:05:03.540> maybe

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
really do expect it coming out on maybe

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.100 
really do expect it coming out on maybe
Xbox<00:05:04.260> 720<00:05:04.650> and<00:05:05.010> ps4<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.390> if<00:05:06.510> that<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.080> case

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
Xbox 720 and ps4 and if that is the case

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.040 
Xbox 720 and ps4 and if that is the case
we<00:05:07.770> probably<00:05:08.010> won't<00:05:08.160> stay<00:05:08.340> until<00:05:09.050> 2014-2015

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
we probably won't stay until 2014-2015

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.710 
we probably won't stay until 2014-2015
and<00:05:10.860> that's<00:05:11.010> probably<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.550> if<00:05:12.030> they<00:05:12.240> do<00:05:12.300> build

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
and that's probably the if they do build

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.390 
and that's probably the if they do build
it<00:05:12.840> up<00:05:12.930> this<00:05:13.140> year<00:05:13.200> they<00:05:13.710> could<00:05:13.950> build<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.340> up

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
it up this year they could build it up

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.060 
it up this year they could build it up
at<00:05:14.580> e3<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:15.180> release<00:05:15.960> a<00:05:15.990> teaser<00:05:16.470> trailer<00:05:16.830> and

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
at e3 and release a teaser trailer and

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.570 
at e3 and release a teaser trailer and
then<00:05:17.640> actually<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.420> next<00:05:18.690> year<00:05:18.870> 2014<00:05:19.770> XIII<00:05:20.370> if

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
then actually the next year 2014 XIII if

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.400 
then actually the next year 2014 XIII if
there<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.910> one<00:05:21.120> obviously<00:05:21.510> and<00:05:21.810> nobody<00:05:22.200> knows

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
there is one obviously and nobody knows

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.860 
there is one obviously and nobody knows
what<00:05:22.800> happens<00:05:23.190> during<00:05:23.400> these<00:05:23.940> two<00:05:24.180> years<00:05:24.210> but

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
what happens during these two years but

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.840 
what happens during these two years but
if<00:05:24.960> there<00:05:25.140> is<00:05:25.260> a<00:05:25.290> 2014<00:05:26.100> III<00:05:26.400> that's<00:05:26.550> when<00:05:26.760> they

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
if there is a 2014 III that's when they

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.730 
if there is a 2014 III that's when they
actually<00:05:27.030> put<00:05:27.390> the<00:05:27.510> trailer<00:05:27.810> out<00:05:27.840> there<00:05:28.140> just

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
actually put the trailer out there just

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.590 
actually put the trailer out there just
look<00:05:28.860> at<00:05:29.010> a<00:05:29.040> rockstar<00:05:29.790> games<00:05:29.820> for<00:05:30.240> an<00:05:30.330> example

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
look at a rockstar games for an example

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.880 
look at a rockstar games for an example
with<00:05:30.840> GTA<00:05:31.290> 5<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:32.310> know<00:05:32.430> they<00:05:32.840> teased<00:05:33.840> they<00:05:34.680> put

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
with GTA 5 you know they teased they put

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.220 
with GTA 5 you know they teased they put
a<00:05:34.920> teaser<00:05:35.250> trailer<00:05:35.490> up<00:05:35.640> for<00:05:35.820> GTA<00:05:36.180> 5<00:05:36.540> i<00:05:36.570> think<00:05:37.110> it

honestly I think all of us can wait so
uh<00:05:51.690> now<00:05:52.530> down<00:05:52.770> to<00:05:52.920> the<00:05:53.010> next<00:05:53.130> one<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.610> guns<00:05:53.820> and

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
uh now down to the next one the guns and

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.000 
uh now down to the next one the guns and
stuff<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.510> personally<00:05:54.900> thought<00:05:55.320> that<00:05:55.620> follow

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
stuff I personally thought that follow

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.520 
stuff I personally thought that follow
three<00:05:56.510> the<00:05:57.510> weapons<00:05:57.870> were<00:05:57.990> amazing<00:05:58.470> in

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
three the weapons were amazing in

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.920 
three the weapons were amazing in
fallout<00:05:58.890> 3<00:05:58.920> the<00:05:59.580> only<00:05:59.850> problem<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.210> had<00:06:00.420> was<00:06:00.720> in

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
fallout 3 the only problem I had was in

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.810 
fallout 3 the only problem I had was in
Fallout<00:06:01.230> New<00:06:01.260> Vegas<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.920> felt<00:06:02.520> that<00:06:02.670> they<00:06:02.790> could

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
Fallout New Vegas I felt that they could

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.730 
Fallout New Vegas I felt that they could
have<00:06:03.150> added<00:06:03.390> a<00:06:03.600> little<00:06:03.720> bit<00:06:03.900> more<00:06:04.140> newer

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
have added a little bit more newer

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.380 
have added a little bit more newer
weapons<00:06:04.950> and<00:06:05.370> got<00:06:05.490> rid<00:06:05.640> of<00:06:05.730> some<00:06:05.910> of<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.060> older

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
weapons and got rid of some of the older

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.690 
weapons and got rid of some of the older
weapons<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:07.560> I've<00:06:07.770> been<00:06:08.070> reading<00:06:08.460> through

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
weapons that I've been reading through

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.250 
weapons that I've been reading through
some<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:09.060> the<00:06:09.120> comments<00:06:09.360> through<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.960> videos

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
some of the comments through the videos

personal<00:06:14.790> thought<00:06:15.210> but<00:06:15.540> I<00:06:15.570> really<00:06:15.990> do<00:06:16.080> think

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
personal thought but I really do think

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.720 
personal thought but I really do think
that<00:06:16.440> some<00:06:16.980> of<00:06:17.010> the<00:06:17.130> weapons<00:06:17.250> some<00:06:17.580> of<00:06:17.670> the

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
that some of the weapons some of the

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.400 
that some of the weapons some of the
newer<00:06:17.940> weapons<00:06:18.150> that<00:06:18.480> were<00:06:18.690> made<00:06:18.930> in<00:06:19.080> Fallout

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
newer weapons that were made in Fallout

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.770 
newer weapons that were made in Fallout
New<00:06:19.440> Vegas<00:06:19.560> they<00:06:20.400> should<00:06:20.700> expand<00:06:21.480> it<00:06:21.660> and

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
New Vegas they should expand it and

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.810 
New Vegas they should expand it and
bring<00:06:22.170> more<00:06:22.530> weapons<00:06:22.920> like<00:06:23.130> that<00:06:23.160> back<00:06:23.670> I

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
bring more weapons like that back I

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.140 
bring more weapons like that back I
guess

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
guess

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.000 
guess
not<00:06:24.330> exactly<00:06:24.540> being<00:06:24.840> specific<00:06:25.380> with<00:06:25.560> weapons

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
not exactly being specific with weapons

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.520 
not exactly being specific with weapons
