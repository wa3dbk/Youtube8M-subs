00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
hi my name's Dan welcome and in my hands

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.910 
hi my name's Dan welcome and in my hands
I<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> instinct<00:00:12.300> DCT<00:00:12.929> we've<00:00:13.620> gone<00:00:13.769> all

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
I have the instinct DCT we've gone all

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.250 
I have the instinct DCT we've gone all
out<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.400> board<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.910> DCT<00:00:15.660> stands<00:00:16.049> for

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
out with this board and DCT stands for

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040 
out with this board and DCT stands for
double<00:00:16.650> Canberra<00:00:17.340> torsion<00:00:17.970> basically<00:00:18.900> what

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
double Canberra torsion basically what

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570 
double Canberra torsion basically what
we<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.710> flat<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.189> between<00:00:20.279> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
we have it's flat in between the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880 
we have it's flat in between the
bindings<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> under<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.960> feet<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.710> have

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
bindings and and under the feet we have

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.640 
bindings and and under the feet we have
camera<00:00:23.480> clearly<00:00:24.480> explain<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.439> kind

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
camera clearly explain it you can kind

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.890 
camera clearly explain it you can kind
of<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> colors<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> black<00:00:27.570> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
of see with the colors so the black is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
of see with the colors so the black is
obviously<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> tip<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.800> tail<00:00:28.859> where<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
obviously the tip and tail where the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.490 
obviously the tip and tail where the
blue<00:00:30.150> area<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.840> where<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> board<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
blue area is is where the board is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.430 
blue area is is where the board is
cambered<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> gray<00:00:33.480> area<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.110> flat

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
cambered and then the gray area is flat

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
cambered and then the gray area is flat
between<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.950> bindings<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.360> don't<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.660> if

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
between the bindings so I don't know if

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
between the bindings so I don't know if
you<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.200> close<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.790> down

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
you can see close up if you look down

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650 
you can see close up if you look down
the<00:00:39.149> board<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.739> camber<00:00:41.640> flat<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the board you can see a camber flat and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.700 
the board you can see a camber flat and
camera<00:00:43.820> you'll<00:00:44.820> also<00:00:45.000> notice<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.780> there<00:00:46.350> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
camera you'll also notice that there is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
camera you'll also notice that there is
a<00:00:46.770> slightly<00:00:47.129> thinner<00:00:47.489> waist<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> board<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a slightly thinner waist of the board it

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
a slightly thinner waist of the board it
drops<00:00:49.590> down<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.010> millimeters<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.820> each<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
drops down to millimeters on each of the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.220 
drops down to millimeters on each of the
edges<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.230> great<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> torsional<00:00:53.190> flex

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
edges this is great the torsional flex

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.720 
edges this is great the torsional flex
these<00:00:55.230> blue<00:00:55.500> areas<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.430> called<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
these blue areas this is called the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.389 
these blue areas this is called the
framework<00:00:57.239> as<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.289> side<00:00:58.500> loop<00:00:58.710> comes<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.129> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
framework as the side loop comes up it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
framework as the side loop comes up it
laps<00:00:59.609> over<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> top<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.140> great<00:01:01.440> for<00:01:02.129> when

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
laps over the top this is great for when

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
laps over the top this is great for when
the<00:01:02.460> bindings<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.000> pushing<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> their<00:01:03.690> it

one<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> tail<00:01:32.689> basically<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
one in the tail basically what this is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
one in the tail basically what this is
is<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> fibers<00:01:35.130> flex<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.640> builds<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
is as the fibers flex it builds up a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
is as the fibers flex it builds up a
charge<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.689> they<00:01:36.990> release<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.470> snap<00:01:37.710> straight

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
charge as they release it snap straight

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.490 
charge as they release it snap straight
this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.790> great<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.240> extra<00:01:39.479> pop<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.110> power

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this is great for extra pop and power

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.910 
this is great for extra pop and power

new head instant zct board it's been
very<00:01:48.540> fun<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:49.049> first<00:01:49.380> double<00:01:49.590> camera

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
very fun it's my first double camera

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
very fun it's my first double camera
board<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.000> say<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.299> works<00:01:51.509> really

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
board and I have to say it works really

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
board and I have to say it works really
good<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.259> jumps<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.829> rails<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.460> had<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.149> much

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
good on jumps and rails I had so much

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.510 
good on jumps and rails I had so much
fun<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.320> definitely<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.860> board<00:01:56.130> I'll<00:01:56.280> use

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
fun and it's definitely a board I'll use

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.520 
fun and it's definitely a board I'll use
this<00:01:56.759> year

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.370 

so<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> instinct<00:02:03.999> dct<00:02:04.539> go<00:02:04.929> check<00:02:05.229> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380
