00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:11.099
 today we decided to realize 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.759
 super simple way a bumper and also 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.869
 a special rear spoiler for the xb 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.020
 10 so you will take some useful 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 plast okay you 're going to take a 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.080
 glass to get some water and you take 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.849
 a support that you go to so wet 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.380
 that your hands to be able to handle 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:41.940
 dutil plast agree so you take from 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.980
 the water that you have heated and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 you will see it will act very 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.950
 quickly you take some useful plast 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.649
 which will allow us to do the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.649
 support platform 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.260
 duke bumper 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.940
 he's already melting and he 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.260
 becomes translucent so with this 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.770
 plastic you will be able very 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.410
 quickly 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:23.780
 be careful it's hot you take a 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:25.680
 support a kind of two screwdriver or 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.390
 any account in you had 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.290
 wet a support for the plastic 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 do not adhere and here is the useful plast tel 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 that he presents himself and so with that you 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.520
 you can build your support 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 which will be positioned below the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.380
 bumper and who will come to position themselves 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.340
 on the front of the xb lice that's all 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.470
 simple to handle 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.620
 when you wet your hands it's 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.260
 manipulate very very easily 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.040
 but you're pretty thick even what 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.310
 will happen is that you go 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.799
 take your bumper as you go 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.420
 moisten so it does not stick 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:17.640
 more agree and then then you have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:23.760
 simply 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.760
 position your support 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:35.469
 like this we simply 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.469
 put it well it will be like that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.570
 and you have a support that has just been 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.810
 fact that you can color if you 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.810
 want 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.209
 as well 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:05.940
 and on the front the finish will be done 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.040
 after and you have a product that gets 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 present like this we will put in 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:20.180
 freezer to strengthen you check 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.180
 well positioning by doing this 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:32.130
 and already already he holds it will suffice then 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.130
 simply and drawbridge 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.880
 we will now put it at 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.610
 cool hours so no we'll show you 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:52.500

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:55.770
 here you are, you have a shock father with 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.810
 its support so with the little ones 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.410
 plots what are we going to do so 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.740
 it simply snaps but we will also 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.440
 added in Persian small screws that 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:13.740
 will strengthen and so we go 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:20.239
 then bored all to have a better 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.239
 strength on the car parking 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.429
 no 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:20.520
 Here's the result 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:27.960
