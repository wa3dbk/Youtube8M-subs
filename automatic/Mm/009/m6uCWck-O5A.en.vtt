00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.749
 hello press yourself 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.910
 video lessons 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.509
 then many ask 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.999
 how to learn to play freaks play 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.969
 beautiful and like all the boy bavaria 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.799
 now we will try 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.019
 deal with it did not use 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.289
 some music theory 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.749
 which you don't want to teach is possible 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.069
 although if you want to keep playing 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:26.299
 the guitar is on then she is likely to you 

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:28.279
 will need 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.890
 UAH how do you make a beautiful entry into 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.010
 the song 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 percentage try 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.870
 base enter 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.640
 take a look 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.400
 ak hordes more court plan court 4 that is, let's say 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.400
 there is no place 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 2 therefore four days of work using 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.420
 these hordes 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.230
 we can safely do 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 not a great performances song 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.060
 but as we can see it is quite simple 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.340
 just misinterpret 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.110
 in almost any order we have 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.230
 something beautiful turns out 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.410
 and if you want to say stupion 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.250
 let's say slower 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.920
 the truth about articles is that using it 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.650
 receiving item or hard rock 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.970
 Well, I do not know if there is a musical instrument 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 people in a meeting do not know descending 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.550
 regatta 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.500
 so how is it done 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.110
 let's spend our share 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.010
 Georgiy Ivaniv Rostov 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.000
 and moto starts broadcasting just because 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400
 that we are all hitting the country she helped 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.400
 which people 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.820
 Someone, for example, can do what 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 I do not know 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.700
 can even be done in reverse order 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.310
 there is when we rubbed the beginning with yura 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.340
 superiority but then opel gm finger table 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.340
 get back 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929
 neither 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.789
 rubles so you can even milk and 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.269
 build some more or less 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.329
 normal entry 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 so you can still use 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.109
 Roma I still can say 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.669
 shelter use accent when we 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:43.469
 play 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.559
 Paradise and play a pick but if 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:47.449
 you are comfortable looking for hands 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:48.809
 you are welcome 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.619
 so many people play 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.619
 like that 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.469
 he will agree to be quite bored 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:02.309
 First of all 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:04.149
 how we play we play ourselves nails 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.619
 look when it goes 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:07.789
 another down there is a favor all four 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 fingertips 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:18.019
 punch goes nails when go up 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.599
 is coming 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.329
 touch exit build blow 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.649
 thumb 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.799
 meanwhile more voluminous and generally 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.089
 quite similar to the mediator 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.679
 and so 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:32.529
 number 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:35.519
 here with try to play with accents 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.620
 Now it is high Siberia and Moscow 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.419
 I will say this 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.579
 and here on every sudan you should 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.579
 account accent 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.999
 but the floor itself is quite simple and 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.429
 so it is much better to study than if we 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.429
 not played without 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.419
 I can not quite play conquered dollars 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.870
 I think we understood 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.160
 so there is the next trick 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.410
 which we try in our essence 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.270
 court appearances and snow 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.900
 This answer is a pity 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900
 take offense pack all packs so much 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.419
 well, like a classic production 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.249
 In general, I think my shoes for a walk 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:42.249
 will turn out 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.599
 but if we tear off every finger 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.599
 subordination 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.860
 so can be done too big 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.960
 basketball 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.659
 insanely difficult 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.659
 but not very beautiful 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.159
 simple enough but it sounds good 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.419
 gn so try 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.749
 something to do with brute force for our 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.310
 world of songs that we sing under our windows 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.990
 wonderful lady 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.469
 and so what can be done with brute force 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.999
 can you turn it off some interesting 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.999
 rhythmic patterns that is when we 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.520
 if we can put it like that 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.039
 a little beer songs all maktum sound 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.319
 equally and it is necessary a little bit they are different 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:10.180
 You can include brute force several 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.180
 robbery say 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.349
 just a few tricks 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.050
 it sounds quite good even 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.599
 make an account in sums of any major 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.599
 etchings let r 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.800
 easy enough 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.899
 want unlikely but 

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:58.789
 do not want but players major network reception 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.770
 suitable for all kinds of chords 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.220
 Well, I think about how they understood 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.430
 club street pilipa nets in the yard and 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.460
 that's all 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.880
 bowing
