it's<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.750> digital<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.860> designed<00:02:41.280> for

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:41.820> uses<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:43.260> made<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> reversible

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.870 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.730> fits<00:02:45.000> either<00:02:45.210> way<00:02:46.010> we<00:02:47.010> also<00:02:47.190> move<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.850> a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
