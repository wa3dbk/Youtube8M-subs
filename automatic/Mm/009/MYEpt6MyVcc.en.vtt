milligrams of potassium just to

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
milligrams of potassium just to
carbohydrates<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.060> has

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
carbohydrates but actually it just has

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.730 
carbohydrates but actually it just has
one<00:02:09.390> because<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.259> one<00:02:10.590> gram<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> fiber<00:02:12.060> 0

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
one because it has one gram of fiber 0

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.890 
one because it has one gram of fiber 0
and<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.700> protein<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.480> doesn't<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.810> as

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and one protein so it doesn't have as

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.940 
and one protein so it doesn't have as
much<00:02:16.020> protein<00:02:16.320> as<00:02:16.730> regular<00:02:17.730> milk<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
much protein as regular milk but it is a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.220

sugar<00:03:15.480> added<00:03:15.690> web<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.440> allah<00:03:16.710> but<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.130> got

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
sugar added web of allah but it's got

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.580 
sugar added web of allah but it's got
more<00:03:17.550> calories<00:03:18.150> than<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.230> only

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
more calories than this and this only

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.400 
more calories than this and this only
has<00:03:19.950> two<00:03:20.370> grams<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.820> sugar<00:03:21.030> which<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.110> fine

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
has two grams of sugar which I'm fine

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.790 
has two grams of sugar which I'm fine
with<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.610> 25<00:03:24.120> calories<00:03:24.450> per<00:03:24.900> packet<00:03:25.440> zero

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
with so it's 25 calories per packet zero

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.020 
with so it's 25 calories per packet zero

fat 160 milligrams of sodium for carbs

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.970 
fat 160 milligrams of sodium for carbs
but<00:03:30.240> really<00:03:30.540> three<00:03:30.960> because<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.440> has<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.800> gram

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
but really three because it has one gram

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030 
but really three because it has one gram
of<00:03:32.010> fiber<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.850> protein<00:03:33.420> I'm<00:03:33.750> at<00:03:33.870> two<00:03:34.020> sugars<00:03:34.500> to

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
of fiber to protein I'm at two sugars to

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.700 
of fiber to protein I'm at two sugars to
protein<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:36.210> I'm<00:03:36.600> good<00:03:36.900> with<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.350> sugars

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
protein so I'm good with the sugars

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.360 
protein so I'm good with the sugars
because<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.070> I'm<00:03:38.370> assuming<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.240> yeah<00:03:40.370> yeah

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
because it's I'm assuming it's yeah yeah

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.510 
because it's I'm assuming it's yeah yeah
it's<00:03:41.640> from<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.360> milk<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.620> powdered<00:03:43.950> milk<00:03:44.190> or

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
it's from the milk the powdered milk or

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.180 
it's from the milk the powdered milk or
whatever<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.210> it's<00:03:45.360> not<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.540> actually<00:03:46.190> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
whatever so it's not really actually you

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.910

you<00:04:13.320> can<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.680> lot<00:04:13.860> of<00:04:13.920> stuff<00:04:14.250> with<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.580> but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
you can do a lot of stuff with this but

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.150 
you can do a lot of stuff with this but
it<00:04:15.000> 2<00:04:15.270> tablespoons<00:04:15.840> has<00:04:16.080> 90<00:04:16.530> calories<00:04:16.980> but<00:04:17.100> i

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160

it 2 tablespoons has 90 calories but i
don't<00:04:17.430> use<00:04:17.790> but<00:04:18.060> maybe<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.390> teaspoon<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.770> it's<00:04:19.980> a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
don't use but maybe a teaspoon so it's a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.659 
don't use but maybe a teaspoon so it's a

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
protein so you know I don't use a lot of

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.510 
protein so you know I don't use a lot of
this<00:04:35.680> but<00:04:35.949> it<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.160> gives<00:04:36.400> a<00:04:36.490> little

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
this but it just gives a little
