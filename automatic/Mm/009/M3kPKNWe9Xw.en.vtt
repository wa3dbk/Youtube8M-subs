00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:07.729
 with half folio or a quarter folio 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.019
 but in this case we have medium we are going to 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:13.619
 make a unit ladder 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.570
 the unit stairs are very very 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.270
 very didactic 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.650
 and can be used to work 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:26.890
 with the meter work with the liter 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.529
 work with grams are units of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 measure units of mass units of 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.989
 length and all are equal 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.820
 we doubled first in book form 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.820
 we fold then in the form of wardrobe 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.170
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:52.230
 a very easy zigzag so you can 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.380
 fold the folio the middle folio the fourth 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 of folio we can make stairs 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.760
 pokey more if we work with 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.980
 kids love doing stairs very 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 very very tiny 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.790
 we should divide this into eight parts 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 same 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.400
 and when we have the 8 equal parts 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.550
 then we look for the position that 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.450
 we call book position the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.450
 position of the book 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 it would be this 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:29.030
 very well then we just turn it around 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.150
 here would go the title to be able to throw 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 it would be the opposite of a book and then in 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.810
 inside 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.479
 Well, we have to look 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 1 2 3 4 the fifth column which is a 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.649
 very name 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.719
 and original in the fifth column plus or 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.719
 less in the center we mark 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.759
 and then we go down 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 steps in this direction and going up 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.890
 steps in this direction 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.590
 well I will give you an example that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.760
 It's done 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.870
 is this unit is the subway 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 we throw him 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.860
 and we have this ladder with kilometer 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.970
 every meter of every meter and the meter that 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.189
 is the main character 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.159
 the main one then the metro I decided 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:36.220
 centimeter and finally the millimeter 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 how to work with stairs as 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.329
 you work with what we know with the 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.600
 system of falls and bumps I will 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.030
 put an example here 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.490
 this at first is a little complicated 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.280
 go from hectometres to meters or go from 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.080
 kilometers to centimeters costs a bit 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.100
 of work unless we have the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:03.330
 system of steps and armchairs 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.970
 7 hectometers 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:13.300
 how many decimeters are not easy 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 the 7 falls a step 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.180
 and they get a lump falls a second 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.150
 step 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.360
 and two chicks come out or we can 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:30.840
 do it directly 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.900
 one two three steps the 7 has three 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.010
 armchairs 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.010
 it's pretty easy 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.129
 they also love let's go because 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.680
 This is one of the best falls 8 km 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:51.840
 passed to centimeters how many steps 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:55.550
 drops 8 one two three four five 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.550
 hello steps 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.140
 2. 3 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.140
 45 bumps 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.489
 dot 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.700
 every 3 bump is a point a point of 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.290
 Clear suture is understood good as this 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.590
 is the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.769
 the system of steps and bumps you 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.780
 I teach the last one with which I have worked 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.440
 that the originality that has good is 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.300
 see that it is quite simple and the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.300
 originality is in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.419
 works with a hard battery
