00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that's about 22 miles and how so it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
that's about 22 miles and how so it's
pretty<00:00:45.420> slow<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.079> only<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.680> restricted

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
pretty slow and only and they restricted

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
pretty slow and only and they restricted
in<00:00:47.399> speed<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.450> also<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.140> way<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> have

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
in speed but also the way that you have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.650 
in speed but also the way that you have
to<00:00:49.920> chop<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> vehicle<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to chop the vehicle down so it really is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
to chop the vehicle down so it really is
classified<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> tractor<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.640> do

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
classified as a tractor so what they do

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
classified as a tractor so what they do
is<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.090> chop<00:00:54.360> basically<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.410> off<00:00:55.620> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
is they chop basically the back off a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
is they chop basically the back off a
standard<00:00:56.309> karan<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> put<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> new<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.719> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
standard karan and put a new back on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.170 
standard karan and put a new back on
that<00:00:58.649> way<00:00:58.890> there's<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.280> rear<00:00:59.489> seat<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.059> they

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that way there's no rear seat so they

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840 
that way there's no rear seat so they
can't<00:01:00.570> carry<00:01:01.109> anybody<00:01:01.800> else<00:01:02.190> around<00:01:02.579> all<00:01:02.730> they

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
can't carry anybody else around all they

can't carry anybody else around all they
can<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.870> passenger<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.559> them<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.330 
to get something to eat and when I come
out<00:01:38.759> from<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> restaurant<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> put<00:01:41.280> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
out from from the restaurant I put the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.770 
out from from the restaurant I put the
keys<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> ignition<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.509> turned

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
keys in the ignition and it just turned

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.230 
keys in the ignition and it just turned
over<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.100> wouldn't<00:01:44.310> fire<00:01:44.549> into<00:01:44.850> life<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
over and it wouldn't fire into life I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.910 
over and it wouldn't fire into life I
thought<00:01:45.479> maybe<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.170> didn't<00:01:46.470> fill<00:01:46.590> out<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.860> the

thought maybe I didn't fill out with the
right<00:01:47.189> petrol<00:01:47.729> but<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.240> closer<00:01:48.780> examination<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
right petrol but on closer examination I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
right petrol but on closer examination I
