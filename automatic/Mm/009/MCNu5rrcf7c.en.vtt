up against the wheel make sure I got a

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.230 
up against the wheel make sure I got a
nice<00:01:00.420> flat<00:01:00.839> surface

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
too it's not just easier it's faster yes

well it gets you going so right here you

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.150 
well it gets you going so right here you
can<00:04:07.840> see<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:10.630> reflection<00:04:10.890> this<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.130> a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
can see the reflection this is a

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.259 
can see the reflection this is a
real-time<00:04:12.850> video<00:04:13.200> there<00:04:14.200> is<00:04:14.230> no<00:04:15.269> editing

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
real-time video there is no editing

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.930 
real-time video there is no editing
involved<00:04:17.080> and<00:04:17.260> just<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.680> see<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.370> look<00:04:18.609> at<00:04:18.730> how

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
involved and just to see but look at how

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.050 
involved and just to see but look at how
vivid<00:04:19.480> all<00:04:19.750> those<00:04:20.049> colors<00:04:20.590> pop<00:04:20.760> that's<00:04:21.760> the

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
vivid all those colors pop that's the

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.720 
vivid all those colors pop that's the
one<00:04:22.360> nice<00:04:22.630> thing<00:04:22.660> about<00:04:23.260> when<00:04:23.590> you<00:04:23.740> polish<00:04:24.220> the

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
one nice thing about when you polish the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.900 
one nice thing about when you polish the
Reds<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.510> vibrant<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.470> block<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.130> defined

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
Reds are vibrant the block is defined

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.080 
Reds are vibrant the block is defined
and<00:04:28.330> so<00:04:28.870> now<00:04:29.530> do<00:04:30.130> the<00:04:30.310> zoo<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.730> into<00:04:30.970> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
and so now do the zoo it into the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.850 
and so now do the zoo it into the
setting<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:31.750> this<00:04:31.930> is<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.260> setting<00:04:32.560> or<00:04:32.830> the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
setting so this is the setting or the

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.100 
setting so this is the setting or the
chemicals<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.790> of<00:04:34.180> course<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.690> fits<00:04:34.930> in

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
chemicals and of course it fits in

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.940 
chemicals and of course it fits in
perfectly<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:36.010> now<00:04:36.970> you<00:04:37.030> have<00:04:37.570> a<00:04:37.950> beautifully

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
perfectly and now you have a beautifully

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.690 
perfectly and now you have a beautifully
designed<00:04:40.050> pendant<00:04:41.050> look<00:04:41.350> at<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:42.430> could

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
designed pendant look at this this could

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.630 
designed pendant look at this this could
go<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:42.910> the<00:04:43.120> art<00:04:43.360> gallery<00:04:43.780> don't<00:04:44.350> you<00:04:44.560> speak

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.820 

these<00:04:48.910> could<00:04:49.150> also<00:04:49.600> get<00:04:50.020> all<00:04:50.200> kinds<00:04:50.500> of<00:04:50.560> sets

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
these could also get all kinds of sets

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.440 
these could also get all kinds of sets
if<00:04:50.980> you're<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.220> medic<00:04:51.580> way<00:04:51.760> artists<00:04:52.180> like<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.450> am

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
if you're a medic way artists like I am

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.020 
if you're a medic way artists like I am
you<00:04:53.540> were<00:04:53.660> at<00:04:53.840> glass<00:04:54.110> or<00:04:54.530> stone<00:04:54.830> but<00:04:55.370> on<00:04:55.850> you

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
you were at glass or stone but on you

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.800 
you were at glass or stone but on you
develop<00:04:56.650> systems<00:04:57.650> just<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.160> reflect<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:59.270> that

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
develop systems just to reflect and that

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.540 
develop systems just to reflect and that
was<00:04:59.960> like<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.170> that's<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:01.010> be<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.250> sent<00:05:01.490> me

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
was like the that's to be that sent me

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.820 
was like the that's to be that sent me
over<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:02.000> moon<00:05:02.210> but

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
over the moon but

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.570 
over the moon but
this<00:05:04.129> is<00:05:04.310> not<00:05:04.580> just<00:05:04.819> me<00:05:05.240> a<00:05:05.270> lot<00:05:05.539> of<00:05:05.720> times<00:05:06.580> I

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
this is not just me a lot of times I

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.660 
this is not just me a lot of times I
have<00:05:07.729> to<00:05:07.789> tell<00:05:07.940> you

and to give this kind of fellows best
suit<00:05:13.440> easy<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.580> long<00:05:14.730> run

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
suit easy and in the long run

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.920 
suit easy and in the long run
in<00:05:16.280> achieving<00:05:16.850> money<00:05:17.180> we<00:05:17.360> can't<00:05:17.570> raise<00:05:17.780> our

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
in achieving money we can't raise our

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.470 
in achieving money we can't raise our
vessels<00:05:18.380> but<00:05:18.530> just<00:05:18.740> like<00:05:18.920> Lisa<00:05:19.160> said<00:05:19.340> so<00:05:20.120> it's

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
vessels but just like Lisa said so it's

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.240 
vessels but just like Lisa said so it's
because<00:05:20.780> you<00:05:20.960> do<00:05:21.140> other<00:05:21.440> things<00:05:21.800> with<00:05:22.070> ice

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
because you do other things with ice

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.850 
because you do other things with ice
