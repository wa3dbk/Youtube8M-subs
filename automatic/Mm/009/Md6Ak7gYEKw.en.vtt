00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi how about friends how are you 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.940
 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.590
 I am going to show you one of the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.440
 best tricks I personally 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
 they really like each other and today we are going to spend 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.830
 directly to the explanation so that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.810
 not be so long this video should 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.119
 prove it and then explain it well 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.699
 first of all let's take out of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 our deck of cards a key card 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.260
 that is, the one that we recognize 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.660
 a lot but the viewer is not going to 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.399
 say that it is a key letter but it is 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.870
 a letter that serves us on this occasion 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 I have a very good excuse to say 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.149
 that this letter does not work which is the joker 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.129
 and tell them good this letter does not work 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.250
 let's take it out because in this trick of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.140
 I imagine does not apply or something like that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.960
 they know how 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 how this works we leave the letter 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.560
 key that is very important to have a 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.200
 key letter 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.350
 the next thing is to tell the viewer 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.860
 that I'm going to draw letters and he's going to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.840
 see an example like that and he has to say 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.840
 already when I have seen the letter that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 give it very is very important to give 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.370
 the orders or to say the steps well 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 in the viewer so that the whole trick 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.800
 go well and be surprised dojos ok 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 then we will go drawing letters 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.530
 and that when he says they already stop and they 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.510
 they stop all this but it's very very very 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.180
 important that the letters that count 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.270
 they left before he said 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270
 example 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 before we will go counting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.830
 9 10 I guess I suppose that in the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.940
 number 10 it is said as you stop 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.080
 the others plus the subject step we are going to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.800
 put 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.890
 above the key letter that is very very 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.890
 important 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.570
 of the letter of the 10 cards 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.330
 7 8 9 10 that are here is where 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.310
 he saw and obviously because they moved us 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.310
 Let's suppose he saw 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.750
 a 5 diamond 5 diamond that and what 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.720
 next the next step is to tell 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.330
 to the good viewer as part is what 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.720
 of the whole heap puts a quantity that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.570
 you want not all here 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.300
 and the next step is to give him these 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.000
 the 10 where is your letter and tell pon 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.960
 the letter you saw about this not in 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.810
 no other place 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.440
 about this that this time as 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.440
 we said is he 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.110
 the 5 of diamonds we put on top of 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.150
 here 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.400
 and tell the viewer that of the 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.710
 that nine remaining cards because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.130
 we put the one he thought here put the 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.270
 that you like here on top of this and 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.020
 those that are left over, we put them 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.650
 So with the key letter 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.630
 about this is very easy then 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.460
 we know that in all this fist is the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.080
 letter that he obviously thought and is 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.550
 our key letter 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.910
 let's go starting the deck 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:25.410
 nice to make it look more 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.860
 incredible and in this step we're going to go 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.280
 searching 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.040
 the joker or the key letter that you 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.040
 they put 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.680
 well let's go looking for that the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.280
 young man was down then when he passed 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.340
 that quickly you must pass it 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.049
 a little higher up that way and now 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.049
 we are above we look for 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.200
 here when there is in the joker the letter that 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.140
 they were on about the joe that the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.830
 we go under that is to say that all the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.390
 mallet be like this and look like originally 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.210
 I was low 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.270
 ok how do we pass the letters up and 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:13.290
 we count 10 because they remember that we take 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.720
 days 1 2 3 5 18 9 10 let's get a 10 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.840
 if it is your case if you counted for example 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.220
 two or five those who are draw that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.120
 number of letters goes up for example I'm going to 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.340
 take out a 10 but the viewer does not go 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.530
 to say so they do not know that you 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.330
 you told 10 we're going to tell you good I'm going to 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.550
 take out a random letter to see which one 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.510
 like this I like this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.350
 good yes and they pass up top not 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:50.030
 move nothing and we will go taking out 1 2 3 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:55.790
 3 5 6 7 8 9 and in the tenth nobody goes to 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:59.020
 be or should be on 5 diamonds 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.090
 5 of diamonds as you can see 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.099
 is in the tenth this is because 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.949
 we counted from the beginning so it's 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.039
 something unexplainable but that's the way it is and it works 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.810
 until you saw that I did it is not 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.199
 It is necessary for the deck to be complete 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:19.240
 I say good that I think you do it to me 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:21.220
 know and then there is very impressive 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.350
 this trick as I was telling you is one of the 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.210
 best I've seen 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.670
 and I hope that it has served you 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.040
 you liked it I will not ask you to 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.960
 subscribe because good usually not 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.750
 sure these videos even if this one hits 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.120
 maybe I encourage you to upload one or the other 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.340
 magic video over here 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.440
 Well I hope that I have served you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.270
 he liked it like I said I'm johnny and 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.270
 see you until next time
