00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
believe next city in it and there's a

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.320 
believe next city in it and there's a
way<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:49.140> wire<00:01:50.140> wire<00:01:50.890> watch<00:01:51.760> this<00:01:52.060> thing

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
way you can wire wire watch this thing

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.500 
way you can wire wire watch this thing
so<00:01:52.980> you<00:01:53.980> wired<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.580> city<00:01:54.909> thing<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.330> I
