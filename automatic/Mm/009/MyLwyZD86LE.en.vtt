about but you're both in real life and
in<00:02:45.350> FIFA<00:02:45.680> but<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.310> guess<00:02:47.209> he<00:02:47.239> just<00:02:47.630> kind<00:02:47.930> of

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
in FIFA but I guess he just kind of

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
favors getting the ball inside the net

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.290 
favors getting the ball inside the net
from<00:02:50.269> really<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:51.519> unruhe<00:02:52.519> not<00:02:52.970> unrealistic

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
from really on unruhe not unrealistic

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.229 
from really on unruhe not unrealistic
but<00:02:53.750> unlikely<00:02:54.620> angles<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.430> maybe<00:02:55.910> that's<00:02:56.120> why

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
but unlikely angles so maybe that's why

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.180 
but unlikely angles so maybe that's why
he<00:02:56.360> has<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.510> five-star<00:02:57.230> week<00:02:57.470> but<00:02:57.680> because<00:02:57.980> he's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
he has a five-star week but because he's

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.850 
he has a five-star week but because he's
just<00:02:58.459> dumb<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.910> clinic<00:02:59.480> finisher<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.350> Neymar

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
just dumb a clinic finisher so Neymar

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.039 
just dumb a clinic finisher so Neymar
would<00:03:01.190> be<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> sister<00:03:01.970> for<00:03:02.239> Pedro<00:03:02.750> of<00:03:02.810> course

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
would be a sister for Pedro of course

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.120 
would be a sister for Pedro of course
and<00:03:03.260> then<00:03:03.410> relatives<00:03:04.010> were<00:03:04.190> very<00:03:06.130> obvious

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and then relatives were very obvious

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.590 
and then relatives were very obvious
that<00:03:07.220> they<00:03:07.430> were<00:03:07.489> going<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:07.940> probably<00:03:08.209> get<00:03:08.450> it

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that they were going to probably get it

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.270 
that they were going to probably get it
back<00:03:08.989> in<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.170> match<00:03:09.319> look<00:03:09.530> at<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.739> finish<00:03:09.890> up

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280

by<00:03:10.459> name<00:03:10.700> are<00:03:10.880> probably<00:03:11.150> getting<00:03:11.330> ready<00:03:11.600> for

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
by name are probably getting ready for

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.259 
by name are probably getting ready for
fifa<00:03:12.170> 14<00:03:12.410> because<00:03:12.680> finesse<00:03:13.130> shot<00:03:13.239> will<00:03:14.239> be

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
fifa 14 because finesse shot will be

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.630
