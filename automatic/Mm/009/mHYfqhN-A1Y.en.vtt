00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
jailbreak 4.3 point one at this point on

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.889 
jailbreak 4.3 point one at this point on
the<00:00:40.230> easy<00:00:40.559> way<00:00:40.940> it's<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.300> safer<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the easy way it's just a lot safer to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.500 
the easy way it's just a lot safer to
stay<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.260> 4.01<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.640> update<00:00:44.969> if<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
stay with 4.01 so don't update if you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
stay with 4.01 so don't update if you
are<00:00:45.660> already<00:00:45.870> jailbroken<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> keep

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
are already jailbroken and want to keep

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
are already jailbroken and want to keep
your<00:00:47.340> jailbreak<00:00:48.200> second<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.680> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
your jailbreak second of all what is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.500 
your jailbreak second of all what is
actually<00:00:50.010> included<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.820> update<00:00:51.059> well

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
actually included in this update well

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.260 
actually included in this update well
basically<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.920> nothing<00:00:53.430> extraordinary<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
basically it's nothing extraordinary it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
basically it's nothing extraordinary it
just<00:00:54.510> makes<00:00:54.690> facetime<00:00:55.260> calls<00:00:55.590> more<00:00:56.309> secure

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
just makes facetime calls more secure

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.160 
just makes facetime calls more secure
more<00:00:57.449> reliable<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> basically<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.829> fixes<00:00:59.309> the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
more reliable and basically it fixes the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.450 
more reliable and basically it fixes the
connectivity<00:01:01.170> issues<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> verizon

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
connectivity issues that the verizon

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.270 
connectivity issues that the verizon
ipad<00:01:02.969> 2<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.629> having<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.710> were<00:01:04.830> not<00:01:05.040> having

was absolutely fine don't go ahead and
update<00:01:09.930> you're<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> lose<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
update you're going to lose the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.270 
update you're going to lose the
jailbreak<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.400> does<00:01:11.670> patch<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.390> jailbreak

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
jailbreak this does patch the jailbreak

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.670 
jailbreak this does patch the jailbreak
however<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.689> news<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> dev<00:01:16.439> team

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
however the good news is the dev team

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.670 
however the good news is the dev team
has<00:01:17.009> already<00:01:17.369> released<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.420> tethered<00:01:19.110> version

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
has already released a tethered version

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.560 
has already released a tethered version
which<00:01:20.640> means<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> hook<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.450> up<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
which means you have to hook it up to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.120 
which means you have to hook it up to
your<00:01:21.659> computer<00:01:21.780> every<00:01:22.229> time<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.650> turn<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> off

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
your computer every time you turn it off

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
your computer every time you turn it off
but<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.880> does<00:01:24.030> jailbreak<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.750> um<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.350> very

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
but it does jailbreak it um it's very

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.050 
but it does jailbreak it um it's very
very<00:01:25.860> complicated<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:26.850> I'm<00:01:26.939> not

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
very complicated that's what I'm not

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.039 
very complicated that's what I'm not
going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> walk<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> through<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
going to walk you through it in this

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.530 
going to walk you through it in this
video<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.490> recommend<00:01:29.970> waiting<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
video and I recommend waiting for the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.450 
video and I recommend waiting for the
simpler<00:01:30.930> jailbreak<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.799> am<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> do

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
simpler jailbreak like i am going to do

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.630 
simpler jailbreak like i am going to do
i<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:33.509> upload<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.930> video<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.860> simpler

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
i will upload a video when the simpler

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
i will upload a video when the simpler
easier<00:01:35.970> jailbreak<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.229> i<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.829> guide

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
easier jailbreak is up and i will guide

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.670 
easier jailbreak is up and i will guide
you<00:01:38.189> through<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:38.930> if<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> really<00:01:40.350> feel

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you through it but if you really feel

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.710 
you through it but if you really feel
like<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.189> jailbreak<00:01:41.640> 4.3<00:01:42.360> point<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like you need the jailbreak 4.3 point to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.569 
like you need the jailbreak 4.3 point to
go<00:01:43.290> ahead<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> follow<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.009> guide<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.549> the
