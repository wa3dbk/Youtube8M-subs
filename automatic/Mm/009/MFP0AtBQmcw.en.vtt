we're<00:00:32.590> pretty<00:00:32.949> shaky<00:00:33.399> cuz<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:33.820> always<00:00:34.000> felt

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
we're pretty shaky cuz I always felt

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.490 
we're pretty shaky cuz I always felt
like<00:00:34.420> we<00:00:34.480> had<00:00:34.629> an<00:00:34.780> advantage<00:00:34.989> for<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.379> game

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
like we had an advantage for the game

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.650 
like we had an advantage for the game
and<00:00:35.620> we<00:00:35.710> were<00:00:35.769> just<00:00:36.329> enough<00:00:37.329> to<00:00:37.510> make<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.530> work

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
and we were just enough to make it work

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.440

knowledge and now the two years in the
group<00:01:58.759> stage<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.179> first<00:01:59.420> two<00:01:59.509> days<00:01:59.659> we're

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
group stage the first two days we're

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.690 
group stage the first two days we're
gonna<00:02:00.469> try<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:00.740> change<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:01.280> playing<00:02:01.549> the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
gonna try to change that playing the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.350 
gonna try to change that playing the
Korean<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.149> powerhouse<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:02.869> here

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.360 

I<00:02:05.420> think<00:02:06.110> we<00:02:06.230> don't<00:02:06.620> really<00:02:06.740> have<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.040> change<00:02:07.280> a

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
I think we don't really have to change a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.370

mistakes
I<00:02:11.060> had<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.270> many<00:02:12.390> moments<00:02:12.630> movement<00:02:13.230> where<00:02:13.410> we

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I had so many moments movement where we

what<00:02:30.120> they<00:02:30.240> are

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
what they are

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.679 
what they are
so<00:02:31.770> why<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:33.240> think<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:33.960> have

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
so why I think they just have

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:44.120 
so why I think they just have
then<00:02:36.689> they<00:02:37.049> knew

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.790 

this<00:02:44.640> is<00:02:44.790> all<00:02:44.970> surviving<00:02:45.300> -<00:02:45.840> calls<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.440> really

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
this is all surviving - calls or really

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.760 
this is all surviving - calls or really
beautiful<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.640> they<00:02:47.910> know<00:02:48.000> exactly

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
beautiful because they know exactly

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.220 
beautiful because they know exactly
exactly

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:59.290 

your<00:02:52.440> team<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.800> gigantic<00:02:53.900> actually<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.590> just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.940 

I<00:02:59.360> actually

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.589 

I<00:03:04.980> thought<00:03:05.490> maybe<00:03:05.730> they'd<00:03:05.910> become<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.240> contest

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
I thought maybe they'd become a contest

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.180 
I thought maybe they'd become a contest
for<00:03:06.690> them<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.110> still<00:03:07.319> kill<00:03:07.680> them<00:03:07.860> because<00:03:07.950> they

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
for them to still kill them because they

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.530 
for them to still kill them because they
don't<00:03:08.250> have<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.640> perfect<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.209> they<00:03:09.300> really

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
don't have a perfect and they really

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.660 
don't have a perfect and they really
like<00:03:11.300> different<00:03:12.300> angles<00:03:12.920> perfect<00:03:13.920> for<00:03:14.550> them

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
like different angles perfect for them

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.990 
like different angles perfect for them
of<00:03:14.790> course<00:03:15.349> it's<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.560> they<00:03:17.370> paid<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.790> water

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
of course it's like they paid so water

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.670 
of course it's like they paid so water
that's<00:03:18.330> same<00:03:18.510> time<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:19.080> don't<00:03:19.260> feel<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.530> we're

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that's same time I don't feel like we're

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.350
