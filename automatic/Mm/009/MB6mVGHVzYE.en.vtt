lightning data or a cloud just I mean
we're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.020> many<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> more

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
we're going to have so many to more

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
we're going to have so many to more

different channels in terms of visible

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
different channels in terms of visible
or<00:01:09.930> infrared<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:11.430> help<00:01:11.610> us<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.970> terms

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
or infrared that will help us in terms

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.730 
or infrared that will help us in terms
of<00:01:12.360> forecasting<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> figuring<00:01:13.470> out<00:01:13.560> where

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of forecasting and figuring out where

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.940 
of forecasting and figuring out where
that<00:01:13.860> severe<00:01:14.159> weather<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> happen

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
that severe weather is going to happen

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.620 
that severe weather is going to happen
goes<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.189> maybe<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.610> latest<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> long<00:01:18.330> line

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
goes are maybe the latest in a long line

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
goes are maybe the latest in a long line
of<00:01:18.689> satellites<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.890> it's<00:01:20.040> new<00:01:20.250> capabilities

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
of satellites but it's new capabilities

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.179 
of satellites but it's new capabilities
will<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.540> than<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.229> tune-up<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.979> it's

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
will be more than just a tune-up so it's

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.820 
will be more than just a tune-up so it's
going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.580> putting<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:23.970> glasses

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to be like putting on glasses

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to be like putting on glasses
compared<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.280> today<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
compared to what we have today so this

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
compared to what we have today so this
is<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> great<00:01:28.560> improvement<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
is going to be a great improvement to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.429 
is going to be a great improvement to
our<00:01:29.340> methods<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.030> now<00:01:30.210> rough<00:01:30.750> weather<00:01:31.020> used

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
our methods right now rough weather used

our methods right now rough weather used
to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.770> great<00:01:31.979> unknown<00:01:32.159> something<00:01:33.119> always

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
to be the great unknown something always

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.719 
to be the great unknown something always
over<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> horizon<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.590> capable<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.280> arrival

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
over the horizon and capable of arrival

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.940
