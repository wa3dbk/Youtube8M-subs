obviously<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.520> pretty<00:00:20.820> cut<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:22.050> would

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
obviously this was pretty cut it would

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.689 
obviously this was pretty cut it would
fall<00:00:23.850> apart<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.810> can<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.189> the
