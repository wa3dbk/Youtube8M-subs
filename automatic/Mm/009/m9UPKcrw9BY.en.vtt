00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
I was looking for but it wasn't a very

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.789 
I was looking for but it wasn't a very
solid<00:02:53.190> curriculum<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.410> knew<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.680> the

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
solid curriculum I knew that the
