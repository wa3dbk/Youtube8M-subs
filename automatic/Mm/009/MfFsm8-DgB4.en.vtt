00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.829 
all right back again today we've got the
pc<00:00:04.049> GT<00:00:04.470> out<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:05.100> if<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.120> saw<00:00:06.299> my<00:00:06.480> other<00:00:06.629> two

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
pc GT out and if you saw my other two

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.009 
pc GT out and if you saw my other two
videos<00:00:06.990> about<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.400> pc<00:00:08.940> GT<00:00:09.330> it<00:00:09.540> was<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
videos about this pc GT it was in the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.440 
videos about this pc GT it was in the
process<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.590> being<00:00:10.740> repaired<00:00:11.280> i<00:00:11.610> think<00:00:12.240> i<00:00:12.300> made

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
process of being repaired i think i made

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.039 
process of being repaired i think i made
two<00:00:12.719> or<00:00:12.900> three<00:00:13.110> videos<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.509> the<00:00:15.509> last<00:00:15.780> one<00:00:16.020> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
two or three videos of it the last one I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.800 
two or three videos of it the last one I
think<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.379> was<00:00:16.500> ninety-five<00:00:17.070> percent<00:00:17.310> done

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
think it was ninety-five percent done

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.620 
think it was ninety-five percent done
but<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> did<00:00:19.260> today<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:21.000> ran<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
but what I did today as I ran out and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
but what I did today as I ran out and
was<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.740> looking<00:00:23.010> around<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.640> some<00:00:23.820> parts

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
was out looking around for some parts

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.330 
was out looking around for some parts
for<00:00:24.240> something<00:00:24.510> else<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.410> need<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.859> fix

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
for something else that I I need to fix

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.960 
for something else that I I need to fix
and<00:00:26.720> came<00:00:27.720> across<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.170> capacitors<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.130> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
and came across some capacitors and that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
and came across some capacitors and that
I<00:00:30.000> could<00:00:30.240> use<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.750> one<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.830> had<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
I could use for this one so it had a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.850 
I could use for this one so it had a
capacitor<00:00:32.520> problem<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> sound<00:00:33.360> but

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
capacitor problem for the sound but

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.530 
capacitor problem for the sound but
replace<00:00:34.860> those<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> few<00:00:35.700> minutes<00:00:35.850> ago<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
replace those just a few minutes ago and

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.770 
replace those just a few minutes ago and
got<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.210> running<00:00:39.420> it's<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
got it got it back up and running it's a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.080 
got it got it back up and running it's a
hundred<00:00:39.989> percent<00:00:40.079> complete<00:00:40.739> now<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.309> i'll<00:00:41.940> do

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
hundred percent complete now so i'll do

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.479 
hundred percent complete now so i'll do
is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> turn<00:00:42.719> off<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> lights<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.250> show

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
is a turn off the lights here and show

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
is a turn off the lights here and show
you<00:00:44.550> show<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.510> how<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.899> working<00:00:57.079> as<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.770> can

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
you show you how it's working as you can

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.190 
you show you how it's working as you can
hear<00:00:58.980> sounds<00:00:59.969> really<00:01:00.750> crisp

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
a little bit of a volume it's got thick

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.540 
a little bit of a volume it's got thick
and<00:01:07.840> go<00:01:07.930> so<00:01:08.230> much<00:01:08.440> higher<00:01:08.680> now<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.430> just
