00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi everyone was mega present by 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.250
 my mother with this beautiful set 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 and I left it open with 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.230
 you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.179
 is a set of 13 stainless steel cookware 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.029
 which promises a bake without water and without 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.750
 also allowing the cooking to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.850
 steam 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:29.660
 she has special beddings in the background that 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.660
 allows lower power consumption 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.020
 opening the box come these brochures 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.809
 explanation that was bought here in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.920
 italy has no explanations in Italian and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.540
 nor portuguese 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.540
 I read everything in Spanish in case 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.559
 This is the background, look at these beautiful people. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.550
 the covers come with the thermostat that 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.740
 shows the inside temperature of the pan 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.360
 do not need to be unplugged to 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.030
 control the temperature 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 I find the most it looks that chic 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:21.080
 people all caps will consult a 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.850
 statue that can be taken at the time of 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.510
 put in the washing machine 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:35.960
 Moreover it is recommended to take place in 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:38.810
 washing machine is not washed together for 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.410
 cleaning is recommended do not use 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.619
 products containing a sibling of the formula 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.540
 and recommends rubbing cooking oil 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.970
 the cookware to form a 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.690
 protector that is a good tip 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.300
 interesting that I did not know 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.040
 another cleaning tip is that with the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.229
 excess calories for them can 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.679
 end up getting a color that goes from blue 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.569
 or golden brown then it is advised to 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.630
 use any specific product for the 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:12.290
 cleaning of steel jacques materials 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.420
 stainless steel to this pan and 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.110
 above one or the other you can do the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.110
 steam cooking 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:40.379
 the inside there that I have shown 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:44.500
 Meter All Single Meter Pans 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:47.110
 that black part there I still do not 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.750
 I discovered what it is but I'll find out 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.430
 I write if you want to know, tell me 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.769
 I do not know if we put it inside the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.560
 pan to make a special baking 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.790
 or to put up there not 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.790
 burn table for example 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 So I hope you enjoyed the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.420

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.110
