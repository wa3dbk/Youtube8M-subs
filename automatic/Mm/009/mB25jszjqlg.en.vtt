00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.549
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:16.020
 Another best video of me this time 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.289
 for analysis, and I hope so 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000
 like her short time opinion about the weapon 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.300
 then explain well what I recommend 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.460
 upgrade here to weapons and too good 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.349
 Last but not least briefly on the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.330
 I also go rarities 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.270
 so the most interesting is 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:41.460
 the last word in my opinion one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.470
 clear buy recommendation for pvp why the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.590
 Moffels crazy day really much 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.590
 strongly 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.060
 one has here fan fan fire this 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.810
 week no mold and consistent 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.810
 be fired 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.290
 genetics harm small looking of the type 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.080
 then the stability you will pretty 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.500
 well throw up that's in pvp course 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.210
 The idea of ​​the name helps before this 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 pilgrimage additional precision at 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 firing from the hip will turn out for the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.870
 Weapon a petty review and so on 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 further interested in the card the 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.380
 I now have dazzling myself 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.870
 and from my guests partners 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 youtube thrown the info card with it 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.430
 It also gives a better impression 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.810
 from the weapon gets it goes on 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 we have a point here 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.390
 change weapons move faster 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.360
 faster as you count that's all 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.280
 okay big-caliber chance over big 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.470
 chance to shake the goals and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.990
 they make their mass difficult 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.479
 the handling of the weapon is also complete 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.120
 okay but not what i want 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.190
 I want to perfect the ground from the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.140
 recoil this week is extremely low 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.970
 you can imagine how slight that is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.260
 recoil is when you have it in there 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.520
 and the rift help almost at the top 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.550
 and it is a wonderful deduction 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.470
 mirror 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.890
 then the last word that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.820
 special ability beans damage and more 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.760
 stability 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.530
 additional precision additional 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.750
 Precision damage when free from the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.030
 hip means you do it at one 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.800
 headshot when he made the hip of 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.940
 additional harm if there is one 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.770
 Critical strike is in the melee can 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.250
 you then in pvp of course without pulling 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.770
 celebrate 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.430
 that is extremely strong because you then more 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.900
 I'll do too much harm 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.360
 create a pvp video 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.960
 that will probably be on saturday 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.030
 get by 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.100
 I would be in the info card then 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.640
 if you have the video here, the analysis 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.170
 a little later , the weapon is now looking 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.720
 is in my opinion like me now 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.870
 says I have a very strong PVP weapon 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.090
 as well as all revolvers so all exotic 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.120
 Revolvers are strong in my opinion 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.330
 pvp weapons for pvp, however, rather 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.670
 less I'm not such a pv revolver 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.040
 friend with the exception of destiny to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.970
 but that's a different story 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.720
 theme for me for pvp angefressene 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 people a clear buy recommendation for pva 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.190
 Torn people came shopping is not 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.560
 bad but the magazine with downing 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.800
 is just a little bit and has 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.220
 you go through pretty fast 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.870
 I prefer to be open in pvp with others 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.739
 but she is not too bad so 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.340
 tightened again 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.890
 in summary, buy pvp definitely bva 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.590
 is a matter of taste, I want to be him 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.600
 to let 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.340
 Well that was it from the last one 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.270
 word here we go briefly on the 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.650
 other part 1 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.090
 that I also said something about that 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.040
 I would like to upgrade or not 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.239
 I'm not that hard light fan I am 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.239
 I'd rather search 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.989
 but many people do not have that and 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.519
 like to play, of course, upgrade and 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.560
 no color at all, you should finally 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.590
 the game with the weapons with which one 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.300
 plays best and likes to play 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.180
 visit did not appear there now 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.730
 discussion that will upgrade the weapon 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.209
 super bvb so upgrade if you can 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.560
 or by the way, exactly the same 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:25.410
 upgrade because now is a superweapon 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.090
 with the skills they that are then 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.229
 If we had the thorn, I say 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.970
 always not discouraged 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:36.070
 that has a specific reason for me 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.430
 because someday you will get the forment 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.110
 again that you get anyway, the there 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.360
 Can and if you look after the nil you 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.960
 gets the foray and then on 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.270
 anyway you have the hat then with 331 on 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.050
 but who can not wait the otherwise 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.860
 also upgrade 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.860
 very clearly then she plants mine 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.470
 opinion after a wonderful weapons bvb 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.139
 and the bvb also very strong if you have the 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:05.260
 Skin also upgrade patience and time 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.320
 also very good with the hunter 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.750
 to combine invisibility but also 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.060
 he is a pvp weapon for pva just for the 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.620
 Dawn well suited I take because he 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:22.630
 other sniper with the icebreaker or 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.669
 black sky but see the skills 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.030
 Of course, without patience and patience 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.639
 time with invisibility and then 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.130
 something very special the falcon moon 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.020
 for ps four players had xbox unfortunately 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.889
 not or not yet 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.060
 coming so soon all the 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:45.600
 Handgun is 1a advised against 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.340
 is very pvp says for me as well as me here 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.430
 everyone said at the last word 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.380
 exotic dollars, pvp are strong the bva 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:02.310
 not bad I think in all cases 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:04.110
 better than the last word in the big and 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.300
 actually upgrade everything 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:10.650
 unless of course you do not have enough money 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.810
 or enough of that, well then I would 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:17.130
 recommend 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.200
 heerizes the two to prioritize now 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.960
 short of the rarities that I'm there 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.260
 also something to say from this 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.090
 time is chosen in the foot telemetry there 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.460
 handguns telemetry wish red 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:33.060
 flashing entry most of the 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.450
 Ingenious telemetry also does not deceive 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.490
 Not 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:37.320
 You can use them quite well 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.000
 've made a video on it too 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.590
 now who put it in the info card in 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.770
 the description wef is also one 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.130
 because you know that you can use super 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.050
 to level weapons 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.090
 I do not give away more in the other 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:55.110
 video you can see how it works 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.030
 the 2 well there you can normal 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.669
 perez upgrade a bit 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.350
 make faster 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.810
 who does not have that and who munich too much 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.100
 has that too is not bad 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.240
 I have at the beginning of the game too 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.460
 I have done in the meantime 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.630
 These ratings are much better 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.729
 and much faster 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.370
 that's why it's not for me 

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:16.560
 more interesting and then harder 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.110
 Ammunition synthesis very clear 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.419
 Purchase recommendation covers you too 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.940
 ammunition 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:26.490
 You can get a coin at five 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.260
 trade in and that's a great deal 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.789
 I would make every now and then 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.370
 if you have too little heavy ammunition 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:35.060
 because one searches and always needs 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.060
 heavy ammunition 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.520
 yes and that was it already 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:42.680
 from a small analysis to the words 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.360
 from CSU - I deliberately share that choice 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.080
 not reinwerfen again info cards 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.509
 with the partners and with the armor 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.690
 with my own videos I ask that 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.729
 in two videos because it's so much easier 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.630
 to manage is 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.160
 I thank you very much for 

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.810
 watch if you liked the video 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.880
 has and helpful even let but a 

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.590
 easier or commented I am pleased 

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.870
 always over commons then lies the channel 

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.660
 nice then i know the community is here 

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.949
 and she is happy about wet video 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.410
 or subscribe me if you still have me 

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:15.310
 do not subscribe 

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.310
 thank you for watching
