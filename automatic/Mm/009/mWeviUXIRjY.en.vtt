like<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:01.839> many<00:01:01.959> other<00:01:02.170> games<00:01:02.440> that<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:03.309> idea

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
like so many other games that the idea

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.069 
like so many other games that the idea
here<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.439> deflect<00:01:05.439> sirs<00:01:06.509> as<00:01:07.509> many<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.990> the

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
here is to deflect sirs as many of the

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:14.789 
here is to deflect sirs as many of the
gold<00:01:08.289> coins<00:01:08.619> as<00:01:08.829> as<00:01:09.399> possible

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:21.580 

and<00:01:15.799> that's<00:01:15.979> that<00:01:16.130> devil<00:01:16.340> complain<00:01:20.470> so<00:01:21.470> it

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
and that's that devil complain so it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.590 
and that's that devil complain so it
shows<00:01:21.770> you<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:21.979> matter<00:01:22.159> go<00:01:22.700> into<00:01:23.000> done<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
shows you the matter go into done and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.320 
shows you the matter go into done and

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
then you move on to the next level so I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.350 
then you move on to the next level so I
show<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.689> one<00:01:26.840> as<00:01:26.960> well<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:27.619> briefly

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.930 
as I've got they're not being trying
really<00:02:19.850> hard<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:22.430> control<00:02:22.730> button<00:02:22.910> on

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
really hard so the control button on

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.940 
really hard so the control button on
left-hand<00:02:23.299> side<00:02:23.480> still<00:02:23.720> makes<00:02:23.900> him<00:02:24.019> jump<00:02:24.260> but

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
left-hand side still makes him jump but

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.370 
left-hand side still makes him jump but
if<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.310> hold<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:25.579> down<00:02:25.900> he's<00:02:26.900> also<00:02:27.079> got<00:02:27.350> a

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
if you hold it down he's also got a

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.170 
if you hold it down he's also got a
little<00:02:27.620> propeller<00:02:27.980> on<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.280> top<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.820> his<00:02:28.970> head

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
little propeller on the top of his head

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.349 
little propeller on the top of his head
which<00:02:32.180> will<00:02:33.370> help<00:02:34.370> protect<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.820> coins<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:35.359 
which will help protect the coins and

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.080 
which will help protect the coins and
also<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:36.709> some<00:02:36.980> levels<00:02:37.400> can't<00:02:37.790> remember<00:02:37.970> if

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
also in some levels can't remember if

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.259 
also in some levels can't remember if
it's<00:02:38.239> in<00:02:38.359> this<00:02:38.480> one<00:02:38.829> there's<00:02:39.829> some<00:02:40.070> bad<00:02:40.579> spikes

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
it's in this one there's some bad spikes

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.949 
it's in this one there's some bad spikes
that<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.799> avoid<00:02:43.070> by<00:02:43.400> out<00:02:46.959> by

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
that you you have to avoid by out by

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.840 
that you you have to avoid by out by
flying<00:02:48.260> over<00:02:48.470> them<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.250> doesn't<00:02:49.790> look

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
flying over them and it doesn't look

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.729 
flying over them and it doesn't look
like<00:02:49.910> it's<00:02:50.180> only<00:02:50.329> stood<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.900> but<00:02:51.109> maybe<00:02:51.500> what

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
like it's only stood up but maybe what

like it's only stood up but maybe what
I'll<00:02:51.890> do<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.190> move<00:02:52.370> on<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.140> show<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.350> add

very<00:03:12.040> quickly<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.140> here<00:03:23.290> we<00:03:23.350> go<00:03:23.500> here's<00:03:23.710> some

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
very quickly and here we go here's some

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.350 
very quickly and here we go here's some
spikes<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:24.400> what<00:03:24.520> we<00:03:24.640> don't<00:03:24.880> want<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> do<00:03:25.240> is

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
spikes and what we don't want to do is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240 
spikes and what we don't want to do is
hit<00:03:25.540> those<00:03:25.780> there<00:03:26.200> aren't<00:03:26.500> occasionally<00:03:26.980> some

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
hit those there aren't occasionally some

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.650 
hit those there aren't occasionally some
rare<00:03:27.460> clasps<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.210> pick<00:03:28.360> up<00:03:28.390> and

that allows you to at least bump into
the<00:03:31.480> spikes<00:03:31.780> once<00:03:32.110> I<00:03:32.410> suppose<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.710> gives<00:03:32.890> you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
the spikes once I suppose it gives you

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.380 
the spikes once I suppose it gives you
kind<00:03:33.160> of<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.520> extra<00:03:33.760> like<00:03:34.000> this<00:03:34.210> one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
kind of like that extra like this one

there that I've missed as you can see if
you<00:03:37.240> hit<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.450> spike<00:03:37.690> see<00:03:37.930> all<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.440> way<00:03:38.530> back

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
you hit the spike see all the way back

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.530 
you hit the spike see all the way back
to<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:38.950> starts<00:03:39.370> which<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.210> kind<00:03:40.510> of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
to the starts which is kind of

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.770 
to the starts which is kind of
frustrating<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.970> also<00:03:43.150> challenging

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
frustrating but it's also challenging
