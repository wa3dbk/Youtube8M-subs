60<00:01:23.220> percent<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.759> body<00:01:23.970> weight<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.509> lifting

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.280 
so I have an additional 30 on here right
now<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.990> morning<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.380> waited<00:01:28.530> in<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:29.100> 57<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
now this morning I waited in one 57 so

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
now this morning I waited in one 57 so
you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.380> plus<00:01:31.590> 30<00:01:31.890> pounds<00:01:32.430> whatever<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.360> is

you know plus 30 pounds whatever that is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
you know plus 30 pounds whatever that is
that's<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.530> I'm<00:01:34.619> working<00:01:34.890> out<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
that's what I'm working out with so I

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's what I'm working out with so I
just<00:01:36.720> thought<00:01:36.840> I'd<00:01:36.990> show<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.380> couple<00:01:37.560> moves

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
just thought I'd show you a couple moves

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
just thought I'd show you a couple moves
on<00:01:38.130> me<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.759> total<00:01:39.090> gym<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.689> how<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
on me on the total gym and how that

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950 
on me on the total gym and how that
works<00:01:40.970> because<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.479> believe<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
works because I really believe that this

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.749 
works because I really believe that this
that's<00:01:43.649> been<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> start<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> everything<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that's been the start to everything and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's been the start to everything and
then<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.540> my<00:01:45.630> attention<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:46.140> how<00:01:46.259> I'm

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
then I got my attention that's how I'm

00:01:46.320 --> 00:02:37.500 
then I got my attention that's how I'm
getting<00:01:46.470> bigger<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.939> we<00:01:48.030> go

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
