but what makes a team a winner team is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.519 
but what makes a team a winner team is
if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.510> everything<00:00:30.930> together<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
if you get everything together and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.340 
if you get everything together and
that's<00:00:32.130> where<00:00:32.550> BMW<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.630> good<00:00:33.810> at<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> that's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

where the team ray all is good at I

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.960 
where the team ray all is good at I
think<00:00:36.870> that's<00:00:37.170> why<00:00:37.350> they<00:00:37.530> are<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.770> successful

always being overtaken by someone in a
faster<00:01:03.630> class<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.199> don't<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.770> there's<00:01:05.009> one

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
faster class I don't think there's one

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
faster class I don't think there's one
way<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.339> win<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:05.759> endurance<00:01:06.090> race<00:01:06.270> but<00:01:06.509> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
way to win an endurance race but you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
way to win an endurance race but you
sure<00:01:06.690> can't<00:01:06.899> lose<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.440> lot<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.800> different

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
sure can't lose it a lot of different

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.880 
sure can't lose it a lot of different
ways<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> whole<00:01:09.000> idea<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.680> make

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
ways but the whole idea is to not make

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
ways but the whole idea is to not make
mistakes<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> driver<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.330> team<00:01:12.690> spend<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
mistakes as a driver as a team spend as

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.800 
mistakes as a driver as a team spend as
little<00:01:13.800> time<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> pizzas<00:01:14.729> as<00:01:15.149> possible

never<00:02:47.500> sees<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.239> got<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
never sees you and you know you got to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
never sees you and you know you got to
learn<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.690> sort<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.320> work<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.829> understand

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
learn to sort of work and understand

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.490 
learn to sort of work and understand
that<00:02:51.609> it's<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.299> moving<00:02:52.690> target<00:02:52.870> all<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.290> time

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
that it's a moving target all the time

you<00:02:54.400> know<00:02:54.489> what<00:02:54.609> I<00:02:54.640> think<00:02:54.760> endurance<00:02:55.510> racing

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
you know what I think endurance racing

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.319 
you know what I think endurance racing
over<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> years<00:02:56.530> has<00:02:57.250> become<00:02:57.820> completely

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
over the years has become completely

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.960 
over the years has become completely
different<00:02:58.810> I<00:02:58.930> still<00:02:59.410> remember<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.010> times<00:03:00.250> you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
different I still remember the times you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.120 
different I still remember the times you
know<00:03:01.060> when<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.239> grew<00:03:01.450> up<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:02.130> long-distance

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
know when I grew up in long-distance

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.509 
know when I grew up in long-distance
races<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.239> at<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:04.900> time<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.859> goal<00:03:06.040> was<00:03:06.250> to

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
races that at that time the goal was to

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.430 
races that at that time the goal was to
bring<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.880> car<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.329> finish<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:08.200> really

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
bring the car to the finish you really

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.449 
bring the car to the finish you really
had<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.590> take<00:03:08.829> care<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.160> them<00:03:09.280> because<00:03:09.430> they

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
had to take care of them because they

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.400 
had to take care of them because they
weren't<00:03:09.670> as<00:03:09.819> robust<00:03:10.209> as<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.660> cars<00:03:10.870> are<00:03:11.109> today

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
weren't as robust as the cars are today

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.080 
weren't as robust as the cars are today
you<00:03:11.950> don't<00:03:12.130> have<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.459> watch<00:03:12.609> out<00:03:12.790> for<00:03:12.819> the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
you don't have to watch out for the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.849 
you don't have to watch out for the
equipment<00:03:13.450> anymore<00:03:13.630> usually<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> equipment

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
equipment anymore usually the equipment

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.100 
equipment anymore usually the equipment
is<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.069> good<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:16.690> go

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
is so good that you go

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.370 
is so good that you go
let<00:03:17.740> our<00:03:17.860> door<00:03:18.160> raise<00:03:18.460> it's<00:03:19.360> a<00:03:19.480> 24-hour<00:03:19.960> sprint
