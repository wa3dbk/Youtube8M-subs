my brother this spring I will we the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.220 
my brother this spring I will we the
plant<00:04:08.639> through<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.180> netting<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.720> use

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
plant through the netting and use

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.939

this increases the support on the plant

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.020 
this increases the support on the plant
and<00:04:16.320> will<00:04:16.709> help<00:04:16.919> it<00:04:17.039> hold<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.400> larger<00:04:17.760> fruit

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030
