 channel now I bring you what is a 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 review of a case or cover for our 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.410
 iphone 5 thanks to the company your 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.150
 Let's see poetic good before 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.980
 I do not want to invite you to like it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.600
 to the facebook page since they 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 they are giving away what are several games 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.650
 as you can see there they are seeing the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.689
 address facebook.com diagonal your 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 poetic now yes let's see what we 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 brings in this wonderful that is 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.230
 we'll start with what it is to get it out 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 so we can see and show you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 exactly what it is that brings us this 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.250
 they say if it's based enough on what 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.770
 it's personalization since we can 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.969
 customize to our liking 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.309
 It also comes in different colors 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 as we can see we can see that we 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 includes two pieces of plastic that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.219
 Now I'm going to show it to you and this 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 It helps to customize how it was 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.350
 saying since with this we can 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.210
 change color to our case or 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 found to see us a little more 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.130
 personalized we are going to take it out of here 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.079
 to see what else it brings we see what it is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.270
 first thing we find is something about the 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.969
 guarantee I tell them that they can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.429
 read it so we can know what 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.409
 it covers us and what does not cover us also 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.259
 let's see how you can see the one that says 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.689
 yes it is very simple the cover is pretty 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.009
 simple but good since it brings this is 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 what I was telling you to be able to 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.750
 customize what the truth is pretty 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 well those are the ones we can do 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.789
 the change of different colors or 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 even use them without needing those 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.220
 plastic voladitos to make it a lot 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.869
 easier and we can give it a touch 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.149
 different as you can see here already 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.280
 I put the ones I brought are like as 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.799
 transparent the truth looks pretty 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.450
 well but good to put it is very easy what 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.159
 only thing they have to do is like 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.259
 can see if they do not fit in a way 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.899
 they have to try to give back what 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.270
 it's the little plastic things so 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.640
 they are well and you owe me that of no longer 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.259
 they come out and that's very simple so we're going to 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 start with the second you can guide 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.099
 I really take care to guide me with what 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.019
 from the phone put it in the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.239
 imagine that in what position and see the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.110
 phone to put it very simple always 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.850
 the buttons 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.860
 that first thing they put on as they can 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.420
 see is pretty good and what I 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.490
 I really liked this one that I did is that 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.260
 I do not assure you that and we have access 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.290
 easy to what our buttons are 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.030
 Now if you liked this case or found the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.460
