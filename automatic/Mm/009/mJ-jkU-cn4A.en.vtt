00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.070 
fun to work I really enjoyed working
with<00:02:24.620> her<00:02:24.770> we<00:02:24.980> had<00:02:25.130> some<00:02:25.310> good<00:02:25.459> matches<00:02:26.080> you

with her we had some good matches you

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.930 
with her we had some good matches you
know<00:02:27.110> everybody<00:02:28.100> always<00:02:28.160> says<00:02:28.550> she's<00:02:28.760> not<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
know everybody always says she's not a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.460 
know everybody always says she's not a
wrestler<00:02:29.330> she<00:02:29.780> shouldn't<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.140> this<00:02:30.260> she

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
wrestler she shouldn't do this she

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.229 
wrestler she shouldn't do this she
shouldn't<00:02:30.739> do<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.489> think<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.120> all

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
shouldn't do that but I think it's all

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.390 
shouldn't do that but I think it's all
about<00:02:32.480> working<00:02:32.870> together<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.680> working<00:02:34.130> on

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
about working together and working on

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.979 
about working together and working on
people's<00:02:34.760> dreams<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.450> feeding<00:02:35.660> off<00:02:35.810> their

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
people's dreams and feeding off their

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.300 
people's dreams and feeding off their
strengths<00:02:36.350> instead<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.680> tried<00:02:36.860> to<00:02:37.010> expose

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
strengths instead of tried to expose

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.490 
strengths instead of tried to expose
their<00:02:37.610> weaknesses<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.080> think<00:02:39.230> that's<00:02:39.380> just

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
their weaknesses and I think that's just

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.270 
their weaknesses and I think that's just
what<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.800> have<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.100> do<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.739> had<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.070> ended

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
what you have to do so we had we ended

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.310 
what you have to do so we had we ended
