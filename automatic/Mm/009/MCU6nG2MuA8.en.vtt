how<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.239> cloud<00:00:33.450> moves<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.680> have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
how to the cloud moves you actually have

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000 
how to the cloud moves you actually have
to<00:00:34.980> select<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.690> little<00:00:36.690> help<00:00:37.290> boxes<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to select the little help boxes which is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.190 
to select the little help boxes which is
kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> stupid<00:00:38.460> ease<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.940> shows<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.510> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
kind of stupid ease it shows you you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
kind of stupid ease it shows you you
know<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.950> shows<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.180> screen

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
know it actually shows you on the screen

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.270 
know it actually shows you on the screen
a<00:00:42.480> pop<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.990> or<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.740> says<00:00:43.980> but<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a pop up or what it says but you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.770 
a pop up or what it says but you
actually<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.790> back<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.030> select<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
actually have to go back and select it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.650 
actually have to go back and select it
which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.500> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.860> weird<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.880> if<00:00:48.060> you<00:00:48.239> are

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
which is kind of weird but if you are

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.330 
which is kind of weird but if you are
focusing<00:00:49.530> on<00:00:49.680> getting<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.040> hundred<00:00:50.310> percent

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
focusing on getting one hundred percent

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.760 
focusing on getting one hundred percent
on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> mission<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.540> I<00:00:51.750> suggest<00:00:52.470> doing<00:00:52.650> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
on the mission and I suggest doing that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
on the mission and I suggest doing that
so<00:00:53.760> right<00:00:54.000> now<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.570> gonna<00:00:54.720> have<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> guy<00:00:55.079> use

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so right now we're gonna have a guy use

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
so right now we're gonna have a guy use
his<00:00:55.620> EMF<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.940> turn<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> electronic

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
his EMF to turn off the electronic

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.830 
his EMF to turn off the electronic
device<00:00:58.710> which<00:00:59.040> is<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.220> camera<00:00:59.730> right<00:00:59.820> there<00:00:59.880> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
