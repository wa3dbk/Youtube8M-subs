thing it would be very hard to prove the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.930 
thing it would be very hard to prove the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
ridiculous and shouldn't exist obviously

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.600 
ridiculous and shouldn't exist obviously
people<00:01:18.840> who<00:01:19.409> commit<00:01:19.830> gun-related<00:01:20.250> crimes

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
people who commit gun-related crimes

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
people who commit gun-related crimes

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
actions but I think it's worth thinking

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.890 
actions but I think it's worth thinking
about<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.320> there<00:01:25.770> exists<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:26.729> object<00:01:27.540> whose

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you are also insane to me but like i

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.690 
you are also insane to me but like i
said<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:14.840> always<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> sticky<00:02:15.590> issue<00:02:15.920> i<00:02:16.370> think

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
said it's always a sticky issue i think

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.949 
said it's always a sticky issue i think
it's<00:02:16.819> worth<00:02:16.969> mentioning<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.780> world

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
it's worth mentioning that the world

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's worth mentioning that the world
would<00:02:18.079> definitely<00:02:18.499> be<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> better<00:02:18.889> place<00:02:19.189> if

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
would definitely be a better place if

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.119 
would definitely be a better place if
guns<00:02:19.609> didn't<00:02:20.120> exist<00:02:21.109> obviously<00:02:21.620> people<00:02:21.650> still

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
guns didn't exist obviously people still

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.649 
guns didn't exist obviously people still
get<00:02:22.340> robbed<00:02:22.609> and<00:02:22.909> killed<00:02:23.150> but<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.540> would

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
get robbed and killed but it would

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.140 
get robbed and killed but it would
happen<00:02:23.959> with<00:02:24.109> way<00:02:24.560> less<00:02:24.590> success<00:02:25.459> but<00:02:25.819> clearly

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
happen with way less success but clearly

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.819 
happen with way less success but clearly
that's<00:02:26.420> not<00:02:26.569> going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.019> happen<00:02:27.139> so<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.739> do

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
that's not going to happen so what do

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.679 
that's not going to happen so what do
you<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.129> some<00:02:28.430> people<00:02:28.700> say<00:02:28.849> gun<00:02:29.150> control<00:02:29.540> we

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
you do some people say gun control we

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.330

need<00:02:29.840> more<00:02:30.079> gun<00:02:30.439> control<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.920> need<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.129> limit

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
need more gun control we need to limit

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.119 
need more gun control we need to limit

or even prohibit civilian access to guns
and<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.459> used<00:02:34.639> to<00:02:34.730> be<00:02:34.849> one<00:02:34.879> of<00:02:35.090> these<00:02:35.150> people<00:02:35.569> I

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
and I used to be one of these people I

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.059 
and I used to be one of these people I
used<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.840> be<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:35.959> favor<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.409> dropping<00:02:36.829> the<00:02:36.859> big

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.520 
used to be in favor of dropping the big
bad<00:02:37.400> hammer<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.030> guns<00:02:38.329> in<00:02:38.599> general<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:39.169> like<00:02:39.409> I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
bad hammer on guns in general but like I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500 
bad hammer on guns in general but like I
said<00:02:39.590> this<00:02:39.919> is<00:02:40.099> purely<00:02:40.400> ideological<00:02:40.639> not

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
said this is purely ideological not

said this is purely ideological not

based on any practical real-world
evidence<00:02:43.879> in<00:02:44.030> fact<00:02:44.359> there's<00:02:44.659> a<00:02:44.719> lot<00:02:44.870> of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
evidence in fact there's a lot of

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.539 
evidence in fact there's a lot of
evidence<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.379> gun<00:02:45.680> control<00:02:46.069> doesn't<00:02:46.250> even

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
evidence that gun control doesn't even

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.610 
evidence that gun control doesn't even
work<00:02:46.849> in<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.329> United<00:02:47.810> States<00:02:47.840> at<00:02:48.290> least<00:02:48.500> I

work in the United States at least I

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.259 
work in the United States at least I
think<00:02:48.829> any<00:02:49.040> time<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.370> state<00:02:49.730> has<00:02:49.969> imposed

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
think any time a state has imposed

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.330 
think any time a state has imposed
stricter<00:02:50.900> gun<00:02:51.169> laws<00:02:51.199> either<00:02:51.949> the<00:02:52.069> crime<00:02:52.310> rate

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
stricter gun laws either the crime rate

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.490 
stricter gun laws either the crime rate
didn't<00:02:52.849> change<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.449> got<00:02:53.569> worse<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.049> people

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
didn't change or it got worse and people

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.649 
didn't change or it got worse and people
say<00:02:54.769> well<00:02:55.189> that's<00:02:55.400> because<00:02:55.849> if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> ban<00:02:56.359> guns

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
say well that's because if you ban guns

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.209 
say well that's because if you ban guns
and<00:02:56.959> only<00:02:57.230> criminals<00:02:57.739> are<00:02:57.829> going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.099> have

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:58.219 
and only criminals are going to have

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.589 
and only criminals are going to have
guns<00:02:58.519> but<00:02:59.000> that's<00:02:59.180> kind<00:02:59.419> of<00:02:59.449> an

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
guns but that's kind of an

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.080 
guns but that's kind of an
oversimplification<00:03:00.370> because<00:03:01.370> many<00:03:01.790> many

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
oversimplification because many many

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.759 
oversimplification because many many
crimes<00:03:02.419> are<00:03:02.629> committed<00:03:02.810> with<00:03:03.199> guns<00:03:03.230> that<00:03:03.650> were

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
crimes are committed with guns that were

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.559 
crimes are committed with guns that were
initially<00:03:04.129> bought<00:03:04.579> legally<00:03:04.819> now<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.329> lot<00:03:05.540> of

initially bought legally now a lot of

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.420 
initially bought legally now a lot of
people<00:03:05.959> have<00:03:06.079> independently<00:03:06.650> concluded<00:03:07.280> that

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
people have independently concluded that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.220
