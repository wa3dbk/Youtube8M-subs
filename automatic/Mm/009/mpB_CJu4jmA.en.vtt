00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.980
 type of 377 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.360
 and today I bring you a tutorial of how it is 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.360
 that really in linux 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:22.810
 what we have to do is go to this 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.810
 link that I will leave in the description 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.400
 for now I will do 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.079
 this tutorial is 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.720
 Y 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.790
 of brands of these bikes 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.360
 I do not know would be interesting 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.360
 here 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.950
 and they unload us 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:02.410
 and the prisoner is a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.410
 it's worth once downloaded 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:17.080
 this zip point file 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.080
 and you can see in extract here 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.760
 this simply 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.530
 the friction in the folder of preference 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.440
 we are going to open and it will be in this 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.770
 point file since it 's minecraft 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.820
 and well this habit is believed 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.480
 The first thing is this that you're going to have 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:52.290
 first right click properties 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.180
 and this permits good you are uninhabited 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.980
 and we're going to enable it to execute 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.140
 the file as a program 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.100
 Once you do that it will be ready and 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.100
 it works at the moment 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.970
 here in me you are pirate minecraft 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.320
 the original can be downloaded very easy 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.320
 from the original page 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.880
 and you the same delivery that goes away 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.050
 to update to the latest version 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.569
 in this case the most recent version 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.459
 but wrong is the 1.5 point 1 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.900
 and you are not going to leave this 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.730
 they are just going to load minecraft 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 normal 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.180
 all right 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.819
 at the moment I have many positions 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.400
 and because 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.150
 teach 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.150
 and install 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.130
 this what is it about and with minecraft 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.600
 and they are minecraft icons since it is this 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.390
 and this 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.790
 I prefer this month because I like it more 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.780
 which are used to put styles 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.780
 moisturizing here 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.750
 kurt file and johan but I have a 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.130
 image to identify them and not do it 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.130
 you can let it work well 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.519
 anyway 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.950
 hello right now the violence how to put 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.530
 what if I'm not wrong is the same 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.590
 in ubuntu since this is different is 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.360
 linux mint 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.360
 in a similar press 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.639
 and that I think to change the icon 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.840
 civilian of good he can dispose him or not 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.540
 can read 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.110
 you can put the other one and with what 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.920
 want 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.920
 this file I do not know why they are 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.350
 but as you see here will be minecraft 1.5 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.350
 point 1 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.810
 to put icons on the icon and decide 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.810
 and so ugly 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:39.479
 right click properties 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:39.479
 and here he gives 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.249
 and well you can select any 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.840
 another imagine that it will not look so good 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:50.630
