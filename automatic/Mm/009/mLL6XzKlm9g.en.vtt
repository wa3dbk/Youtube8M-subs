00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.869
 we come here to 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.650
 the boss of the order 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 for 109 to improve 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.650
 on the bottom all this 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.890
 instead of going to high school 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.070
 we can do the training at the same time 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.070
 she is going 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.320
 it allows us to see already made a return on the matches of the weekend of 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 being able to rework things upset by the workout 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.630
 it's been a while since cantons earlier 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 it makes me work their modalities 2 the facilities 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.020
 to do our written homework so it helps us this is what allows the contract 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.890
 help 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 things we do not have time to work 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.710
 so those who are more or less said that they are more focused sure 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.190
 not sure 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.550
 bases 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.670
 for me that's what comes out of the level but for 100 euros I think it's 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.240
 can make me progress all 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.190
 even if they made dissatisfied 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.180
 it allows us to camp from marib to club training to have taken place 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.180
 otherwise extra and from before it was faster than the others 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.960
 with them 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.950
 please hate 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.850
 we have taken steps to ensure that young people in the plc can 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.200
 follow launched when a harmonious way to college also 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.070
 to be able to train at the highest level 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.710
 as for them to do this she reads them embedded in classes to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.240
 arranged schedules that are 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.170
 its college members we have two by division 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.540
 it's about having time slots available so that they can 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
 to train regularly every day if it is necessary 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.140
 must know that we are struggling to ski with a triple objective for these young people to 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.000
 know that he can succeed in their passion succeed high level sports 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690
 this is the interest of the club's uninteresting youth 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.610
 we also want to make sure that he succeeds 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.610
 at school level with specific indicators to know 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.330
 Moreover, the percentage of success in the brevet des collèges 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.719
 passage so far in our classes we have released to know 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.049
 on% of success at the college patent and virtually 100% of 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.829
 positive success finally from third 8% reinforcing a third 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.180
 objective which is self-evident but which for us also to be important 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.049
 really keeps responsible citizens informed that they have an attitude 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.760
 km of examples all their college mates polled for us sportsmen 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.760
 of high level and as such it is worth exploit 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.919
 thanks acea 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 7 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.520
 it's been several years since we realized that the youth championships 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.670
 sales level is 14-18 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.370
 she's playing higher level she's interested in the world to bring to these 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.859
 young born with oneself 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.559
 thanks to this center, we can allow them to progress 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.769
 much faster on the workouts one is 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.339
 only on the individual fundamentals we come back on things 

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.269
 deeper we do not have time to do three meals we do not have time 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.149
 to do but on the canals lingers too much% on science club for 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.139
 his work undertaken between sète and iga main by session when one has the 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:16.049
 time to do muscle building to come back I got 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.189
 much simpler it takes proprioception and turnarounds on 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.139
 places the label in basel
