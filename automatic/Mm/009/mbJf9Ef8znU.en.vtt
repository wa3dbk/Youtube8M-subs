00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.450 
one hundred percent legit solo so what
you're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.530> seen<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.920> video<00:00:14.099> the

you're going to be seen in the video the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.609 
you're going to be seen in the video the
reason<00:00:14.730> why<00:00:14.820> it's<00:00:15.030> not<00:00:15.210> legit<00:00:15.660> is<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.379> I

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
reason why it's not legit is because I

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.320 
reason why it's not legit is because I
had<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.100> friend<00:00:17.369> helped<00:00:17.760> me<00:00:17.820> out<00:00:17.910> with<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
had a friend helped me out with a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.900 
had a friend helped me out with a
certain<00:00:18.930> part<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> next<00:00:19.920> kill<00:00:20.100> which<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
certain part of the next kill which is

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
certain part of the next kill which is
he<00:00:21.150> killed<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.570> blood<00:00:21.750> Reavers<00:00:22.109> during<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
he killed the blood Reavers during the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
he killed the blood Reavers during the
blood<00:00:22.769> phase<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.760> other<00:00:24.060> than<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.539> pretty

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
blood phase so other than that I pretty

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900 
blood phase so other than that I pretty
much<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.260> load<00:00:25.470> necks<00:00:25.769> although<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
much so load necks although you know of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 
much so load necks although you know of
course<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.359> doesn't<00:00:27.539> count<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.349> legit<00:00:28.830> next

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
course it doesn't count as a legit next

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640 
course it doesn't count as a legit next
solo<00:00:29.429> however<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.050> taking<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
solo however you know it's taking me a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
solo however you know it's taking me a
lot<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.920> time<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.399> actually<00:00:32.520> figure<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.149> out

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
lot of time to actually figure this out

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
lot of time to actually figure this out
next<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> quite<00:00:34.559> difficult<00:00:34.860> when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.489> first

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
next is quite difficult when you first

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.690 
next is quite difficult when you first
try<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> solo<00:00:37.020> her<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.219> wanted

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
try to solo her and I just I just wanted

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.700 
try to solo her and I just I just wanted
to<00:00:38.790> show<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.149> off<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.260> because

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
to show this off because that because

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.869 
to show this off because that because
it's<00:00:40.829> incredibly<00:00:41.309> impressive<00:00:41.640> because

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
it's incredibly impressive because

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.310 
it's incredibly impressive because
there's<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> lot<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.329> people<00:00:42.660> who<00:00:42.750> can<00:00:42.989> solo

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
there's a lot of people who can solo

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.040 
there's a lot of people who can solo
next<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.250> more<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:46.020> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
next but more just because that for me I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.709 
next but more just because that for me I
think<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> decent<00:00:47.520> personal<00:00:48.239> achievement

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think is a decent personal achievement

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.229 
think is a decent personal achievement
so<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.160> was<00:00:50.160> trying<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> learn<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.789> solo<00:00:51.030> max

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
so I was trying to learn how to solo max

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.060 
so I was trying to learn how to solo max
last<00:00:51.449> night<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> i<00:00:51.960> don't<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.410> six<00:00:52.920> or

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.369 
last night it i don't know like six or
seven<00:00:53.250> attempts<00:00:53.910> most<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.750> them<00:00:54.870> did<00:00:55.020> not<00:00:55.050> go

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
seven attempts most of them did not go

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.650 
seven attempts most of them did not go
very<00:00:55.410> well<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.829> admit<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.340> died<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.270> half<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
very well I admit I died on like half of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.200 
very well I admit I died on like half of
them<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> had<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> teleport<00:00:58.770> away<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.219> most<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
them and had to teleport away on most of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
them and had to teleport away on most of
the<00:01:00.270> rest<00:01:00.480> ones<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> next<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.890> does<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.070> lot

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
the rest ones and next just does a lot

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.719 
the rest ones and next just does a lot
of<00:01:02.460> damage<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.390> her<00:01:03.780> damage<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.350> raised

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
of damage now on her damage was raised

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.830 
of damage now on her damage was raised
supposedly<00:01:05.729> or<00:01:05.970> damage<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.420> supposed<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
supposedly or damage was supposed to be

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.410 
supposedly or damage was supposed to be
raised<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.260> scale<00:01:07.860> because<00:01:08.400> all<00:01:08.850> life<00:01:09.119> points

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
raised to scale because all life points

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.820 
raised to scale because all life points
were<00:01:09.510> boosted<00:01:09.840> next<00:01:10.260> his<00:01:10.380> damage<00:01:10.650> was

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
were boosted next his damage was

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.109 
were boosted next his damage was
supposed<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> be<00:01:11.220> raised<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.520> scale<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:11.970> I'm

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
supposed to be raised to scale but I'm

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.120 
supposed to be raised to scale but I'm
pretty<00:01:12.450> sure<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:12.990> raised<00:01:13.229> like<00:01:13.530> even<00:01:13.920> more

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
pretty sure it was raised like even more

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.550 
pretty sure it was raised like even more
than<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> scale<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.330> she<00:01:15.960> does<00:01:16.140> do<00:01:16.380> more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
than just to scale so she does do more

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.690 
than just to scale so she does do more
damage<00:01:16.740> than<00:01:16.979> she<00:01:17.159> did<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> past<00:01:17.549> because

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
damage than she did in the past because

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.609 
damage than she did in the past because
I<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.060> attempted<00:01:18.420> next<00:01:18.840> close<00:01:19.020> before<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I have attempted next close before and I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
I have attempted next close before and I
don't<00:01:19.680> remember<00:01:20.189> her<00:01:20.340> hitting<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.909> hard<00:01:21.240> but

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
don't remember her hitting this hard but

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
don't remember her hitting this hard but
at<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> same<00:01:22.290> time<00:01:22.590> saradomin<00:01:23.009> brews<00:01:23.369> were

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
at the same time saradomin brews were

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.429 
at the same time saradomin brews were
buffed<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.420> he'll<00:01:24.630> 1000<00:01:25.290> per

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
buffed as well then now he'll 1000 per

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.859 
buffed as well then now he'll 1000 per
dose<00:01:25.590> instead<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> 500<00:01:26.729> per<00:01:26.850> dose<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.270> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
dose instead of 500 per dose so that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.319 
dose instead of 500 per dose so that
kind<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.170> helps<00:01:28.439> out<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.860> as<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.329> but

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
kind of helps out a bit as well but

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.730 
kind of helps out a bit as well but
anyway<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.750> you're<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.200> seen<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
anyway what you're going to be seen is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.249 
anyway what you're going to be seen is
yeah<00:01:32.369> once<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.880> start<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.240> blood<00:01:33.450> phase<00:01:33.659> my

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
yeah once we start in blood phase my

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050 
yeah once we start in blood phase my
friend<00:01:34.500> comes<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.040> he<00:01:35.100> does<00:01:35.310> kill<00:01:35.610> Reavers

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
friend comes in and he does kill Reavers

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.140 
friend comes in and he does kill Reavers
on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.869> first<00:01:37.770> siphon<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.430> seconds<00:01:38.880> happen

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
on the first siphon or seconds happen

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.749 
on the first siphon or seconds happen
yeah<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:39.930> siphon<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.320> one<00:01:40.470> user<00:01:40.920> can

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
yeah the first siphon is one user can

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.999 
yeah the first siphon is one user can
see<00:01:41.939> he's<00:01:42.090> killing<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> Reavers<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:43.649> did

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
see he's killing the Reavers and I did

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.460 
see he's killing the Reavers and I did
in<00:01:44.159> fact<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.970> kill<00:01:45.450> where<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> managed<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
in fact have a kill where I managed to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
in fact have a kill where I managed to
get<00:01:46.619> past<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> blood<00:01:47.130> phase<00:01:47.340> without<00:01:47.780> anyone

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
get past the blood phase without anyone

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690 
get past the blood phase without anyone
coming<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> Reavers<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> kill<00:01:50.670> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
coming the Reavers but on that kill I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.569 
coming the Reavers but on that kill I
died<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.570> ice<00:01:51.720> face<00:01:52.020> um<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:53.009> unfortunately

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
died on the ice face um so unfortunately

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.039 
died on the ice face um so unfortunately
I<00:01:53.939> wasn't<00:01:54.180> able<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> one

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I wasn't able to get a one

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
I wasn't able to get a one
hundred-percent<00:01:55.350> legit<00:01:55.920> neck<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.850> i<00:01:56.880> did

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
hundred-percent legit neck so but i did

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.420 
hundred-percent legit neck so but i did
get<00:01:57.270> her<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.079> siphons<00:01:58.500> i<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.009> yeah<00:01:59.189> i

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
get her in to siphons i think but yeah i

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
get her in to siphons i think but yeah i
did<00:01:59.850> eventually<00:02:00.210> well<00:02:00.960> i<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.590> was

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
did eventually well i think it was

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.020 
did eventually well i think it was
before<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.100> kill<00:02:02.310> by<00:02:02.430> de<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> kill

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
before this kill by de to get a kill

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.719 
before this kill by de to get a kill
where<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.960> completely<00:02:04.560> destroyed<00:02:05.250> next

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
where I just completely destroyed next

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.050 
where I just completely destroyed next
and<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.180> managed<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> get<00:02:07.530> her<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:08.060> 85,000

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
and I managed to get her to like 85,000

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.820 
and I managed to get her to like 85,000
HP<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.720> first<00:02:09.959> siphon<00:02:10.349> then<00:02:10.500> she<00:02:10.619> sighed

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
HP on the first siphon then she sighed

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.170 
HP on the first siphon then she sighed
from<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> blood<00:02:11.280> rivers<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.849> managed<00:02:12.120> to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
from the blood rivers and I managed to

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.500 
from the blood rivers and I managed to
get

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
get

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.979 
get
down<00:02:13.700> after<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.819> siphon<00:02:15.239> all<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.689> way<00:02:15.810> down

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
down after the siphon all the way down

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.780 
down after the siphon all the way down
so<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.500> would<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.920> mean<00:02:17.189> before<00:02:17.370> she<00:02:17.640> even

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
so it would I mean before she even

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.399 
so it would I mean before she even
called<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.329> the<00:02:18.390> blood<00:02:18.540> sacrifices<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.319> was

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
called for the blood sacrifices I was

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.559 
called for the blood sacrifices I was
pretty<00:02:20.010> awesome<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.579> just<00:02:20.879> admit<00:02:21.299> on<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
pretty awesome but I just admit on that

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.800 
pretty awesome but I just admit on that
kill<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.780> got<00:02:21.989> extremely<00:02:22.349> lucky<00:02:22.860> with<00:02:23.310> DPS<00:02:23.810> so

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
kill I got extremely lucky with DPS so

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.270 
kill I got extremely lucky with DPS so
now<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:24.989> get<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.379> ice<00:02:25.530> phase<00:02:25.860> now<00:02:26.099> it's

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
now we get to the ice phase now it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.160 
now we get to the ice phase now it's
probably<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.730> harder<00:02:27.000> faces<00:02:27.420> pretty

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
probably one of the harder faces pretty

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020 
probably one of the harder faces pretty
much<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.530> only<00:02:28.560> way<00:02:28.829> I<00:02:29.340> was<00:02:29.640> doing<00:02:29.849> it<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
much the only way I was doing it is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.729 
much the only way I was doing it is
basically<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.480> tanking<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.049> ice<00:02:31.260> prisons

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
basically just tanking the ice prisons

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.319 
basically just tanking the ice prisons
you<00:02:32.159> can<00:02:32.340> switch<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.790> your<00:02:32.849> shield<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.180> use

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
you can switch to your shield and use

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.330 
you can switch to your shield and use
like<00:02:33.540> barricade<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.349> well<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:35.069> just

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
like barricade as well but I just

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.420 
like barricade as well but I just
decided<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.909> tank<00:02:36.150> them<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.739> easier

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
decided to tank them because it's easier

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.490 
decided to tank them because it's easier
that<00:02:38.549> way<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:39.030> can<00:02:39.209> still<00:02:39.450> drink<00:02:39.720> brews<00:02:40.109> even

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
that way you can still drink brews even

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.660 
that way you can still drink brews even
when<00:02:40.620> you're<00:02:40.739> in<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.890> ice<00:02:41.010> prison<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.519> since

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
when you're in the ice prison and since

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.149 
when you're in the ice prison and since
they<00:02:41.849> heal<00:02:42.030> 1,000<00:02:42.629> HP<00:02:42.810> now<00:02:43.109> it's<00:02:43.290> pretty<00:02:43.980> easy

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
they heal 1,000 HP now it's pretty easy

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.880 
they heal 1,000 HP now it's pretty easy
to<00:02:44.340> tank<00:02:44.670> them<00:02:45.260> but<00:02:46.260> anyway<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.739> I'm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
to tank them but anyway like I'm

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
to tank them but anyway like I'm
probably<00:02:47.159> not<00:02:47.489> going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.879> going<00:02:48.060> back<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
probably not going to be going back to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.229 
probably not going to be going back to
solo<00:02:49.260> next<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.739> because<00:02:50.040> it's<00:02:50.250> not<00:02:50.430> really

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
solo next just because it's not really

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.119 
solo next just because it's not really
worth<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.659> in<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:51.780> opinion<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.379> don't<00:02:52.409> think<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
worth it in my opinion I don't think the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.490 
worth it in my opinion I don't think the
drops<00:02:53.670> are<00:02:53.849> worth<00:02:54.060> enough<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.540> really<00:02:54.720> make<00:02:55.470> it

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
drops are worth enough to really make it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.860 
drops are worth enough to really make it
worth<00:02:55.799> doing<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.459> solon<00:02:56.819> X<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.299> like<00:02:57.510> even

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
worth doing to solon X because like even

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.330 
worth doing to solon X because like even
if<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.109> do<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.440> drop<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.799> drops<00:02:59.040> probably

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
if you do get a drop that drops probably

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.039 
if you do get a drop that drops probably
like<00:02:59.549> 10-15<00:03:00.180> no<00:03:00.329> because<00:03:00.540> that's<00:03:00.629> what<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> lot

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
like 10-15 no because that's what a lot

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.869 
like 10-15 no because that's what a lot
of<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.230> next<00:03:01.470> items<00:03:01.739> are<00:03:01.889> right<00:03:02.099> now<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.819> of

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
of the next items are right now one of

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.220 
of the next items are right now one of
my<00:03:02.940> biggest<00:03:03.120> regrets<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.780> entire<00:03:04.170> game

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
my biggest regrets in this entire game

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.259 
my biggest regrets in this entire game
is<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:04.859> I<00:03:04.889> never<00:03:05.010> sold<00:03:05.400> next<00:03:05.700> one<00:03:05.940> she<00:03:06.150> was

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
is that I never sold next one she was

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.869 
is that I never sold next one she was
easy<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:06.780> when<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.019> OC<00:03:07.440> first<00:03:07.709> came<00:03:07.980> out<00:03:08.099> next

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
easy like when I OC first came out next

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.149 
easy like when I OC first came out next
was<00:03:09.030> actually<00:03:09.480> very<00:03:09.510> very<00:03:09.870> very<00:03:10.349> easy<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.920> solo

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
was actually very very very easy to solo

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.610 
was actually very very very easy to solo
at<00:03:11.370> least<00:03:11.549> compared<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.150> she<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.690> and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
at least compared to what she is now and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.949 
at least compared to what she is now and
you<00:03:13.769> could<00:03:13.920> do<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.430> in<00:03:14.760> chaotic<00:03:15.450> maul<00:03:15.780> or

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
you could do it like in chaotic maul or

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.689 
you could do it like in chaotic maul or
whatever<00:03:16.230> quite<00:03:16.470> easily<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.919> also<00:03:17.489> here<00:03:17.669> I

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
whatever quite easily and also here I

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.360 
whatever quite easily and also here I
got<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.030> he<00:03:18.329> does<00:03:18.540> free<00:03:19.199> me<00:03:19.349> from<00:03:19.530> ice<00:03:19.769> prison<00:03:20.099> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
got it he does free me from ice prison I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.270 
got it he does free me from ice prison I
didn't<00:03:21.000> ask<00:03:21.150> him<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.750> but<00:03:22.199> he<00:03:22.230> did<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.889> he<00:03:23.069> said

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
didn't ask him to but he did and he said

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.680 
didn't ask him to but he did and he said
the<00:03:23.400> reason<00:03:23.519> why<00:03:23.849> you<00:03:23.910> freed<00:03:24.209> me<00:03:24.239> from<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.569> nice

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
the reason why you freed me from a nice

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.780 
the reason why you freed me from a nice
prison<00:03:25.139> is<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.319> had<00:03:26.010> plenty<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.340> brews<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:26.760> i

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
prison is I had plenty of brews so i

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.280 
prison is I had plenty of brews so i
could<00:03:27.030> easily<00:03:27.239> escape<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.989> ice<00:03:28.049> prison

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
could easily escape from the ice prison

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.569 
could easily escape from the ice prison
anyway<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.889> wasn't<00:03:29.099> that<00:03:29.129> big<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.459> deal

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.699 
anyway so it wasn't that big of a deal
um<00:03:29.819> but<00:03:30.720> he<00:03:30.900> said<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.139> reason<00:03:31.260> why<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.560> because

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
um but he said the reason why is because

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.589 
um but he said the reason why is because
i<00:03:31.980> got<00:03:32.129> like<00:03:32.280> more<00:03:32.819> ice<00:03:32.970> prisons<00:03:33.389> than<00:03:33.510> I

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
i got like more ice prisons than I

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.879 
i got like more ice prisons than I
should<00:03:33.810> have<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.199> just<00:03:34.379> got<00:03:34.500> screwed<00:03:34.739> over

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
should have and I just got screwed over

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.490 
should have and I just got screwed over
by<00:03:35.040> rng<00:03:35.790> or<00:03:35.940> something<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.269> that<00:03:36.500> anyway

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
by rng or something like that anyway

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.740 
by rng or something like that anyway
yeah<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.889> had<00:03:38.430> plenty<00:03:38.669> bruise<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.299> even<00:03:39.569> if<00:03:39.660> he

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
yeah I had plenty bruise so even if he

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.000 
yeah I had plenty bruise so even if he
didn't<00:03:39.959> free<00:03:40.079> me<00:03:40.169> from<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.440> ice<00:03:40.560> prison<00:03:40.829> I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
didn't free me from the ice prison I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650 
didn't free me from the ice prison I
would<00:03:41.069> had<00:03:41.340> no<00:03:41.489> problem<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:41.940> had<00:03:42.030> lots<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:42.510> food

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
would had no problem I had lots of food

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.050 
would had no problem I had lots of food
left<00:03:42.870> over<00:03:43.049> after<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.500> kill<00:03:43.680> anyway<00:03:43.949> um<00:03:44.160> so<00:03:45.030> I

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
left over after the kill anyway um so I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.970 
left over after the kill anyway um so I
gotta<00:03:45.510> say<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.959> most<00:03:46.139> difficult<00:03:46.590> part<00:03:46.620> for

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
gotta say the most difficult part for

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.589 
gotta say the most difficult part for
soloing<00:03:47.519> next<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:47.970> reason<00:03:48.299> why<00:03:48.419> I'm

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
soloing next and the reason why I'm

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.569 
soloing next and the reason why I'm
probably<00:03:48.900> not<00:03:49.739> going<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.040> be<00:03:50.099> doing<00:03:50.340> this

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
probably not going to be doing this

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.860 
probably not going to be doing this
again<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:50.849> future<00:03:51.120> i<00:03:51.150> don't<00:03:51.449> know<00:03:51.510> maybe<00:03:51.750> i

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
again the future i don't know maybe i

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.689 
again the future i don't know maybe i
might<00:03:52.199> but<00:03:52.769> for<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.099> most<00:03:53.220> part<00:03:53.310> i'm<00:03:53.519> probably

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
might but for the most part i'm probably

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.039 
might but for the most part i'm probably
not<00:03:53.849> going<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> be<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.269> next<00:03:54.510> just<00:03:54.780> sticking

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
not going to be so next just sticking

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.860 
not going to be so next just sticking
the<00:03:55.079> doing<00:03:55.590> or<00:03:55.739> truing<00:03:56.639> if<00:03:56.819> i<00:03:57.060> end<00:03:57.269> up<00:03:57.389> going<00:03:57.780> to

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
the doing or truing if i end up going to

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.080 
the doing or truing if i end up going to
next<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.260> because<00:03:58.919> of<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.459> blood<00:03:59.609> phase<00:03:59.849> it's

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
next is because of the blood phase it's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.509 
next is because of the blood phase it's
just<00:04:00.299> very<00:04:00.780> hard<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.260> get<00:04:01.379> past<00:04:01.560> my<00:04:02.340> main

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
just very hard to get past my main

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.949 
just very hard to get past my main
problem<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.970> getting<00:04:03.030> past<00:04:03.449> the<00:04:03.569> blood<00:04:03.780> phase

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959

isn't doing enough damage it's just my

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.259 
isn't doing enough damage it's just my

constantly miss so I don't know if I'd

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.610 
constantly miss so I don't know if I'd

able to do successful blood phases most
of<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> time<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.400> seems<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:21.000> um

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
of the time but it just seems like um

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
where I

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.950 
where I
the<00:04:26.370> blood<00:04:26.550> phase<00:04:26.730> done<00:04:27.030> without<00:04:27.540> help

in pernix gloves dropped on the ground
so<00:05:35.640> it<00:05:35.790> counted<00:05:36.300> as<00:05:36.390> me<00:05:36.570> getting<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.900> drop

kill even though he finished off the

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.540 
kill even though he finished off the
kill<00:05:40.260> because<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.710> got<00:05:40.950> her<00:05:41.070> most<00:05:41.280> of<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.460> way

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
to him for doing that but anyway we got

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.870 
to him for doing that but anyway we got
the<00:05:49.560> first<00:05:49.680> glove<00:05:50.040> so<00:05:50.220> I<00:05:50.250> guess<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.669> made<00:05:50.850> all

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
the first glove so I guess it made all

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.610 
the first glove so I guess it made all
the<00:05:51.060> solo<00:05:51.600> attempts<00:05:51.870> worth<00:05:52.050> it<00:05:52.200> even<00:05:52.320> though

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
the solo attempts worth it even though

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.250 
the solo attempts worth it even though
trying<00:05:53.430> to<00:05:53.580> solar<00:05:53.729> next<00:05:54.000> was<00:05:54.120> mostly<00:05:54.570> credibly

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260 
trying to solar next was mostly credibly

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.250 
trying to solar next was mostly credibly
frustrating<00:05:55.950> and<00:05:56.100> very<00:05:56.940> annoying<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.720> do<00:05:57.960> it
