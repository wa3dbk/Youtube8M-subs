00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello I am the master elric 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.490
 formerly a psychotherapist and 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.170
 creative coffee dream in paris 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 today I was talking to you in this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.320
 video of two critters that make you come back 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.869
 a little in dreams 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.270
 the snake is the spider in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.350
 traditions it is said that god 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.750
 quentin when he created the universe 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.009
 started for the land created the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.940
 creeping in this case the snake 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.520
 it is an animal that is included in the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 traditions as a life force but 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.690
 also as vice and perfidy the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.969
 snake is the life force it's 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.850
 whoever enters the earth who 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.510
 have heart can search the earth and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.649
 receive the secrets of the land so 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.430
 a form of knowledge 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.699
 he intrigues because he metamorphoses 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 he would lose me a skin and in this he 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.049
 is how to tell the animal that will appear 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.299
 the inner metamorphoses and he 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.840
 intrigue too because it is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 dangerous 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.259
 some are venomous he can choke 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.930
 it's an animal that is very fast all 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.250
 being very fatique for example in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.290
 india the life force is figured by a 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.900
 snake that curl up the sacred floor of 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.150
 human body the sacrum and that was showing 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 along the spine and 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.470
 would open the chakras as and when 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.540
 measuring the opening of the field of 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.540
 human consciousness first of the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.820
 domestication of his instincts which 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.310
 leads me to say that the snake is also 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.950
 a sexual symbol and as you go 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.630
 of the domestication of his work it is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.479
 to say different stages of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.299
 instincts of the emotional of speech 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 transmission and thought either 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.630
 opening of field of consciousness 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.750
 the ser while it is possible 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 to evolve from verticalizing these 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.009
 elements of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.250
 snake its speed its flexibility and its 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.930
 ability to stand up to standing 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.810
 right and the fact that he loses his skin on 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.849
 creates telling men that he was also 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.000
 a transformation symbol but a 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.260
 cycle symbol there is a before and a 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.420
 afterwards for the cycle of humanity there 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.670
 figures and a great cycle of humanity 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.550
 and figured by the pink robot it's up to 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.200
 to say a circle that is simply a 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.769
 snake biting its tail 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.260
 this snake gels and worried as I 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.900
 say at first he worries t she figure 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.930
 also in a dream all our guilt 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.150
 all our fears I will give you 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.230
 the example of a dream of a student in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.690
 medicine that had way dream 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.540
 recurrent where he saw himself immobilized 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.209
 by a certain by a very very big 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.900
 snake of the python style and where they 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:09.359
 were stuck he shared it with his 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.870
 professor of medicine and two months later 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.489
 late it turned out that he had been 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.970
 has a marrow disease 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.630
 spinal 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.760
 the spider has left 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.799
 traces in the human imagination first 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.139
 because he slips a little bit 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.760
 everywhere she is able to hold in 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.340
 suspension at the end of a wire 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.829
 she is disturbing and anyway 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.660
 in some countries very dangerous in 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.299
 the usual shortcuts that we can 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.380
 hear the spider represents the sea at 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.630
 beyond the sea ​​she represents the woman 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.280
 who wants to jail anyway 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.079
 in his canvas so someone in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.859
 validating in any case it is often 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.600
 a woman who educator when it comes 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.180
 of a dreamer of a radiant and at this 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.319
 I will give you an example 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.430
 of a person who was suffering from 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 phobia through 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.280
 cerrell a few years ago I received 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:06.099
 a young woman of about 35 who 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.260
 was suffering from a recurring dream where 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.829
 appeared a spider see some 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.310
 spiders this dream had already occurred 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:17.229
 in childhood but finally 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.570
 with a wide distance between 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.370
 different dream when she told me 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.630
 consulted 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.330
 it was in a hurry was several 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.669
 weekly shouted elected 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.410
 relay and he had made the decision so 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.750
 to not have children while they 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.639
 wished with her husband because she 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.580
 was not bothered by this 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.919
 dream at the first session of his 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.650
 consultation and because I work 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.199
 with breathing techniques more 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.110
 known as hyperventilation and 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.270
 his talents at and we were able 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.949
 observe a month especially since I was 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.070
 an observer position 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.669
 what was happening so she set herself 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.580
 to scream 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.699
 because she had this spider exactly 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.000
 as in his dreams it was huge 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:06.099
 spider that was landing on her and 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.500
 she tells me I see patches on 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.810
 paws then arms then arms I 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.199
 tell him softly if there are any arms there 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.449
 has people and saw two women two 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.370
 women who were fighting and when I 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.849
 asked how old was tel she told me 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.280
 said I'm 4 and a half she she is 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.310
 saw in a cradle and she saw 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.900
 these women maybe his mother can be 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.090
 other people who were fighting but in 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.430
 every case it was a woman herself 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.990
 being of scientific training the young 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:39.340
 woman that I had had she was when 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.780
 even very reluctant to these techniques and 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.560
 mother more open to him has 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:46.610
 told him it was very interesting 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.990
 because she knew that the symbol of 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.150
 the spider is the woman the mother and 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.950
 she told him that being small when 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.050
 she had returned to the area of 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.700
 the maternal grandmother after a 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.380
 divorced 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.150
 the grandmother wanted to monopolize 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.070
 the child she had just discovered at 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:09.169
 90 and the sea ​​interfered because she 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.240
 wanted to preserve his daughter from his grand 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.880
 mother for a while so there has been 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.960
 a lot of hassle when this young 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.460
 woman got wind so real from 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.169
 his life that they did not have 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.690
 not know until then she has 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.250
 stopped dreaming of spider there is to 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.860
 many other animals that come 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.419
 to visit us in our dreams and 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.820
 in our dreams pets 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.220
 prehistoric animals animals 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.200
 imaginary 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.080
 I invite you to discover them further 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.160
 by deepening your readings I 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.160
 thank you very soon
