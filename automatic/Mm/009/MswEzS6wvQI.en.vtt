00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.360
 i 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.370
 the relationship between us three then 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.250
 it's never never the same, so there's a 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.500
 kind of emotional script that more or 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.290
 less we follow but good every time is 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.800
 different and a little bit my body responds to 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.800
 all that 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.090
 from outside the circus and the show 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.960
 we know each other is easier to understand and 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.210
 understand us and know how to react and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 help us and support us in the sign and that 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.830
 It is very valuable 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.970
 in my body is the service of the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.680
 relationship that we have three and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.159
 between us and with the objects that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.159
 we try 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.470
 with very basic and very simple objects 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 to create images and from the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.049
 images of emotions 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.049
 and reactions too 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.040
 ah 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.470
 the geometry of emotions comes from 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.130
 our body in relation to the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.690
 elements that we use on stage and the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.690
 relationship that we have the three always 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.900
 we feel and want the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.550
 public interpreter 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 your own emotions from what you 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.090
 we invoke or what we 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.090
 we build on the theme 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.500
 when I am acting I am also 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.230
 connected with vania jana and with the 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 public then when I get excited and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.860
 the public is with me in the 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.260
 you receive and that makes it even more 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.720
 strong but the most spectacular moment 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.489
 for me it is when when the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.459
 show that we finished it 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.519
 looking at the audience and at that moment as 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.980
 that hear me it does not happen that I receive the emotion 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.500
 that sometimes because we get it, it gives me the 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.239
 feeling of receiving it and for me it is very 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.769
 exciting is like I have the skin of 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.560
 chicken or sometimes I think I want 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.560
 cry or is the time strong
