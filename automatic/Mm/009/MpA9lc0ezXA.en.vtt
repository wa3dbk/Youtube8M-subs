00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:03.550
28th July...

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.279
You should be able to watch it,

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.679
now that you've failed once to rescue Makise Kurisu.

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:11.175
What do you mean?

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.017
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:15.295
The plan called for you to fail once.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.915
So that you would see this.

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:24.669
What's this?

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.819
Nice to meet you, myself fifteen years ago.

00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:31.129
It's Okarin!

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.086
If you've opened this message,

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:38.736
then you've failed to rescue Kurisu.

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:42.107
It must've been painful.

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:46.598
But that pain gave rise to my obsession.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.750
So it had to happen.

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.466
You might say it was a part of the preparation.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:58.068
Now we can begin with the plan for real.

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:00.838
The plan to save Makise Kurisu,

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.994
and enter Steins Gate.

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.299
We have two objectives.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.983
First, destroy the paper on time machines,

00:01:07.983 --> 00:01:13.178
which Professor Nakabachi took to Russia.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.838
Second, to save Makise Kurisu.

00:01:17.838 --> 00:01:19.168
If I could do that...

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:23.971
But avoiding her death and changing the past are impossible

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:27.059
because of the Attractor Field convergence.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:28.466
Right?

00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:30.333
I'll be as clear as possible.

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.940
Saving Makise Kurisu is possible.

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.374
You're just approaching it the wrong way.

00:01:36.213 --> 00:01:37.371
Listen well.

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.519
You must not change the past once it's been established.

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:44.825
You must not undo what you saw that day.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:50.287
If you do either, the past will change, and all will be lost.

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.883
Remember your experiences in the alpha world line.

00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:57.305
It was only three weeks,

00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:01.219
but you should have memories of your time with Makise Kurisu.

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:07.362
Of all you and she sacrificed to save Mayuri.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:10.732
Of everything that happened.

00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:17.771
You must not waste those three weeks.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.852
You must not undo them.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:24.471
The only reason you wish so desperately to save her

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:28.077
is because of the world lines you experienced.

00:02:28.622 --> 00:02:30.836
And it's the sole reason

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:33.272
I devoted my life to developing a time machine.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.983
The reason you've managed to get

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:39.370
as far as you have is that we both want to save Kurisu.

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.257
So you must deceive your other self.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:49.868
Save her without changing the past where she died.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.626
Make your past self mistaking a living Kurisu for a dead one.

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:58.216
If you do that, the past won't change.

00:02:58.873 --> 00:03:00.136
I get it...

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.962
What does he mean?

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:03.538
Okarin, do you know?

00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:05.113
I know you'll understand me.

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:09.714
By the way, the time machine's ID is C204.

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:14.010
I'm sure you know what that stands for.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.724
Christina...

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.186
And I was the one who named the target world line Steins Gate.

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:25.353
You know why I named it that.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.829
&lt;b&gt;It doesn't really mean anything.&lt;/b&gt;

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:30.828
Right?

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.461
I will now explain the parameters

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:38.550
of the final mission, Operation Skuld.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.276
Change the result without changing the established past.

00:03:43.477 --> 00:03:45.349
The past consists of Makise Kurisu, laying in a bloody pool,

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:48.782
and Okabe Rintarou seeing her there.

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:51.558
Change the past without changing that.

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:54.880
Deceive your other self.

00:03:55.645 --> 00:03:57.085
&lt;b&gt;Deceive the world.&lt;/b&gt;

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.808
That is what you must do to reach Steins Gate.

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.538
Good luck.

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:09.248
&lt;b&gt;El Psy Congroo.&lt;/b&gt;

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:13.213
What was that?

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.191
Was that you, fifteen years from now?

00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:18.874
The voice was so deep!

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:27.190
*laughing*

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.890
Operation Skuld?

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.261
El Psy Congroo?

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:35.271
I still talk like that when I'm thirty-three years old?

00:04:37.296 --> 00:04:40.072
I sound like an Otaku who has read too many bad light novels.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:42.833
Okarin?

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.161
I'll do it.

00:04:45.267 --> 00:04:48.468
If that is the choice of Steins Gate.

00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:51.136
I'll say it once more.

00:04:51.695 --> 00:04:59.496
I am the mad scientist, Hyouin Kyouma...

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.438
And the world is in the palm of my hand.
