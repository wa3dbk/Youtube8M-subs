00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
this house and I think it's because our

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.110 
this house and I think it's because our
whole<00:06:32.770> lives<00:06:32.920> we<00:06:33.220> lived<00:06:33.430> in<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:33.640> two<00:06:33.790> bedroom

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
whole lives we lived in a two bedroom

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.720 
whole lives we lived in a two bedroom
apartment<00:06:34.630> so<00:06:35.230> when<00:06:35.710> we<00:06:36.220> had<00:06:36.430> that<00:06:36.460> other

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:36.730 
apartment so when we had that other

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.200 
apartment so when we had that other
house<00:06:37.000> that<00:06:37.030> other<00:06:37.420> house<00:06:37.570> was<00:06:37.810> huge<00:06:38.770> so<00:06:39.700> I

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
house that other house was huge so I

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.310 
house that other house was huge so I
think<00:06:40.570> we<00:06:40.840> all<00:06:41.200> feel<00:06:41.740> more<00:06:42.070> at<00:06:42.190> home<00:06:42.250> and<00:06:42.910> a<00:06:43.330> lot

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
think we all feel more at home and a lot

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.170 
think we all feel more at home and a lot
more<00:06:44.620> comfortable<00:06:44.890> in<00:06:45.310> this<00:06:45.460> house<00:06:45.700> because

it's<00:06:57.970> haunted<00:06:58.120> like<00:06:58.990> I'm<00:06:59.230> pretty<00:06:59.440> sure<00:06:59.680> every

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
it's haunted like I'm pretty sure every

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.040 
it's haunted like I'm pretty sure every
single<00:07:00.190> house<00:07:00.310> out<00:07:00.550> there<00:07:00.580> is<00:07:00.820> haunted<00:07:01.210> but

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
single house out there is haunted but

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.230 
single house out there is haunted but
surprisingly<00:07:02.740> i<00:07:02.830> have<00:07:03.220> not<00:07:03.430> had<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.910> feeling

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
surprisingly i have not had the feeling

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.640 
surprisingly i have not had the feeling
or<00:07:04.390> the<00:07:04.510> suspicion<00:07:05.020> that<00:07:05.050> this<00:07:05.290> house<00:07:05.500> is

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:05.650 
or the suspicion that this house is

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.610 
or the suspicion that this house is
haunted<00:07:05.800> so<00:07:06.460> i<00:07:06.810> guess<00:07:07.810> that's<00:07:08.020> a<00:07:08.140> good<00:07:08.320> sign

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
haunted so i guess that's a good sign
