00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.430 
during Final Fantasy 13 the writers all
started<00:00:36.270> huffing<00:00:36.600> spray<00:00:36.719> paint<00:00:37.079> during<00:00:37.260> the

dead for a large part of the game the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
dead for a large part of the game the
idea<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> giant<00:00:48.780> ice<00:00:48.899> shard<00:00:49.230> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
disc 1 actually killed him and the rest

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.340 
disc 1 actually killed him and the rest
of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> game<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> weird<00:00:54.930> trippy

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of the game is just a weird trippy

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
of the game is just a weird trippy
hallucination<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> squall<00:00:56.699> suffers<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
hallucination that squall suffers as a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.450 
hallucination that squall suffers as a
result<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.840> being<00:00:57.989> near<00:00:58.320> death<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:59.219> would

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
result of being near death it would

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
result of being near death it would
explain<00:00:59.789> some<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> weird<00:01:00.480> trippy<00:01:00.930> imagery

that appears in the game that I'd
