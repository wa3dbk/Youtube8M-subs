 after past

 all the relaxation sessions 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.760

 still going very healthy not 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.810
 lost time for the top 10 so 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.550
 really in the nails for the start 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.500
 a year center 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.900
 a palpable tension also among 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.030
 sports directors analyzed the stage 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.370
 down to the smallest detail nothing 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.250
 leave it to chance 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.130

 especially do not you speak of happiness 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.290
 afterwards we will make a precise weather point for 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.670
 to be sure of the time to omar a little 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.950
 less than 8 months that's what I thought 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.260
 when I saw the weather today I 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.270
 I told myself it's gonna be just burst 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.270
 25 35 km time 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:53.950
 it's not 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:57.220
 for tonight without forgetting the mechanics 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.620
 always at work the whole team is 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.890
 on the bridge 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.890
 jerk off 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.900
 20 44 min must no 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.590
 you can leave a little 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.660
 sÃ©bastien minard comes to take the pulse 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:40.000
 of his team relaxing moment in the heart 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:44.110
 of the team is essential to a few 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.060
 hours of a capital stage at dawn 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.260
 the staff is dispersing around the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.560
 key places of the race 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.350
 in other words the paved areas if we 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.600
 told you that like physio I had 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:02.470
 had a very good day of my life I had 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.120
 students this is his chance and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.520
 why today do you do 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.820
 are not at the kines for buses to 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.820
 stop the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.910
 today there is still a risk 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.550
 the horizon that as relatively 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.200
 important then suddenly we all know 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.269
 to each sector 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.560
 to each Paris sector to be able to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.840
 give wheels to the couriers then 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:31.250
 this is to minimize the losses 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:34.090
 of time but unfortunately not the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.090
 weather with each other 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.039
 ok big morin today it's 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.810
 important for the team on the leader ok 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.669
 you guys get it deep because 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.590
 that it's super important today a 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.340
 nice collective your communication the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.110
 naked to block 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.270
 the relationship with it will pass and let go 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.669
 never anything we know that we can at a 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.139
 moment being in a fix at 50 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.099
 at thirty bounds and stood ten 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.240
 bands further in a good 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:06.340
 situation so we let nothing ok the 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.990
 message is clear finish at 9 play the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.020
 solidarity map on the cobblestones 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.169
 simply gladiators at large 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.169
 heart
