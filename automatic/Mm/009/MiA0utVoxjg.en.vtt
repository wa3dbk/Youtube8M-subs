00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
better this year I could play one the

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.860 
better this year I could play one the
most<00:03:40.450> was<00:03:40.900> like<00:03:41.080> only<00:03:41.200> like<00:03:41.349> 14

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
most was like only like 14

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.940 
most was like only like 14
also<00:03:44.870> because<00:03:44.990> it's<00:03:45.200> more<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.500> spread<00:03:45.770> out

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
also because it's more like spread out

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.040 
also because it's more like spread out
but<00:03:46.160> still<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.460> think<00:03:46.610> about<00:03:46.970> more<00:03:47.570> tournaments

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
but still I think about more tournaments

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.590 
but still I think about more tournaments
last<00:03:48.230> year<00:03:48.440> well<00:03:48.980> yeah<00:03:49.100> it<00:03:49.400> seems<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.940> know<00:03:50.240> it's

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
last year well yeah it seems I know it's

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.390 
last year well yeah it seems I know it's
like<00:03:50.720> what<00:03:50.930> goes<00:03:51.080> up<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.620> down<00:03:51.680> like<00:03:52.070> Momo

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
like what goes up and down like Momo

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.070 
like what goes up and down like Momo
everyone<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:53.000> declaring<00:03:53.420> at<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.930> that's

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
everyone is declaring at that and that's

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.420 
everyone is declaring at that and that's
all<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.320> leader<00:03:54.500> had<00:03:54.680> some<00:03:54.830> tuna<00:03:55.040> once<00:03:55.190> again

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
all the leader had some tuna once again

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.160 
all the leader had some tuna once again
and<00:03:55.640> seems<00:03:56.210> like<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.420> game<00:03:56.540> stores<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.930> lot<00:03:56.960> of

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
and seems like the game stores a lot of

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.870 
and seems like the game stores a lot of
fans<00:03:57.350> but<00:03:57.590> certainly<00:03:58.010> China<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.520> still<00:03:58.760> very

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
fans but certainly China is still very

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.150 
fans but certainly China is still very
popular<00:03:59.120> not<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.230> worry<00:04:00.350> about

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
popular not to worry about

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.000 
popular not to worry about
okay<00:04:02.150> maybe<00:04:02.420> it's<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:03.080> tricky<00:04:03.350> question<00:04:03.530> maybe

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
okay maybe it's a tricky question maybe

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.580 
okay maybe it's a tricky question maybe
it's<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:04.490> easy<00:04:04.670> but<00:04:05.450> what's<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.140> best

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
it's really easy but what's the best

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.950 
it's really easy but what's the best
game<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.130> ever<00:04:07.160> seen<00:04:07.670> overall<00:04:08.360> we<00:04:08.720> won't<00:04:08.870> go

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:08.960 
game you ever seen overall we won't go

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.020 
game you ever seen overall we won't go
through

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.069 

or<00:04:14.600> best<00:04:14.810> moment<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.440> know<00:04:15.830> I<00:04:16.130> really<00:04:16.670> like<00:04:17.079> the

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
or best moment I know I really like the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
check lost like his main building too

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.360 
check lost like his main building too
and<00:04:24.990> still<00:04:25.290> in<00:04:25.500> with<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.710> game<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.010> not<00:04:26.190> for

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
and still in with the game I not for

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.550 
and still in with the game I not for
like<00:04:26.430> 25<00:04:26.850> minutes<00:04:26.910> over<00:04:27.570> here<00:04:27.840> like<00:04:28.020> six<00:04:28.260> units

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
like 25 minutes over here like six units

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.190 
like 25 minutes over here like six units
and<00:04:28.800> most<00:04:29.190> painful<00:04:29.580> 24th<00:04:30.270> minute<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:31.080> was

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
and most painful 24th minute it was

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.690 
and most painful 24th minute it was
incredible<00:04:31.620> crazy<00:04:31.890> but<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.310> don't<00:04:32.610> know<00:04:32.670> if

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
incredible crazy but I don't know if

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.090 
incredible crazy but I don't know if
they're<00:04:32.940> like<00:04:33.120> one<00:04:33.690> basket<00:04:34.140> map<00:04:34.320> I<00:04:34.620> remember

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
they're like one basket map I remember

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.800 
they're like one basket map I remember
being<00:04:35.280> shocked<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.760> probably<00:04:36.120> get<00:04:36.390> stuck<00:04:36.630> on

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
being shocked I probably get stuck on

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.660 
being shocked I probably get stuck on
this<00:04:37.320> call<00:04:37.380> and<00:04:37.740> they<00:04:37.920> were<00:04:37.980> incredibly<00:04:38.610> good

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.490 

I<00:04:41.700> don't<00:04:42.390> think<00:04:42.420> is<00:04:42.900> really<00:04:43.110> hard<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.290> pick

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
I don't think is really hard to pick

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500 
I don't think is really hard to pick
like<00:04:43.650> one<00:04:43.800> last<00:04:43.980> name<00:04:44.190> yeah<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.180> sure
