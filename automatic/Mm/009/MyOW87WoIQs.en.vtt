because they're so pretty so I went
ahead<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.910> got<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.480> was<00:04:01.570> about<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
ahead and got I think it was about a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.320 
ahead and got I think it was about a
yard<00:04:02.019> of<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.739> fabric<00:04:03.010> so<00:04:03.459> hopefully<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.090> can

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
yard of this fabric so hopefully I can

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.259 
yard of this fabric so hopefully I can
find<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.959> use<00:04:04.989> for<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.769> actually<00:04:05.980> put<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.090> to

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
find a use for it and actually put it to

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.699 
find a use for it and actually put it to
use<00:04:07.450> instead<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.959> letting<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.260> just<00:04:08.320> sit<00:04:08.680> on

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
use instead of letting it just sit on

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.890 
use instead of letting it just sit on
the<00:04:08.890> shelf<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:10.470> lastly<00:04:11.470> is<00:04:11.709> this<00:04:12.100> grey

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the shelf and lastly is this grey

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.380 
the shelf and lastly is this grey
interfacing<00:04:13.900> it<00:04:14.079> is<00:04:14.230> very<00:04:14.860> lightweight

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
interfacing it is very lightweight

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.110 
interfacing it is very lightweight
fusible<00:04:16.390> interfacing<00:04:16.540> and<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:18.430> was<00:04:18.729> on<00:04:19.060> a

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
fusible interfacing and it was on a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.960 
fusible interfacing and it was on a
large<00:04:20.020> bowl<00:04:20.349> like<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> decorator<00:04:21.190> type<00:04:21.489> bolt<00:04:21.729> so

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
large bowl like a decorator type bolt so

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.110 
large bowl like a decorator type bolt so
it's<00:04:22.120> 62<00:04:22.720> inches<00:04:22.990> wide<00:04:23.229> I

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
it's 62 inches wide I

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.300 
it's 62 inches wide I
it<00:04:24.360> was<00:04:24.510> only<00:04:24.780> 99<00:04:25.199> cents<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.560> yards<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.070> got

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it was only 99 cents a yards so I got

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.330 
it was only 99 cents a yards so I got
two<00:04:26.610> yards<00:04:27.000> just<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.419> try<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.720> out<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:29.130> is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
two yards just to try it out so that is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.580 
two yards just to try it out so that is
what<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:29.669> found<00:04:30.000> today<00:04:30.180> at<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.570> fabric<00:04:30.960> store<00:04:30.990> I

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
what I found today at the fabric store I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.550 
what I found today at the fabric store I
had<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> lot<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.010> fun<00:04:33.050> kind<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.169> just<00:04:34.350> roaming

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.230 
had a lot of fun kind of just roaming
around<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.919> store<00:04:35.220> not<00:04:35.490> really<00:04:35.760> looking<00:04:36.060> for

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
around the store not really looking for

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.480 
around the store not really looking for
anything<00:04:36.389> in<00:04:36.660> particular<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.500> just<00:04:38.220> kind<00:04:38.430> of

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
anything in particular but just kind of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.310 
anything in particular but just kind of
see<00:04:38.669> them<00:04:38.729> what<00:04:39.000> drew<00:04:39.540> me<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:39.990> by<00:04:40.260> the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
see them what drew me to it by the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.590 
see them what drew me to it by the
colors<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:40.979> patterns<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.970> everything

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
colors and patterns and everything

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.659 
colors and patterns and everything
and<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.380> I'm<00:04:43.560> sure<00:04:43.800> you'll<00:04:44.010> see<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.280> few<00:04:44.610> of
