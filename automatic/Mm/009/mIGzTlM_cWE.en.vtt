 German land is not about the sum of us here and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.070
 all the colors of pop art and cars 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
 if we take as an example the line of flow 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 technical designer then absolute 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.110

 came from graphic advertising he took over 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 this truncated shape i think is 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 interesting dialogue between the car and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.370
 a work of art from flour lumpen 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.510
 kunst century german concern daimler benz 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.730
 in 1986 ordered a semi series 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.960
 under the name of cars was the reason 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.960
 centuries of car 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.280
 This is the first experience of the maestro of pop art 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.290
 famous graphic 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.420
 images of american products 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.190
 for example coca cola or canned 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.190
 soups with German industry 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.110
 basis there is 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.000
 and innovations in the works of warhol is that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.710
 it shows the variability of the products 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 demotivates historicity 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.950
 not 40 years of Coca-Cola and the history of the car 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.450
 what he dedicated to his work 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.380
 the impermanence of products is already quite 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 unusual tie 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.619
 1 but not only Andy Warhol but 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.930
 many other artists and writers are looking 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:54.700
 inspiration is in contact with traffic 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:56.680
 means book and baby you can 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.650

 car story in art 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.320
 us begins a french artist 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.850
 Henri Toulouse-Lotreka of the late 19th century 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.420

 ends for today 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.960
 Panda ndnd flagship but because most 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.300
 fascinating in question as in it 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.040
 portray the car this difference between 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.470
 pictures which displays one 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.510
 the only moment and so photos and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.390
 the car which assumes the movement 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.310
 yes even movement in time and therefore 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.980
 the artist must understand anyway 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.850
 how to capture hidden motion 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.750

 objects that are of interest to him personally 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.030
