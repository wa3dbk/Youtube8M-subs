and I was Paragon rank 0 like about two
days<00:01:01.170> ago<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.739> I've<00:01:01.890> been<00:01:01.949> playing<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.280> quite

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
days ago so I've been playing this quite

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
days ago so I've been playing this quite
a<00:01:02.489> bit<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.730> last<00:01:02.910> couple<00:01:03.090> days<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:04.320> 5.3

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a bit the last couple days and that 5.3

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490 
a bit the last couple days and that 5.3
percent<00:01:05.400> seems<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.909> seventy<00:01:06.900> five<00:01:07.049> point

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
percent seems like seventy five point

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820 
percent seems like seventy five point
three<00:01:07.590> percent<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> stuns<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.830> when

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
three percent it it stuns a lot so when

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
three percent it it stuns a lot so when
the<00:01:10.920> other<00:01:11.070> thing<00:01:11.250> that's<00:01:11.340> made<00:01:11.909> for<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> spec

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the other thing that's made for the spec

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.910 
the other thing that's made for the spec
is<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:13.290> storm<00:01:14.220> shield<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.810> good<00:01:16.049> block
