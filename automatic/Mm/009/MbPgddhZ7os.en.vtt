00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.859
 standard army which fits 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.740
 every base and thanks to which you can 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.779
 select the appropriate shopping base and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.630
 demolish two stars without steaming here 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.270
 mixed unusual bare megabytes a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.800
 combined all-in-one 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.800

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 small tutorial on how 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.700
 determine what is done before 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.430
 updates oao champ without stages a gaga 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.120

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.820
 lying around 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.670
 so why are these bases aimed at 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.559
 go below or above so what are we going 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.200
 from the bottom of the joke I'm joking we go to the side 321 knock out 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.360
 you max x something I spun around 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.060
 yes fuck fuck continue to let 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.800
 Galimov well and break the ring to these 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.530
 scum is not turned to hell 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.920
 a bit later we break a big chunk 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.410
 blue to break his fence and now the meat 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.930
 Of course you think that now everyone 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.130
 consecutively put into one hole but no no all 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.130
 need to do gradually 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.640
 the king was the finest Cossack 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.490
 scum throw him a report for gifts but 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.299
 damn well you che there lies underfoot 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.670
 why why not bits of it more than good 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.039
 such bases that having destroyed one of the four 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.219
 parties can enjoy life because 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:55.850
 home the Queen flies no dick will not but 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:02:01.490
 or almost all like a puppy two stars also 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.799
 Onions finished off sweaty sweeh so I'm here 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.459
 thought thought why such arrangements 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.440
 put and came up it turns out they sometimes 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.200
 work against Galimov and take 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.150
 either two stars or zero i am so 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.579
 flew a couple of times for others to freeze again 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.069
 overwrites well and the hardest thing is with 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.450
 using 6 bombers to break through this fence 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.390
 so also in three places 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 problems with the fence to help I come 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.590
 powerful quick times being outside and gaze 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.319
 he sang inside the raid 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:42.200
 and now the magic of the random house is pinned here 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:44.170
 finger and wait for beauty that's when broken 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 center of this base then it becomes 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.170
 divinely vulnerable 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.200
 everything just stomps the golem ahead a 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.590
 queen i sharpens behind oh behind excuse me 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.420
 front-ass you understand here and here I have her 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.209
 his stupidity accelerated so that onions 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.940
 pushing faster and faster turns in vain 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:13.310
 but also shorter here, if of course 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:16.310
 it is appropriate to say here all my here 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.470
 we see the ideal base for demolition but here 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.690
 of course the standard mix 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.930
 small tutorial how to determine what 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.739
 so done before the update oh well I have you 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.840
 fucked fresh juicy fest hand not 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.889
 Well, you understand it happens second hand 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.410
 and here I drove well, like type 1, type 1, well, so 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.810
 the golden rule go always by 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.780
 queens, provided that both 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.820
 farther up to us by distance is true 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.190
 a sign that the army will move closer to 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.229
 center alternately lure away to the queen 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.229
 clan caste and king 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.409
 well, all as the previous attack only 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.540
 our skin queen went to the center with 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:06.159
 golems who will break the circle 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.739
 of course nobody 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.810
