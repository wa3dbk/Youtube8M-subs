as<00:03:05.170> Anna's<00:03:05.770> coming<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.400> whole<00:03:06.670> project<00:03:07.120> I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
as Anna's coming to this whole project I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.010 
as Anna's coming to this whole project I
would<00:03:07.540> say<00:03:07.890> well<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.070> especially<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:10.780> her

would say well and especially with her

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.130 
would say well and especially with her
sketches<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.920> think<00:03:12.720> she<00:03:13.720> really<00:03:13.930> brought

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
sketches I think she really brought

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.199 
sketches I think she really brought
something<00:03:14.709> new<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.220> guess<00:03:15.610> see<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.880> again<00:03:16.030> in

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
something new I guess see you again in

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.470 
something new I guess see you again in
television<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.370> Ugandan<00:03:18.820> scene<00:03:19.209> in

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
television and to the Ugandan scene in

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.900 
television and to the Ugandan scene in
general<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:20.860> think<00:03:20.890> that's<00:03:21.250> why<00:03:21.489> she's

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
general and I think that's why she's

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.729 
general and I think that's why she's
she's<00:03:22.330> becoming<00:03:22.690> a<00:03:22.840> household<00:03:23.320> name<00:03:23.380> right

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
she's becoming a household name right

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.500 
she's becoming a household name right

when she wants to do something she will

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.350 
when she wants to do something she will
