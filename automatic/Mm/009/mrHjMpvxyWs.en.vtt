00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
 The basic eye of crochet, it is a crochet. 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 Here is a table. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.120
 Here is the back, back mountain. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.696
 Here is the back. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
 I will start knitting. 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.500
 Hang the thread on your finger. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640
 Hold the yarn end with your right hand, 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.820
 Between the ring finger and the pinkie on the left hand, 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.560
 Pull up, pass between index finger and middle finger, 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.020
 Turn it over your index finger and pull it towards you. 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.120
 Hold the thread with your thumb and middle finger in tension. 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.220
 Hold the crotch with your thumb, index finger, middle finger as you would hold a pen 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.000
 Put the crochet behind the thread, 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.580
 Pull it forward and rotate the needle tip from the bottom to the right. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.020
 I will change the root of the thread on the needle. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.820
 Rotate the needle from left to right on the thread and hook the thread. 

00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:01.597
 Aim the tip slightly downward and pull out the thread. 

00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:04.974
 Squeeze the yarn end. Ready to knit. 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.540
 The eyes on the needle are not counted. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.780
 From here, it is a crochet. 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.420
 Rotate the needle from left to right on the thread and hook the thread, 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.740
 Turn the hook down and pull out the thread. 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.400
 I made one. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 Knit the necessary number in the same way. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.320
 When hooking a crochet, from left to right. 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:39.080
 If the needle point of the crochet is slightly downward according to the oval of the eye to be pulled out, the thread will be easier to pull out. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 When the needle and the pressing finger are separated and it becomes difficult to knit, they will change hands. 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.660
 I was able to knit. 

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:12.334
 Here is a table. 

00:02:15.193 --> 00:02:18.313
 It is the back of a solid weave. 

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.913
 When picking up the back mountain, pick up this bumpy mountain. 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 The basic eye of crochet, it is a crochet.
