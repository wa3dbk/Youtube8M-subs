00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the imbalance between krefeld and 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.940
 The kassel huskies did not draw 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.280
 only sporty but on the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 A great crowd offered the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.849
 Husky trailer with a special train 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.920
 arrived in Krefeld 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 They saw a dedicated performance of theirs 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.130
 team after the minute in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.500
 the number went into the lead 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 rednet singer served tobias schwab 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 zero to one and over 600 husky fans 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.849
 celebrated their team in the tenth 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 play minute with the equalization on 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.260
 but the trowel failed again 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.239
 here at Finkenrath in the tenth 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.640
 play the huskies by manuel 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.090
 sound at 0 to 2 and in the 16 minute 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 on 0 to 3 by bretzinger the huskies 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 had the buyer in hand before markus 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 Crawling florian bohm and alex angel 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.730
 with two minutes from the ice 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 Kleve cleverly used the payoff game 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 by double beat within less 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.960
 in seconds dennis wants 0 goals there 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.989
 they came so that only kassel 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.760
 Almost a high-speed job went 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.320
 so on here could christian 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.989
 Wendler with a great parade 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.240
 distinguish themselves before this scene was 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.950
 manuel kling pressed patrick klöpper in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.229
 the gang and got a 5 plus 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.510
 playing time also a 5 plus 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.460
 For michael acker , there was a lot of playing time 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 metzinger snapped and both 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 involved in a fist fight 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.909
 in the middle section made the huskies 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.689
 same methods continue to petr sikora 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.299
 increased in the 23 minute to 4 2 and in 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.180
 michael christ in the 25 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.650
 minute the lead on 5 to 2 for the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.479
 Expand huskies 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 chief referee markus krawinkel 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 remained his unbalanced 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 loyal and krefeld could in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.909
 double overpaid again to 3 5 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.369
 come on as your template of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.520
 Patrick Klöpper met Michael Christ 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.350
 in the 44 minute to the 6 3 and artjom 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 kostyrev built the leadership in front of the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.729
 second break on goats to 3 out in the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860
 final section michael christ with 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.680
 his third goal in this game is the 8th 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.680
 to 3 finish for the kassel huskies 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 labeled 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.050
 very exhausting later both sides in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.550
 was played but no 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.080
 In the end, we think we have that 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.940
 the better the grip 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.350
 As I said, the more mature team 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.270
 and have also earned in the height 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.760
 but won for both sides 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.069
 actually 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.700
 not a nice game because we always only 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.110
 overpaid the whole time 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.660
 some games overwhelmed written 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.450
 this one i say deserves winner 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.980
 won by us because we were better 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.940
 at 15 and in overpay situations 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 I have to join my team 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 Compliment that we do the game 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.460
 not won 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.410
 and I think we have very intense 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.540
 actually seen good hockey game 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.400
 unfortunately the referee from mine 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.350
 too much involved in the game 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 this is very difficult for both sides 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.860
 I had the game played 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.900
 gladly seen if we over longer 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.730
 have played period at 5 against 5 because 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.170
 We looked very good in 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.240
 the majority is kassel of course 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.520
 incredibly strong and if you still 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.810
 of four defend the mannheimer 2 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.550
 by 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.840
 weird punishments with a game on it 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.840
 loses then the game is natural 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.400
 very fast after the game in 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 newwied and ratingen receive the 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.830
 kassel huskies on 21.12 the red devil 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.319
 Bad Nauheim derby which team 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.830
 preliminary decision in the fight for first place 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.830
 will be
