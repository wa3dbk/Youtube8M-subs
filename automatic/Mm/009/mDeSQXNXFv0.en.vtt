to dance now you know that all right
let's<00:01:11.670> try<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:16.400> think<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> tiny<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:19.100> fast

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:29.870 

and<00:01:23.189> also<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:23.880> guitar<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.360> dead<00:01:28.430> ok<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.729> ready

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and also my guitar was dead ok you ready

and also my guitar was dead ok you ready
to<00:01:30.030> dance<00:01:31.520> ok<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.790> could<00:01:32.970> do<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.119> I'm

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to dance ok what we could do is I'm

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670 
to dance ok what we could do is I'm
going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> play<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> riff<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.590> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to play the riff and then you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
going to play the riff and then you
should<00:01:34.829> say<00:01:35.659> and<00:01:36.659> put<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.140> hands<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.500> air

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
should say and put your hands in the air

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.139 
should say and put your hands in the air
so<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.369> could<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.079> let's<00:01:40.079> try<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.500 

that<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.420> was<00:01:45.450> not<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.810> riff<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:47.340> not

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
that that was not the riff that was not

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510 
that that was not the riff that was not
okay<00:01:49.510> um<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.380> think<00:01:50.530> we<00:01:50.770> should<00:01:50.950> go<00:01:51.070> for<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> on

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
okay um I think we should go for the on

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.469 
okay um I think we should go for the on
slides<00:01:52.030> I<00:01:52.270> again<00:01:52.570> could<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:52.870> do<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.880> then

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
slides I again could we do that and then

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:15.270 
slides I again could we do that and then
you<00:01:58.570> should<00:01:58.690> actually<00:01:58.840> do<00:01:59.110> it<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.920> this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
you should actually do it is this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.530 
you should actually do it is this
Belgium<00:02:15.790> or<00:02:15.910> what<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:19.060> shows<00:02:19.650> some<00:02:20.650> cuts<00:02:21.540> for

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
Belgium or what then shows some cuts for

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:31.040 
Belgium or what then shows some cuts for
crying<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.170> loud<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.160> crying<00:02:24.489> out<00:02:24.730> loud

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.009 

like<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.430> know<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.790> bet<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.360> can<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.750> even

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
like it you know I bet we can do it even

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.949 
like it you know I bet we can do it even
more<00:02:35.739> than<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.239> because<00:02:37.239> I've<00:02:37.450> noticed<00:02:37.870> that
