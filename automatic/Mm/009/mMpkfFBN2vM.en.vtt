it um I like to connect it in gigabit
speeds<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.560> router<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.640> comes<00:01:11.970> with<00:01:12.060> four

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
speeds to my router it comes with four

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.510 
speeds to my router it comes with four
DV<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.729> outputs<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.180> ACM<00:01:15.659> eyes<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.310> think

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
DV is outputs to ACM eyes and I think

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.820 
DV is outputs to ACM eyes and I think
these<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:18.560> for<00:01:19.560> micro<00:01:20.310> HDMI<00:01:21.150> ports<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
these are for micro HDMI ports so you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
these are for micro HDMI ports so you
can<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.189> hook<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.700> 1<00:01:23.909> 2<00:01:23.939> 3<00:01:24.119> 4<00:01:24.360> 5<00:01:24.720> 6<00:01:24.750> 7<00:01:25.020> 8<00:01:25.290> 9

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
can actually hook up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
can actually hook up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10<00:01:25.650> monitors<00:01:26.659> well<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.380> can

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
10 monitors well I think you can

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
10 monitors well I think you can
actually<00:01:28.799> hook<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> four<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:30.540> sure<00:01:30.720> on

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
actually hook up to four not sure on

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.649 
actually hook up to four not sure on
that<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.950> put<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.060> hardware<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.509> can

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that when you put the hardware you can

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.920 
that when you put the hardware you can
actually<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.110> 10<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.520> see<00:01:35.700> that

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
actually look up 10 as you can see that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
actually look up 10 as you can see that
now<00:01:36.930> let's<00:01:37.140> go<00:01:37.259> inside<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:38.100> case<00:01:38.670> let<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.000> open

graphic<00:02:32.110> cards<00:02:32.410> I'm<00:02:33.280> so<00:02:33.790> for<00:02:34.000> gaming<00:02:34.329> that's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
graphic cards I'm so for gaming that's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960 
graphic cards I'm so for gaming that's
going<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> be<00:02:34.870> pretty<00:02:35.349> good<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.769> think<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:36.280> think

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
going to be pretty good I think I think

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.460 
going to be pretty good I think I think
that's<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> value<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.049> it<00:02:38.170> comes<00:02:38.380> with

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that's the value of it and it comes with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.729 
that's the value of it and it comes with

cooling fans all have the install video
of<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.280> following<00:02:51.930> shortly<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.380> I'll<00:02:54.130> do

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
of that following shortly and I'll do

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.569 
of that following shortly and I'll do
some<00:02:54.489> benchmarking<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:56.530> also<00:02:56.650> comes<00:02:56.889> with<00:02:57.010> 4<00:02:57.340> 3

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
some benchmarking it also comes with 4 3

gigabytes<00:02:58.920> memory<00:02:59.920> cards<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.670> can<00:03:00.819> see

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
gigabytes memory cards as you can see

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.440 
gigabytes memory cards as you can see
there<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:03.549> know<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:04.060> pretty<00:03:04.180> much<00:03:04.389> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
there and you know that's pretty much it

there and you know that's pretty much it
not<00:03:05.319> a<00:03:05.350> bad<00:03:05.590> value<00:03:06.100> at<00:03:06.340> all<00:03:06.489> um<00:03:06.730> think<00:03:07.299> about

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
not a bad value at all um think about

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.569 
not a bad value at all um think about
especially<00:03:08.139> I<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.400> actually

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
especially I think this one is actually

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.059 
especially I think this one is actually
300<00:03:10.150> bucks<00:03:10.299> each<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.959> something<00:03:11.829> like<00:03:11.920> that

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
300 bucks each is it something like that

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.970 
300 bucks each is it something like that
um<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:14.109> it<00:03:14.739> comes<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.359> Intel<00:03:16.709> 2600<00:03:17.709> k

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
um and it comes with the Intel 2600 k

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.870 
um and it comes with the Intel 2600 k
quad<00:03:18.670> core<00:03:19.739> 3.4<00:03:20.739> gigahertz<00:03:21.160> the<00:03:21.609> good<00:03:21.760> thing

about<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:22.180> processor<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.130> there's<00:03:24.730> a

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
about this processor is that there's a

to almost 5 gigahertz um so this one I'm

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.229 
to almost 5 gigahertz um so this one I'm
gonna<00:03:30.819> try<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> do<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:32.470> my<00:03:32.620> liquid<00:03:33.239> liquid

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
gonna try to do with my liquid liquid
