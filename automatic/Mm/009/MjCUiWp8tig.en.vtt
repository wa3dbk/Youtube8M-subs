00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.240
 hello again how are you I am ruin 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.769
 and the tutorial of today is from 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 turbo movie snail 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.780
 before starting with the tutorial I wanted to 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.450
 tell them how they have asked me 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.540
 many figures 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.980
 and the list is so super long what 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.190
 I have decided to do is that I will go 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.400
 taking out the ones that have asked me more times 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.920
 that's why I think the next tutorial 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.390
 it will be a superhero 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 or from the sun and that of monsters university 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 bye 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.840
 the first step is to take mass of color 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.810
 orange or orange or whatever you 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.390
 call where you well 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.079
 and we are giving it this way as more 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.420
 round in the part that will be the head 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.719
 and we have lengthened in the part that will be the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.719
 tail 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.750
 now we split a toothpick 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.880
 or if you have a piece of wire too 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.140
 works 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:30.240
 and we put two pieces in the part 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.240
 superior of what will be the head 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 we cover them with a mass of the same color 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.390
 that we did the rest 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 and we merged so that you do not see 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.399
 unity 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 and now we make two spheres of it 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.890
 white sizes that were in the part 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.890
 top of those chopsticks 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.039
 and so we have the eyes 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.360
 now let's make the mouth 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.360
 the draw with stick and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.489
 and now let's make the potatoes 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.700
 it's a matter of planning a little bit of 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:41.140
 mass put it on top of the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.140
 eye of each eye 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 something like that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.450
 so for both eyes 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.250
 and we do the same with the eyelids of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.530
 down but these have to have a 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.160
 strip thinner than the one we put in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.160
 The top 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.150
 Now let's paint with blue 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.950
 Clear 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.550
 a circle in each eye 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.550
 A) Yes 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.560
 and a black nugget in the center 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.110
 now we make a little ball that we put 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.110
 like in the night on the back 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.430
 we are waiting for you a little bit of the head 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:00.400
 because to me it was really stuck me as 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.870
 that diagonal shape and crushed a 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.870
 poquitico the top part 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.950
 and in the back of what would be 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.799
 its shell 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.799
 I'm going to put two sticks 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.709
 A) Yes 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.880
 here I put another little circle and I'm going to 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:36.849
 plant one on each side 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.449
 and that's where I'm going to draw the spiral 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.449
 cabbage 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.559
 x 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.559
 no small 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.940
 a little bit more like that 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:12.860
 in this way as from apothecary in the plane 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.860
 and spoke to him like a hole 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.889
 something like that but that looks like this 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.140
 the same obviously on both sides 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.680
 now to plane a little bit we are going with a 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.840
 roller or any object that can us 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.470
 serve the roll 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.780
 I cut it 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.140
 the leftovers I'm giving a form 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.140
 rectangular 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.400
 and it's the rectangle I put it where I put 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.400
 those two chopsticks 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.720
 the spiral that we draw we have that 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:03.480
 paint inside white or blue 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.720
 Of course that is the most difficult part 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.380
 but then there that comes out we now make a 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.670
 Strip with white paint or if you want 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.850
 It can also be with a little bit of 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.260
 Mazon but well well I flattened 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:21.880
 it looks like white this way 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.880
 throughout the disabled center 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:32.180
 he already drew a number 5 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.270
 a little bit well dough well 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.270
 delgadito 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.820
 I give it as a form of droplets 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:58.539
 I glue 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:11.330
 giving it this way 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.330
 Something like that has to be left for us 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:17.289
 ready and now we are going to give you some 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:20.830
 touches with red paint 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:25.710
 to that last thing that we did that 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.710
 last little detail and some stripes 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:33.600
 red 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.870
 located more or less there last I did 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:40.400
 was to put it on a base and put two 

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.400
 red triangles 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:47.600
 on each side right triangles with 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.600
 the number 5 drawn and already
