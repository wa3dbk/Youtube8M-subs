00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
remember that your pattern paper or your
designer<00:00:54.690> paper<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> lot<00:00:55.590> lighter<00:00:56.160> weight

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
designer paper is a lot lighter weight

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.580 
designer paper is a lot lighter weight

lines sorry so now I have a score line
here<00:01:15.570> here<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:16.920> cut<00:01:17.729> up<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:19.560> are

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
here here and then cut up here we are

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.010 
here here and then cut up here we are
going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.009> cut<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.520> these<00:01:21.240> little<00:01:21.299> corner

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
going to cut out these little corner

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.510 
going to cut out these little corner
pieces<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.950> is<00:01:25.950> cut<00:01:26.340> them

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pieces so what you will do is cut them

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
pieces so what you will do is cut them
off<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.840> little<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
off and then to have a little more of a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.490 
off and then to have a little more of a
finished<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.970> good<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.540> take<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.140> give

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
finished look it's good to take and give

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.649 
finished look it's good to take and give
it<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.610> an<00:01:32.729> angle<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.540> will

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
it just a little bit of an angle it will

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.960 
it just a little bit of an angle it will
fold<00:01:33.960> easier<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.159> will<00:01:35.340> look<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> little

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
fold easier and it will look a little

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.590 
fold easier and it will look a little
nicer<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.520> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> want<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.030> could<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.450> your

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
nicer and if you want you could use your

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.889 
nicer and if you want you could use your
cutter<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.189> I'll<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.970> repeat<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.720> on

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
cutter to do that I'll do repeat that on

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.460 
cutter to do that I'll do repeat that on
all<00:01:43.200> four<00:01:43.560> sides<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> now<00:01:45.210> I've<00:01:45.420> done<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.960> four

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
all four sides so now I've done all four

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
all four sides so now I've done all four
the<00:01:46.770> sides<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.700> you'll<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> these

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the sides and so you'll see that these

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
the sides and so you'll see that these
will<00:01:48.750> come<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.579> need<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
will come down you know what I need to

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.520 
will come down you know what I need to
make<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.659> little<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.170> an<00:01:52.290> angle

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
make this just a little more of an angle

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.460 
make this just a little more of an angle
this<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.700> here<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.479> does<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.049> makes<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
this one here it does it makes a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.649 
this one here it does it makes a
difference<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.130> how<00:01:56.280> nicely<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.240> your

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
difference in how nicely you get your

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
difference in how nicely you get your
fold<00:01:57.960> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.380> don't<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> little<00:01:59.340> angle

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
fold if you don't do that little angle

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.999 
fold if you don't do that little angle
there<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.990> we'll<00:02:01.140> do<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.320> down<00:02:01.770> at<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
there so we'll do that down at the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.749 
there so we'll do that down at the
bottom<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.420> my<00:02:03.630> top<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
bottom and then I have my top so I can

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.919 
bottom and then I have my top so I can
just<00:02:06.659> add<00:02:07.320> some<00:02:07.860> adhesive<00:02:08.569> along<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.810> edge

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
just add some adhesive along the edge

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.170 
just add some adhesive along the edge
here

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
here

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.959 
here
make<00:02:11.390> sure<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.989> don't<00:02:12.200> go<00:02:12.730> deeper<00:02:13.730> than

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:13.969 
make sure that you don't go deeper than

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:16.750 
make sure that you don't go deeper than
it's<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.599> to<00:02:14.719> overlap<00:02:15.260> or<00:02:15.680> your<00:02:16.129> card<00:02:16.430> or

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's going to overlap or your card or

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.849 
it's going to overlap or your card or
your<00:02:16.969> envelope<00:02:17.420> will<00:02:17.840> stick<00:02:18.170> together<00:02:18.379> so<00:02:18.829> I

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
your envelope will stick together so I

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.559 
your envelope will stick together so I
kind<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.730> hung<00:02:20.030> off<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.959> edge<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.730> my<00:02:22.730> envelope

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
kind of hung off the edge of my envelope

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.209 
kind of hung off the edge of my envelope
a<00:02:23.719> little<00:02:23.750> bit<00:02:23.989> and<00:02:24.290> that's<00:02:24.439> why<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> did<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:24.950> on

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
a little bit and that's why I did it on

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.099 
a little bit and that's why I did it on
the<00:02:25.489> silicon<00:02:26.060> mat<00:02:26.299> so<00:02:26.599> then<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.900> wouldn't

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:27.109 
the silicon mat so then it wouldn't

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.119 
the silicon mat so then it wouldn't
stick<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.700> then<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.120> bottom<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.689> just<00:02:30.129> sealed

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
stick and then the bottom is just sealed

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.009 
stick and then the bottom is just sealed
up<00:02:31.519> nice<00:02:31.939> and<00:02:31.969> easy<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.340> then<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:35.870> my

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
make it super tight because you want to

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.319

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
so I'm just kind of not making sure it's

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.099 
so I'm just kind of not making sure it's
not<00:04:09.290> completely<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:10.009> the<00:04:10.040> way<00:04:10.189> down<00:04:11.109> just
