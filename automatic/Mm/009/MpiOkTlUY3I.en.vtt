00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.019
 other four so go with the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.529
 Fifth question exactly and I read

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.250
 walker really very cool I found quite 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.289
 Well 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.020
 I did not see that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.059
 actually very many like me it is 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.829
 Very classic kevin alone in new york 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.539
 I always really watch it too 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 my brother also together Christmas 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:05.820
 and is very funny yes it's me i am 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.159
 this one big one with her 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.130
 big nose and this game I think 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.720
 even with me still looks and 18 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 exactly then the next question the number 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.840
 61 times how well you pack presents 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840
 can 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.790
 ask if you have a van Zandt here 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.540
 rename what name would be 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.310
 That would mean that you have to do it all now 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.310
 know names of the councils watery 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.040
 but why not a male? 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:11.860
 He says I'm such a funny guy 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.270
 names 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.910
 I wanted to say hans-peter it stop 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.910
 is someone you peter you gave me 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 but I call the hans-peter I stay 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.700
 so nothing against all hans-peter 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.020
 but I just think so it represents 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.800
 you have a little tears with the name Hans 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.180
 peter funny so double yes yes so 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:49.489
 Doubles after years 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 kevin justin and then the last question 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:57.800
 what's the best for you? 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.330
 So I think Christmas is nothing 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.670
 of course, for my answer but 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.670
 I like to do the movies especially 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.489
 I like about Christmas that with the 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.069
 whole family actually sees and often 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.780
 is it so if you are yes 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.959
 no longer in school is the 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 all around christmas 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.950
 So classmates are there where you 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.599
 come here and then you can always 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.249
 meet with the school 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.810
 That's what I always want cool 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:28.230
 Everybody always contributes to this at home 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.819
 Not always cool to parents 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.260
 true and that was already the 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.900
 last one was looking very short because like 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:47.319

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:49.829

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.829
