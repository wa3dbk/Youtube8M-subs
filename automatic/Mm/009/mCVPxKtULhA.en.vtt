00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
only reason what I'm doing so much is a

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.270 
only reason what I'm doing so much is a
once<00:07:43.930> again<00:07:44.050> just<00:07:44.500> like<00:07:44.650> I'm<00:07:44.860> getting

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 
once again just like I'm getting

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.140 
once again just like I'm getting
again<00:07:45.550> and<00:07:46.710> if<00:07:47.710> you<00:07:48.160> didn't<00:07:48.580> hear<00:07:48.790> from<00:07:48.970> my

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:49.150 
again and if you didn't hear from my

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.900 
again and if you didn't hear from my
first<00:07:49.450> video<00:07:49.810> and<00:07:50.170> I'm<00:07:50.410> not<00:07:50.650> sure<00:07:50.680> if<00:07:50.980> I<00:07:51.160> I<00:07:51.490> be

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:51.910 
first video and I'm not sure if I I be

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.420 
first video and I'm not sure if I I be
staying<00:07:52.270> there<00:07:52.570> so<00:07:52.870> i<00:07:53.080> most<00:07:53.710> likely<00:07:53.889> will<00:07:54.280> be
