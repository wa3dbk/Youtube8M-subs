00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 good afternoon my dear I cook today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.170
 fish you to the furnace and foot acetic cheats 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.920
 marinade in which the rabbit is cooked 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.780
 chicken and fish are served cold for 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 marinade we will need 1 medium 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.859
 onion and and cut into thin 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.150
 half rings will need garlic to taste 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 I will not cut 4 slices of garlic 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.430
 I distribute it to the plane of the knife in order to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.830
 he better revealed his taste to cook once 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.610
 to the oven you can absolutely any fish and even 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.070
 several varieties of fish at the same time 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.550
 me fish fillets cut into pieces 450 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.520
 gram 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.980
 although you can just cut the podium pieces 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 or you can even take the whole fish 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.989
 depends on your mood 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.570
 desires and for a start we need 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.090
 fish roll flour I added 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
 some salt just not necessarily flour 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.000
 hide it hildren as she will 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.770
 burn when roasting 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.850
 and then we will need to fry the fish 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.800
 warming up on the skillet olive 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 butter 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.360
 traditionally it is taken quite new on 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.010
 450 grams of fish fillets I took 100 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.439
 milliliters of olive oil 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.960
 if there is no olive thought any 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.860
 other vegetable and for starters 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.780
 fry the fish on both sides and hike 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.090
 on would like to say that originally from to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 oven suite on marinade a place to exist 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.080
 keeping food fresh for not 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.210
 there were refrigerators 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.810
 aux marinated product kept 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.479
 longer 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.729
 It is believed that this method has Arabic 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.979
 roots and then spread by 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.970
 all over europe and rugged sat in many 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 national cuisines for example in spanish 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 fried fish postpones lay 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.149
 garlic 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.630
 and fry it just a couple of minutes where 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.130
 the appearance of garlic smell 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.079
 it is not necessary to fry hard garlic 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.880
 should change color because in this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 case it can give bitterness i strongly 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.759
 fried enough to 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.149
 feel the garlic smell of oil 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.880
 filter the necessary oil can 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.179
 add heated butter lay out 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.450
 chopped onion slices fry it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.950
 one or two minutes of transparency 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.989
 if you want the marinade to be wrong 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 such glorious spicy can along with 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.780
 fry onion chopped red spicy 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.569
 pepper griddle with fried onions 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.660
 we pour in 300 milliliters of 3 percent 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.340
 vinegar and add salt sugar 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.390
 taste in order to marinade you 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.129
 pleasant sweet-sour salty taste 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.709
 in passing, I note that instead of wine you can 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.989
 take any other vinegar of any fortress 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.379
 just dilute it if necessary 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.540
 we all have different water after us 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.700
 there is a problem to keep the dishes as possible 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.470
 longer so the marinade is always possible 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.459
 try and add if necessary 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.319
 There either vinegar or some water therefore 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.590
 marinade several bay leaves 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.720
 several peas black pepper give 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.560
 marinade boil for 3-4 minutes 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.450
 rotate marina then fish fish should be 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.930
 completely covered marina there therefore 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.090
 if a 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.310
 fluid is not enough, you can add 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.319
 some water if you add water 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.659
 many times marinade try 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.190
 and, if necessary, even the taste for 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.400
 order to marinator enjoy 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.890
 sweet and sour salty taste give them 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.459
 simmer literally one minute and take off 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.680
 from the fire 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.870
 when completely cool shift 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.940
 glass container and put in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.610
 the fridge will be in a day 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.200
 ready to be considered that the decree on the marinade 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.750
 in the refrigerator it can be stored until 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.420
 two weeks fall and and cold 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.110
 usually sprinkles with chopped olives and 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.180
 capers 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.209
 although in my opinion from black girls 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.950
 these are very wonderful dishes and so is ours 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.959
 the dish is ready will not remain traditionally 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.390
 wish bon appetite cook 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:55.670

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.670
