00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.100
 good night and I send you the video with 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.040
 regarding the exposure of 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.440
 conclusions of recommendations 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.809
 to begin with, it has been concluded that the 5 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.240
 Sometimes it is a way of working and a 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.610
 management methodology that they provide us 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.930
 benefits on issues of change in the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.689
 improvement of half of work and in 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.939
 change the organizational culture 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.310
 In addition, it was concluded that in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.230
 part of the process five times 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.640
 just in implementation of the fourth s 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.710
 where the commitment of the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 people because they are the same 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.600
 of the group as proposed by the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.700
 ideas of change and they are the actors 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.110
 materials and intellectuals of the process 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.120
 further to this also 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.940
 concluded that with the implementation of a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 system based on rsm will increase the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.490
 Equipment reliability available 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.120
 because this type of system 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.290
 determines the activities of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 corrective and proactive maintenance 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.870
 in order to minimize errors or 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.700
 failures it was also not concluded that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.220
 there are quite a lot of economic losses 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.950
 for issues of time delays by 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.660
 about transportation processing 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.680
 because there are low levels of 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.180
 commitment in the organization which is 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.660
 part of the people that generate 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.620
 pretty type of waste which 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.140
 they give him 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.670
 and costs to the product but they do not provide 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.409
 value 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.850
 In addition to this, it was concluded with 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.670
 a first stage of the tool 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.110
 I think more than half of the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.009
 problems are due to order issues and 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.020
 cleaning like second field to subject of not 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.750
 compliance with procedures this 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 is because there is no control of the 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.130
 same cleaning order system and not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.399
 there are not many procedures 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.680
 appropriate to the work system there is a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.320
 this table was also concluded in the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.240
 issue of the evaluation of the surveys 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 there are issues in issues of 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.920
 communication and leadership this caused 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.179
 to which the suggestions opinions of the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.659
 people are not taken into account 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.030
 in addition to this the heads of charge 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.979
 of the different areas make decisions 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 that directly affect your staff and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.790
 neither do they give them the resources 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.950
 necessary to be able to pawn their 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.140
 work 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.910
 further to this also 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.400
 concluded with the second evaluation of the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.690
 pareto tool but based on the 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.270
 eight quality principles 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.450
 that the principle of participation of 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.120
 staff and the principle of this system 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.350
 of management obtain the highest percentage 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.870
 of non-conformities 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.130
 this means that they occupy more or less the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.510
 22 or 25% 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.840
 taking into account this yes 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.239
 and we carry out actions that correct this 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.189
 22% 25 percent would achieve an effect 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.370
 positive in 80 percent of 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:48.370
 results 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.510
 further to this also 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.549
 concluded that there are high costs for 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.900
 the reflexes corrective maintenance 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.510
 which generate unnecessary expenses of the 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.640
 company and minimizes or reduces 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.409
 profitability issues this because of the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.000
 lack of maintenance planning 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.610
 preventive since there is a culture 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.770
 clearly corrective 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.870
 On the other hand , the 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.240
 analysis of key processes which 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.400
 with which it was determined that it is 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.990
 necessary to implement a 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.730
 system that improves reliability and 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.590
 availability of equipment and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.690
 saving costs on issues of 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.850
 corrective maintenance which with 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.560
 Implement implementation is said 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.010
 generate significant savings 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.870
 around 38 thousand 900 soles 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.610
 On the other hand, the analysis of 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.049
 alternative comparison is also 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.079
 determined that the tool of the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.400
 five times and the rc m are the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.920
 tools that provide the greatest 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.079
 benefits to the organization because of 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.860
 its low costs to its short periods 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.860
 of implementation 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.720
 to the significant savings that they produce with 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.190
 the implementation and the increase 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.710
 significant also in the 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.330
 sales productivity 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.190
 with the implementation also 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.650
 He concluded five times that 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.450
 generates an increase in the productivity of 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.060
 sales of 25 percent what 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.940
 means an amount around 15 thousand 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.860
 100 soles what's true additionally to 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.380
 this with implementation of a system of 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.930
 consuman software management and 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.690
 rsm system is also generated 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.050
 a significant saving of around 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.979
 38 thousand 850 soles 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.349
 and finally to conclude by evaluating the 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.110
 total system benefit of 5 is the 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:36.569
 rcn management system that has a 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.699
 approximate value of 53 thousand 4 940 soles 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:42.370
 inside compared to the 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:45.039
 necessary investment that is 45 thousand 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.190
 around this gives an idea that it would be 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.979
 in a very short time the recovery of the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.249
 investment would not be an approximation of a 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.349
 month and a half 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:57.419
 as part of the recommendations that are 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.769
 applied it seems work but still 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.929
 commenting 3 points that considered 

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:02.369
 needed in the first field is 

00:05:00.929 --> 00:05:04.559
 recommends conducting studies on the subject of 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:06.919
 ergonomics to be applied in the 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:09.580
 organization and to be able to prevent risks 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.889
 diseases or accidents at work 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.530
 In addition to this, it is recommended 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.840
 be able to hire specialized services 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.389
 on issues of plant distribution for 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.550
 to be able to find the most orderly form of 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.439
 equipment and work areas and 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.990
 to be able to manufacture the whole process 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:27.639
 the most economical and efficient way and 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.500
 same time as it is safe and 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.270
 satisfaction for the people who 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.910
 they do the work 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.560
 and finally the other recommendation is 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.200
 that the company is involved in issues of 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.990
 corporate marketing so you can 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.090
 promote or in any case show the 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.500
 benefits achieved and goals 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.320
 achieved with implementation these 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.690
 systems which favors the creation and 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.540
 motivation and the development of 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.700
 people of the organization 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.970
 Well, all that would be all the 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.320
 presentation I will be waiting for your 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.320
 comments thank you very much until then
