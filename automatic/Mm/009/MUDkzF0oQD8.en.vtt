00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
vegetables I don't know I think it's

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.770 
vegetables I don't know I think it's
because<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.100> mom<00:02:02.250> always<00:02:02.790> had<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.360> soups

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because my mom always had it in soups

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.190 
because my mom always had it in soups
and<00:02:04.049> stuff<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.210> they're<00:02:06.390> great<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.990> I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and stuff and I think they're great so I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.710 
and stuff and I think they're great so I
just<00:02:07.680> kind<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> keep<00:02:08.310> them<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.819> bigger<00:02:09.330> pieces

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
just kind of keep them a bigger pieces

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.160 
just kind of keep them a bigger pieces
like<00:02:10.379> this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
like this

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.980 
like this
is<00:02:11.230> carrots<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.190> parsnips<00:02:12.970> they<00:02:13.209> do<00:02:13.270> cook<00:02:13.840> a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
is carrots and parsnips they do cook a

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.210 
is carrots and parsnips they do cook a
lot<00:02:14.200> faster<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.590> don't<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.800> don't<00:02:17.890> want<00:02:18.160> to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
lot faster so I don't I don't want to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:35.280 
lot faster so I don't I don't want to
make<00:02:18.340> them<00:02:18.489> too<00:02:18.730> small

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.280 

and<00:02:35.560> then<00:02:36.069> my<00:02:36.310> carrots<00:02:37.000> I<00:02:37.120> don't<00:02:37.480> always<00:02:37.989> peel

everything<00:04:44.080> cooks<00:04:44.409> nicely<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.400> then<00:04:46.000> we'll

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
everything cooks nicely and then we'll

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.940 
everything cooks nicely and then we'll
see<00:04:46.690> what<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:46.960> looks<00:04:47.110> like<00:04:47.169> when<00:04:47.380> it's<00:04:47.500> done

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
see what it looks like when it's done

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.250 
see what it looks like when it's done
and<00:04:48.070> this<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:48.700> what<00:04:48.910> it<00:04:49.000> looks<00:04:49.180> like<00:04:49.480> once<00:04:49.960> it's

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
and this is what it looks like once it's

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.380 
and this is what it looks like once it's
out<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.650> oven<00:04:50.680> I<00:04:51.100> did<00:04:51.340> cook<00:04:51.580> these<00:04:51.790> for<00:04:52.180> one

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
out of the oven I did cook these for one

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.170 
out of the oven I did cook these for one
hour<00:04:52.660> on<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.230> all<00:04:54.010> varies<00:04:54.460> on<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.640> vegetables

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
hour on it all varies on the vegetables

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.640 
hour on it all varies on the vegetables
you're<00:04:55.330> using<00:04:55.570> like<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:55.930> did<00:04:56.110> use<00:04:56.260> an<00:04:56.380> extra

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
you're using like I did use an extra

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.230 
you're using like I did use an extra
sweet<00:04:56.830> potato<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.460> did<00:04:57.670> need<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.850> little

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
sweet potato so it did need a little

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.240 
sweet potato so it did need a little
more<00:04:58.450> time<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:59.320> that's<00:04:59.500> why<00:04:59.590> I<00:04:59.710> cook<00:04:59.920> them<00:05:00.070> for

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
more time so that's why I cook them for

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.670 
more time so that's why I cook them for
an<00:05:00.370> hour<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.940> let<00:05:01.480> them<00:05:01.630> sit<00:05:01.900> for<00:05:02.200> about<00:05:02.290> 10

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
an hour I let them sit for about 10

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.280 
an hour I let them sit for about 10
minutes<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.190> I<00:05:03.280> can<00:05:03.310> handle<00:05:04.090> the<00:05:04.510> actual<00:05:04.960> pan

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
minutes so I can handle the actual pan

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.940 
minutes so I can handle the actual pan
itself<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.570> cooling<00:05:07.570> them<00:05:07.750> off<00:05:07.870> gives<00:05:08.710> them<00:05:08.860> a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
itself and cooling them off gives them a

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.070 
itself and cooling them off gives them a
chance<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.550> get<00:05:09.940> a<00:05:10.000> little<00:05:10.240> bit<00:05:10.450> more<00:05:10.660> crispy<00:05:11.050> I

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080
