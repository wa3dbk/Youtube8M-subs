00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.500 

there<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.260> go<00:00:46.469> there's<00:00:47.309> my<00:00:47.399> Settings<00:00:48.059> button

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
right here I'm going to zoom in on that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.380 
right here I'm going to zoom in on that
so<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.829> better

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
so you can see it better

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.939 
so you can see it better
settings<00:00:56.270> so<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.199> had<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
settings so one thing I had to do is

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
settings so one thing I had to do is
under<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> general<00:01:00.149> tab<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:01.969> went<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.149> this

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
under the general tab I went to this

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
under the general tab I went to this
auto<00:01:03.719> lock<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.159> had<00:01:05.309> had<00:01:05.460> my<00:01:05.640> auto<00:01:05.850> lock

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
auto lock because I had had my auto lock

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.210 
auto lock because I had had my auto lock
on<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> switched<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
on and you can see I switched it to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.880 
on and you can see I switched it to
never<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.689> didn't<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> auto

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
never because I didn't know if the auto

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
never because I didn't know if the auto
lock<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.479> would<00:01:12.630> upload<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.560> it

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
lock because it would upload and it

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800 
lock because it would upload and it
would<00:01:13.770> say<00:01:13.920> publishing<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.570> auto

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
would say publishing but then the auto

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.350 
would say publishing but then the auto
lock<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:17.070> come<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.820> wasn't<00:01:18.030> sure<00:01:18.180> if

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
lock would come on and I wasn't sure if

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
lock would come on and I wasn't sure if
that's<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:18.990> was<00:01:19.140> making<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.590> crash<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's what was making it crash so I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.789 
that's what was making it crash so I
switched<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.630> never<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
switched that to never that's one of the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.280 
switched that to never that's one of the
things<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.159> did<00:01:23.400> now<00:01:24.390> let's<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:24.780> back<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.170> the

really long title here I've noticed that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.840 
really long title here I've noticed that
really<00:03:17.230> long<00:03:17.590> titles<00:03:18.190> when<00:03:18.430> you're<00:03:18.550> trying<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
do it from a mobile device

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.449 
do it from a mobile device
might<00:03:21.190> fail<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:22.630> not<00:03:22.870> easy<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.530> find<00:03:23.860> the

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
might fail it's not easy to find the

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.750 
might fail it's not easy to find the
title<00:03:25.030> exact<00:03:25.870> character<00:03:26.410> limit<00:03:26.800> but<00:03:27.580> I<00:03:27.640> think

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
title exact character limit but I think

I have believe I believe I have seen
sixty<00:03:30.550> characters<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.690> limit<00:03:32.050> from

going screwy was when I go over to my
video<00:04:21.669> manager<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.360> hope<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:22.690> does<00:04:22.900> this

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
video manager and I hope this does this

video manager and I hope this does this
relatively<00:04:23.770> quickly

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
relatively quickly

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.150 
relatively quickly

thing<00:06:18.210> I'm<00:06:18.690> thinking<00:06:19.020> about<00:06:19.110> my<00:06:19.470> account

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
thing I'm thinking about my account

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.050 
thing I'm thinking about my account
allows<00:06:20.630> videos<00:06:21.630> over<00:06:22.229> ten<00:06:22.949> minutes<00:06:23.130> long<00:06:23.520> but

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.529 
allows videos over ten minutes long but
however<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:25.289> do<00:06:25.560> remember<00:06:26.250> and<00:06:26.550> I'm<00:06:27.240> not<00:06:27.389> sure

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 
however I do remember and I'm not sure

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:31.460 
however I do remember and I'm not sure
if<00:06:27.659> this<00:06:27.780> has<00:06:27.960> been<00:06:28.110> fixed<00:06:28.380> but<00:06:30.259> perhaps<00:06:31.259> it

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:31.470 
if this has been fixed but perhaps it

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.680

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
channel and it did not fail so obviously

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.550

that<00:07:20.250> limit<00:07:20.789> has<00:07:20.909> been<00:07:21.120> removed<00:07:21.449> so<00:07:22.349> I<00:07:22.379> was

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
that limit has been removed so I was

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.019 
that limit has been removed so I was
going<00:07:22.650> to<00:07:22.740> tell<00:07:22.919> you<00:07:22.979> just<00:07:23.250> check<00:07:23.580> and<00:07:23.699> see<00:07:23.789> if

00:07:24.019 --> 00:07:24.029 
going to tell you just check and see if

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:25.490 
going to tell you just check and see if
it's<00:07:24.180> because<00:07:24.330> your<00:07:24.629> videos<00:07:24.900> more<00:07:25.139> than<00:07:25.199> 10

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
it's because your videos more than 10

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.980 
it's because your videos more than 10
minutes<00:07:25.710> but<00:07:26.240> that<00:07:27.240> doesn't<00:07:27.599> seem<00:07:27.689> to<00:07:27.840> be<00:07:27.960> a

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
minutes but that doesn't seem to be a

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.559 
minutes but that doesn't seem to be a
problem<00:07:28.409> the<00:07:28.979> only<00:07:29.250> 10-minute<00:07:29.969> limitation
