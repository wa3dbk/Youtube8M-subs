00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
yeah because they don't do the homework
people<00:00:45.030> i<00:00:45.059> looked<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.450> girls<00:00:45.690> silver

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
people i looked at the girls silver

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
people i looked at the girls silver
ratio<00:00:46.620> you'd<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.550> very

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
ratio you'd see it's actually very

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
ratio you'd see it's actually very
expensive<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.420> has<00:00:48.570> been<00:00:48.809> very<00:00:49.079> expensive

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
expensive and has been very expensive

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.279 
expensive and has been very expensive
and<00:00:49.710> angels<00:00:50.219> vs<00:00:50.940> silver<00:00:51.210> absolutely<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and angels vs silver absolutely the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.720 
and angels vs silver absolutely the
girls<00:00:52.500> still<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> ratio<00:00:53.190> went<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> about

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
girls still the ratio went up to about

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.180 
girls still the ratio went up to about
75<00:00:54.210> or<00:00:54.390> 80<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
75 or 80 I think it was I think that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
75 or 80 I think it was I think that
should<00:00:56.489> drop<00:00:56.730> back<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.120> again<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.600> 50<00:00:57.960> 55<00:00:58.350> ish

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
should drop back down again to 50 55 ish

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.349 
should drop back down again to 50 55 ish
and<00:00:58.980> therefore<00:00:59.609> silver<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.059> outperform

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and therefore silver would outperform

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.330 
and therefore silver would outperform
what<00:01:01.140> I'd<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> add<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.070> dealer

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
what I'd like to add as my dealer

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.660 
what I'd like to add as my dealer
suggested<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.739> had<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> free<00:01:05.309> shuttle

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
suggested that I also had a free shuttle

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
suggested that I also had a free shuttle
with<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:07.080> idea<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.710> this<00:01:07.830> trade

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
with this this this idea of this trade

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
with this this this idea of this trade
because<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> then<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.200> stick<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
because what you then do is stick a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.780 
because what you then do is stick a
great<00:01:10.770> big<00:01:10.979> hole<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> back<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.700> your

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
great big hole in the back of your
