00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.609 
glass frame very similar to the iphone
right<00:01:39.689> now<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.960> not<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.500> more

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
right now it's not be a little bit more

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.050 
right now it's not be a little bit more
susceptible<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.189> scratching<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.790> everything

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
susceptible to scratching and everything

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
susceptible to scratching and everything
else<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.509> i<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.780> two<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> these<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.159> i

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
else but i got two of these for what i

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
else but i got two of these for what i
would<00:01:44.399> pay<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> regular<00:01:45.750> apple

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
would pay for one of the regular apple

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780 
would pay for one of the regular apple
watches<00:01:46.290> with<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> nice<00:01:46.890> metal<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.759> leather

watches with a nice metal or leather

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
watches with a nice metal or leather
band<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.630> i<00:01:48.659> thought<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> was<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> better<00:01:49.799> way

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
band so i thought that was a better way

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.889 
band so i thought that was a better way
to<00:01:50.100> go<00:01:50.369> especially<00:01:50.610> because<00:01:51.119> apple<00:01:51.509> updates

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
to go especially because apple updates

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
to go especially because apple updates
everything<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.590> like<00:01:52.799> every<00:01:53.640> year<00:01:53.670> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
everything you know like every year and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
everything you know like every year and
you<00:01:54.149> get<00:01:54.299> something<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.110> thinner<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you get something you know thinner and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
you get something you know thinner and
faster<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.250> every<00:01:56.939> iteration<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.689> know

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
faster with every iteration and I know

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
faster with every iteration and I know
they'll<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.079> doing<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.590> work<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.950> this

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
they'll be doing a lot of work on this

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.350 
they'll be doing a lot of work on this
product<00:01:59.399> but<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> think<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.939> important

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
product but what I think is important

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670 
product but what I think is important
about<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.689> why<00:02:00.810> I'm<00:02:00.930> talking<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
about and why I'm talking about the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.859 
about and why I'm talking about the
Apple<00:02:02.040> watch<00:02:02.219> much<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.240> everyone<00:02:03.540> chagrin

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
Apple watch much to everyone chagrin

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.709 
Apple watch much to everyone chagrin
perhaps<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.829> because<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.360> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
perhaps is because it is going to really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
perhaps is because it is going to really
create<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.170> market<00:02:07.680> for<00:02:07.920> wearables<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.610> I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
create a market for wearables that I

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.219 
create a market for wearables that I
haven't<00:02:08.879> seen<00:02:09.060> before<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
haven't seen before and this is

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
haven't seen before and this is
anecdotal<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.430> had<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:11.970> people<00:02:12.180> ask<00:02:12.569> me

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
anecdotal but I had more people ask me

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
anecdotal but I had more people ask me
about<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:13.110> Apple

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
about the Apple

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
those reviews from those major players

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.160 
those reviews from those major players
was<00:02:17.310> getting<00:02:17.579> out<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.540> publications

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
was getting out to all the publications

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.619 
was getting out to all the publications
than<00:02:20.010> I've<00:02:20.099> seen<00:02:20.129> for<00:02:20.549> any<00:02:20.760> wearable<00:02:21.359> in<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
than I've seen for any wearable in the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.420 
than I've seen for any wearable in the
last<00:02:21.840> two<00:02:22.140> years<00:02:22.439> or<00:02:22.769> three<00:02:22.799> years<00:02:23.010> wherever

last two years or three years wherever

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.920 
last two years or three years wherever
long<00:02:23.670> we've<00:02:23.819> been<00:02:23.849> talking<00:02:24.269> about<00:02:24.299> wearables

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
long we've been talking about wearables

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.959 
long we've been talking about wearables
and<00:02:25.019> its<00:02:25.170> really<00:02:25.349> significant<00:02:26.159> that<00:02:26.790> this

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
and its really significant that this

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.179 
and its really significant that this
device<00:02:27.510> has<00:02:27.810> driven<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.379> so<00:02:28.620> much<00:02:28.739> consumer

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
device has driven up so much consumer

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.160 
device has driven up so much consumer
interest<00:02:29.579> so<00:02:29.730> much<00:02:29.909> so<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.120> when<00:02:30.810> people<00:02:30.840> go

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
interest so much so that when people go

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.629 
interest so much so that when people go
out<00:02:31.200> looking<00:02:31.590> at<00:02:31.709> an<00:02:31.829> Apple<00:02:32.099> watch<00:02:32.129> and<00:02:32.519> maybe

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
out looking at an Apple watch and maybe

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.920 
out looking at an Apple watch and maybe
discovered<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.389> doesn't<00:02:33.629> work<00:02:33.780> with

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
discovered that it doesn't work with

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.929 
discovered that it doesn't work with
their<00:02:34.049> android<00:02:34.439> phone<00:02:34.709> they<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.609> take<00:02:35.790> an

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
their android phone they will take an

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.149 
their android phone they will take an
interest<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.389> what<00:02:36.599> some<00:02:36.780> of<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> other

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
interest in what some of the other

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.470 
interest in what some of the other
watches<00:02:38.159> are<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.609> might<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.909> out<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
watches are that might be out there and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.629 
watches are that might be out there and
I<00:02:39.569> think<00:02:39.840> we'll<00:02:40.049> see<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.500> lot<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> innovation

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
I think we'll see a lot of innovation

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.160 
I think we'll see a lot of innovation
very<00:02:41.849> quickly<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:42.599> there's<00:02:42.750> finally

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
very quickly because there's finally

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.410 
very quickly because there's finally
some<00:02:43.349> competitive<00:02:44.060> development<00:02:45.060> going<00:02:45.209> on

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
some competitive development going on

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.149 
some competitive development going on
the<00:02:46.169> smartphones<00:02:46.590> are<00:02:46.769> certainly<00:02:46.980> getting

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
the smartphones are certainly getting

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.789 
the smartphones are certainly getting
better<00:02:47.459> but<00:02:47.669> we're<00:02:47.790> not<00:02:47.909> seeing<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.329> rapid

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
better but we're not seeing that rapid

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.229 
better but we're not seeing that rapid
development<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:49.889> we've<00:02:50.040> seen<00:02:50.340> we<00:02:50.849> saw<00:02:51.000> in

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
development that we've seen we saw in

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.819 
development that we've seen we saw in
the<00:02:51.299> early<00:02:51.629> stages<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.409> smartphone

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.670 
the early stages of the smartphone
revolution<00:02:52.859> from<00:02:53.599> 2007<00:02:54.599> forward<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.590> know

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
revolution from 2007 forward you know

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
revolution from 2007 forward you know
the<00:02:55.769> last<00:02:55.859> couple<00:02:56.220> of<00:02:56.250> years<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.549> know<00:02:56.609> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the last couple of years you know the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.589 
the last couple of years you know the
phones<00:02:56.849> are<00:02:56.939> getting<00:02:57.120> better<00:02:57.299> and<00:02:57.419> a<00:02:57.480> little

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
phones are getting better and a little

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.179 
phones are getting better and a little
bit<00:02:57.780> faster<00:02:58.230> but<00:02:58.379> there's<00:02:58.530> nothing<00:02:58.859> like<00:02:59.010> oh

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
bit faster but there's nothing like oh

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.920 
bit faster but there's nothing like oh
my<00:02:59.340> gosh<00:02:59.549> it's<00:02:59.790> completely<00:03:00.299> different<00:03:00.569> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
my gosh it's completely different and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.059 
my gosh it's completely different and
new<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.230> everything<00:03:01.409> else<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.859> think<00:03:01.980> we're

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
new and everything else I think we're

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.159 
new and everything else I think we're
going<00:03:02.159> to<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.669> now<00:03:02.879> on<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.719> watch<00:03:03.900> side

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
going to see that now on the watch side

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.959 
going to see that now on the watch side
especially<00:03:04.409> definitely<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> Android

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
especially definitely with the Android

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.179 
especially definitely with the Android
watch<00:03:06.629> manufacturers<00:03:07.439> and<00:03:07.620> perhaps<00:03:07.799> others

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
watch manufacturers and perhaps others

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.490 
watch manufacturers and perhaps others
like<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.969> pebble<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.840> new<00:03:09.959> pebble<00:03:10.260> time

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
like the pebble the new pebble time

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.869 
like the pebble the new pebble time
watch<00:03:10.739> which<00:03:10.919> I'll<00:03:11.010> talk<00:03:11.129> about<00:03:11.189> in<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.519> second

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
watch which I'll talk about in a second

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.159 
watch which I'll talk about in a second
too<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:12.269> think<00:03:12.359> this<00:03:12.569> is<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.689> really<00:03:12.930> good

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
too so I think this is a really good

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.229 
too so I think this is a really good

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.699 
really kind of spin up and what's
interesting<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.540> Android<00:03:21.989> watches

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
interesting is that the Android watches

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.140 
interesting is that the Android watches
that<00:03:22.799> are<00:03:22.859> out<00:03:23.069> right<00:03:23.099> now<00:03:23.370> are<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.000> much

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.599 
that are out right now are so much
better<00:03:24.389> than<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:25.260> Android<00:03:25.709> phones<00:03:26.010> were<00:03:26.340> when

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
better than the Android phones were when

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.550 
better than the Android phones were when
the<00:03:27.209> iphone<00:03:27.629> first<00:03:27.900> came<00:03:28.139> out<00:03:28.290> remember

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the iphone first came out remember

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.530 
the iphone first came out remember

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
iphone and android were you know kind of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.990 
iphone and android were you know kind of
coming<00:03:30.810> out<00:03:30.900> around<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.349> same<00:03:31.439> time<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.430> you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
coming out around the same time and you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.099 
coming out around the same time and you
know<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.209> android<00:03:33.479> phones<00:03:33.689> really<00:03:33.959> weren't

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
know the android phones really weren't

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.259 
know the android phones really weren't
there<00:03:34.470> at<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.680> outset<00:03:35.069> but<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.939> we've<00:03:36.120> seen

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
there at the outset but now we've seen

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.550 
there at the outset but now we've seen
them<00:03:36.359> kind<00:03:36.540> of<00:03:36.599> catch<00:03:36.810> up<00:03:37.079> all<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.349> watches

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
them kind of catch up all the watches

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.110 
them kind of catch up all the watches
really<00:03:38.129> you're<00:03:38.250> pretty<00:03:38.459> darn<00:03:38.609> good<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
really you're pretty darn good on the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.670 
really you're pretty darn good on the
Android<00:03:39.479> side<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.780> haven't<00:03:40.049> tested<00:03:40.199> any<00:03:40.409> but<00:03:40.650> I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Android side I haven't tested any but I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.869 
Android side I haven't tested any but I
know<00:03:40.799> some<00:03:41.010> friends<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.310> have<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.519> few<00:03:41.760> and

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
know some friends that have a few and

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.890 
know some friends that have a few and
I've<00:03:41.939> played<00:03:42.239> with<00:03:42.329> them<00:03:42.449> a<00:03:42.509> little<00:03:42.629> bit

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
I've played with them a little bit

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.929 
I've played with them a little bit
they're<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.530> nice<00:03:43.799> products<00:03:44.280> already<00:03:44.400> and

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
they're really nice products already and

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.849 
they're really nice products already and
i<00:03:45.209> think<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.659> apple<00:03:45.989> watch<00:03:46.109> is<00:03:46.169> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.680> make

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
i think the apple watch is going to make

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.439 
i think the apple watch is going to make
them<00:03:47.009> better<00:03:47.310> especially<00:03:47.609> for<00:03:48.030> people<00:03:48.120> that

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
them better especially for people that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.629 
them better especially for people that
don't<00:03:48.659> use<00:03:49.379> an<00:03:49.530> iphone<00:03:49.979> so<00:03:50.220> we'll<00:03:50.370> see<00:03:50.519> where

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
don't use an iphone so we'll see where

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.119 
don't use an iphone so we'll see where
that<00:03:50.790> ends<00:03:51.060> up<00:03:51.389> as<00:03:51.659> time<00:03:51.959> goes<00:03:52.199> on<00:03:52.349> now<00:03:52.799> i<00:03:52.829> also

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
that ends up as time goes on now i also

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.390 
that ends up as time goes on now i also
ordered<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.930> pebble<00:03:54.930> time<00:03:55.259> and<00:03:55.680> what<00:03:56.189> was

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
ordered a pebble time and what was

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.610 
ordered a pebble time and what was
interesting<00:03:56.430> about<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.329> watch<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:58.139> me<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
interesting about this watch for me is a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.259 
interesting about this watch for me is a
couple<00:03:58.889> of<00:03:58.979> things<00:03:59.009> one<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.549> it<00:03:59.790> lasts<00:04:00.150> an

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
couple of things one is that it lasts an

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.990 
couple of things one is that it lasts an
entire<00:04:00.569> week<00:04:00.989> or<00:04:01.199> more<00:04:01.470> between<00:04:02.370> charges<00:04:02.729> so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
entire week or more between charges so

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.339 
entire week or more between charges so
the<00:04:03.120> Apple<00:04:03.359> watch<00:04:03.479> has<00:04:03.689> to<00:04:03.810> be<00:04:03.900> charged<00:04:04.199> every

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
the Apple watch has to be charged every

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.949 
the Apple watch has to be charged every
day<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:05.159> do<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> lot<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.579> Android<00:04:06.030> watches<00:04:06.780> but

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
day as do a lot of Android watches but

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.990 
day as do a lot of Android watches but
the<00:04:07.439> pebble<00:04:07.680> time<00:04:07.949> is<00:04:08.159> using<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.609> special

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
the pebble time is using a special

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.360 
the pebble time is using a special
screen<00:04:09.329> it's<00:04:09.509> got<00:04:09.689> a<00:04:09.870> en<00:04:10.349> screen<00:04:10.739> similar<00:04:11.009> to

what<00:04:11.609> you'd<00:04:11.729> see<00:04:11.909> on<00:04:11.939> an<00:04:12.180> on<00:04:12.569> an<00:04:12.689> Amazon<00:04:13.019> Kindle

too<00:04:45.690> I<00:04:45.720> kind<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.410> missed<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.770> boat<00:04:46.950> on<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
too I kind of missed the boat on the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.770 
too I kind of missed the boat on the
first<00:04:47.370> iteration<00:04:47.580> of<00:04:48.030> them<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.330> I'd<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:48.480> to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
first iteration of them so I'd like to

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.300 
first iteration of them so I'd like to
take<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.440> look<00:04:49.620> at<00:04:49.740> some<00:04:49.890> of<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.070> next

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
take a look at some of the next

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.650 
take a look at some of the next
generation<00:04:50.340> watches<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.240> are<00:04:51.300> coming<00:04:51.570> out

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
generation watches that are coming out

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.480 
generation watches that are coming out
so<00:04:51.780> they<00:04:51.870> look<00:04:52.050> really<00:04:52.230> good<00:04:52.560> my<00:04:53.250> main

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
so they look really good my main

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.790 
so they look really good my main
objection<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.540> to<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:54.960> Android<00:04:55.410> watches

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
objection to the to the Android watches

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.960 
objection to the to the Android watches
initially<00:04:56.190> is<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.640> them<00:04:56.730> looked

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
initially is that all of them looked

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.000 
initially is that all of them looked
really<00:04:57.180> big<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.810> clunky<00:04:58.140> so<00:04:58.500> I'm<00:04:58.590> looking<00:04:58.980> to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
really big and clunky so I'm looking to

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.760 
really big and clunky so I'm looking to
see<00:04:59.310> as<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.300> know<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.540> next<00:05:00.720> year<00:05:01.020> progresses

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.680 
see as you know the next year progresses
how<00:05:02.400> they<00:05:02.550> kind<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:02.760> get<00:05:02.910> these<00:05:03.090> watches<00:05:03.510> down

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
how they kind of get these watches down

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.880 
how they kind of get these watches down
a<00:05:03.720> little<00:05:03.930> bit<00:05:04.110> smaller<00:05:04.440> because<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:04.800> I've

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
a little bit smaller because what I've

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.470 
a little bit smaller because what I've
seen<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.310> Apple<00:05:05.670> watch<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:06.030> far<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.360> some
