00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.720
 hello I am the teacher idc 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.269
 climbed today I was talking to you 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.849
 safety instructions 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:14.280
 the safety instructions to be observed in 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 general are very very simple just 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.720
 just to be attentive to what we are doing 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.050
 attentive to what the other climber does 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.230
 and check if the important points of the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.019
 material the knot the belay system 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.150
 if you would like to tie very very 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.040
 important since it has enough of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 quickdraws I present the material 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.690
 quickly made the harness the material 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 belay 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 and finally those called quickdraws 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 that we pose as and when 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.450
 the ascent 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.820
 so that the insurer that provides 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 climber must verify that the climber has 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.600
 well set up his harness and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 especially since he realized his 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.039
 climber him to check the same thing 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.070
 at the level of the insurer ie 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.100
 that he put on his harness and that his 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.659
 belay system is well locked 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.180
 very important if before the climber 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.710
 do not go off to climb well 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 check that at the other end of the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.430
 rope serving at the other end there is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 a year simply why when the 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.100
 climber goes down if ever the coward and 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 too short 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.680
 she'll go through the camera at once 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.000
 who will escape the hands of the insurer 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 result of the races the graffiti sfar himself 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.299
 find on the ground 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 more or less injured according to the height of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.979
 fall among the important things 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.420
 regarding security there is also the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.590
 rope 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 okay let you just stay 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 alive so if she shows some 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.729
 signs of wear heavenly it's it 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 not the same diameter in some places 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.079
 that's how it could have been very smooth to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.479
 stuffed animals and all that you have to be wary of 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 if he took the water if then she took 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.460
 the sun and risk losing its 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 elasticity of knowing that a rope is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.600
 relaxes 10 % of its circle length 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.880
 if he gave twenty meters and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.700
 relaxes 2 meters which allows 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 to cushion shocks so falls what 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 you take it between your two fingers and 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.879
 you are trying to crush him if he remains a 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.850
 little hole like that it's glam is 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.800
 still good so your rope 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.360
 viable so now we really come 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.940
 for gluing the two is that it is 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.230
 damn it's better not use it for 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.630
 do escalations other point 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.970
 important concerning the material the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.250
 material with which it is realized these 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.020
 two usually aluminum 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 duralumin or aluminum alloy 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 any 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.230
 the fact is that this material is very 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.390
 very rigid light and the problem is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 that if he falls if he is hit by 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.960
 something harder it can be 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.430
 that they make the microcracks then 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.970
 microcracks they are often 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.100
 inside 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.530
 if after a shock there is a tension 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.820
 excessive due to the climber's fall he 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.390
 it is possible that because of this micro 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.190
 cracks this gear this tool breaks so 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.200
 it breaks obviously the climber falls 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.730
 and eventually and only die for 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.480
 conclude when you go up in 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.890
 cliff the most important moment 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.500
 that's when you place your 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.100
 material on the rope the system 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.840
 belay 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.240
 all the equipment you need at this 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.010
 moment there you must be super attentive 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.440
 after reindeer hinders you from 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.590
 burst but especially at that moment 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.650
 be very very vigilant and have fun 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.650
 well
