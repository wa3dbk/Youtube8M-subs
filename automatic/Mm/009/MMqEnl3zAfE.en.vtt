the blue tips things like that short
very<00:01:02.720> short<00:01:03.339> staccato<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.789> little<00:01:05.179> burst<00:01:05.479> of

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:05.679 
very short staccato a little burst of

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:08.950 
very short staccato a little burst of
wind<00:01:06.679> and<00:01:07.009> very<00:01:07.249> very<00:01:07.579> high<00:01:07.759> high<00:01:08.450> sounds

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
wind and very very high high sounds

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.989 
wind and very very high high sounds
something<00:01:09.740> like<00:01:09.859> this

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:15.999 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:18.340 

so<00:01:16.999> how<00:01:17.090> do<00:01:17.149> I<00:01:17.270> get<00:01:17.389> those<00:01:17.600> very<00:01:17.869> high<00:01:17.990> sounds

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
so how do I get those very high sounds

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.190 
so how do I get those very high sounds
like<00:01:18.499> that<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:18.979> really<00:01:19.359> making<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.509> aperture

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
like that I'm really making the aperture

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.679 
like that I'm really making the aperture
between<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.679> lips<00:01:21.889> as<00:01:22.729> small<00:01:23.119> as<00:01:23.240> possible

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
between the lips as small as possible

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.289 
between the lips as small as possible
really<00:01:27.909> like<00:01:28.909> that

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
really like that

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.449 
really like that
so<00:01:29.539> once<00:01:29.689> you've<00:01:29.840> mustered<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:30.499> type<00:01:31.429> of

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
so once you've mustered that type of

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.429 
so once you've mustered that type of
bird<00:01:32.270> whistle<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:32.749> might<00:01:32.899> want<00:01:33.079> to<00:01:33.139> move<00:01:33.289> on
