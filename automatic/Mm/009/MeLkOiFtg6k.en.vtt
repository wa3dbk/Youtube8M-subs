intermediate skill level videos and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
intermediate skill level videos and then
you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.829> come<00:00:41.010> down<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> can

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
interested in a false cut and there you

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
interested in a false cut and there you
go<00:00:56.430> there's<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.120> intermediate<00:00:57.420> level

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
site-wide chatroom so you can navigate

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.139 
site-wide chatroom so you can navigate
through<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.880> site<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:50.460> chatroom<00:01:51.000> will

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
through the site and that chatroom will

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
through the site and that chatroom will
still<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.780> takes<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> second<00:01:52.649> or<00:01:52.740> two

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
still be there it takes a second or two

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.270 
still be there it takes a second or two
to<00:01:53.100> open<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.430> again<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.909> there<00:01:54.119> are<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
to open up again but there are this and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.359 
to open up again but there are this and
and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> can<00:01:56.700> resize<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.990> window<00:01:58.369> can

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
and then you can resize the window can

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.950 
and then you can resize the window can
make<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> smaller<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> bigger

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
make it smaller you can make it bigger

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.920 
make it smaller you can make it bigger
and<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:01.950> minimize<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.790> want<00:02:03.000> okay

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and you can minimize it if you want okay

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.910
