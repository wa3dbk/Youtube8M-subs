00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
yeah this is actually pretty good I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.620 
yeah this is actually pretty good I
would<00:01:44.040> rate<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.820> high<00:01:45.270> four<00:01:45.509> out<00:01:45.600> of

would rate this one a high four out of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
would rate this one a high four out of
five<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.560> almost<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.790> ever

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
five but this is almost like if you ever

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.850 
five but this is almost like if you ever
wondered<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:49.049> Pringles<00:01:49.439> would<00:01:49.560> taste<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
wondered what Pringles would taste like

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.700 
wondered what Pringles would taste like
in<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.549> candy<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.180> me<00:01:51.329> that's<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
in like candy for me that's what it is I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.080 
in like candy for me that's what it is I
still<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.399> think<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.700> weird<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.939> they

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
still really think it's weird that they

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
still really think it's weird that they
have<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.509> sticks<00:01:54.780> up<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> top<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.290> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
have like sticks up at the top but then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.480 
have like sticks up at the top but then
it's<00:01:55.740> filled<00:01:55.950> with<00:01:56.009> chips

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's filled with chips

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.649 
it's filled with chips
I<00:01:56.579> mean<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.820> Pringles<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.299> that's<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> be

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I mean it's Pringles so that's to be

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.819 
I mean it's Pringles so that's to be
expected<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.259> still<00:01:58.439> kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> weird

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
expected but it's still kind of weird

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.289 
expected but it's still kind of weird
but<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.549> really<00:01:59.640> good<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.090> they

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
but these are really good I know they

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
but these are really good I know they
had<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.659> other<00:02:00.810> Christmas<00:02:01.320> flavor<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:02.040> well
