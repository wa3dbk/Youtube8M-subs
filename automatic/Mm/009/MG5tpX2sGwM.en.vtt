I<00:01:30.110> can<00:01:30.350> find<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.520> like<00:01:31.760> literally<00:01:32.540> like

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
I can find and it's like literally like

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.230 
I can find and it's like literally like
it's<00:01:32.990> teeny<00:01:33.500> tiny<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.100> mean<00:01:34.580> if<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.790> if<00:01:35.030> you

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
it's teeny tiny I mean if you if you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.850 
it's teeny tiny I mean if you if you
don't<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.540> one<00:01:35.900> of<00:01:35.930> those<00:01:36.080> really<00:01:36.260> tiny<00:01:36.560> ones

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
don't have one of those really tiny ones

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.700 
don't have one of those really tiny ones
then<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.670> could<00:01:37.790> probably<00:01:37.970> use<00:01:38.360> um<00:01:38.930> a

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
then you could probably use um a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.530 
then you could probably use um a
slightly<00:01:40.250> bigger<00:01:40.490> one<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:41.119> just<00:01:41.360> what

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
slightly bigger one but that's just what

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.410 
slightly bigger one but that's just what
I<00:01:41.570> use<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:41.990> then<00:01:42.140> obviously<00:01:42.740> like<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.040> brush

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
I use and then obviously like a brush

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.570 
I use and then obviously like a brush
and<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:45.259> actually<00:01:45.530> honestly<00:01:46.070> probably

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
and I actually honestly probably

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.850 
and I actually honestly probably
wouldn't<00:01:46.790> even<00:01:46.850> need<00:01:47.000> a<00:01:47.060> brush<00:01:47.500> it's<00:01:48.500> like<00:01:48.680> not

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
wouldn't even need a brush it's like not

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.380 
wouldn't even need a brush it's like not
you<00:01:49.610> could<00:01:49.729> probably<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.210> comb

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
you could probably just like comb

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.880 
you could probably just like comb

extra<00:03:36.070> hair<00:03:36.220> with<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.000> tiniest<00:03:37.299> strand<00:03:37.630> I

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
extra hair with so the tiniest strand I

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.380 
extra hair with so the tiniest strand I
do<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.769> same<00:03:38.950> thing<00:03:39.160> with<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.519> one<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:42.390> then

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
do the same thing with that one and then

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.310 
do the same thing with that one and then
um<00:03:43.750> I<00:03:44.230> just<00:03:45.120> regular<00:03:46.120> braid<00:03:46.420> for<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.019> little<00:03:47.230> bit

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
um I just regular braid for a little bit

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.140 
um I just regular braid for a little bit
because<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.680> gets<00:03:47.799> more<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.130> braid<00:03:48.370> look<00:03:48.700> so

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
because it gets more of a braid look so

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.120 
because it gets more of a braid look so
I'll<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:49.630> do<00:03:50.109> regular<00:03:50.260> braids<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:50.829> picking

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130

most of the braids that I've seen when
people<00:06:15.880> do<00:06:16.449> their<00:06:16.569> hair<00:06:16.690> like<00:06:16.840> this<00:06:17.050> is

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
people do their hair like this is

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.680 
people do their hair like this is
they'll<00:06:17.889> do<00:06:18.310> a<00:06:18.340> full-on<00:06:18.610> French<00:06:19.060> braid<00:06:19.389> and

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.469 
they'll do a full-on French braid and
what<00:06:19.900> I<00:06:19.930> found<00:06:20.169> with<00:06:20.440> that<00:06:20.470> braid<00:06:20.889> is<00:06:21.099> that

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
what I found with that braid is that

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.640 
what I found with that braid is that

it's harder to put your hair up into a

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:24.990 
it's harder to put your hair up into a
ponytail<00:06:23.710> because<00:06:24.160> it's<00:06:24.400> like<00:06:24.550> this<00:06:24.759> whole

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
ponytail because it's like this whole

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.330 
ponytail because it's like this whole
area<00:06:25.509> is<00:06:25.569> like<00:06:25.720> a<00:06:25.840> braid<00:06:26.139> and<00:06:26.380> it's<00:06:26.590> just<00:06:26.830> mmm<00:06:27.250> I
