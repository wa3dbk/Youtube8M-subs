00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 there are very good everyone and it is so moment 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.200
 with an old lady 5 in this case we are 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 playing a new career with 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.010
 subscribers and we are with him in marmoset 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.389
 well, in fact we are all with the marmoset 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 because it was the only car that could be 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.860
 catch and we went first perfect 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.969
 perfect we come out in a very position 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.500
 good we have also made an exit 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.600
 pretty good less badly than without 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.210
 contact because right now I would have 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.529
 sent to China but good and relief 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.010
 I just do not need to mel 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.269
 someone to mess it up is worth the case 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 that to play with me the boy the only thing 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.210
 what you have to do is follow me 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 twitter since when I play with you 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.690
 so I put it on twitter I put a tweet 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.739
 with the I think you have to put though 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.980
 also the ones that you have in the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.710
 description said this we go eighths and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.590
 let's start here overtake in mode 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.969
 spectacular voucher worth 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.370
 let's go the curve ojito ojito around here 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.050
 we put ourselves sixth we can get in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.670
 better position 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 It's worth watching, I'm careful. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 here it seems there are not many vouchers 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.780
 He puts a lamp in the middle to mess it up 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 I'm here over here my mother fifth 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.850
 It's worth, it's worth, we have not lost many 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.150
 positions for now 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.090
 we only have here because they are 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.890
 all because we would go very fast 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.479
 we managed to gain time and we have the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.350
 first three here in front well fine 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.040
 well we can already here among all and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.120
 now here surely this one 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.850
 how complicated it is here less than 5 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.660
 because I would have to be reborn 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.230
 lately the faces who puts without 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.510
 Contact I am listening to the creator 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.070
 because I 'm going to shit on everything because I do not 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.140
 I have no no no no no see 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.479
 to see that we just fight a lot 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
 because it will already be two or three 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
 safe 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.340
 and it is getting there is coming 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.020
 I do not know what to tell you 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.120
 I do not know what to say if it's going to happen to 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.370
 someone I think so 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.920
 no idea, no idea, no hope 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.810
 we really go fourth two seconds 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 third party is worth it if it has happened has been 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 only one 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.810
 I dont believe it 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.270
 one has passed it because it is super 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.560
 far 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.880
 It is worth little by little bit by bit 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.630
 I do not know what 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.800
 I do not think that nobody has passed 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.800
 but they are still there 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.380
 but they might have caught first 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:31.140
 point 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.350
 but it is because too far away 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.010
 state 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.010
 they're here 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.659
 Okay, this is already done. 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.549
 I know what I was doing wrong there 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.709
 I thought he sent me directly and I 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.299
 I can turn you around a bit and I was 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.170
 doing perfect perfect wrong does not happen 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.400
 nothing 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.030
 in this if everything goes well we do it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.639
 well, there is another one who is there 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.069
 is going there there is one who has just 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.019
 happen 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.840
 it does not take the point from I do not know why 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.450
 do not take the next point to see the same 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 is that it is complicated that is worth this already 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.120
 While this makes me put me so I told 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.730
 the return around here sends us 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.610
 here it can not be 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.620
 it can not be what just happened what 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.330
 we had all done 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.970
 everything only had to be put in 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.799
 damn car has gotten us nothing happens 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.040
 nothing happens is first table that a lot 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.040
 advantage 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.520
 but not if there are two that already 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.040
 least they have spent it entirely because 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.020
 they are already returning to the site so 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.500
 now it would only be to do this 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.600
 this way over there we leave this 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.310
 which is now around here we turn 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.310
 here the car we control 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.989
 I do not believe it I tend to believe it but if 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.400
 it is that's not failure that is not 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.840
 well put or something is happening 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 it's happening very very weird 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.980
 because it is to say that one touched the wine of 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.230
 Walt roots but you can not 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.620
 you have to shoot epic and guys like 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.099
 never as we never go last 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.299
 but this is going to change quickly if it goes 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.849
 to change we are going to do it here all 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.519
 perfect in plan pim pam pim pam 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.280
 we do this right now we put ourselves by 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.549
 here perfect we give here the return 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.230
 you have to be careful because my name 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.730
 is that I can not do more 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.820
 Let's see 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.820
 the sky not of the world does not make sense 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:33.430
 if he would have to send us alone 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.689
 I'm doing it right, I'm 100% 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.520
 safe 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.380
 come come come quick 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.160
 Quick 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.740
 we crash or crash do looping 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.310
 we go down like this backwards we accelerate here to 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.080
 butt we put the car well 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.390
 and finally it was time to give and as not 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.500
 I would pick at that point if I was seeing that 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.420
 this second point is costing them 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.360
 pretty to one 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:05.960
 I do not know why the fact is that we're going 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.090
 sixth low is the first one is already going to be 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.340
 yes the one that goes before me 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.639
 that you can know if it's the one in front 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.410
 mine so let's see what 7 here the 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:19.310
 objective I believe that between the three 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:21.380
 first if we were left I would give more than 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.410
 satisfied is first I think it is 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.350
 very difficult because they get us quite and 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.060
 to see is going to give him a lot of time 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.500
 It's going to take a lot of time 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.639
 to keep trying years until I 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.830
 I arrived 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.599
 because I still have enough one already 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.180
 the first one comes, it's worth that, I knew it 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.819
 I imagined it was normal but good 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.860
 we can still be between the second 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.599
 or the third if we still have options 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.099
 we have options even one of those 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.969
 two positions would be very good because 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:49.669
 you have already seen that he is doing it 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.129
 perfect and I did not get well worth another 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.030
 it remains second another is third one was 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.160
 normal was normal 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.650
 that was logical because it was that I got 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.940
 very much and had then all the time 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.680
 of the world to try the thousand times 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.110
 OK 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.960
 rooms 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.360
 could be quarters the position that all 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.860
 we are waiting for one who is there 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.620
 unemployed more than in contact because if not 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.210
 is to the minimum I would block the space myself 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.780
 could happen to me I think that's the 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.300
 quarter 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.800
 and that's why it's standing there why 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.720
 ok ojito ojito that we put rooms 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.729
 we take the sea point and we do it and all 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.960
 the first we do it the first time 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.080
 you will see how it is until the return 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.879
 quick I'm one hundred percent sure I'm 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.830
 100% sure you just make the return 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:41.050
 fast, well, we passed it to the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.020
 first with that I think I'm more 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.970
 happy because at the beginning it has 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.340
 cost a lot because I do not know why 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.220
 I did not get right in that in that last 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.810
 which root are we going to see as for example 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.120
 the fifth and as I say I do not understand why 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.500
 what did not get me in the damn point 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.419
 because I was doing everything perfect 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.860
 I already had a controlled car in those 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.719
 which root that has already seen that there is 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.240
 tour us yes that sent us 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:06.219
 automatically but the case is that not 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.870
 it has been quite strange at the end 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:09.909
 we have managed to move to the next to 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.229
 the second and I'm super convinced of 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:12.879
 which has been the quick return because it 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.560
 went to the first and the others have 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:17.280
 had more in a safe try I'm 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.889
 sure to see if this one passed 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.479
 ok not good guys I hope that I have 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:24.190
 liked I know if I would appreciate very much if 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:25.479
 you say video your christ I'm not for 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.900
 lose none and we do not see the next 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.900
 goodbye
