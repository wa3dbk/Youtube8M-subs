 Greetings to everyone. I BOOWHOWOO. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.840
 Today, I will show you some toothpick dance. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:39.920
 Material: water, 5 toothpicks, dropper (or straw) 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.560
 Mantra --- change to a star !! 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.280
 1. Bend the toothpick in the center. 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.260
 Make sure you do not get out of them completely 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 But just bending. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 2. Place the toothpick 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 Radically on the table. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.460
 3. Let a few drops fall in the middle of this toothpick. 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.800
 It is not ideal but almost a star. 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.440
 This is the last time. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.680
 He does not seem to want to be a star ... 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.560
 How was the video today? 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.280

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.960
