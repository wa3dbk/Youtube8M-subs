00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.070
 something like that is welcome from today 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 again here on my channel people 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.890
 here today again a spontaneous 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.330
 video and although I would like ever 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.539
 I apologize for that now 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.060
 last I believe 45 days no video 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.720
 may it be because of my internet 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 haunting it all over again and yes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.940
 I 've got it always I could always 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.059
 so upload a little 20% and then 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.230
 but I had to stop because easy 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.680
 the internet is not against then 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 would have been up there sharing parts 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.129
 1000 minutes and so on it was 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 Of course not in the direction of Berlin 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.670
 disabled 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.120
 We see an attitude believes so 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.340
 three two or three minutes explained 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.170
 not my game from the clan colleague 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.859
 definitely fresh from me 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.809
 to look 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 It's not the topic of boys today 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.049
 Today is a bit like that 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.460
 call of duty scene or how they feel 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.750
 has changed in recent years 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 currently there are so many truckers 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.409
 and so on as many as I would like 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.990
 like which would like to run around professionals 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.799
 many say that vista basra would be enough 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.290
 scorpion and upgrade eg montana visa 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.259
 make sure to blame but the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.880
 can not do anything okay 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.650
 maybe they have a bit with us 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.939
 because many watch their videos 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.380
 and they just want to be like that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.110
 you 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.649
 but I mean it is, it is 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.909
 simply fact that the 490 and the ska 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.070
 h &amp; m makes the strongest weapons because 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.659
 why should not you take them me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.950
 my husband would indeed a principle 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.110
 Disadvantage if you go against one 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.290
 would take take weaker weapon 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.270
 rather than the stronger weapon I mean it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.229
 is just how the weapons are 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.930
 just strength and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.799
 which in my opinion also after 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.660
 bit which started community 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.750
 somehow the main menu of black ops 2 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.510
 it is much more open than for 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 example mp3 mp2 and so on you can 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.480
 for example my last games 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.030
 you can just hit it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.769
 take a look at the menu and or you can 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.660
 just look at all his statistics 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.239
 And it is for example everyone wants 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.680
 be sure to be the best with the kd's 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.860
 pushes most players yet 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 somehow eschborn or what I know and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.069
 I think that the strongest bit is the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.560
 community I'll still remember that 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.690
 good old times mw3 where it just 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.390
 killed gamble against non somewhere a 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.400
 shit would be the best lived or the 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.840
 best wires i mean thats 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.450
 Actually incidental it is also about 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.660
 I gamble my for some people it is 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.120
 apparently more important than eating 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.720
 or so that your animals get away 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.720
 held 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.549
 instead of you, there are really people 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.190
 They can easily do a four-string 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.690
 just keep it without a dashboard or something 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.389
 but then there are those people who do that 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.519
 Bonner play bot lobby and hold her 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.959
 error kg against the I in principle 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.790
 I have a cd but will still be 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.069
 specify that then it somehow 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.959
 I think and that's partly what I 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.410
 as a bit weird if this 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.650
 I'm the best 4 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:32.840
 kg of thousands pretzel and so it wonders 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.920
 Also what a lot of people are so upset 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.380
 adjusts 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.870
 are all these 13 year olds 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.200
 twelve-year-olds who simply call in 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.639
 Duty just tick off freedoms me 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.530
 many of the little children think so 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:53.239
 if much better than most 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.639
 from the big 27 20 year olds or something 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.069
 they just have a much nimble handed 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:01.730
 always better reflexes and such 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.010
 and yes that is plays you are allowed though 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.859
 but not yet play honestly who 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.459
 has stayed on even today 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:12.560
 the age restriction for example too 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:18.799
 at film in the film are 18 everyone looks 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.900
 the on and so it does not matter so in the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.849
 by and large the community call of 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.020
 Duty community has already changed 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:30.740
 for example, this ego with the kg and 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.410
 so who is the better destroyer to the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.660
 great part so the community and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.190
 sometimes even destroys friendships 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.070
 although I can not understand that one 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.259
 may not forget is always a 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.440
 Spielleute and well you sweat 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.680
 Of course, like the ass but man 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.780
 Sweating is only half the life of people 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.910
 There is still a real life friends 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.580
 and so people you never forget 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.990
 in any case, it's just a game 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.120
 the community has already changed 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.720
 I have to say but you can not do that 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.949
 to disc abbas abu mazen scorpion das 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.960
 you can not cling to that 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.750
 is just a general at the 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.289
 other personalities of people like 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.060
 they have changed or others 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.360
 General play a lot more people call 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.650
 of duty than at that time I believe and he has 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.120
 at some point it had to come so far so 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.449
 you can not do it on the youtube 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.599
 written because I mean every player 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.960
 or at least most of them 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.210
 and yes it would be from this one 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.610
 small themes come carey if I am so 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.810
 may call 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.710
 Yes, I would like ever 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.650
 apologize for the slip of the tongue 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.090
 video might already there were 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.060
 I am still a real know how in 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.590
 things humor carey and so on but 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.110
 I will definitely go on 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.449
 So I will stick to it I stay 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.340
 just say stay tuned and open 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.150
 any case if i like the video 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.740
 has left thumb up there little 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.710
 switch rating what bad here 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.780
 in the front for example and yes that would be it 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.780
 I'll be away from you until next time
