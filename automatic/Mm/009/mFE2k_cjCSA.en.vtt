bucket<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.980> now<00:02:39.980> let's<00:02:40.190> go<00:02:40.310> do<00:02:40.459> another<00:02:40.489> one

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
bucket in now let's go do another one

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.180 
bucket in now let's go do another one
over<00:02:41.090> there<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.599> the<00:02:42.590> poles<00:02:42.799> are<00:02:42.950> going<00:02:43.129> to

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
over there and the poles are going to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.050 
over there and the poles are going to
run<00:02:43.280> along<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.760> Mac<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.150> PVC<00:02:44.629> pipe<00:02:46.060> I've

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
run along there Mac the PVC pipe I've

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.449 
run along there Mac the PVC pipe I've
come<00:02:47.390> 20<00:02:47.840> centimeters<00:02:48.500> down<00:02:48.769> from<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.220> top

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
come 20 centimeters down from the top

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.170 
come 20 centimeters down from the top
and<00:02:50.109> then<00:02:51.109> I've<00:02:51.290> drilled<00:02:51.590> with<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.609> drill<00:02:52.970> bit

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and then I've drilled with a drill bit

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.270 
and then I've drilled with a drill bit
some<00:02:53.480> guide<00:02:53.720> holes<00:02:54.019> for<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.319> screws<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.769> go<00:02:55.099> in

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
some guide holes for the screws to go in

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360 
some guide holes for the screws to go in
then<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.609> go<00:02:55.760> down<00:02:55.970> 20<00:02:56.389> centimeters<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.079> there

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
then you go down 20 centimeters to there

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.649 
then you go down 20 centimeters to there
so<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.519> is<00:02:58.549> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.849> 40<00:02:59.209> centimeter

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
so this is going to be 40 centimeter

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.699 
so this is going to be 40 centimeter
drop<00:02:59.930> from<00:03:00.170> there<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.519> next<00:03:01.819> holes<00:03:02.709> those

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
drop from there to the next holes those

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.520 
drop from there to the next holes those
two<00:03:04.040> for<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> bracket<00:03:04.849> then<00:03:05.299> another<00:03:05.569> 40

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
two for the bracket then another 40

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.119 
two for the bracket then another 40
centimeters<00:03:07.129> one<00:03:07.879> two<00:03:08.530> suites<00:03:09.530> I've<00:03:09.769> got<00:03:09.980> me

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
centimeters one two suites I've got me

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.580 
centimeters one two suites I've got me
90<00:03:10.489> degree<00:03:10.760> turns<00:03:11.060> as<00:03:11.420> expected<00:03:12.139> I've<00:03:12.349> used

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
90 degree turns as expected I've used

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.030 
90 degree turns as expected I've used
90ml<00:03:13.310> pipe<00:03:13.639> so<00:03:14.170> because<00:03:15.170> these<00:03:15.409> are<00:03:15.739> smaller

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
90ml pipe so because these are smaller

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.550 
90ml pipe so because these are smaller
than<00:03:16.609> 100<00:03:17.150> or<00:03:17.269> 110<00:03:17.900> mill<00:03:19.840> I'm<00:03:20.840> gonna<00:03:21.139> need<00:03:21.500> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
than 100 or 110 mill I'm gonna need a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.210 
than 100 or 110 mill I'm gonna need a
gap<00:03:22.660> because<00:03:23.660> they're<00:03:23.840> not<00:03:23.989> joining<00:03:24.500> so

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
gap because they're not joining so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.800 
gap because they're not joining so
luckily<00:03:25.609> that's<00:03:25.849> why<00:03:26.060> I've<00:03:26.180> kept<00:03:26.419> some<00:03:26.629> of<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
luckily that's why I've kept some of the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.129 
luckily that's why I've kept some of the
space<00:03:27.049> up<00:03:27.430> because<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:29.480> give<00:03:29.629> me<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> little

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:30.139 
space up because you give me a little

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.270 
space up because you give me a little
bit<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:31.760> little<00:03:31.790> bit<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:33.680> turn<00:03:33.889> around<00:03:34.069> the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
bit just a little bit to turn around the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.900 
bit just a little bit to turn around the
corner<00:03:34.609> and<00:03:35.389> then<00:03:36.079> that<00:03:36.260> will<00:03:36.379> then<00:03:36.500> allow<00:03:36.650> me

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
corner and then that will then allow me

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.689 
corner and then that will then allow me
put<00:03:37.910> my<00:03:38.030> bracket<00:03:38.480> right<00:03:38.900> in<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.079> middle<00:03:39.699> sweet

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:40.699 
put my bracket right in the middle sweet

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.569 
put my bracket right in the middle sweet
mate<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:42.319> the<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:42.799> thing<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.549> remember

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
mate and the other thing to remember

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.289 
mate and the other thing to remember
really<00:03:44.329> important<00:03:44.720> is<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:46.250> haven't<00:03:47.090> put

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
really important is that I haven't put

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.270 
really important is that I haven't put
the<00:03:47.419> other<00:03:47.540> bucket<00:03:47.930> of<00:03:48.019> concrete<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.470> yet<00:03:48.859> over

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
the other bucket of concrete in yet over

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.420 
the other bucket of concrete in yet over
here<00:03:49.989> why<00:03:50.989> haven't<00:03:51.349> even<00:03:51.530> dug<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.949> hole<00:03:52.129> yet

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
here why haven't even dug the hole yet

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.050 
here why haven't even dug the hole yet
because<00:03:52.849> if<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.660> put<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.109> that<00:03:54.760> that's<00:03:55.760> not

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
because if I put it like that that's not

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.909 
because if I put it like that that's not
our<00:03:56.090> foot<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:56.750> cut<00:03:57.079> it<00:03:57.109> down<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.349> nine<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:57.889> a

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
our foot now cut it down to nine and a

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.159 
our foot now cut it down to nine and a
half<00:03:57.949> foot<00:03:58.310> they're<00:03:58.519> going<00:03:58.669> to<00:03:58.730> be<00:03:58.879> if<00:03:59.870> I<00:04:00.109> do

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
half foot they're going to be if I do

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.750 
half foot they're going to be if I do
that<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:00.919> it<00:04:01.069> has<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.370> trickle<00:04:01.730> down

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
that because it has to trickle down

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.149 
that because it has to trickle down
you're<00:04:02.239> going<00:04:02.359> to<00:04:02.419> lose<00:04:02.540> some<00:04:02.780> distance<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.069> if

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 
you're going to lose some distance so if

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.740 
you're going to lose some distance so if
I'd<00:04:04.280> put<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.579> pole<00:04:04.790> in<00:04:05.030> it's<00:04:05.329> not<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.659> to

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
I'd put the pole in it's not going to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.569 
I'd put the pole in it's not going to
reach<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.680> there<00:04:06.859> you<00:04:06.949> go<00:04:06.980> that's<00:04:07.220> what<00:04:07.400> she's

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
reach so there you go that's what she's

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.909 
reach so there you go that's what she's
going<00:04:07.699> to<00:04:07.760> look<00:04:07.909> like<00:04:07.940> going<00:04:08.389> around<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.690> pole

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
going to look like going around the pole

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.199 
going to look like going around the pole
I'm<00:04:09.919> just<00:04:10.129> getting<00:04:10.430> them<00:04:10.579> ready<00:04:10.760> or<00:04:10.970> haven't

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849

haven't<00:04:14.120> glued<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.389> yet<00:04:14.569> but<00:04:14.750> I'm<00:04:14.870> just

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.710 
it's funny my spacers exactly 10
centimeters<00:04:26.650> so<00:04:27.759> that<00:04:28.759> was<00:04:28.940> dumb<00:04:29.180> luck<00:04:29.210> folks

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
centimeters so that was dumb luck folks

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.100

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
what you're going to do you're not going

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.480 
what you're going to do you're not going
to<00:04:34.430> have<00:04:34.520> much<00:04:34.789> over<00:04:35.349> just<00:04:36.349> a<00:04:36.500> little<00:04:36.530> bit<00:04:37.009> just

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
to have much over just a little bit just

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.839 
to have much over just a little bit just
enough<00:04:37.639> over<00:04:38.300> like<00:04:39.259> that<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:40.069> as<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.520> can<00:04:40.610> see

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
enough over like that so as you can see

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.370 
enough over like that so as you can see
there's<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.449> little<00:04:41.479> bit<00:04:41.750> there<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.139> a<00:04:42.229> bit

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380

there's a little bit there it's a bit
bigger<00:04:42.590> than<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.860> pipe<00:04:43.069> so<00:04:43.880> if<00:04:44.210> you<00:04:44.419> put<00:04:44.569> the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
bigger than the pipe so if you put the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.020 
bigger than the pipe so if you put the
pipe<00:04:44.900> against<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.410> pole<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.949> it's<00:04:46.729> there

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
pipe against the pole and it's there

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.700 
pipe against the pole and it's there
you're<00:04:47.780> not<00:04:47.840> going<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.110> be<00:04:48.169> able<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.380> put<00:04:48.500> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
lid on see the turn so you're going to

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.260 
lid on see the turn so you're going to
make<00:04:51.500> sure<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.340> put<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.699> add<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> little

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
bit as well out from the pole after

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:59.140 
bit as well out from the pole after
