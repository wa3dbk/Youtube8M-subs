 good friends of the channel is I encourage that 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.839
 we are today in the rotation of champions 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.250
 well if you hear me there is a little weird 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.080
 is that it is feverish and good 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.380
 I'm here anyway to do the 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.030
 trade of the day let's go starting in 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.119
 today's rotation we have cork and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 doctor world catalina civil green dame 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.500
 mckay river tics and I'll explain it 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.289
 a little bit the strengths and the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 skinny spots of these characters first 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.890
 character that we have because as you know 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 Corghi is a character that has very 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 good damage in area can burst 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.550
 mature with their physical and magical damage and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 true is a good character that forms 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.129
 to very easily also has a good 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.750
 push or good bullying is also one of 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.410
 the character that by law has a very 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.870
 good dps has a car that is a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.430
 fragile shaped to escape and I want 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.020
 also say that this character then 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.449
 good can reveal to the units that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.500
 they are in the hedges the contra is that is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.280
 plus dependent also has 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.800
 but dependent has a note of very 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.680
 little range lacks any kind of 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.450
 cc has very low version of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.100
 base movement to start game and a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 bit of hard to master 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.080
 now we talk about the world with 6 world is 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.549
 a character who has very good endurance 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 above those characters that also 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.299
 things very well with your book is very easy 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.130
 they're mega with him from level 6 is 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.950
 almost a tablet with its last except 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.799
 that has understand is also very 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.140
 good in a one against one is a piece 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.049
 of tank and some cases become 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 spend impossible to kill the against is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 that is a character that if you do not know how to use 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 alright fine alright you are going to have 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.840
 difficulties at the beginning 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.280
 it's not worth going up the character 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.909
 entertaining means and their points 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.340
 strong are both the top and the jungle 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.020
 and if families at the beginning very bad then 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.939
 you'll have difficulties after 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.219
 ledger is very important in ideas 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.450
 well and we also have to have a lot 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.009
 in mind that every time we have 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.289
 skills you lose life you have to 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.969
 quickly have the equipment of a 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.340
 minimum water to withstand the 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.989
 substitution now let's talk about 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.099
 katharina as you know catarina those 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.620
 characters that have a lot of damage 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.989
 explosive plus with which you can 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360
 escape easily you can push very 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.030
 well with your q you have a multi with 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.860
 multiple goals and it becomes 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.370
 one of the strongest characters in the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.590
 skate if you ask also to tell you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.690
 that this character is very, very, very 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 difficult to big that's why it's so good 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.989
 for its escape the contra is that in the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.640
 game shift almea is a lot but it does not 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.430
 sÃ¡enz and it fails to equip it does not 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.410
 you have a good team you are not so hard 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.690
 also that decides that the definitive one 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.790
 can interrupt with any is all 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.870
 what this has is your contender 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.700
 let's do the series do not mess 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.840
 He is also a very weak character 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.599
 beginning 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.330
 and also if the enemy team is a 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.250
 little bit more or less sharp you go to 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.230
 be the focus automatically for you 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.640
 you can not do much damage so you 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.410
 I recommend that you enter 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.090
 half an ink and never the beginning 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.040
 and starting sir when you start 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.390
 you enter when you start your tank and I'm 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.490
 sure you can treat yourself 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.860
 now we talk about civil with six civil 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.660
 It is a very good channel 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.069
 quite powerful plus you can 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 block all the skills that they give 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.459
 target her 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.020
 can form very easily has a 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.569
 cv skill that you cv that gives you 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.400
 very much range also has a 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.540
 definitive very good to enter together 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.760
 with his partners 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.319
 how easy to recover mana at work 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.909
 if he plays pretty well even if I go to 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.189
 hide a kylie because the traps are 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:39.549
 manna sources let's say it like that of 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:42.010
 against in the daily king is a bit weak 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.870
 you have to take into account a lot of 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.990
 ancient enemies of the jungle both 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.520
 like the one in the lane 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.590
 plus it's a little slope to 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.930
 principle if you do not have a good if you 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.290
 you're going to wait too much and it's also a 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.090
 character that 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.579
 does not have escape skills except 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.170
 the shield nothing more for that still sometimes 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.490
 it gets a little weak when you fight 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.110
 against the uv because it has enough 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.140
 I also want to say since he does 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.910
 missing a little practice with the shield 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.400
 now we talk at length about him is 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.780
 one of the very good characters not very 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.250
 hard in the lake game 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.350
 I also want to tell you that it's good 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.970
 both in the jungle and in the single top 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.400
 in the accounting school of 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 slow down makes the enemy not 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.170
 can escape besides that only everything 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.630
 they have enough stamina not their passive is 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.210
 good because of the critical impact 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.490
 what you get if the fury is at maximum and 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.680
 besides its definitive makes the ink and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 the character difficult to kill already 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.680
 that heals 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.620
 this usually does two things if you have a 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.450
 definitive list to be used or not 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.390
 you are the enemy's focus and that makes 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.890
 You can kill like a pig or you usually 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.810
 be you the focus of the objective and its team 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.370
 can kill while you are with your 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.900
 definitively stuck inside and starting the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.300
 mouth 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.009
 the bad thing about this character is very 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.419
 dependent on the objects is usually done 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.820
 strong in helette that is not our 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.820
 power is in the eln and in the mid and 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.980
 it's easy too 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.440
 it's very easy to use it with skills that 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.630
 have many cc the latin file as i have 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.930
 repeated earlier if yes you go very 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.670
 Well you are going to focus on you 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.980
 now after killing as they know how to kill is 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.760
 a very good champion in the middle besides 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.370
 that can cost very well to consolidate 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.430
 and has a skill that can 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.630
 Silence many enemies at once 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.030
 it also has a definite one that you can 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.470
 nail an enemy on the site and give it 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.090
 opportunity to your colleagues like you 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.850
 eat it whole if you have your 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.680
 complete combination becomes 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.990
 indestructible even though the enemy is 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.580
 pull you would also do that in 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.070
 against which is a very weak character to 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.310
 bruce dependent principle but more 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.990
 well with the is does not have mechanisms of 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.420
 escape and you have to learn a little bit to 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.810
 handle yourself then exhibition 'art and 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.030
 you also have to learn the only thing 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.510
 which is to know the combo of the multi that 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.030
 would be w on the floor and useful 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.860
 now we talk about maracay as you know it is 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.810
 a character that stays well in the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.970
 Jungle theme for their passive that 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:08.880
 it helps a lot to your experience is also 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.440
 a very good character initiating has 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.430
 good skills of eleven so many 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.920
 they are two the w and the cv and they have facility 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.990
 say that or from level 4 on the 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.270
 against is that they do not do much harm if not 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.520
 has surnames mounted so do not work 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.870
 that hurting your ultimate is for 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.770
 reduce you have to know how to use it a 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.930
 little if they do not move quite scarce 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.470
 if you take the game and so you see that 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.450
 you are a tank 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.940
 keep in mind that you have to throw yourself 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.430
 how to put up with enemies but you do not go 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.770
 to produce hardly harm now we talk about 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:44.650
 fish as you know and they have a lot of damage 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.360
 you narrate his chut and it's devastating 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.479
 again he is a champion of good 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:54.550
 he has a good escape with his little bombs 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:56.290
 It has much damage slows playing 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.390
 in the style of far it burns me you will win 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.800
 very fast the equipment if you go 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.050
 to be wearing we have with the pumps 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.690
 and I mean from their 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.890
 soil pumps the good come on and on 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.960
 mine not because I have many bombs and 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.150
 here from only the good has to be 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.160
 guarantee if you have a low position 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.070
 AndrÃ©, you end up bursting the 

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.990
 enemy was cons that his definitive is 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.550
 very slow launches de- energized pump 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.050
 side to side and until you do not have to 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.169
 coming and until there comes as no 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.270
 hurt not 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:27.180
 It takes a little bit of time to learn sw 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.189
 character a little bit soft all his 

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.259
 success lent itself more easily if used 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:33.240
 a little bit more, not in the sense that
