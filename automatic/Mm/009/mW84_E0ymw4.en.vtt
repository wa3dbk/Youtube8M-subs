00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:18.650
 how to learn I do not know it's 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.650
 like that I did for my love 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.910
 are you living a 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.480
 dream 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.470
 currently at nightmare rick the water I 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.380
 will tell you who you are living a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.360
 little of both 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.070
 I have always hoped for this confrontation 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 the wii 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.750
 I always hoped that but at the same 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.250
 time today I saw it then it's 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.640
 like a nightmare because sean of mag 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 Seriously I still go myself 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000
 I listen to their eyes alone at home 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 I feel like I have other than me 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.699
 my son i'm alone in montreal at 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.699
 take for angels 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.640
 I'm a fan of my brother and I see 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.110
 always take for the team to my 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.030
 brother I have long since for 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 canucks then the stan and I take for 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.409
 the rangers off dow and austria 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 really really in total admiration 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.070
 of what makes my brother then that's for sure 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.229
 that I take it for him though if 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.229
 Canadian coach day I take more than 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.330
 go during season 2 to kiss and his 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.710
 coaches life coach he's really his 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.630
 childhood I never saw it like game 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.390
 as they said my brother is a scholar 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 from harki beam from 6 am in the morning to 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.130
 midnight evening for eight months eight months 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 of the year that's what makes me and me 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 when I see it summer in a bar b qu 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 we go zlotys there is with family 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.700
 we make love 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.600
 then we do not necessarily speak 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.579
 arched but during the season I 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.250
 mean and his focus is right there you 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.340
 do that quia my brother coach loot my 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.590
 brother is something special 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 for your brother to coach bypassing 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.719
 a team still pretty rough I 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.860
 think so but I was going to say that 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.110
 boston his way 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.819
 it would have been so intense because 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.959
 still lost a seventh match the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.239
 stanley cup against boston 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.680
 when i was in vancouver would be a 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.050
 nice revenge with boston 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.000
 but I think the little one goes on as 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.640
 it's also said to be a hockey town 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.680
 fake it is sure that we find ourselves in 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 series with the Canadian you energy 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.189
 EEAS 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.890
 this index in this lot agrees with 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:36.540
 me everyone is talking about art that n 6 and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.540
 6.5 big deal 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:48.000
 I brought family photos 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:55.430
 bank and found objects already looks 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.480
 proudly carried the mustache eacute to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.710
 abel listen we do not see him very well 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.560
 but there was a little phase when 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.720
 even eric besson 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.570
 do you know internship i see calais do not 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.630
 not doing very well on that one is 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.390
 all agree okay and sweets and 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.670
 we look very much like that 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.010
 for example excuse me lol it's me the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.450
 pqube it was mostly peace 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.430
 that's what I said I found someone 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.470
 for example the time of his cut 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.620
 longing separate a little bit in the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.709
 middle 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.810
 we find a qte it was the 70s 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.739
 it's my big brother and joy war who I 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:39.190
 find is good I found beautiful I dare 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.110
 hope that if ever the Canadian gets 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.989
 does eliminate that people take for 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.069
 the rangers after and not for chicago where 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.810
 she's here we'll stay in the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.129
 training the ess the fight of 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.200
 the association of the east that we will take 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.610
 my brother I would be really happy 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.610
