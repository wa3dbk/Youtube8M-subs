nice enough main features it's that zero

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
nice enough main features it's that zero
differential<00:01:13.260> between<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.740> heel<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.070> the

that really strikes you when you're

that really strikes you when you're
running<00:02:29.950> them<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:31.060> similar<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.720> running<00:02:32.290> two

can<00:02:39.310> run<00:02:39.460> them<00:02:39.550> at<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.790> lower<00:02:40.030> pressure<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
can run them at much lower pressure so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.150 
can run them at much lower pressure so
they<00:02:40.840> deform<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.530> trail<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:41.830> give<00:02:42.070> you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
concern about them when I initially got

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.750 
concern about them when I initially got
them<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.780> how<00:03:07.930> they<00:03:08.080> were<00:03:08.200> going<00:03:08.350> to<00:03:08.410> wear

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
them was how they were going to wear

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.220 
them was how they were going to wear
there<00:03:09.760> are<00:03:09.850> minimal<00:03:10.209> shoe<00:03:10.480> they're<00:03:10.900> stripped

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
there are minimal shoe they're stripped

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.150 
there are minimal shoe they're stripped
down<00:03:11.290> they're<00:03:11.650> lightweight

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
down they're lightweight

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.430 
down they're lightweight
they've<00:03:12.730> got<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> sticky<00:03:13.440> performance

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
they've got the sticky performance

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.860 
they've got the sticky performance
compound<00:03:14.950> on<00:03:15.160> them<00:03:15.370> which<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:16.420> downside<00:03:16.840> of

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
compound on them which the downside of

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.590 
compound on them which the downside of
that<00:03:17.050> is<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.500> can<00:03:17.530> wear<00:03:17.890> away<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:19.270> let's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
that is that it can wear away so let's

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.449 
that is that it can wear away so let's
look<00:03:19.720> at<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:19.900> shoe<00:03:20.080> that's<00:03:20.430> put<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.520> miles<00:03:21.730> in<00:03:21.940> I

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
look at a shoe that's put the miles in I

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.510 
look at a shoe that's put the miles in I
think<00:03:24.459> sort<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> five<00:03:25.330> six<00:03:25.570> hundred<00:03:25.840> miles<00:03:26.020> in

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
think sort of five six hundred miles in

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.580 
think sort of five six hundred miles in
it's<00:03:27.520> doing<00:03:28.120> pretty<00:03:28.150> well<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.820> tread<00:03:31.590> there's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
it's doing pretty well the tread there's

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.800 
it's doing pretty well the tread there's
a<00:03:32.680> bit<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.890> wear<00:03:33.160> but<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.550> still<00:03:33.820> absolutely

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
a bit of wear but it's still absolutely

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.260 
a bit of wear but it's still absolutely
functional<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:36.580> wear<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.970> where<00:03:37.120> you'd

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
functional the wear is where you'd

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.930 
functional the wear is where you'd
expect<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.780> to<00:03:37.810> be<00:03:37.930> it's<00:03:38.700> internally<00:03:39.700> on<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
expect it to be it's internally on the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.979 
expect it to be it's internally on the
front<00:03:40.209> because<00:03:40.480> obviously<00:03:40.630> when<00:03:40.900> you're

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
front because obviously when you're

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.500 
front because obviously when you're
climbing<00:03:41.580> you're<00:03:42.580> up<00:03:42.640> on<00:03:42.790> your<00:03:42.910> toes<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
climbing you're up on your toes and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.900 
climbing you're up on your toes and
that's<00:03:43.870> what<00:03:43.989> you're<00:03:44.110> doing<00:03:44.459> but<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.580> rest<00:03:45.790> of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
that's what you're doing but the rest of

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.440 
that's what you're doing but the rest of
the<00:03:46.000> way

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the way

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.930
