machine that is sitting behind me that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.579 
machine that is sitting behind me that
is<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.550> making<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> video<00:00:45.870> possible

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
is actually making this video possible

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.680 
is actually making this video possible
because<00:00:46.830> this<00:00:47.430> video<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.940> being<00:00:48.449> currently

because this video is being currently

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.640 
because this video is being currently
rendered<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.830> that<00:00:50.010> workstation<00:00:50.460> PC<00:00:51.409> but<00:00:52.409> we

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
rendered on that workstation PC but we

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.770 
rendered on that workstation PC but we
as<00:00:52.830> editors<00:00:53.309> required<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.239> hold<00:00:54.540> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
as editors required to hold that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.170 
as editors required to hold that
rendering<00:00:55.290> power<00:00:55.589> not<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
rendering power not only just in the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
rendering power not only just in the
offices<00:00:57.839> where<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.470> workstation<00:00:58.830> PC<00:00:59.549> comes

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
offices where that workstation PC comes

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.079 
offices where that workstation PC comes
in<00:00:59.970> handy<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.809> also<00:01:01.320> when<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.710> travel<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
in handy but also when we travel to

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.200 
in handy but also when we travel to
events<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.449> Computex<00:01:04.170> CES<00:01:04.710> III<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> GDC

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
events like Computex CES III and GDC

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
events like Computex CES III and GDC
where<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.720> require<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.530> render<00:01:07.860> things

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
where we require to render things

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.390 
where we require to render things
on-site<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.180> bringing<00:01:10.020> external<00:01:10.830> computers

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
on-site and bringing external computers

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.190 
on-site and bringing external computers
and<00:01:11.700> monitors<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
and monitors are just not the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370 
and monitors are just not the
possibility<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.909> rely<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.689> machines<00:01:15.930> like

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
possibility so we rely on machines like

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.310 
possibility so we rely on machines like
these<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> job<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.210> us<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
these to do the job for us and so in

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.050 
these to do the job for us and so in
today's<00:01:19.560> video<00:01:19.740> we'll<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.220> upgrading<00:01:20.460> the

upgrading this machine with something

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:52.730 
upgrading this machine with something
else<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.719> for<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:51.960> upgrade<00:01:52.200> we'll<00:01:52.619> be

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the 4k footage that we get and I will

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.750 
the 4k footage that we get and I will
need<00:02:21.600> fast<00:02:21.959> drives<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.650> speed<00:02:22.980> up<00:02:23.130> my<00:02:23.370> workflow

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
need fast drives to speed up my workflow

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.270 
need fast drives to speed up my workflow
especially<00:02:24.510> when<00:02:24.990> working<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.500> Premiere

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

especially when working with Premiere
after<00:02:26.700> facts<00:02:27.120> for<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> memory<00:02:28.260> upgrade<00:02:28.740> I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
after facts for the memory upgrade I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.880 
after facts for the memory upgrade I
have<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> 16<00:02:29.760> gigabyte<00:02:30.000> vengeance<00:02:30.900> kit<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.650> they

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
have a 16 gigabyte vengeance kit so they

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.530 
have a 16 gigabyte vengeance kit so they
are<00:02:31.950> 8<00:02:32.250> gigabyte<00:02:32.760> modules<00:02:33.360> at<00:02:33.709> 1866<00:02:34.709> megahertz

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
are 8 gigabyte modules at 1866 megahertz

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.480 
are 8 gigabyte modules at 1866 megahertz
speed<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:36.959> really<00:02:37.290> doesn't<00:02:37.680> matter<00:02:37.890> for<00:02:38.310> me

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
speed here really doesn't matter for me

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.390 
speed here really doesn't matter for me
but<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.030> matters<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.690> low<00:02:40.080> voltage<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.890> each

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
but what matters is low voltage of each

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.780 
but what matters is low voltage of each
module<00:02:41.760> at<00:02:42.360> one<00:02:42.720> point<00:02:42.930> 3<00:02:43.260> 5<00:02:43.560> volts<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
module at one point 3 5 volts and so the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.550 
module at one point 3 5 volts and so the
next<00:02:45.000> thing<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:45.330> need<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.959> open<00:02:46.380> this

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
next thing we need to do is open this

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.160 
next thing we need to do is open this
baby<00:02:46.830> up<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.340> populate<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.390> with<00:02:48.600> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
baby up and populate it with this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:03:57.390 
baby up and populate it with this
hardware

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.390 

and<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.810> now<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.140> everything<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:00.709> in<00:04:00.800> place<00:04:00.920> I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
and so now that everything is in place I

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.890 
and so now that everything is in place I
really<00:04:01.730> hope<00:04:01.880> you<00:04:02.000> enjoyed<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.360> footage<00:04:02.690> and

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
really hope you enjoyed the footage and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.630 
really hope you enjoyed the footage and
the<00:04:03.050> sort<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.620> quick<00:04:03.890> upgrade<00:04:04.370> process

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
the sort of the quick upgrade process

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.180 
the sort of the quick upgrade process
but<00:04:05.540> after<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.140> put<00:04:06.350> everything<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.800> together<00:04:06.950> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
but after I put everything in together I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.030 
but after I put everything in together I
want<00:04:07.610> to<00:04:07.730> do<00:04:08.030> another<00:04:08.660> battery<00:04:09.170> test<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.800> see

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
want to do another battery test to see

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.490 
want to do another battery test to see
if<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.430> lower<00:04:11.390> power<00:04:11.690> consumption<00:04:12.200> of<00:04:12.319> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
if the lower power consumption of the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.610 
if the lower power consumption of the
SSDs<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.040> maybe<00:04:13.819> potentially<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
SSDs and maybe potentially the the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.440 
SSDs and maybe potentially the the
addition<00:04:16.040> of<00:04:16.190> an<00:04:16.400> extra<00:04:16.730> eight<00:04:16.910> gigabyte

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
addition of an extra eight gigabyte

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.770 
addition of an extra eight gigabyte
would<00:04:17.720> contribute<00:04:18.019> to<00:04:18.200> better<00:04:18.620> battery<00:04:19.459> life

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
would contribute to better battery life

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.340 
would contribute to better battery life
and<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:21.380> am<00:04:21.470> NOT<00:04:21.700> super<00:04:22.700> happy<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.300> report<00:04:23.690> there

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
and I am NOT super happy to report there

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.040 
and I am NOT super happy to report there
is<00:04:24.680> a<00:04:24.740> battery<00:04:25.220> loss<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:26.090> still<00:04:26.360> get<00:04:26.480> over<00:04:26.780> three

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
is a battery loss I still get over three

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.710 
is a battery loss I still get over three
hours<00:04:27.080> an<00:04:27.560> hour<00:04:27.710> browser<00:04:28.010> usage<00:04:28.550> scenario<00:04:29.120> but

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
hours an hour browser usage scenario but

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.710 
hours an hour browser usage scenario but
I<00:04:29.900> lost<00:04:30.140> about<00:04:30.380> maybe<00:04:30.680> 10<00:04:31.010> minutes<00:04:31.419> versus<00:04:32.419> my

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
I lost about maybe 10 minutes versus my

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.300 
I lost about maybe 10 minutes versus my
previous<00:04:33.260> battery<00:04:33.620> test<00:04:33.830> that<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.040> did

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
previous battery test that I did

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.060 
previous battery test that I did
initially<00:04:35.150> when<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.360> received<00:04:35.870> a<00:04:35.990> notebook<00:04:36.230> but

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
initially when I received a notebook but

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.980 
initially when I received a notebook but
aside<00:04:37.310> from<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.580> everything<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.360> now<00:04:38.480> super

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
aside from that everything is now super

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.560 
aside from that everything is now super
snappy<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:39.530> mean<00:04:39.770> one<00:04:40.310> terabyte<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.850> SSD

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
snappy I mean one terabyte of SSD

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.690 
snappy I mean one terabyte of SSD
storage<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.230> I<00:04:42.260> can<00:04:42.530> continue<00:04:42.919> with<00:04:43.520> my

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
storage so I can continue with my

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.820 
storage so I can continue with my
expected<00:04:44.510> workflow<00:04:45.050> when<00:04:45.260> they're<00:04:45.500> working
