00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 I want to show you how to properly 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.040
 harvest the bracken fern 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.250
 it grows on the edges of birch forests 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.820
 can grow on the outskirts of taiga 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:21.060
 fern begins after the snow 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.859
 in the second half of may , such are 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.880
 sprouts 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:31.460
 crocheted sprouts here they are close 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:38.149
 show harvested by hand 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:42.840
 manually tear under the base 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:45.739
 spine manually pull tax until he 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.520
 it does not come off that is, it can not be cut 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 only manually on on cut it 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:59.100
 is such a heart 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.410
 visible and over the course should not be hairs 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.689
 and here it is after ripening if 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:10.159
 hairs mean excess length was torn off 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.159
 breaks under the base and 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.250
 only those stems that are not taken are taken 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.040
 the arrow is already 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.190
 that is, after disclosure, it turns out three 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.430
 leaflet here it is already considered 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:32.060
 overgrown fern I'll show now 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.540
 you what overgrown happens but it 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.540
 about 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:51.220
 this one has almost opened its triple 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:53.920
 the arrow is now 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.140
 overgrown almost overgrown but although 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:03.510
 you can still take it under him 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:08.590
 the base if you take it will break off then 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.180
 you need to scald him for six hours 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.510
 in boiling water 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:18.790
 that is, the taiga is making a fire somewhere and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.110
 boiling water drops there just 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:28.090
 dip it to bright green after 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.110
 This fern needs to be decomposed into 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.520
 dry dark surface 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.780
 this roofs roofs can be houses garages 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:46.060
 where it dries within 3 days after that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:49.740
 it dries up so and so on than you 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.720
 committed loses in its weight approximately 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.630
 90 percent moisture i.e. 10 kilograms 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 one kilogram of dry is obtained 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.190
 fern is a drying technology 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.739
 korean after it dries it 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.770
 coils and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.310
 Packed in sealed bags where it can 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.910
 stored up to 5 years 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.910
 Thanks for attention
