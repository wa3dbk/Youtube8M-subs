some breadcrumbs

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.950 
some breadcrumbs
and<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.610> tone<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.360> stickiness

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and this will tone down the stickiness

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
and this will tone down the stickiness
if<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.560> makes<00:01:31.829> sense<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.490> always<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> fry

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
side and by each side I met the sides -

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.160 
side and by each side I met the sides -
you<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> oil<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.240> hit<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> breadcrumbs

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
so they don't look dry in the end and

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.690 
so they don't look dry in the end and
chicken<00:01:46.079> breast<00:01:46.350> cooks<00:01:46.649> fairly<00:01:47.100> quickly<00:01:47.340> so
