 truth is that I scare the price of

 this graphic card I think it's going 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.450
 be very expensive but it's worth buying 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.020

 as he says he also has a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.660
 liquid cooling means that 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.819
 this does not overheat ok obviously 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 everyone to be able to play for hours and hours and
