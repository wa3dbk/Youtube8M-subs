00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.590
 since the action comes the school blog for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.509
 later with high school for the online 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.240
 playstation 3 again today against the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.870
 Good wore the chat can as places 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.740
 13 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.199
 he is already shamefully selected that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.779
 relief as a problem 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.269
 I'm curious who is from the winter 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.410
 Last week a very chaotic 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.510
 had a chaotic match with the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 elements chervel match with you all 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 People of the online supermarket like that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.260
 because this is how it works and how this is done 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.559
 with which the lasers we will say 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 accustom 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 3 Do not play so often and used 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.640
 Playstation 3 is a recording station like 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.530
 The last time this is all here and 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.789
 Accordingly, this works with the pc 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 and from the Hessian four not so 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.739
 optimal as we wanted or the server 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.390
 We went through the bill 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.219
 accordingly we have to between three 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.210
 dodge 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.129
 most are on the way 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.380
 Accordingly, I just continue 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.610
 so many nice punch comes and so 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.140
 on the whole I recognize I 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.189
 I like to do some moves then 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 I come directly afterwards 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 with a pretty crib and that would be in this 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.920
 case a video team now after 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.119
 reaction he is already on the block nice 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.549
 sit right after animal first comes up 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 once out what he liked to push 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.909
 on it says what once pinsky 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.070
 or so I am out hope I continue 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:43.170
 us there we some some normally 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 14 o'clock to Finnish did not go through 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 first place action this is probably 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.689
 is unfortunately reasonably acceptable for 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.520
 counter and so running action but as soon as 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.960
 then to something else, how to 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.310
 pins, for example, and so I'm mostly 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.310
 come out so come back up 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.570
 neither came home thank you directly in the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.680
 greppiner how to band magic the problem 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.090
 afterwards with the action on the head 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.910
 is that would be a in this case 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.170
 wonderful way to discover 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.720
 if you say it's just a question of 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:23.960
 time until I have a future again 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:25.870
 okay but nothing we have now hanno 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.400
 balitsch kassenbeck break 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:40.490
 that's how I would go now 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 let 's say it's off with the boulder says 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.740
 go first for me or something 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.310
 museums 12 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.280
 there one comes out ok residenz directly 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.340
 You do not use it that early 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.780
 okay but definitely better 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.330
 maybe always come back for or 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.700
 window on the possibility for one 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:08.780
 nudges to come because they wanted to be 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.810
 but not at all basta rebell goes 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.180
 also not by no 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.100
 as well as his rally action I 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.650
 I'll go out on the ropes now 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.060
 top-springer on him down wonderful 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.700
 unfortunately made into the void 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.400
 Alexia now and then is no problem he came 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.260
 People get hit there 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.820
 if next special action is not 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.140
 then I would go through 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.980
 but also ask me what is here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.370
 So we went wrong 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.930
 again after albert ok 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.860
 Do we have this action? 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.340
 possibility of a small policy next 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.340
 on the head 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.480
 he still has not output target 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.940
 but it's about time I would 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.940
 say or what do you friends mean 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:05.930
 google extra want red wings from behind 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.270
 as soon as yes I remember 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.780
 again davos playstation 3 was with the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:19.380
 minds of our time 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:26.870
 72 or so I hope you go 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:33.870
 Tear the old funny way 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:35.610
 did not know why he could not 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.050
 I do not understand what would you do me 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.090
 the lust search site otherwise once 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.120
 to get up quite a bit 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.280
 not all good 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.940
 then I would say do not want yes 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.540
 you must raise age you only have to 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.040
 content 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.560
 It is not that hard to enjoy 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.419
 celtic road cross becomes the other 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.060
 direction 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.120
 yes, then a bit the middle pulls 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.740
 that would be hopefully the 1 0 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:13.260
 jackson that there is a possibility tomorrow 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.720
 come on now gives you even so 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.610
 Just chance and do so 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.600
 obviously now in the bread kick the 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.560
 Most of the planers get the best results 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.499
 from the mars a bit exciting compson 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:35.759
 there comes tarnished directly 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:40.559
 you can not do that as a 2 3 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:43.490
 That's what 23 coach really was for me 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:45.509
 a bit hurts I'm sorry chances so 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.749
 since you have, I still think a bit 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:50.210
 practice while you're here 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:53.069
 No I will play no one here 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.539
 complained again or again forever 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.099
 until there because that says right now with me 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.469

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.139
 oh well that shit well yes we 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.229
 if you have the tk server too 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.729
 shit or playstation 3 does not matter 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.740
 Nevertheless, we have a nice one now 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:17.339
 We do not agree with that 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:21.240
 Sunday again if we can 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:22.379

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.520
