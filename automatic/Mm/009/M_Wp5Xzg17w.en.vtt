00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.429
 a small program which I already have 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.530
 the previous windows versions say 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.650
 times windows 7 vista xp helped very well 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.120
 has is the cc clinics is up at me 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.980
 ever played on the notebook 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.570
 we see the surface even the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 Incidentally, there is free internet 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.560
 just google it 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 what is the ct kwh that is for 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.720
 Clean up there to clean and a great 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 function is here at china that he 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.380
 stop after yes no longer used 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.300
 files he is looking for garbage so to speak 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 I accumulate in my computer 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.050
 know her just say so analyze 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.059
 then the whole computer will be 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.399
 Search what else is left for rest 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.170
 surfing from the last internet or even 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.879
 files that just kind of pointless 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 they are still on the computer 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.510
 here all displayed since my son 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.200
 actually he is relatively fresh 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.020
 Nevertheless 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.000
 about 300 65 mb found that easy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.309
 no longer needed so gone 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 so once right on just start 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.379
 cc china press and then that will 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.719
 automatically adjusted may like 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.010
 be deleted and thus I can too 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.390
 in the older system or at 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.710
 Windows 8 still a bit fresh 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.510
 bring wind in and above all things 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.670
 also much other part rubbish what 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.920
 actually taken up unnecessarily space 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.509
 just remove it 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 Furthermore, it is a very good feature 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.330
 here in the rider registry to find 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.500
 you have to imagine windows though 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 you install the program, the 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.170
 is sorted there are 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.479
 Links to the system that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.979
 sometimes you find something to remove 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 install something new and what can 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.170
 happen 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.490
 the link is somehow wrong 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.229
 more correctly then you have to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.210
 imagine windows like a big one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 then usually the library will know 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.530
 whichever gear in which row in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.909
 which shelf which book stands and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.110
 if that gets mixed up then 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.430
 you start looking 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.140
 then one wonders that every now and then 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.579
 my program starts slower or 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 Other things can not be found or 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 is just taking me here now 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.549
 this registry cleaner this 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 start a bug then it will all be 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.820
 searches the hot climate fits 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.619
 vote for the whole 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.200
 Links is that all right 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 so and how you see here there is 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 some links that yes simply 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.569
 no longer needed and also here 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.009
 i can just say fix it that way 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.080
 Of course I can do the changes as well 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.880
 before that again 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 save the old entries again if 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 I want to be sure 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.320
 that does not have to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.680
 no all please fix here it was 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.480
 now 75 pieces already done they will be 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.980
 note that everything accelerates again 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.500
 a bit and so much 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.110
 tidy and finally there is 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.240
 stop at the subject extras the 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 opportunity to watch again programs 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.820
 you can uninstall at 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.460
 autostadt to see what programs 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.440
 and which services here automatically 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.580
 to be started when the device is in 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 operation is taken 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.340
 sometimes you need to think about it 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.110
 I'm the program at all 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.560
 background already has to be active 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.940
 his 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.920
 so you can then just again 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.240
 save resources and the whole system 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.040
 accelerate a bit more 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.840
 in windows 8 I can already 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.100
 say that is faster and more stable than 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.459
 all the other version I have before 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.650
 would have 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.060
 but I know from windows 7 and the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.209
 older versions of this program 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.800
 simply helps clean up links 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.450
 of course to clarify that it is all 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.100
 runs faster and of course too 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.540
 Look, this has really only the 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.860
 real things are also active 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.720
 You can use the cc kids on the internet 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.410
 download free sample it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.410
 just out
