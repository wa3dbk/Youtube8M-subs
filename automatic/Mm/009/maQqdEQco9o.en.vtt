00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
this little loop this is what you

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.939 
this little loop this is what you
attachment<00:00:16.520> bodies<00:00:16.850> were<00:00:17.089> useful<00:00:17.589> if<00:00:18.589> I<00:00:18.740> like

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949

if<00:00:19.310> I<00:00:19.460> choose<00:00:19.699> to<00:00:19.849> do<00:00:19.999> so<00:00:20.029> to<00:00:20.839> get<00:00:21.019> the<00:00:21.199> big<00:00:21.410> like

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
if I choose to do so to get the big like

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.479 
if I choose to do so to get the big like
that<00:00:22.550> again<00:00:23.060> extends<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.079> aversive<00:00:25.089> now<00:00:27.489> we

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:28.489 
that again extends the aversive now we

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.910 
that again extends the aversive now we
look<00:00:28.669> at

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750 

they<00:00:33.270> won't<00:00:34.270> pull<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.690> the<00:00:34.810> side<00:00:35.430> now<00:00:36.430> I'll<00:00:36.580> get

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
they won't pull on the side now I'll get

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.850 
they won't pull on the side now I'll get
this<00:00:36.940> out<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:37.570> way<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:38.280> i'll<00:00:39.280> show<00:00:39.340> you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
this out of the way and i'll show you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.470 
this out of the way and i'll show you
another<00:00:41.860> way<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.100> putting<00:00:42.220> it<00:00:42.550> up

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.440 

and<00:00:50.110> that's<00:00:50.290> quite<00:00:50.590> comfortable<00:00:51.430> but<00:00:51.670> because

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
and that's quite comfortable but because

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.620 
and that's quite comfortable but because
it<00:00:52.690> isn't<00:00:52.989> that<00:00:53.110> stable<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.730> I<00:00:55.090> can<00:00:55.450> actually

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
it isn't that stable so I can actually

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.020 
it isn't that stable so I can actually
add<00:00:57.059> another<00:00:58.059> poor

enough you can see number then inside
the<00:01:48.319> diversity<00:01:49.319> there<00:01:49.470> would<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.679> dry<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.459> I

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
the diversity there would be dry if I

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.499 
the diversity there would be dry if I
close<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.659> big<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.729> our<00:01:54.030> plane<00:01:54.360> your
