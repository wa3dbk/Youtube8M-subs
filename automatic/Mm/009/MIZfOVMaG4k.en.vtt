00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello I'm simone pepper and today 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.880
 for peter tv in hockenheim on the way 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.559
 do not be the same with marcus walz 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.780
 Meet every custom bike scene 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.890
 he knows comes to these names 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.600
 actually not over is one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.000
 real office in the scene has that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.920
 so-called recs frame invented what that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.840
 is that if you still know today and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.590
 we will know that markus knows one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.590
 real friend is 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.750
 to meet 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:51.890
 I already say hardcore cycles above 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 real history is for example 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.750
 that soon that brad pitt for three months 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.329
 had I borrowed him as 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.120
 he or his wife in the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.119
 Czech prague turned that was back then 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.759
 my own motorcycle her and 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.610
 shining in the short term 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.929
 Imagine if that is 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.970
 talk about one or the other as well 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:16.030
 on the future 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 meanwhile the analogy for example 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.789
 james hetfield of metallica 50 cents and 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.410
 Maintain the whole race driver mainly 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.940
 which are actually my favorites 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.659
 especially in Iran, we were really 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.659
 there is really great 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.950
 here are so to speak now in the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 workshop and that is already so far 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.840
 as it is in the raw state sixth 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.660
 here can at least explain exactly 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.490
 So what's different is sitting position 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.620
 realized that I sat on it is a whole 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.110
 is another song on the frame that was exactly 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.380
 actually the primary feature and im 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.180
 same frame of sitting position too 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.270
 another primary feature is 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.190
 altogether the wheelbase of that of the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.119
 motorcycles days much longer 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.200
 looks like if you can 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.400
 look almost finished machine here 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 really the complete difference 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.430
 his hd so there is nothing with glamor 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 and kangaroo but a very exactly 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.940
 that is mainly the whole 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.330
 Grohmann components are usually on it 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.430
 are 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.710
 so will the footpegs or here the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.570
 forget all black plastic 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.370
 coated what are you doing now ? 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.520
 Customer comes and says I really want to 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.890
 totally cool does not set colleague 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.050
 definitely on so generally croc 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.000
 ostrich leather and leather weeks what 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.870
 the whole thing is quite popular at the end 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.090
 all scene 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.160
 I definitely reject that from myself 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 we have a special one here 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.360
 alcantara leather alcantara travel 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.610
 Synthetic leather is especially used in racing 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.160
 use the whole race seats and 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.220
 All our seats are made of leather 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.320
 made here the eyes quite expensive 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.830
 rest but as I said is an artificial leather 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.910
 and that's the way we are 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.950
 to relate the seats 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:14.400
 there can come who wants to do it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:16.080
 only this year so many 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.460
 famous dirty work 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.460
 Of course, a few now 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.330
 there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.900
 now markus have become 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.489
 businessman is experiencing us all the time 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.140
 pretty much in a private setting with you too 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.970
 Home and I already have a big one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.250
 animal lover announced markus has some 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.220
 Seen there were you with dog 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.239
 your side yesterday this is my tip 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:09.750
 Tonga was 15 years old at the time 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.569
 set in february he died 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.109
 pitbull pitbull male and weighs 15 years 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:18.180
 that was by my side, I say 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.900
 times and that's less me myself 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.590
 no children 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.000
 it was like a kid in that for me 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.889
 something was missing or if we were somewhere 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 If I realize then it's fine then 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.419
 I immediately looked what is or what 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.960
 I have to make then it comes to me 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.030
 not every animal whether it is a dog or 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.600
 or a cat or something 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.820
 Feel like a human can then 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.250
 feeling pain can be sad 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.169
 be funny and people can 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.300
 if it matters, that will help 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.870
 Of course, animals can not do that if I do 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.430
 then on television the insane 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.410
 Reports from these 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.539
 transporting animals or these 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.360
 this one of these battle process and what 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:04.000
 do not know what are all things really 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.330
 the manager starts me back 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.380
 Summary has prompted no 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.270
 meat more 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.010
 So I think it's great the show 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.310
 to really pursue it consistently like you 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.200
 do that how does that happen in the scene 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.850
 there are very different 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.150
 but reactions are for the most part 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.000
 we of course negative because specifically in 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.490
 you have to go to the so-called bio sector 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.790
 Of course, that's the cliché of the hat 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.190
 man asked and if there is someone 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.980
 turns up visually the budget 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.310
 But in reality it even corresponds 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.430
 Not 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.750
 for example, this cliché lives 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:45.950
 I'm on a show after-party now 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.190
 at special events on his 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.610
 show 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.650
 there are for the most part the largest 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.590
 Part always gives some ochs am 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.050
 spit or or suckling pig and so on 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.730
 it's not enough for me to just sit there 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.950
 would not eat anything from it then 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.290
 I actually do not want to be there 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.840
 here at this celebration then and then am 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.420
 I'm the first one who turns around 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.730
 and what can I do? 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.800
 We had first line as a thing 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.570
 others think about me because nobody will 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.570
 forced to eat any meat 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:20.240
 or leather jackets or five 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.650
 all the little pigs to eat and 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.450
 anyone can actually be carried 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.520
 very easily contribute to the behavior 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.900
 sorry for animals and pain 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.340
 I would not have thought it more beautiful 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.320
 It is a thank you 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.000
 markus thank you very much for making a small one 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.350
 I have granted insight into his life 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.060
 I'm curious what to continue 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.130
 Of course, many want to be heard 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.750
 succeed and of course have 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.820
 thank you very much the duo peter 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.820
 feel supported then any time
