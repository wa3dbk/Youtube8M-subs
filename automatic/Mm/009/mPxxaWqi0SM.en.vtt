a new layer and start building up our

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
a new layer and start building up our
backdrop<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> give<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
backdrop this one is going to give the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.439 
backdrop this one is going to give the
illusion<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> net'<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> bend<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.420> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 

we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.729> sure<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.330> our

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
what is it our fourth option which is a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
what is it our fourth option which is a
reflected<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> hold<00:01:26.100> down<00:01:26.280> shift

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
reflected we're going to hold down shift

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.450 
reflected we're going to hold down shift
and<00:01:27.210> we're<00:01:27.690> going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.140> draw<00:01:28.500> ourselves<00:01:28.920> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
and we're going to draw ourselves a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
and we're going to draw ourselves a
gradient<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.600> move<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.020> by

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
gradient now you can move this by

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.820 
gradient now you can move this by
hitting<00:01:31.470> your<00:01:31.650> move<00:01:31.860> tool<00:01:32.330> until<00:01:33.330> you're

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
hitting your move tool until you're

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.010 
hitting your move tool until you're
happy<00:01:34.830> with<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.159> about<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:35.790> good<00:01:36.240> make

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
happy with it about there's good make

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.440 
happy with it about there's good make
another<00:01:37.350> new<00:01:37.619> layer<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.220> we're<00:01:38.970> going<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> add

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
another new layer and we're going to add

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.320 
another new layer and we're going to add
a<00:01:39.479> highlight<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:41.340> highlight<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.030> going

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
a highlight now this highlight is going

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.870 
a highlight now this highlight is going
to<00:01:42.570> give<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.229> illusion<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.280> background

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to give the illusion of the background

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
to give the illusion of the background
light<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.600> again<00:01:46.470> we're<00:01:46.680> gonna<00:01:46.770> do

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
light and again we're gonna do

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.499 
light and again we're gonna do
foreground<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> transparent<00:01:47.970> with<00:01:48.479> our

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
foreground to transparent with our

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
foreground to transparent with our
gradient<00:01:48.869> tool<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.710> time<00:01:49.950> we're<00:01:50.070> gonna<00:01:50.130> hit

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
gradient tool this time we're gonna hit

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.330 
gradient tool this time we're gonna hit
white<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:52.320> may<00:01:52.470> be<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.619> little<00:01:52.770> blinding

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
white and it may be a little blinding

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
white and it may be a little blinding
but<00:01:53.580> that's<00:01:53.789> okay<00:01:54.440> we're<00:01:55.440> gonna<00:01:55.530> start<00:01:56.869> using

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
but that's okay we're gonna start using

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.410 
but that's okay we're gonna start using
your<00:01:58.080> circular<00:01:58.619> gradient<00:01:59.100> tool<00:01:59.330> start<00:02:00.330> from

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
your circular gradient tool start from

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
your circular gradient tool start from
her<00:02:00.630> waist<00:02:00.840> holding<00:02:01.590> down<00:02:01.710> shift<00:02:02.159> we're<00:02:02.550> going

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
her waist holding down shift we're going

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.510

so on to the next step which would be
making<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.450> new<00:03:38.569> layer<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.219> this<00:03:40.219> is<00:03:40.400> going<00:03:40.670> to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
making a new layer and this is going to

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.459 
making a new layer and this is going to
be<00:03:40.909> our<00:03:41.060> highlight<00:03:41.540> layer<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.049> this<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.290> gonna

be our highlight layer and this is gonna

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:43.899 
be our highlight layer and this is gonna
add<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> little<00:03:42.739> more<00:03:42.950> punch<00:03:43.280> to<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.640> right

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909

behind her as if we had another stroke
well<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:47.900> use<00:03:48.049> our<00:03:48.170> brush<00:03:48.409> this<00:03:48.680> time<00:03:48.709> and
