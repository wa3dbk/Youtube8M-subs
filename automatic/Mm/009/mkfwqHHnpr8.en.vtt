00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 Everyone is around the world that are not far from Eisai 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:28.330
 The appearance of the earth after 35 years of radical report of a major US bank is called off 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.390
 Natural disasters intensifying 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:39.640
 Fury of a typhoon in the past few years, the fiercely can not neglect the coming season is particularly vigilant 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:46.200
 Needless to say, the rage of nature will continue to grow in the future 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 A shocking report was released from the UK Lloyds Bank group think tank the other day 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.710
 Crop production threatens due to global climate change 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 This report, titled Food System Shock Food Distribution Equipment, is a Global Climate Today 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.120
 Change 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:09.659
 It is predicting that it will seriously damage production of languages and by this 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.090
 Food shortages cause concerns about the nature of each country and affect business and transportation 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.689
 The 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.700
 It leads the current civilized society to collapse 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:23.770
 Created by Lloyds Bank think tank and Angri- Alaskin University studies 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:28.990
 This report mainly focuses on the outlook for the future world economy 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.080
 It was written to explain to the insurance industry, but from the contents of the shocking 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.290
 System in the world 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.980
 It became something to ring the alarm bell 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:41.630
 The future of the world's population that are both problematic and fulminant of natural disasters on the future of food supply 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:48.560
 Say it is a sharp increase of 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:55.909
 Humanity has increased its population to 6 billion in 200 years of civilization, but the pace of increase is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:02:01.620
 It is expected to rise sharply and reach 9 billion people by 2050 after 35 years and 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:06.290
 By 2050 to meet growing food needs in proportion to population growth 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.649
 Say that food production shipping costs must be doubled 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.090
 Unless innovative crop production technology is born 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:20.150
 Likely say that it is extremely difficult is because to double in 35 years after 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:24.600
 The becomes a major cause of the food crisis, even only a problem of this population increase add insult to injury in this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 Is the decrease in crop yields due to weather fluctuations 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:35.580
 A severe drought hit from 2003 to 2003 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.670
 If an example like Australia occurs in various parts of the world in the future, it will certainly be the talk of food production increase 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:43.569
 There is no 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:45.720
 And as a result of the frequent occurrence of extreme weather conditions, the world is facing more severe water shortages than it is today 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:52.140
 The forecast is also shown 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:56.730
 In some way people corresponding to two-thirds of the world's population in 2025 after 10 years 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:03.770
 It is when you are forced to live under the influence of water shortage 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:09.890
 That is that if you look at the world is more of water is insufficient region become commonplace situation 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:12.660
 And of course water shortages will overshadow crop production 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.930
 Grain prices are rising 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:23.430
 With such a risk of decreasing crop yields 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:25.590
 The growing demand for crops due to population growth under dangerous production conditions is also a natural consequence 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:32.550
 Cause the price to rise 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:38.250
 According to the report, prices of grain are already rising in various places in Argentina last autumn 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.319
 A value of about 4 times the soy and 2000 wheat pigeon be subjected to a poor harvest in Australia before and after 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.379
 When it comes dipped and the US 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.580
 But the fact that five times was also jumped in price 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.580
 And in the future 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.580
 When the rising trend of prices is expected to continue 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:57.700
 news. com au articles are telling 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:04:00.950
 In Japan, wheat etc. were raised in this June , and in part, the price of bread and noodles is also affected. 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:04.830
 But as is I propose to have begun to 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.400
 Food disputes erupt around the world 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.090
 And speaking of that lack of food and water is lead 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:18.390
 Political unrest is the result of rising grain prices 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:21.470
 In some parts of the Middle East and North Africa Latin America where access to food became difficult 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:27.440
 It has become not uncommon riot 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.430
 In Kenya, where the military is mobilizing to protect the food distribution, food Kodakuro also happens everywhere 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.920
 For this reason, the freedom of the people's travel is prohibited 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.120
 In Nairobi, the situation where the simultaneous bombings on buses and museums have not been stopped 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.330
 Is 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:46.880
 Other South Sudan in North Africa 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:51.650
 Terrorist attacks on food in countries such as Nigeria Cameroon 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:56.330
 India accuses India of soaring food prices in West Asia 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.440
 Pakistan Nationalists also bombed a cricket match in India 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.360
 The 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:05.990
 Dr. Jones of Angriaraskin University who led this report writing 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:12.870
 If you do not touch anything like this 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:18.750
 It states that there is no doubt that the situation in North Africa and West India will be our destiny 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:23.100
 In other words, if a lot of humanity continues to live in the current style, it will be in the near future 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.580
 The fight over food breaks out all over the world 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.420
 Sluggishness in international commerce due to political unrest 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.639
 Increased risk of sea and air transportation 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.270
 Furthermore it does not end with this alone 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:38.720
 In the Greek crisis which is a very urgent situation 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:43.490
 Finally If Greece withdraws from the eu 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:49.400
 Riots that were the purpose is Hayashi say that can occur in Athens food deprivation 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:53.720
 I wonder who thought up to now, such as that food writing occurs in the rich should of Europe 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:57.290
 And another similar period is Argentina 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:02.210
 It says that it can happen also in Saudi Arabia Lithuania etc. 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:09.080
 The risk of such riots has led to political instability in the nation and the consequences 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:09.390
 Sluggish international business transactions and also seriously affect ocean and air transportation 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:16.740
 Say 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:19.170
 Reduced import and export of food will increase costs for importers to spend more safely 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:25.860
 Cause the rising spiral of 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:31.710
 It also means that the commercial port, which has been reduced , will be a good target for robbers 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:38.159
 The food crisis brought about by population growth and climate change is a new humanity never experienced 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:41.699
 The meaning of the very devil's scenario leading to the collapse being submitted from a private bank think tank 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:45.880
 Would be great as Dr. Jones points out 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:48.330
 It's almost time for me not to continue the same life until now 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.990
 It may be better to keep in mind 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:56.569
 And how to tackle these problems in the future 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.569
 Exactly the wisdom of humanity is being tested 

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:48.309
 ana 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.630
 Hmm
