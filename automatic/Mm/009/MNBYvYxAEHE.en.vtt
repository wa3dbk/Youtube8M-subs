very hard to do something that every
single<00:01:57.240> day<00:01:57.479> because<00:01:57.750> things<00:01:58.290> tend<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> come

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
single day because things tend to come

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
single day because things tend to come
in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.189> illness<00:01:59.790> or<00:02:00.060> unexpected

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
in the way like illness or unexpected

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.870 
in the way like illness or unexpected
life<00:02:01.200> events<00:02:01.740> which<00:02:02.310> means<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> can't

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
life events which means you can't

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.149 
life events which means you can't
necessarily<00:02:03.000> record<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.140> edit<00:02:04.290> or<00:02:04.649> gets<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
necessarily record and edit or gets the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.039 
necessarily record and edit or gets the
internet<00:02:05.520> or<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.939> life<00:02:06.149> happens<00:02:06.810> and

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
internet or just life happens and

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.080 
internet or just life happens and
sometimes<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.860> impossible<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> video

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
sometimes it's impossible to get a video

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.510 
sometimes it's impossible to get a video
online<00:02:09.330> or<00:02:09.780> even<00:02:10.110> record<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.890> found<00:02:11.280> out

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
online or even record one as I found out

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.090 
online or even record one as I found out
with<00:02:11.790> my

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
with my

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.580 
with my
life<00:02:12.220> it's<00:02:12.550> very<00:02:12.790> unpredictable<00:02:13.440> but<00:02:14.440> at<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
life it's very unpredictable but at the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.740 
life it's very unpredictable but at the
moment<00:02:14.740> I'm<00:02:15.160> slowly<00:02:15.790> getting<00:02:16.150> better<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.540> think

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
moment I'm slowly getting better I think

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.490 
moment I'm slowly getting better I think
so<00:02:17.040> i'm<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.280> try<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:19.780> back<00:02:20.050> into

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
so i'm going to try and get back into

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.890 
so i'm going to try and get back into
the<00:02:21.220> swing<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.610> things<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.480> I<00:02:22.540> figured<00:02:22.810> this

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
the swing of things so I figured this

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.210 
the swing of things so I figured this
would<00:02:22.990> be<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.140> good<00:02:23.230> way<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.410> doing<00:02:23.770> that<00:02:24.010> I'm

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
would be a good way of doing that I'm

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.620 
would be a good way of doing that I'm
going<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> try<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.640> do<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.850> video<00:02:25.030> every<00:02:25.330> single

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
going to try and do a video every single

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.420 
going to try and do a video every single
day<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.050> have<00:02:26.170> any<00:02:26.290> requests<00:02:26.950> leave

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
day so if you have any requests leave

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.310 
day so if you have any requests leave
them<00:02:27.580> down<00:02:27.700> below<00:02:27.760> I've<00:02:28.390> got<00:02:28.630> drawing<00:02:29.020> my<00:02:29.140> life
