00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 well here we are with you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.960
 the final lesson left for us 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.990
 literally a couple of actions and our work with 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.690
 you will be completed and so let's for 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.210
 Begin to return our texture photos 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.929
 as you remember we have prepared for this 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.460
 two layers 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.830
 here we have them let's turn on the first 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.410
 layer and deliver it to the blending mode 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 overlap as you remember this layer 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.489
 We are responsible for small details as you can see 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 that we immediately showed pictures 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.129
 skin texture has become much more noticeable 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.469
 and now move on to the next layer 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.120
 also we include this large parts yes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.680
 and change the blend mode to soft light 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.600
 see that the sharpness of the image of us 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 right away 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.199
 increased if it seems that the effect 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 too strong can be lowered 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.579
 the transparency of this layer is somewhere up to 80 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 or 75 percent so see the difference i 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.330
 right away so well now i wish you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.340
 would be another interesting way to show 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.030
 he will help you to tint your photos and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.790
 give it a beautiful shade 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.659
 let's do it and choose here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.970
 here is a black and white adjustment layer 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.280
 click on the auto us button 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.280
 the contrast is automatically adjusted and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.009
 we transfer it to the very top we change the mode 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.340
 overlay or overlap 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 or on a soft light whichever 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.409
 what effect do you like better 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 let's try for example overlap 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.689
 see what we can do 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.939
 transparency is a condition to lower to 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.610
 the moment we have no effect 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:55.960
 arrange so 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 Well, I think this is the way to go 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 look what happened let's all the layers 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.090
 combine into one large folder 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.290
 press shift and click here and 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.020
 hold down the shift key, click on 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.220
 penultimate conditions to select all 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.070
 layers now press control g and we 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.420
 they are in the same folder as all yah 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.660
 that let's now look at 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.700
 the final result is what we have with 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.730
 you were first with what we started 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.709
 work and that's what happened to us 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.209
 in the end 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.120
 so its that I finally you still 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:35.120
 I wanted to say all photo retouching 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.340
 this whole huge science exists 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.250
 a whole bunch of different ways 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.140
 process the same photo yes and how are you 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.660
 understand that in the framework of this mini course 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.660
 it's almost impossible to disassemble them 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430
 I tried to give you the most simple and 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.100
 really working methods that 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680
 help you right now already handle 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.769
 any photo of you so i hope 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.810
 that this material was useful to you 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.100
 throughout all these lessons with you was 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.700
 Alexey Kuzmichyov 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.700
 I wish you creative success Good luck
