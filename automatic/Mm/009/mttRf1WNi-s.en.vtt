00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.760
 I come from youtube this time it's 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.740
 some tutorial of a pasta formula 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.469
 of salt that is going to help you 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.140
 figurines are more durable more 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.269
 durable but not eternal 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.019
 this is because the salt paste is 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.390
 about moisture as it contains jumped 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:31.079
 when it is in rainy weather or in 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 Cold times are made as soft 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 and they start to break like that 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.570
 they explode then good me with these 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.570
 I made them with this figurines 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.710
 formula have passed the times of good 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.750
 We are in full seasons of cold and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 This good one had also been preserved 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.579
 I'm going to give some tips to be able to keep 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.920
 the more still the figurines and the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.190
 had presented over there in my first 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.190
 video 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.789
 and all these figures are with that 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.789
 formula 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.230
 sad girl k 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.090
 I decided to do the tutorial in two parts 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.790
 because if it's not going to be very long in the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.400
 first part I will show how it is done 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.500
 the salt paste and I'm going to make another 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 small video in which I will mention 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.790
 some tips to keep more your 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.759
 figurines we started materials 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 of containers something with which to measure either 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.640
 a cup a disposable cup or what you 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.140
 you want this replacement or update 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.509
 but something with which to measure depending on 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.120
 the amount of dough you want to make if 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.909
 less is more Chiquito 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.640
 and something to mix with 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.690
 same as a large container in which you go 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.130
 to make the mixture 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.110
 for pasta 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 wheat flour 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.490
 it has to be wheat flour can not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.170
 be of another type of flour not cornstarch 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.390
 Salt 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.550
 resistol this record he does not have to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 be branded you can buy it loose in 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.580
 the corner hardware store 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.760
 and it can even be a bit lowered with 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 water does not have to be very faithful but 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.040
 special as you use in pasta 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 French glycerin a trickle one 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.090
 teaspoon whatever if you do not have 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.130
 glycerin you can use baby oil 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.080
 If you do not have oil to drink, you can 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.080
 use cooking oil 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.330
 but you can also use cream 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.590
 the most oily you have and it's not going to 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.040
 be the holy the grandmother amounts of o 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:56.390
 on the one hand flour 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 you're going to use half or a little more 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.620
 it does not matter of salt 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.730
 the train 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:10.830
 it was not the resistor train is the 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.360
 necessary only as well as the formula 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.180
 normal the one you put water on 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.840
 needed here instead of water are you going to 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.519
 use the resistol so it's the same 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.560
 only the necessary there is not a measure 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.909
 exact but you're adding it little 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.879
 little by little and you are feeling the 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:33.360
 pulp consistency is not so 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.500
 gives an exact amount 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:40.710
 and from the glycerin the oil or the cream 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.600
 you are going to use for a cup is used 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.780
 this one cup are you going to use a 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.420
 spoonful does not matter if you put it 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.840
 less or you spend a little bit with that 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:56.740
 neither is there is not much problem and 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:59.040
 good we start with the procedure 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.040
 i 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.580
 i 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.560
 for me 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.940
 Y
