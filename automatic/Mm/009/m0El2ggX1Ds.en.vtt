hello I'm your host Dan Rojas next the
big<00:00:03.659> satellite<00:00:04.140> dish<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.710> be

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
big satellite dish we're going to be

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.889 
big satellite dish we're going to be
testing<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.520> boiling<00:00:05.910> some<00:00:06.120> water<00:00:06.150> I<00:00:06.660> have<00:00:06.870> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
testing and boiling some water I have a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.020 
testing and boiling some water I have a
vacuum<00:00:07.410> tube<00:00:07.620> over<00:00:07.890> there<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.189> 20<00:00:08.550> ounces<00:00:08.880> of

vacuum tube over there with 20 ounces of
water<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.450> then<00:00:09.599> we're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> see<00:00:09.990> how

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
water and then we're going to see how

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.020 
water and then we're going to see how
long<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.290> takes<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.769> boil<00:00:11.010> I'm<00:00:11.550> also<00:00:11.759> going<00:00:11.969> to

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
long it takes to boil I'm also going to

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.870 
long it takes to boil I'm also going to
be<00:00:12.150> showing<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.599> how<00:00:12.630> well<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.230> works

parabolic acrylic mirror in the middle

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:52.060 
parabolic acrylic mirror in the middle
it's<00:00:36.780> set<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> focal<00:00:37.620> length<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> dish

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.400 

pretty<00:00:53.070> intense<00:00:53.490> and<00:00:53.790> here<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.900> vacuum

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
pretty intense and here is the vacuum

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.630 
pretty intense and here is the vacuum
tube<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:55.770> we're<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.190> moving<00:00:56.340> into

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
tube that we're going to be moving into

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
tube that we're going to be moving into
position<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.270> got<00:00:57.420> water<00:00:57.690> inside<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.290> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
position it's got water inside of it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.050 
position it's got water inside of it
I've<00:00:58.860> got<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.250> hook<00:00:59.490> to<00:00:59.520> one<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> those

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
I've got this hook to one of those

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.640 
I've got this hook to one of those
stands<00:01:00.450> that<00:01:00.720> I<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.350> parabolic

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
stands that I made for the parabolic

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.140 
stands that I made for the parabolic
collector<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.400> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.580> block<00:01:02.850> some<00:01:03.120> of

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
collector so it's going to block some of

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.780 
collector so it's going to block some of
the<00:01:03.270> sunlight<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.350> shadow<00:01:04.650> coming<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the sunlight the shadow coming in this

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.750 
the sunlight the shadow coming in this
is<00:01:05.940> a<00:01:05.970> real<00:01:06.240> rough<00:01:06.479> test<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:06.960> isn't<00:01:07.760> perfect

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
is a real rough test this isn't perfect

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
is a real rough test this isn't perfect
how<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.940> should<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.800> there<00:01:10.800> is<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> copper

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
how you should do it there is a copper

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.040 
how you should do it there is a copper
wire<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.970> regular<00:01:12.360> electrical<00:01:12.840> tape

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
wire with regular electrical tape

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.240 
wire with regular electrical tape
holding<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.590> place<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:13.950> want<00:01:14.190> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
holding it in place so I don't want to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.680 
holding it in place so I don't want to
get<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> focal<00:01:14.820> point<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> go

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
get the focal point on that I want to go

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:32.090 
get the focal point on that I want to go
towards<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.110> bottom<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.150> tube<00:01:31.100> looks

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
towards the bottom of this tube looks

00:01:32.100 --> 00:02:06.520 
towards the bottom of this tube looks
like<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> went<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.610> little<00:01:32.640> too<00:01:32.970> high

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.139 

so<00:02:07.530> far<00:02:07.740> were<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.100> minute<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.640> test<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so far were one minute into the test and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.360 
so far were one minute into the test and
it's<00:02:09.239> already<00:02:09.569> starting<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.039> steam<00:02:11.039> at<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
it's already starting to steam at the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.490 
it's already starting to steam at the
top<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.110> minute<00:02:16.410> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
top a little bit this is one minute and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.559 
top a little bit this is one minute and
30<00:02:16.709> seconds<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.370> 20<00:02:17.640> ounces<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.150> water<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
30 seconds and 20 ounces of water is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:50.490 
30 seconds and 20 ounces of water is
there<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> full<00:02:18.989> boil

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.770 

so<00:02:51.500> 20<00:02:51.860> ounces<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.340> water<00:02:52.549> in<00:02:52.819> 90<00:02:53.180> seconds<00:02:53.629> is

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
so 20 ounces of water in 90 seconds is

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.479 
so 20 ounces of water in 90 seconds is
not<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> bad<00:02:54.260> deal<00:02:54.290> from<00:02:54.860> 80<00:02:55.129> degrees

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
not a bad deal from 80 degrees

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.210 
not a bad deal from 80 degrees
