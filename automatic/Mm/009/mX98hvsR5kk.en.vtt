00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I do not like confused I will accept trashy 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.270
 comics maybe someone really 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.760
 on high sit a few hours on 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 page reflecting each action heroes 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 but alas, I am not so happy 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.240
 I feel like the story is holding 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.580
 somewhere in the middle between the primitives we 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.130
 something complicated then i read it easy and 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.109
 interesting to observe the events of the story 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 which I will tell you a review to the very 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.439
 the middle appears to the reader as 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 Some horseradish understand that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.039
 and ends just the very 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.859
 the golden middle I told which I said 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 Earlier you are watching a comic review today 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.149
 in my hands is deadly fine 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.149
 fresh comics from the company and night 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.980
 I'll start by tradition the plot of the book meets 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.750
 readers talk between the dead 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.699
 rabbit and butterfly conversation 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.530
 the rabbit is divided with no interesting 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.390
 history that seem to be and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.820
 the main events of the comic unfold 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.220
 the story tells us about the mysterious 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.320
 a blind old man named fox and no less 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.880
 mysterious girl in black suits 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.159
 feathers neck Sisi 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.080
 guys go to different cities and each 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.299
 just act the same grim 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.460
 theatrical song and the spirits of teaching by 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.440
 the name of the genie after one of the typical 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.690
 speeches life of the main characters cool 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.610
 changing now looking for artists 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.590
 menacing mysterious girl with a whole 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.600
 a mob of subordinates but what is it 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.149
 done simple tramps you find out 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.590
 let's talk about the genre of history 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.259
 it is very difficult to select something 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.789
 specific if you read batman silently 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.229
 then you understand that this is clearly 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.390
 superhero detective 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.280
 when you have a meteor from loot 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.500
 immediately see that this is a space fighter 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.020
 with deadly fine everything is very 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.119
 not easy sort of like this in countries with a touch of 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.100
 mystics and the kind of place as a space plane 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.530
 westerns on the first page can be 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.360
 beautiful one-on-one battles just like 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.149
 classic films waste land from 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.950
 tumbler field yes and the scorching sun on 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.270
 2 may be talking 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 other worlds 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.640
 from demons no other people in the same 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.160
 spirit as for the shoals story like me 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.410
 already said earlier the very service begins 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.750
 1 page 50 it seemed that they gave me 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.730
 simply a large set of obscurities 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.310
 and things change heroes are added 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.200
 events and explanation for all this is not 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.500
 just at the very end connected 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.180
 pieces understood the meaning of another moment either 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.340
 I'm too tight or just 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 inattentively read comics but I did not understand 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.780
 a message in the conversation of a rabbit and a butterfly 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.100
 apparently I should have somehow connected 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.470
 them from the main storyline 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.450
 her but I did not succeed not 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.660
 I understand that you want to bring something 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.790
 speak straight 0 and almost right 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.860
 at the second reading I will catch the connection in 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.990
 these conversations but reread the story 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.090
 I will not soon the whole plot and not 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.190
 like pretty much pole 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 considered fast and this is very cool 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.750
 besides talking here are good 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.460
 action and mysterious characters main name 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
 closer to the end of the story to me too 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.110
 I personally liked it did not expect this 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.630
 a turn of events what else is cool so this 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.910
 the atmosphere but it is rather a drawing decides 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.700
 rather than a plot by the way about drawing 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.890
 the girl did not study by name and marius 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.350
 must say pencil pencil gives out very 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.960
 and frail quality picture style is quite 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.310
 unusual sometimes even rough background and 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.920
 traced well 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.920
 there is a bunch of details of the action scene also not 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.660
 pumped up fights looks dynamic 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.090
 I liked the work of the colorist of color 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.950
 at the level and they are also very unusual 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.230
 someone might not like it because of their 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.240
 flat taxi but for me so okay 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.340
 shorter drawing looks solid 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.950
 original release of comics in Russian 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.530
 engaged in publishing and appreciate it 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.570
 second job from them but 1 which I bought 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.760
 I honestly did not expect this 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.520
 the quality of the publication leaves in the comic 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.680
 glossy cover hard and very dull 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 pleased with the quality of firmware printing 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.060
 fonts are also made in patsanski 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.670
 the story consists of five chapters and this 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.860
 about 130 pages that occupy 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.080
 most of the book is well besides the very 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.670
 The plot in the publication included a huge pile 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.510
 cool art from a variety of 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.150
 artists 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.280
 they are really a lot of design of the book, too 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.380
 liked incomprehensible to me only 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.210
 white bookends and excel in place 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.300
 could easily print any 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:25.580
 image and to dear publishers 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.280
 I ask you if the book is more from pages 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.800
 that number them it's not difficult well 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.570
 oh well it's all nagging now the conclusion 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.090
 if you are ready to close your eyes on 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.830
 incomprehensible long history entry then 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.260
 you simply have no reason not to 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.690
 buy this comic good publisher 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.810
 good drawing hint at sequel 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.920
 speaking briefly the purchase is worth it with you 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.740
 there was only am 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.770
