00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.080
 We are on a balcony in the middle of the metropolis Berlin 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.900
 Michael Hilgers agreed 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.070
 many balcony ideas come from him 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.779
 What attracts a designer to balconies 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.480
 When polishing, do a fair after such a weather area and you have to 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.320
 window 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.989
 in contrast to the interior and a bit neglected 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.269
 Palling design and therefore made to the task 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.779
 Percent things are developing this room a bit more attractive and maybe 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.569
 but punished a little more practical 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.789
 in his Berlin his works instead of cityscapes 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.030
 does not have the rule that the principle is possible even on the principle 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 prescribed in the smallest space 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.980
 With that came the soon to the often fears but freest living area the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.090
 balcony 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.440
 he wants to make it usable for all seasons 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.199
 a table two chairs and a parasol 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.570
 so most of them are chronic 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.500
 Not so in this morning of Berlin designer Michael Evers 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 what have they done differently? 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.509
 I have foregone a lot of fish at a college legs 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.440
 Overall, you agree on everything 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.900
 including the already nice that you have so few ball contacts 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.810
 not only optimally used how much space it needed was yes 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.500
 that needed less fine square meters to the alpine space 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.380
 and all for 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.190
 and supper so thats not just at first and ivory can be with 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.480
 this beautiful away 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 and can just replace the whole with a lantern 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.990
 and what 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.150
 if the balcony is needed elsewhere you can do it very easily 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.530
 fold up too easy here 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
 not better 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.789
 j 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:48.910
 and you can 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.840
 swing in this Lechner 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.300
 coming from northwest of the city 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.170
 that's easy to do 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.100
 but unfortunately still a prototype Yeah a balcony is oasis 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.590
 cozy find piece place 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.950
 and also for the planting 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.159
 Michael Wegers has come up with something like that it is 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.700
 Sanctions percent of all world flower boxes but our cuttings 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.079
 We can equally know how to present ourselves to the outside world 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.169
 that is to say, formally, without need, his box 1 will not be why 

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:21.219
 This matching jump of the plaintiff is easy 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.079
 they have and just a recess and they can as it were 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.079
 Fit saddle as a foreigner 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.469
 and that are completely without tools and lo and behold 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.219
 they are not two parts 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.570
 «The knowhow of the two chambers should be in front of the camera 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.020
 You can also hold two different herbs Naser 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.550
 Earth Mainz's name will reform all the flowers or you can also have two 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.140
 Differences planting in front of a deceased closely planned so outward 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.580
 stay there they are also winterized Christoph Winder fest 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.580
 is made up of sassy and politics go and you can 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.849
 straight from the one precursor 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.469
 that means uptrend 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.159
 so should and also failures 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.589
 for police data visitors but off 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.029
 the increasing effects of whether the contract is extended 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.639
 after filling with the earth 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.249
 Percent, the focus is well below 2 3 per thousand Enders and there is 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.539
 none of them secure themselves 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.990
 on our balcony is now a Rohrspatz landed 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.210
 and that's not all of him would have been exactly if not now 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.749
 the smoking ban in restaurants 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.749
 Percent the more and more people smoking outside on the balcony 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.079
 Paschal this little friend develops the process itself from sensors 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.799
 would have been blocked if he wandered as the chain did not over the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.549
 potted plant 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.560
 and also the ashes of the cigarettes I will always on the 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:41.089
 Troops kitchen what you broadcast for a signal neighborhood dispute 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.719
 Diversity makes it possible for the boy to cling to the railing 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.959
 there are 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.849
 the well-known Allen key 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.549
 Finding a percent resembles a screw clamp 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.549
 Kanzem firmly on and especially small and so holds half-hourly clock 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.310
 and the us-sport also ends up 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.039
 Non smoking attendance that can happen 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.930
 this is simply actually another server body 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.129
 the safest way that applies to our whole with a magnet 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.459
 can put on this attitude and already I have a solar lamp 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.269
 the world gets up in the daytime with sunlight and gives it at night in the form of 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.279
 Players off and as the eldest son at that time did not dare market 

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.629
 the time is finally 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.949
 the classic 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.590
 You can stop art 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.909
 become 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:27.139
 and on the private balcony is also cheap drinks 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.000
 and even a campfire is possible 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.229
 more heart 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.499
 I have it for me 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.529
 but in the previous year this idea 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.550
 no hidden pretty dangerous on the balcony and the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.879
 Neighborhood dispute by smoke is inevitable 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.929
 or Pampel have no qualms it just will not work 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.819
 exhaust-free and fed a bioethanol in April 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.559
 to replace the internet minute 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.399
 the protective glass of wood remains pop music passengers through 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.599
 and then it gets cozy 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.650
 that is actually 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.170
 Müssig external warehouse front how come that 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.910
 that has also been the inspiration for this polished Insterburg 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.870
 reminds me of logs 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.590
 Survey still at the same time this diesel glass shell encloses this fire 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.810
 and 5 Munich ots - 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.189
 if only a little 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:23.619
 and then it can be on cooler evenings households so it is not 

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:24.650
 GM 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.560
 Forward to Balkonien 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.240
 to soft sounds from the radio 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.150
 Stommel and I also want to be on the balcony important 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.520
 I will understand that well 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.520
 Nadine Prosecutor visit me again soon on balcony 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.360
 and next week there will be new ideas and inventions, and I think so 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.039
 just awesome
