00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 again solve this video 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.300
 this time we are going to make some 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.559
 cinnamon sweet tamales with raisins 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.480
 here we already have the dough prepared for 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.279
 tamales de dulce already has sugar and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.230
 everything on my channel is the video of how 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.490
 do as prepare this dough 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.740
 and we put it in a bowl if you have one of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.930
 them but by hand what we're going to do 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.220
 is to put cinnamon which is a 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:37.100
 teaspoon ground cinnamon and we're going 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.660
 incorporate well either with your hands or 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.300
 with teachers machines that in this case 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.540
 It is faster raisins if we are going to 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.360
 incorporate doubling the forgiveness 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.350
 wrapping up because it does not get messed up 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.350
 with this machine 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.399
 the machine 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 that cinnamon is well incorporated into 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.219
 some places use color to not 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.190
 we are going to put color only is 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.590
 only cinnamon 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.570
 let's beat it let's admit the noise 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 of this blender and ready 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.610
 we already did the cinnamon can go 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 trying to see if he has enough 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.920
 sugar put a little more sugar 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 adjust it to taste and cinnamon like me 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.180
 I do not put a lot of quality so that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.130
 so much but you can adjust the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.819
 flavor of cinnamon putting a little 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.440
 more or a little less but first one 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:34.350
 teaspoonful 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.210
 it is the least you can put if you can not 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 adjust a little more cinnamon if so 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.780
 you want it and do not forget to say that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 we had put the leaves to soak for 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.690
 that are ready when we go to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 need the here we have a cup of 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.930
 raisins 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.890
 and nothing else we wrap until it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.830
 incorporate well 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.030
 with the dough and ready to make our 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.340
 sizes this we are going to do our 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.330
 tamales let's wrap we have the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.190
 leaves soaked and drained 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.130
 we're going to give it this way and I 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.380
 I prefer to do it so the shortest thing up 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.380
 from the widest down 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.319
 narrow x narrow I wanted to say above you 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.630
 we put the amount the amount that 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.130
 We want to be medium or large guys 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.250
 let's wrap them 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.980
 if we put it more or less than half 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.269
 down 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.269
 because we are going to need 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.160
 fold it 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.340
 in this way 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.040
 so that we recharge it with the others like this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.720
 it does not open if it likes like that if it wants 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.940
 tie them but it is not necessary 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.730
 it just puts them that way, an ornate one 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.290
 with the other and no longer unfolds and less 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.909
 when it is already cooked and so 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.909
 we continue doing the rest 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.500
 and the water 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.930
 enough water so that the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.480
 grating 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.209
 we are going to have water heating apart 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.489
 for when you need it, let's go 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.709
 watching after a half hour we are going to 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.719
 see what destination is missing water we can 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.269
 until you lift this if you like and put 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.340
 necessary water so that we do not run out 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.159
 the water we are going to finish putting 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.129
 our also our steamer all 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.829
 they left approximately 15 tamales here 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:52.519
 there's more because we take advantage of the pot and 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:56.049
 We put other pineapple tamales with coconut 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.840
 that we also have the video on the channel 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.169
 of how to do those of course not 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.720
 they are only made and nobody here is one 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.849
 amount that you need to do that 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.510
 they are usually put in a steamer 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:14.290
 large or medium depends on the tamales 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.220
 that are going to be from others 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.690
 green of sweet red and so on 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.669
 here we already have about 30 with everything 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.630
 with those of pineapple 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:30.910
 the time that the steamer will last 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.970
 It is also depends on the amount of 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:37.690
 tamales how big they are etc. 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.969
 here we are going to leave you less than an hour 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.169
 before reviewing them 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:44.539
 Yo soy 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.400
 you have to check after half an hour the 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.210
 water to go putting water but that is 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.620
 hot so it's not too late 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:57.280
 with the leaves that did not work for us 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:01.630
 girls or why 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.470
 for some reason that we do not use them 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.340
 let's say we have left over, let's cover here 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.900
 so that in that way the steam 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.810
 what's left 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:19.520
 in the lid 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:21.720
 and it turns to make water does not fall inside 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.160
 directly 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.160
 to the tamales 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.950
 you can put a towel 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.330
 clean kitchen to absorb that 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:38.020
 moisture ready we put everything 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.020
 gives stove 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.509
 and let's leave it for an hour and I repeat 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.759
 after half an hour each I can and 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:52.230
 checking the water to go putting more 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:55.350
 hot water let's leave them 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:00.110
 feel in an hour 20 minutes to 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.110
 make sure they are well cooked 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:08.290
 very careful about the steam 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.290
 hot can not see 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:17.819
 what we did here we have two too 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:22.340
 raisins we will get to show how 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:25.040
 we were more ready 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.780
 you can eat hot or hot 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.630
 cold these candy can eat them 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.260
 cool too 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.260
 like 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.639
 the destructive ones 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.110
 as you can see they are spongy 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.239
 sweet enough 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.680
 very rich what we did, I already provide 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:58.900
 10 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:00.910
 I can not show it in the video because 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.570
 when eating you can not talk 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.570
 correctly 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:10.849
 and many thanks for watching this video 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:15.030
 and I leave a link for the tamales of 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:17.419
 pineapple with coconut many thanks
