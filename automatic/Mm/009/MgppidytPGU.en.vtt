time we don't really want it sticky so

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.319 
time we don't really want it sticky so
that<00:02:36.670> side<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.120> done<00:02:37.440> flip<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.560> over<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.329> we're

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
that side is done flip it over and we're

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.940 
that side is done flip it over and we're
just<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.660> repeat<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.079> process<00:02:41.260> we're

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
just going to repeat the process we're

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.680 
just going to repeat the process we're
going<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:43.060> work<00:02:43.209> our<00:02:43.390> hand<00:02:44.070> around<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.280> edge

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
going to work our hand around the edge

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.259 
going to work our hand around the edge
just<00:02:46.690> like<00:02:46.810> so<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.549> will<00:02:48.730> also<00:02:48.970> help

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
just like so and this will also help

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
seen a lot of really weird ways of hand

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.759 
seen a lot of really weird ways of hand
stretching<00:02:57.010> dough<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.489> YouTube<00:02:58.380> so<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.410> thought

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
stretching dough on YouTube so I thought

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.140 
stretching dough on YouTube so I thought
I<00:03:00.010> would<00:03:00.130> give<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.630> my<00:03:01.630> take<00:03:01.989> on<00:03:02.200> how<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:03.150> hand

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
I would give you my take on how to hand

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.680 
I would give you my take on how to hand
stretch<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.570> pizza<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.320> this<00:03:05.680> side<00:03:06.570> just<00:03:07.570> can

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
stretch a pizza and this side just can

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.400 
stretch a pizza and this side just can
push<00:03:07.930> your<00:03:08.079> fingers<00:03:08.440> down

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.430 

all<00:03:15.980> right<00:03:16.280> we've<00:03:16.820> almost<00:03:17.150> got<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.050> dough

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
all right we've almost got the dough

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
all right we've almost got the dough
where<00:03:19.010> we<00:03:19.160> want<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.200> next<00:03:21.410> step<00:03:22.030> I'm

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
where we want it so the next step I'm

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.160 
where we want it so the next step I'm
going<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.240> have<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.450> move<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.720> camera<00:03:23.870> again

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
going to have to move the camera again

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.710 
going to have to move the camera again
just<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.340> get<00:03:25.490> a<00:03:25.520> little<00:03:26.330> wider<00:03:26.570> angle

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
just so you can get a little wider angle

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.390 
just so you can get a little wider angle
okay<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:29.780> now<00:03:30.080> we've<00:03:30.650> got<00:03:30.890> our<00:03:30.980> dough<00:03:31.190> and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
okay so now we've got our dough and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.040 
okay so now we've got our dough and
basically<00:03:32.330> the<00:03:32.960> movement<00:03:33.410> I'm<00:03:33.470> going<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.740> make

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
basically the movement I'm going to make

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.610 
basically the movement I'm going to make
just<00:03:36.050> like<00:03:36.230> this<00:03:36.410> twist<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.640> wrist<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.620> we

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
just like this twist of the wrist and we

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.990 
just like this twist of the wrist and we
don't<00:03:39.800> have<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:40.100> twist<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:40.460> very<00:03:40.640> much<00:03:40.820> because

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
don't have to twist it very much because

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.980 
don't have to twist it very much because
this<00:03:41.840> pizza<00:03:42.230> dough<00:03:42.490> is<00:03:43.490> stretched<00:03:43.990> it's

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
this pizza dough is stretched it's

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.440 
this pizza dough is stretched it's
almost<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.470> size<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.920> want<00:03:46.100> it<00:03:49.330> we're<00:03:50.330> just

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
almost the size we want it we're just

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.810 
almost the size we want it we're just
going<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.660> make<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:51.110> little<00:03:52.100> bit<00:03:52.310> little

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
going to make a little bit little

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.910 
going to make a little bit little
increments<00:03:53.540> we're<00:03:53.990> going<00:03:54.140> to<00:03:54.200> focus<00:03:54.560> on<00:03:54.710> just

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
increments we're going to focus on just

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.370 
increments we're going to focus on just
inner<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.850> crust<00:03:56.120> I<00:03:56.450> don't<00:03:57.080> want<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.260> make

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
inner on the crust I don't want to make

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.340 
inner on the crust I don't want to make
it<00:03:57.500> too<00:03:57.650> big<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:59.180> we'll<00:03:59.330> fit<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.720> on<00:03:59.870> our<00:04:00.020> pizza

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
it too big so we'll fit it on our pizza

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.670 
it too big so we'll fit it on our pizza
pan<00:04:00.710> here<00:04:01.690> we'll<00:04:02.690> make<00:04:02.840> sure<00:04:03.080> it's<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.590> right

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
pan here we'll make sure it's the right

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.110 
pan here we'll make sure it's the right
size<00:04:04.690> sometimes<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:06.080> comes<00:04:06.410> out<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.710> little

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
size sometimes it comes out a little

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.990 
size sometimes it comes out a little
oval<00:04:08.120> but<00:04:08.270> that's<00:04:08.480> okay<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:10.430> can<00:04:10.460> always<00:04:10.730> make

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
oval but that's okay you can always make

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.289 
oval but that's okay you can always make
it<00:04:11.060> round<00:04:11.390> but<00:04:12.020> pulling<00:04:12.710> on<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.100> edges

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.719 

and<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.440> dough<00:04:20.620> will<00:04:20.859> shrink<00:04:21.280> up<00:04:21.459> a<00:04:21.549> little

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
and the dough will shrink up a little

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.850 
and the dough will shrink up a little
bit<00:04:21.940> when<00:04:22.780> you're<00:04:22.930> going<00:04:23.020> to<00:04:23.110> put<00:04:23.259> sauce<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:23.800> it

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
bit when you're going to put sauce on it

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:32.390 
bit when you're going to put sauce on it
so

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.100 

moving<00:04:33.060> around<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.440> actually<00:04:34.830> looking

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
moving around and so actually looking

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.740 
moving around and so actually looking
just<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.200> boat<00:04:37.470> perfect<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.240> that's<00:04:39.390> what<00:04:39.630> you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
just the boat perfect so that's what you

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.810 
just the boat perfect so that's what you
want<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.020> end<00:04:40.170> up<00:04:40.290> with<00:04:40.610> something<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.760> this

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
want to end up with something like this

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.850 
want to end up with something like this
you<00:04:42.030> want<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.540> dough<00:04:42.720> just<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.200> be<00:04:43.350> on<00:04:43.680> the
