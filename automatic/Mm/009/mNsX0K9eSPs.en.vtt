00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.460
 hey people what gives 10 hertz wants 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.990
 groupwide tutorial on the gdf front 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 had to show you mine today 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.279
 opinion for perfect setup for tuning 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 It's part of your own 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.840
 bonnet on that you get yours 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.699
 spotlight on power and your doors 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 we open the whole show up show 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.310
 me now 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.140
 so you have a better picture 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 of the whole thing can show 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 I'll give you the whole brief in game here 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.960
 my bugatti you see the bonnet 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.250
 is open the headlights are on and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.129
 the doors are open and that he is well 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.500
 nobody in the vehicle is sitting first 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.360
 To do that , you turn on your vehicle 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.430
 the place from where the tuning meet 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 then he takes a sniper 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.230
 weapon and shoot at the rear 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.539
 corners of your bonnet just like me 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.100
 you may need about three to four 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.140
 shots then they should be at first 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.539
 crack on page and then he changes 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
 on the other side around there too 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.920
 bracket and also needs to be solved here 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 her about three to four shots then 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 the bonnet should be slightly upwards 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 then just go sit in that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.650
 vehicle pushes on that very easily 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.540
 accelerator 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 so that the bonnet a bit 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.960
 but you should not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.580
 Exaggerate then because the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 take off the hood 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.390
 Now we come to it as you your lights 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 or you can get in that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.960
 vehicle is sitting in here goes first 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.280
 in your vehicle and then press on the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.380
 ipad to the right around your light 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.150
 you start to shoot again 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.040
 with a pistol once fast behind 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.020
 I get in the vehicle again 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.640
 back on the d-pad to the right around the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 to turn on the light you can now 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 get out and you see the light is on 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.060
 continue to last you still make yours 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.439
 I suspect I'll know 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 a corner and be ashamed of their presses 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.100
 a sales or y and the door 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.659
 to open and then sprint from 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.479
 your vehicle away so that your character 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.180
 Do not get in the vehicle and that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.520
 was the entire set up i find that looks 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.049
 just really cool really first 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.030
 right there at night come 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.210

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.950
