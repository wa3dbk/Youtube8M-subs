00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.259 

so<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> second<00:00:14.700> segment<00:00:14.880> we'll<00:00:15.179> be

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so in the second segment we'll be

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.120 
so in the second segment we'll be
looking<00:00:15.389> at<00:00:15.660> some<00:00:15.809> more<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.230> our<00:00:16.440> forms<00:00:16.890> for

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
looking at some more of our forms for

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.420 
looking at some more of our forms for
c-major<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.500> like<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.590> said<00:00:19.650> before<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.310> may

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
c-major and like I said before you may

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.400 
c-major and like I said before you may
spend<00:00:20.699> your<00:00:20.850> whole<00:00:21.060> first<00:00:21.390> day<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.930> warming<00:00:22.260> up

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.080 
spend your whole first day of warming up
just<00:00:22.680> learning<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.490> position<00:00:23.820> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
just learning that first position and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
just learning that first position and
getting<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.359> under<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.660> fingers<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
getting it under your fingers then the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
getting it under your fingers then the
next<00:00:26.130> day<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.820> reinforce<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.660> first

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
next day you can reinforce that first

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.150 
next day you can reinforce that first
position<00:00:28.320> make<00:00:28.470> sure<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.710> still<00:00:28.949> got<00:00:29.070> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
position make sure you still got it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.589 
position make sure you still got it
memorized<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:29.970> add<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> second

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
memorized and then add the second

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.590 
memorized and then add the second
position<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:32.460> continue<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.270> same

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
position and you continue in that same

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
position and you continue in that same
fashion<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.050> third<00:00:34.320> day<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.559> review<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
fashion the third day you review the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.620 
fashion the third day you review the
first<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.640> second<00:00:35.940> position<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.510> add

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
first and second position and then add

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.389 
first and second position and then add
the<00:00:36.809> third<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.800> get<00:00:37.920> faster<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the third and as you get faster and

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.150 
the third and as you get faster and
faster<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.079> all<00:00:40.079> five<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.680> become<00:00:40.800> part

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
faster at it all five will become part

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.619 
faster at it all five will become part
of<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.250> warm<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> where<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.030> play

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
of your warm up to where you can play

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.209 
of your warm up to where you can play
out<00:00:42.780> through<00:00:42.989> all<00:00:43.140> five<00:00:43.379> fast<00:00:43.800> enough<00:00:44.100> where

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
out through all five fast enough where

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.920 
out through all five fast enough where
you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> minute<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> then<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
you can do it in a minute and then you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
you can do it in a minute and then you
can<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.200> some<00:00:46.350> other<00:00:46.469> applications<00:00:47.250> using

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
can do some other applications using

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
can do some other applications using
that<00:00:47.700> same<00:00:47.910> scale<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.570> let's<00:00:49.530> look<00:00:49.680> at<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
that same scale so let's look at the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
that same scale so let's look at the
second<00:00:50.370> position<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:51.420> one<00:00:51.660> will<00:00:51.809> start<00:00:52.050> on

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
second position this one will start on

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
second position this one will start on
the<00:00:52.230> eighth<00:00:52.469> fret<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:52.980> sixth<00:00:53.309> string<00:00:53.340> it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the eighth fret of the sixth string it

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.450 
the eighth fret of the sixth string it
will<00:00:53.850> look<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.000> this

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.250 

so<00:01:01.460> that's<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.760> 8th<00:01:01.940> fret<00:01:02.180> sixth<00:01:02.720> string<00:01:02.750> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
so that's the 8th fret sixth string and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.680 
so that's the 8th fret sixth string and
in<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:03.920> fifth<00:01:04.160> fret<00:01:04.430> seventh<00:01:05.210> fret<00:01:05.300> and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
in the fifth fret seventh fret and

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.100 
in the fifth fret seventh fret and
eighth<00:01:05.900> fret<00:01:06.200> on<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.440> fifth<00:01:06.740> string<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
eighth fret on the fifth string the

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.690 
eighth fret on the fifth string the
fifth<00:01:09.110> fret<00:01:09.410> and<00:01:09.470> seventh<00:01:10.130> fret<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.640> the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
fifth fret and seventh fret of the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.630 
fifth fret and seventh fret of the
fourth<00:01:11.090> string<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.280> then<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.370> the<00:01:13.430> third

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
fourth string and then on the third

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.040 
fourth string and then on the third
string<00:01:13.880> we're<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.240> shift<00:01:14.510> down<00:01:14.750> one

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
string we're going to shift down one

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.620 
string we're going to shift down one
fret<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.070> now<00:01:16.160> we've<00:01:16.280> got<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.760> fourth<00:01:17.090> fifth

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
fret so now we've got the fourth fifth

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.950 
fret so now we've got the fourth fifth
and<00:01:17.870> seventh<00:01:18.350> frets<00:01:18.650> of<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.890> third<00:01:19.100> string

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
and seventh frets of the third string

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.170 
and seventh frets of the third string
then<00:01:20.960> we'll<00:01:21.110> shift<00:01:21.320> up<00:01:21.590> one<00:01:21.890> fret<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.550> have

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
then we'll shift up one fret and have

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.719 
then we'll shift up one fret and have
the<00:01:23.360> fifth<00:01:23.630> sixth<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.590> eighth<00:01:24.979> fret<00:01:25.340> of<00:01:25.700> the

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
the fifth sixth and eighth fret of the

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.170 
the fifth sixth and eighth fret of the
second<00:01:26.180> string<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:27.170> then<00:01:28.010> fifth<00:01:28.340> seventh<00:01:29.000> and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
second string and then fifth seventh and

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.410 
second string and then fifth seventh and
eighth<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.140> first<00:01:30.350> string<00:01:31.119> so<00:01:32.119> we'd<00:01:32.240> want

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
eighth of the first string so we'd want

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.300 
eighth of the first string so we'd want
to<00:01:32.450> play<00:01:32.600> up<00:01:32.750> and<00:01:32.899> down<00:01:33.080> that<00:01:33.259> form<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.920> then

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
to play up and down that form and then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.830 
to play up and down that form and then
there's<00:01:34.460> a<00:01:34.520> couple<00:01:34.700> lower<00:01:35.060> notes<00:01:35.360> we<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:35.540> get

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
there's a couple lower notes we can get

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.210 
there's a couple lower notes we can get
down<00:01:35.990> on<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.200> sixth<00:01:36.470> string<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:36.920> also<00:01:37.040> get

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
down on the sixth string we can also get

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.580 
down on the sixth string we can also get
the<00:01:37.369> seventh<00:01:37.729> fret<00:01:37.970> and<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.869> fifth<00:01:39.110> fret<00:01:39.320> of

the seventh fret and the fifth fret of
the<00:01:40.100> sixth<00:01:40.490> string<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.300> we<00:01:41.330> play<00:01:41.630> all<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.869> way

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899

and<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.830> want<00:01:50.010> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.310> several<00:01:50.580> times<00:01:50.880> so

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
and you want to do that several times so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
and you want to do that several times so
way<00:01:51.660> you've<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.230> position<00:01:52.410> down

sixth<00:01:58.560> string<00:01:58.620> but<00:01:59.040> you'll<00:01:59.160> start<00:01:59.370> this<00:01:59.490> one

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
sixth string but you'll start this one

sixth string but you'll start this one
with<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.150> second<00:02:00.540> finger<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.650> position

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
with the second finger so this position

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.719 
with the second finger so this position
will<00:02:02.130> look<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.400> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.600 
variations of these positions so you may
see<00:02:13.170> some<00:02:13.530> other<00:02:13.709> different<00:02:14.040> things<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.370> books

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
and that's the third position and we'll

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:16.720

the intro starts on the low E string and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.020
