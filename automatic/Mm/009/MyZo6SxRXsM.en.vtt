00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
together the RAM - your VB - 110 - one

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.770 
together the RAM - your VB - 110 - one
got<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> little<00:00:08.820> parts<00:00:09.150> laid<00:00:09.330> out<00:00:09.540> together

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
got the little parts laid out together

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.230 
got the little parts laid out together
here<00:00:10.290> so<00:00:11.129> usually<00:00:11.459> this<00:00:11.580> does<00:00:11.820> come<00:00:12.059> together

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
here so usually this does come together

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.850 
here so usually this does come together
assembled<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.289> just<00:00:13.469> want<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> show<00:00:13.799> you

how<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.070> put<00:00:14.249> it<00:00:14.339> together<00:00:14.459> just<00:00:14.669> in<00:00:15.030> case<00:00:15.209> you

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:15.419 
how to put it together just in case you

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.500 
how to put it together just in case you
need<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.629> know<00:00:16.430> basically<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.700> need<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> take

need to know basically you need to take

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
need to know basically you need to take
this<00:00:19.100> six<00:00:20.100> inch<00:00:20.310> long<00:00:20.430> swing<00:00:21.420> arm<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.160> put<00:00:23.160> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
this six inch long swing arm and put it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.430 
this six inch long swing arm and put it
on<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.790> the<00:00:23.820> six<00:00:24.360> inch<00:00:24.540> bulb<00:00:24.780> socket<00:00:25.200> the<00:00:25.260> swing

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
on to the six inch bulb socket the swing

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.900 
on to the six inch bulb socket the swing
arm<00:00:25.620> that's<00:00:25.950> what<00:00:26.130> we're<00:00:26.250> trying<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.670> here

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
arm that's what we're trying to do here

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.810 
arm that's what we're trying to do here
so<00:00:27.500> firstly<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> rubber<00:00:29.430> washer

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
so firstly you take the rubber washer

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840 
so firstly you take the rubber washer
and<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.690> goes<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.080> there<00:00:31.290> and<00:00:31.669> that's<00:00:32.669> going

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and that goes in there and that's going

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.310 
and that goes in there and that's going
to<00:00:33.030> hold<00:00:33.210> these<00:00:33.360> two<00:00:33.420> together<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.929> so

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to hold these two together like so

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.720 
to hold these two together like so
that's<00:00:34.589> the<00:00:34.859> opening<00:00:35.370> point

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that's the opening point

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.029 
that's the opening point
the<00:00:36.329> bolt<00:00:36.570> comes<00:00:36.839> up<00:00:37.050> through<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.289> bottom<00:00:37.559> or

thing is putting these washers on I've

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.489 
thing is putting these washers on I've
laid<00:00:56.249> them<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.550> perfectly<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.260> they

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
laid them out perfectly in the way they

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.229 
laid them out perfectly in the way they
come<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.159> let's<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.550> put<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.969> here

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
come but let's just put it on here

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.509 
come but let's just put it on here
firstly<00:01:00.659> you<00:01:00.780> get<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.929> black<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.679> black<00:01:02.159> washer

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
firstly you get a black the black washer

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.670 
firstly you get a black the black washer
goes<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.909> there<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> get<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
goes on there and then you get the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.590 
goes on there and then you get the
silver<00:01:05.159> washer<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> bearing<00:01:06.090> washer<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
silver washer the bearing washer and the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.719 
silver washer the bearing washer and the
silver<00:01:06.930> water<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.860> they<00:01:08.009> make<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.219> sandwich

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
silver water so they make a sandwich

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.420 
silver water so they make a sandwich
with<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.060> bearing<00:01:09.719> washroom<00:01:10.079> between<00:01:10.469> then

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
with the bearing washroom between then

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
with the bearing washroom between then
just<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.969> knob<00:01:12.149> on<00:01:12.299> top<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.719> tighten

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
just get the knob on top and tighten

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.139 
just get the knob on top and tighten
that<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.740> down<00:01:15.140> from<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.560> that's

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
that go down from that's it that's

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.789 
that go down from that's it that's
included<00:01:18.149> the<00:01:18.420> system<00:01:18.840> together<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.560> now<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
included the system together so now the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.789 
included the system together so now the
swing<00:01:20.130> arm<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.579> rotate<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.560> way

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
swing arm can rotate around in that way

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.850 
swing arm can rotate around in that way
tight<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.119> swings<00:01:24.659> around<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.439> this

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
tight so it swings around like that this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.649 
tight so it swings around like that this
end<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.460> be<00:01:26.610> bolted<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.149> a<00:01:27.180> vehicle

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
end here would be bolted to a vehicle

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.319 
end here would be bolted to a vehicle
mounting<00:01:28.140> telly<00:01:28.710> Pole<00:01:28.979> system<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> then

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
mounting telly Pole system and then

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.929 
mounting telly Pole system and then
tighten<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.810> down<00:01:30.869> now<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.189> open<00:01:32.670> socket

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
tighten this down now the open socket

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.310 
tighten this down now the open socket
end<00:01:33.329> takes<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.500> RAM<00:01:34.740> tortue<00:01:35.729> ball<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.359> plate

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
end takes the RAM tortue ball and plate

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
end takes the RAM tortue ball and plate
system<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.789> loosen<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.180> off<00:01:39.359> a<00:01:39.390> bit

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
system here so just loosen it off a bit

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.569 
system here so just loosen it off a bit
the<00:01:41.340> socket<00:01:42.060> there<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.920> once

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
the socket there we go and then once

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.969 
the socket there we go and then once
this<00:01:44.789> tightens<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.320> will<00:01:46.439> hold<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> ball

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this tightens up it will hold the ball

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.039 
this tightens up it will hold the ball
in<00:01:47.009> place<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.570> ball<00:01:48.750> will<00:01:48.899> actually

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
in place and the ball will actually

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.480 
in place and the ball will actually
rotate<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.979> both<00:01:50.280> directions<00:01:50.929> like<00:01:51.929> this

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
rotate in both directions like this

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.219 
rotate in both directions like this
twisting<00:01:53.490> forward<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> can

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
twisting forward back then you can

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.139 
twisting forward back then you can
actually<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.799> tighten<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:57.030> then

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
actually then tighten this down and then

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
actually then tighten this down and then
that<00:01:57.329> locks<00:01:57.539> it<00:01:57.689> in<00:01:57.810> place<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.740> you'd

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that locks it in place and what you'd

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.620 
that locks it in place and what you'd
end<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.159> putting<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.460> top<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.789> that<00:01:59.850> ball<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
end up putting on top of that ball the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.539 
end up putting on top of that ball the
plate<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:01.140> would<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.289> like<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> laptop<00:02:01.920> tray

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
plate there would be like a laptop tray

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.030 
plate there would be like a laptop tray

mininet laptop tray whatever it is or
tablet<00:02:08.570> whatever<00:02:08.900> it<00:02:09.080> is<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.290> want<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.530> hold

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
tablet whatever it is you want to hold

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.970 
tablet whatever it is you want to hold
but<00:02:10.460> also<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:11.180> swinger<00:02:12.020> does<00:02:12.320> this<00:02:12.560> as<00:02:12.860> you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
but also this swinger does this as you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.590 
but also this swinger does this as you
loosen<00:02:13.190> it<00:02:13.370> off<00:02:13.520> enough<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.150> can<00:02:14.390> actually

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
loosen it off enough you can actually

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.800 
loosen it off enough you can actually
rotate<00:02:15.080> this<00:02:15.560> in<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.210> 360<00:02:17.210> degrees<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.600> well

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
rotate this in the 360 degrees as well

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.950 
rotate this in the 360 degrees as well
so<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.740> perfect<00:02:19.190> viewing<00:02:19.430> angle

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
so you can get the perfect viewing angle

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.900 
so you can get the perfect viewing angle
for<00:02:20.960> whatever<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.590> you're<00:02:21.740> mounting<00:02:21.920> so

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
for whatever it is you're mounting so

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.650 
for whatever it is you're mounting so
