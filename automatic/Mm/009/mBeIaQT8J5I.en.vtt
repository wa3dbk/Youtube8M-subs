00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
with this all you have to do is do three

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.270 
with this all you have to do is do three
sides<00:02:15.959> do<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.489> three<00:02:17.940> blobs<00:02:18.329> on<00:02:18.720> each

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
sides do like just three blobs on each

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
sides do like just three blobs on each
piece<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.670> let's<00:02:21.239> go<00:02:21.359> like<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:24.450> doesn't

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
piece so let's go like that it doesn't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.950 
piece so let's go like that it doesn't
have<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.900> be<00:02:24.930> too<00:02:25.530> perfect

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.570 

so<00:02:32.960> what<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.200> doing<00:02:33.500> now<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.680> I'm<00:02:33.890> putting<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
so what I'm doing now is I'm putting a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.080 
so what I'm doing now is I'm putting a
blob<00:02:35.270> on<00:02:35.570> each<00:02:36.020> side<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.070> just<00:02:37.490> like<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.730> stroke

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
blob on each side so just like a stroke

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.120 
blob on each side so just like a stroke
with<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:39.470> round<00:02:39.680> brush<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:41.800> you<00:02:42.800> would<00:02:42.920> do<00:02:43.010> it

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
with the round brush and you would do it

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.380 
with the round brush and you would do it
on<00:02:43.220> each<00:02:43.460> side<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:44.060> each<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:46.730> each<00:02:46.910> yellow

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
on each side of each of each yellow

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.940 
on each side of each of each yellow
piece<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.930> do<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:54.290> automatically

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
piece that you do and that automatically

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.610 
piece that you do and that automatically
makes<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.580> really<00:02:56.270> cool<00:02:56.600> cheetah<00:02:56.870> print<00:02:57.230> you
