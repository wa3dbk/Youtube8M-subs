00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
do things so for six years I've been

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.429 
do things so for six years I've been
having<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.060> heart<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.320> would

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
having this in my heart and you would

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
having this in my heart and you would
think<00:01:10.470> being<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> songwriter<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.520> would<00:01:11.700> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
think being a songwriter I would have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
think being a songwriter I would have
popped<00:01:12.540> something<00:01:12.869> out<00:01:12.960> sooner<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
popped something out sooner about that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.830 
popped something out sooner about that
but<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.369> very<00:01:14.520> hard<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> write<00:01:15.119> about<00:01:15.420> things

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but it's very hard to write about things

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.340 
but it's very hard to write about things
like<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:17.659> because<00:01:18.659> nothing's<00:01:18.960> ever<00:01:19.109> good

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
like this because nothing's ever good

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.639 
like this because nothing's ever good
enough<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.929> it's<00:01:21.929> hard<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> put<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.469> into

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
enough for and it's hard to put it into

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.440 
enough for and it's hard to put it into
words<00:01:22.799> how<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.070> feel<00:01:23.429> and<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> idea<00:01:24.359> of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
words how you feel and so the idea of

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.130 
words how you feel and so the idea of

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
in this life you know she can't do

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
in this life you know she can't do
anything<00:01:31.649> for<00:01:32.100> herself<00:01:32.219> and<00:01:32.579> she<00:01:32.759> comes<00:01:33.450> and

goes because she's with me and and then

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:38.090 
goes because she's with me and and then
