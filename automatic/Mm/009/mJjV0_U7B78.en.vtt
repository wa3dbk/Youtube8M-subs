00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
for the upper mount up here I use a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.150 
for the upper mount up here I use a
self-tapping<00:00:17.599> screw<00:00:18.199> and<00:00:20.679> kind<00:00:21.679> of<00:00:21.769> just<00:00:21.949> self

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
self-tapping screw and kind of just self

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.069 
self-tapping screw and kind of just self
tabbed<00:00:22.400> it<00:00:23.439> right<00:00:24.439> into<00:00:24.589> the<00:00:24.800> metal<00:00:25.960> not<00:00:26.960> the

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
tabbed it right into the metal not the

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.999 
tabbed it right into the metal not the
body<00:00:27.289> line<00:00:27.529> as<00:00:27.710> straight<00:00:27.919> as<00:00:28.039> possible<00:00:30.009> for

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
body line as straight as possible for

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.549 
body line as straight as possible for
inside<00:00:31.429> I<00:00:31.789> will<00:00:32.300> do<00:00:32.449> the<00:00:32.539> bracket<00:00:32.960> right<00:00:33.320> there

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
inside I will do the bracket right there

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.830 
inside I will do the bracket right there
that<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.070> can<00:00:34.219> see<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.699> just<00:00:34.879> put<00:00:35.059> a<00:00:35.090> nut<00:00:35.660> in<00:00:35.780> a

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
that you can see and just put a nut in a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.830 
that you can see and just put a nut in a
bolt<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:36.199> it<00:00:36.260> for<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:36.530> middle<00:00:36.739> one<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:38.030> fits

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
bolt in it for the middle one it it fits

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.349 
bolt in it for the middle one it it fits
pretty<00:00:39.680> good<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:41.780> two<00:00:41.960> bottom<00:00:42.379> down<00:00:42.590> here

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
pretty good the two bottom down here

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.869 
pretty good the two bottom down here
they<00:00:44.359> bolt<00:00:44.660> up<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:45.710> stock<00:00:45.949> position<00:00:46.129> so

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
they bolt up to the stock position so

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.729 
they bolt up to the stock position so
you<00:00:47.000> won't<00:00:47.269> have<00:00:47.359> to<00:00:47.480> screw<00:00:47.660> with<00:00:47.780> those<00:00:47.989> just

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
you won't have to screw with those just

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.479 
you won't have to screw with those just
maybe<00:00:48.920> washers<00:00:49.850> for<00:00:50.059> alignment<00:00:50.269> and<00:00:50.570> then

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
maybe washers for alignment and then

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.470 
maybe washers for alignment and then
this<00:00:52.489> will<00:00:52.699> have<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:53.000> tuck<00:00:53.179> underneath

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
this will have to tuck underneath

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.229 
this will have to tuck underneath
underneath<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.980> fender<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.519> then<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.120> got

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
underneath the fender and then you got

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.630 
underneath the fender and then you got
to<00:00:56.329> trim<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:56.780> little<00:00:56.809> bit<00:00:57.140> a<00:00:57.769> pretty<00:00:58.280> common

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
to trim it a little bit a pretty common

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.889 
to trim it a little bit a pretty common
sense<00:00:58.789> on<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.510> then<00:01:00.109> up<00:01:00.260> here<00:01:00.289> you<00:01:01.899> got

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
sense on that and then up here you got

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.460 
sense on that and then up here you got
to<00:01:03.019> cut<00:01:03.170> this<00:01:03.350> out<00:01:03.700> with<00:01:04.700> the<00:01:04.820> sawzall<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.320> your

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
to cut this out with the sawzall so your

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.020 
to cut this out with the sawzall so your
headlight<00:01:06.800> fits<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:07.400> area<00:01:07.730> right<00:01:07.970> here

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
headlight fits in this area right here

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.250 
headlight fits in this area right here
and<00:01:08.360> then<00:01:09.250> under<00:01:10.250> pushes<00:01:10.760> over<00:01:11.110> just<00:01:12.110> like

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
and then under pushes over just like

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.760 
and then under pushes over just like
that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.280 
that
on<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:14.090> thirteenth<00:01:14.510> fender<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.930> got<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.140> cut

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
on the thirteenth fender you got to cut

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.460 
on the thirteenth fender you got to cut
this<00:01:15.470> portion<00:01:15.710> out<00:01:16.750> so<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:17.870> fits<00:01:18.110> in<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:21.320> use<00:01:21.440> a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
this portion out so it fits in so use a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.770 
this portion out so it fits in so use a
sawzall<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.010> make<00:01:22.370> a<00:01:22.400> nice<00:01:22.850> solid<00:01:23.180> cut<00:01:23.570> right

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
sawzall and make a nice solid cut right

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.200 
sawzall and make a nice solid cut right
here

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
here

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.130 
here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
I'll show you on this side and then cut

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.069 
I'll show you on this side and then cut
the<00:01:35.259> frame<00:01:35.969> right<00:01:36.969> where<00:01:37.179> the<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.750> end<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
the frame right where the the end of the

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.370 
the frame right where the the end of the
threads<00:01:38.380> are<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.950> toe<00:01:39.549> mounds<00:01:40.229> let's<00:01:41.229> cut

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
threads are for the toe mounds let's cut

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.510 
threads are for the toe mounds let's cut
the<00:01:41.500> cut<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.310> cut<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.360> flush<00:01:43.679> here's<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.770> piece

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.969 

pretty<00:01:48.520> simple

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.480 

use<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.270> long<00:01:52.450> blade<00:01:52.659> no<00:01:52.900> saws<00:01:53.110> off

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
use the just a long blade no saws off

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.960 
use the just a long blade no saws off
both<00:01:54.490> sides<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.650> grill<00:01:56.920> will<00:01:57.370> fit

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.540 

set<00:02:00.970> something<00:02:01.330> like<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.400> got

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
set something like that and then you got

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.650 
set something like that and then you got
your<00:02:03.729> upper<00:02:04.060> grill<00:02:04.300> mount<00:02:06.240> mount<00:02:07.240> somewhere

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
your upper grill mount mount somewhere

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.370 
your upper grill mount mount somewhere
like<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
like that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.910 
like that
I'll<00:02:09.039> take<00:02:09.280> another<00:02:09.399> video<00:02:09.789> when<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.300> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
I'll take another video when I get that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720 
I'll take another video when I get that

the mail the stock 13 bumper will bulk
right<00:02:27.160> up<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.850> pretty<00:02:31.090> simple<00:02:31.480> for

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
right up to this it's pretty simple for

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.220 
right up to this it's pretty simple for
that<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> fender<00:02:33.790> side<00:02:34.230> here
