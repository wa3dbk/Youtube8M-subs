00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
that scene they're all here if we jump

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.940 
that scene they're all here if we jump
out<00:03:41.019> you'll<00:03:42.019> see<00:03:42.050> there's<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.470> stone<00:03:42.650> cracks

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
out you'll see there's the stone cracks

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.100 
out you'll see there's the stone cracks
but<00:03:43.099> all<00:03:43.310> of<00:03:43.489> them<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:44.150> a<00:03:44.209> color<00:03:44.540> map<00:03:44.780> it's<00:03:45.019> a

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
but all of them is a color map it's a

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.880 
but all of them is a color map it's a
timeline

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
such as animating Penelope

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.030 
such as animating Penelope
can<00:03:56.670> be<00:03:56.820> recorded<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.630> shared<00:03:57.660> up<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.770> in<00:03:58.890> this

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
can be recorded and shared up so in this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.430 
can be recorded and shared up so in this
case<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.850> see<00:03:59.880> there's<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.960> lot<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:01.200> different

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
case you see there's a lot of different

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.430 
case you see there's a lot of different
poses<00:04:01.620> here<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.640> can

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.460 

stop<00:04:05.950> touching<00:04:06.820> one<00:04:07.180> of<00:04:07.210> her<00:04:07.360> joints<00:04:07.750> rotate

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
stop touching one of her joints rotate

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.930 
stop touching one of her joints rotate
it

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.839 

and<00:04:13.300> you'll<00:04:13.450> see

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
and you'll see

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.490 
and you'll see
you've<00:04:15.120> got<00:04:15.269> a<00:04:15.299> bunch<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.599> poses<00:04:15.959> created<00:04:16.380> a

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
you've got a bunch of poses created a

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.490 
you've got a bunch of poses created a
looping<00:04:16.859> animation<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.789> can<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:18.000> very

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
looping animation you can get very

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.870 
looping animation you can get very
complicated<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.220> animations<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.699> want

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
complicated in the animations you want

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.180 
complicated in the animations you want
to<00:04:20.970> create<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:22.019> can<00:04:22.139> tap<00:04:22.320> on<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.530> lot<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:23.039> your

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
to create you can tap on a lot of your

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.370 
to create you can tap on a lot of your
joints<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.820> control<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.479> movement

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
joints and control the movement

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.350 
joints and control the movement
this<00:04:25.800> is<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.250> same<00:04:26.520> model<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.940> an<00:04:27.090> LP<00:04:27.240> that

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
this is the same model of an LP that

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.090 
this is the same model of an LP that
used<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:27.960> dome<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.620> is<00:04:28.800> very

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
used in the dome and this is very

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.970 
used in the dome and this is very
similar<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.990> actual<00:04:31.170> animators

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
similar to the actual animators

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
similar to the actual animators
so<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.520> can<00:04:33.670> create<00:04:33.850> your<00:04:33.910> own<00:04:33.970> animations

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
so you can create your own animations

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.140 
so you can create your own animations
share<00:04:34.840> them<00:04:35.070> abstinent<00:04:36.070> now<00:04:36.820> since<00:04:37.090> last

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
share them abstinent now since last

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.660 
share them abstinent now since last

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
you'll see a lot of different animations

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.050 
you'll see a lot of different animations
created<00:04:41.590> with<00:04:41.710> yeah<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.520> there's<00:04:42.820> just<00:04:42.880> a
