real sense that the matches can turn

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.099 
real sense that the matches can turn
real<00:00:56.250> critical<00:00:56.610> as<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.930> world

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
real critical as well from the world

real critical as well from the world
time<00:00:58.350> punch<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.399> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> most<00:01:00.570> out<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
time punch and to get the most out of it

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.860 
time punch and to get the most out of it
you've<00:01:01.109> got<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.500> make<00:01:01.649> use<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.629> system<00:01:03.629> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you've got to make use of the system I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250 
you've got to make use of the system I
daresay<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> time<00:01:05.939> blocking<00:01:06.540> prop<00:01:06.869> Deacon

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
daresay if you time blocking prop Deacon

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.010 
daresay if you time blocking prop Deacon
Perry<00:01:07.710> strikes<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.490> if<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> hit<00:01:09.840> over

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
Perry strikes and if you if you hit over

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.240 
Perry strikes and if you if you hit over
counter<00:01:10.409> strike<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.799> does<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.189> damage

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
counter strike that does more damage

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.940 
counter strike that does more damage
than<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.880> normal<00:01:12.030> strike<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.799> go

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
than a normal strike so if you just go

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.740 
than a normal strike so if you just go
in<00:01:14.100> swinging<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> do

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
in swinging and you're not going to do

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
in swinging and you're not going to do
as<00:01:15.840> well<00:01:16.020> as<00:01:16.229> somebody<00:01:16.560> who<00:01:16.740> sort<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.250> bit

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
as well as somebody who sort of a bit

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.340 
as well as somebody who sort of a bit
more<00:01:17.729> careful<00:01:18.119> about<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> pays<00:01:19.170> attention

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
more careful about it and pays attention

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.730 
more careful about it and pays attention
good<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:20.340> bit<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.759> fairly<00:01:21.000> technical

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
good little bit so it's fairly technical

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
good little bit so it's fairly technical
complexity<00:01:22.740> yeah<00:01:23.280> it's<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.540> complex<00:01:25.439> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
complexity yeah it's it's not complex so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.230 
complexity yeah it's it's not complex so
much<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.070> terms<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.460> technical<00:01:26.820> execution

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
much in terms of technical execution

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.270 
much in terms of technical execution
it's<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.710> quite<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.159> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
it's more there's just quite a lot of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.450 
it's more there's just quite a lot of
systems<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:31.320> mean<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
systems there and I mean it one of the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.130 
systems there and I mean it one of the
game's<00:01:32.820> weaknesses<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.630> doesn't<00:01:33.990> really

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
game's weaknesses it doesn't really

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
game's weaknesses it doesn't really
explain<00:01:34.500> their<00:01:34.799> system<00:01:35.220> sees<00:01:35.460> very<00:01:35.700> well<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
explain their system sees very well and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.080 
explain their system sees very well and
there<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> tutorial<00:01:37.979> when<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> first<00:01:38.850> play

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
there is a tutorial when you first play

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.810 
there is a tutorial when you first play
it<00:01:39.500> there's<00:01:40.500> also<00:01:40.590> challenge<00:01:41.189> mode<00:01:41.430> which<00:01:41.790> is

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it there's also challenge mode which is

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.789 
it there's also challenge mode which is
quite<00:01:42.420> helpful<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.079> learning<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> game

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
quite helpful to learning the game

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.410 
quite helpful to learning the game
because<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.369> gives<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> various

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
because it gives you the various

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.789 
because it gives you the various
challenges<00:01:45.720> based<00:01:46.110> around<00:01:46.350> particular

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
challenges based around particular

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
challenges based around particular
element<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.610> helps<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> learn<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
element so that helps you to learn it

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
element so that helps you to learn it
but<00:01:49.079> even<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.369> quite<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> lot<00:01:50.729> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
but even then there are quite a lot of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
but even then there are quite a lot of
crucial<00:01:51.479> mechanics<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> found<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:53.009> about

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
crucial mechanics that I found out about

through and unloading screens that you

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.020 
through and unloading screens that you
knows<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.280> loading<00:01:56.579> screen<00:01:56.790> sometimes

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
knows but I'm loading screen sometimes

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
knows but I'm loading screen sometimes
get<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.390> bit<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> information<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.350> tells

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
get a little bit of information it tells

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.109 
get a little bit of information it tells
you<00:01:58.710> something's<00:01:59.070> actually<00:01:59.219> quite<00:01:59.640> important

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you something's actually quite important

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
you something's actually quite important
to<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.360> game<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.250> can

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
to the game with you so you know it can

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.639 
to the game with you so you know it can
take<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> while<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.439> understand<00:02:04.439> all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
take a while to actually understand all

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.210 
take a while to actually understand all
different

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
different

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.270 
different
I<00:02:05.940> could<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.480> bit<00:02:06.720> of<00:02:07.020> paint<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.890> Eagles

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I could be a bit of paint some Eagles

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.520 
I could be a bit of paint some Eagles
i'm<00:02:08.490> going<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.030> private<00:02:09.410> newcomers<00:02:10.410> in

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
i'm going to put private newcomers in

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.970 
i'm going to put private newcomers in
that<00:02:10.830> yeah<00:02:11.960> you<00:02:12.960> mentioned<00:02:13.110> groundin<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
that yeah you mentioned groundin and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.790 
that yeah you mentioned groundin and
graphic<00:02:14.490> stuff<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.940> house<00:02:15.330> up<00:02:15.600> well<00:02:16.050> yes

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
graphic stuff is a house up well yes

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.940 
graphic stuff is a house up well yes
they're<00:02:17.580> not<00:02:17.850> quite<00:02:18.060> as<00:02:18.210> strong<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
they're not quite as strong as the

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.130 
they're not quite as strong as the
striking<00:02:19.950> element<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:21.150> just<00:02:21.360> feels<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.870> tues

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
striking element it just feels bit tues

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.040 
striking element it just feels bit tues
or<00:02:22.470> binary<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.130> mechanicals<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:24.420> as<00:02:24.540> natural

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
or binary and mechanicals not as natural

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.530 
or binary and mechanicals not as natural
as<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.590> striking<00:02:26.040> game<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.360> that's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
as the striking game so that that's

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.360 
as the striking game so that that's
probably<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.230> biggest<00:02:28.440> weakness<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
probably the biggest weakness of the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.950 
probably the biggest weakness of the
game<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.730> those<00:02:29.910> two<00:02:30.150> elements<00:02:30.300> aren't<00:02:30.780> as

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
game of those two elements aren't as

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.950 
game of those two elements aren't as
strong<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.470> they<00:02:32.460> don't<00:02:32.940> ruin<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.570> game<00:02:33.750> by

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
strong and they don't ruin the game by

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.600 
strong and they don't ruin the game by
no<00:02:34.020> means<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> would<00:02:34.950> say<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.220> they<00:02:35.550> do

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
no means and I would say that they do

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.870 
no means and I would say that they do
add<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.750> good<00:02:37.140> fit<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.410> variety<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.610> it

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
add a good fit of variety to it and it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.360 
add a good fit of variety to it and it
is<00:02:39.090> nice<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:39.590> there<00:02:40.590> are<00:02:40.709> times<00:02:40.980> where<00:02:41.190> for

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
is nice that there are times where for

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.590 
is nice that there are times where for
example<00:02:41.400> you'll<00:02:41.790> be<00:02:41.880> playing<00:02:42.120> someone

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
example you'll be playing someone

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
example you'll be playing someone
somebody<00:02:42.900> is<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.410> doing<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.310> terms<00:02:44.520> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
somebody is out doing you in terms of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.910 
somebody is out doing you in terms of
the<00:02:45.150> boxing<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.080> possible<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.590> change

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the boxing and it is possible to change

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.250 
the boxing and it is possible to change
a<00:02:47.100> fight<00:02:47.340> by<00:02:47.820> using<00:02:48.300> those<00:02:48.600> other<00:02:48.810> techniques

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
a fight by using those other techniques

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.410 
a fight by using those other techniques
and<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.070> could<00:02:50.250> beat<00:02:50.430> someone<00:02:50.850> by<00:02:51.030> submission

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
and you could beat someone by submission

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.510 
and you could beat someone by submission
but<00:02:51.870> couldn't<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.110> know<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:52.860> boxing<00:02:53.370> new

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
but couldn't you know it out boxing new

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.460 
but couldn't you know it out boxing new
so<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.540> nice<00:02:54.660> aspect<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.350> it's

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so that that's a nice aspect that it's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.680 
so that that's a nice aspect that it's
got<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.830> variety<00:02:56.459> there<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:57.330> a<00:02:57.450> shame<00:02:57.630> that

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
got a variety there it's a shame that

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.010 
got a variety there it's a shame that
the<00:02:58.130> graphic<00:02:59.130> stuff<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.610> inquires<00:03:00.150> as

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
the graphic stuff is inquires as

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.540 
the graphic stuff is inquires as
in-depth<00:03:01.560> as<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.800> could<00:03:01.980> because<00:03:02.280> that's<00:03:02.430> kind

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
in-depth as it could because that's kind

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.360 
in-depth as it could because that's kind
of<00:03:02.670> part<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.209> UFC<00:03:03.660> MMA<00:03:03.990> oh<00:03:04.140> yes<00:03:04.590> yeah<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.310> a

options are a bit limited in this which
is<00:03:21.930> just<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.290> shame<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:22.739> not<00:03:22.890> not<00:03:23.040> big<00:03:23.280> deal<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
training exercises you get points to

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.240 
training exercises you get points to
upgrade<00:03:30.360> your<00:03:30.720> character<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:32.010> training

exercise is a bit boring to be honest
they<00:03:34.200> don't<00:03:34.410> really<00:03:34.680> add<00:03:34.920> much<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.430> game

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
they don't really add much to the game

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.330 
they don't really add much to the game
is<00:03:37.019> this<00:03:37.200> nice<00:03:37.410> being<00:03:37.680> able<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.890> upgrade<00:03:38.010> your

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
is this nice being able to upgrade your

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.740 
is this nice being able to upgrade your
character<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.820> can<00:03:38.970> buy<00:03:39.120> extra<00:03:39.540> moves

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
character and you can buy extra moves

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.650 
character and you can buy extra moves
and<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.140> on<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.769> career<00:03:41.310> mode<00:03:41.430> itself<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.480> go

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and so on the career mode itself you go

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.330 
and so on the career mode itself you go
through<00:03:42.900> they<00:03:43.410> try<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.680> make<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:43.920> as<00:03:44.100> realistic

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
through they try to make it as realistic

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.920 
through they try to make it as realistic
as<00:03:44.610> possible<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.330> go<00:03:45.450> through<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
as possible and that you go through the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.320 
as possible and that you go through the
ultimate<00:03:46.410> fighter<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.700> reality<00:03:48.150> show

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
ultimate fighter like the reality show

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.990 
ultimate fighter like the reality show
that<00:03:48.510> have<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.780> real<00:03:48.959> life<00:03:49.170> and<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:50.670> progress

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
that have in real life and you progress

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.729 
that have in real life and you progress
up<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.269> rankings<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.049> yeah<00:03:52.560> there's

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
up the rankings and yeah there's

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.380 
up the rankings and yeah there's
something<00:03:53.340> satisfying<00:03:53.519> these<00:03:54.209> were

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
something satisfying these were

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.789 
something satisfying these were
progressing<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:54.989> building<00:03:55.290> your<00:03:55.320> character

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
progressing and building your character

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.600 
progressing and building your character
so<00:03:56.040> decent<00:03:56.760> modes<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:58.080> maybe<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.220> down<00:03:59.430> by

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
so decent modes if maybe that down by

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.270 
so decent modes if maybe that down by
the<00:03:59.840> boring<00:04:00.840> training<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.650> in<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> menus

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
the boring training and it in the menus

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.770 
the boring training and it in the menus
are<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.430> bit<00:04:02.549> fiddly<00:04:02.790> as<00:04:03.030> well<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.420> this<00:04:03.630> is

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
are a bit fiddly as well but this is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.660 
are a bit fiddly as well but this is
Lisa<00:04:03.989> mode<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.950> bit

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
Lisa mode a little bit

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.760 
Lisa mode a little bit
yeah<00:04:06.150> what<00:04:06.810> about<00:04:06.840> multi<00:04:07.230> place<00:04:07.380> that's<00:04:07.620> kind

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
yeah what about multi place that's kind

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.050 
yeah what about multi place that's kind
of<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.950> big<00:04:08.099> deal<00:04:08.130> from<00:04:08.400> these<00:04:08.520> kind<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.790> danger

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
of a big deal from these kind of danger

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.020 
of a big deal from these kind of danger
yeah<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> think<00:04:10.140> multiplayers<00:04:10.890> rare<00:04:11.190> UFC

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
yeah I think multiplayers rare UFC

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.020 
yeah I think multiplayers rare UFC
really<00:04:12.270> shines<00:04:12.540> actually<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:14.010> mean<00:04:14.940> I've

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
really shines actually and I mean I've

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.460 
really shines actually and I mean I've
had<00:04:15.150> some<00:04:15.390> great<00:04:15.630> matches<00:04:15.810> playing<00:04:16.290> online

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
had some great matches playing online

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.349 
had some great matches playing online
even<00:04:16.950> even<00:04:17.280> ones<00:04:17.459> I've<00:04:17.639> lost<00:04:17.880> them<00:04:18.090> I've

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
even even ones I've lost them I've

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.300 
even even ones I've lost them I've
enjoyed<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.440> said<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.010> fact<00:04:20.250> that

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
enjoyed as I said that the fact that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.069 
enjoyed as I said that the fact that
much<00:04:20.519> content<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.239> quickly<00:04:21.660> makes<00:04:21.870> them

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
much content so quickly makes them

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.900 
much content so quickly makes them
really<00:04:22.230> exciting<00:04:22.860> like<00:04:23.070> there's<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.340> retention

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
really exciting like there's a retention

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.850 
really exciting like there's a retention
their<00:04:24.270> sense<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.750> you're<00:04:24.900> always<00:04:25.590> on<00:04:25.740> the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
their sense that you're always on the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.580 
their sense that you're always on the
edge<00:04:25.889> and<00:04:27.020> because<00:04:28.020> people<00:04:28.110> play<00:04:28.530> in

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
edge and because people play in

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.860 
edge and because people play in
different<00:04:28.950> ways<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.340> have<00:04:29.460> different

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
different ways and have different

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.610 
different ways and have different
techniques<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.139> there's<00:04:31.260> quite<00:04:31.410> a<00:04:31.440> lot<00:04:31.530> of

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
techniques and there's quite a lot of

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.930 
techniques and there's quite a lot of
depth<00:04:31.830> to<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.130> system's<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:32.760> quite

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
depth to the system's it's quite

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.629 
depth to the system's it's quite
satisfying<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.990> read<00:04:34.620> some<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.250> his<00:04:35.460> hatch

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
satisfying to read some of his hatch

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.850 
satisfying to read some of his hatch
patterns<00:04:36.120> like<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.870> read<00:04:37.470> what<00:04:37.500> they're

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
patterns like you read what they're

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.580 
patterns like you read what they're
going<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.070> do<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.400> if<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.520> managed<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.060> block

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
going to do and if you managed to block

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.900 
going to do and if you managed to block
attacks<00:04:40.590> because<00:04:40.950> we<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.310> kind<00:04:41.460> of<00:04:41.580> see<00:04:41.729> when

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
attacks because we can kind of see when

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.670 
attacks because we can kind of see when
again<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:42.450> not<00:04:42.750> come<00:04:42.960> out<00:04:43.050> with<00:04:43.290> good<00:04:43.410> poems

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
again and not come out with good poems

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.670 
again and not come out with good poems
like<00:04:43.950> incredibly<00:04:44.940> rewarding<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:46.320> think<00:04:46.530> all

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
like incredibly rewarding so think all

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.590 
like incredibly rewarding so think all
the<00:04:47.070> things<00:04:47.520> are<00:04:47.700> good<00:04:47.910> about<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.270> actually

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
the things are good about you actually

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.210 
the things are good about you actually
really<00:04:48.870> comes<00:04:49.080> before<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.680> multiset

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
really comes before and the multiset

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.490 
really comes before and the multiset
those<00:04:50.580> are<00:04:50.729> probably<00:04:51.180> strongest<00:04:51.990> aspect<00:04:52.350> of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
those are probably strongest aspect of

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.710 
those are probably strongest aspect of
the<00:04:52.620> game<00:04:52.650> actually<00:04:52.950> yeah<00:04:53.639> one<00:04:54.419> last<00:04:54.540> question

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
the game actually yeah one last question

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.170 
the game actually yeah one last question
would<00:04:55.229> disappear<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> non<00:04:56.010> who<00:04:56.190> isn't<00:04:56.940> into

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
would disappear to a non who isn't into

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.760 
would disappear to a non who isn't into
UFC<00:04:57.419> or<00:04:57.570> is<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:57.780> kind<00:04:57.960> of<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.350> hardcore

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
myself though and it's probably maybe a

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.670 
myself though and it's probably maybe a
little<00:05:12.479> bit<00:05:12.660> more<00:05:12.780> interested<00:05:13.289> in<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.440> sport

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
little bit more interested in the sport
