phantom<00:00:06.920> with<00:00:07.730> some<00:00:08.000> water<00:00:09.309> floaties<00:00:10.449> I've

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:11.449 
phantom with some water floaties I've

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.109 
phantom with some water floaties I've
been<00:00:11.809> searching<00:00:12.289> on<00:00:12.409> YouTube<00:00:13.400> for<00:00:14.029> a<00:00:14.059> while

been searching on YouTube for a while

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.060 
been searching on YouTube for a while
researching<00:00:14.869> trying<00:00:15.199> to<00:00:15.409> find<00:00:15.619> out<00:00:15.769> what

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
researching trying to find out what

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.130 
researching trying to find out what
still<00:00:16.219> was<00:00:16.339> the<00:00:16.519> thing<00:00:17.029> that's<00:00:17.359> gonna<00:00:18.050> make

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
still was the thing that's gonna make

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.130 
still was the thing that's gonna make
your<00:00:19.119> phantom<00:00:20.119> float<00:00:20.390> just<00:00:20.630> in<00:00:20.779> case<00:00:20.960> it

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
your phantom float just in case it

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.739 
your phantom float just in case it
crashes<00:00:21.500> in<00:00:21.619> the<00:00:21.650> water<00:00:21.890> so<00:00:22.849> I<00:00:22.880> figured<00:00:23.480> okay

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:23.749 
crashes in the water so I figured okay

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:25.239 
crashes in the water so I figured okay
couldn't<00:00:24.259> find<00:00:24.439> it<00:00:24.589> I<00:00:24.710> got<00:00:24.859> to<00:00:24.949> figure<00:00:25.189> stuff

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:25.249 
couldn't find it I got to figure stuff

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:27.790 
couldn't find it I got to figure stuff
about<00:00:25.550> myself<00:00:25.759> so<00:00:26.119> what<00:00:26.210> I<00:00:26.269> did<00:00:26.359> here<00:00:26.769> see<00:00:27.769> I

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
about myself so what I did here see I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.220 
about myself so what I did here see I
added<00:00:28.070> an<00:00:28.400> extension<00:00:29.179> it's<00:00:29.900> the<00:00:29.990> velcro

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
added an extension it's the velcro

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.529 
added an extension it's the velcro
extension<00:00:30.859> so<00:00:30.980> that<00:00:31.130> way<00:00:31.279> you<00:00:31.999> can<00:00:32.239> go<00:00:32.449> ahead

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
extension so that way you can go ahead

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:38.349 
extension so that way you can go ahead
and<00:00:32.780> move<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:32.989> around<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:36.309> adjust<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.879> camera

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
and move it around and adjust the camera

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:44.920 
and move it around and adjust the camera
so<00:00:39.020> you<00:00:39.489> won't<00:00:40.489> have<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.739> landing<00:00:43.930> platform

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
so you won't have the landing platform

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.939 
so you won't have the landing platform
or<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.590> floaties<00:00:46.160> in<00:00:46.399> your<00:00:46.579> shot<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:47.949> we're

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
or the floaties in your shot so we're

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.950 
or the floaties in your shot so we're
gonna<00:00:49.039> go<00:00:49.219> ahead<00:00:49.420> I'm<00:00:50.420> gonna<00:00:50.539> go<00:00:50.660> ahead<00:00:50.780> and

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
gonna go ahead I'm gonna go ahead and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.810 
gonna go ahead I'm gonna go ahead and
test<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:51.410> out<00:00:51.530> I<00:00:51.910> would<00:00:52.910> say<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.120> know<00:00:54.670> go<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.730> a

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
test it out I would say you know go to a

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.759 
test it out I would say you know go to a
lake<00:00:56.090> don't<00:00:56.420> go<00:00:56.539> on<00:00:56.690> my<00:00:56.809> ocean<00:00:57.230> water<00:00:57.469> cuz<00:00:57.679> in

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
lake don't go on my ocean water cuz in

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.979 
lake don't go on my ocean water cuz in
salt<00:00:57.980> water<00:00:58.010> can<00:00:58.339> damage<00:00:58.730> it<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.750> my

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
salt water can damage it so this is my

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.099 
salt water can damage it so this is my
first<00:01:00.289> test<00:01:00.530> of<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.579> floaties

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
first test of the floaties

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.340 
first test of the floaties
I've<00:01:04.010> tested<00:01:04.820> it<00:01:05.090> out<00:01:05.240> first<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:05.810> my<00:01:06.050> kitchen

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
I've tested it out first in my kitchen

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.130 
I've tested it out first in my kitchen
sink<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.340> when<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:10.850> had<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.360> had<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.780> floaties

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
sink and when I had I had the floaties

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140 
sink and when I had I had the floaties
on<00:01:12.350> here<00:01:12.620> on<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:12.800> platform<00:01:13.280> at<00:01:13.550> first<00:01:13.820> like

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
on here on the platform at first like

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.880 
on here on the platform at first like
you<00:01:14.300> see<00:01:14.480> on<00:01:14.600> other<00:01:14.750> videos<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:15.680> kept

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
you see on other videos and I just kept

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.440 
you see on other videos and I just kept
tilting<00:01:16.370> all<00:01:16.910> these<00:01:17.060> different<00:01:17.360> directions

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
tilting all these different directions

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
tilting all these different directions
and<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:20.390> know<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:20.930> wasn't<00:01:21.170> gonna<00:01:21.260> work

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
and was you know that wasn't gonna work

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.790 
and was you know that wasn't gonna work
so<00:01:22.010> I<00:01:22.040> had<00:01:22.250> to<00:01:22.370> read<00:01:23.320> change<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.470> up<00:01:24.590> a<00:01:24.680> little

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
so I had to read change it up a little

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.160 
so I had to read change it up a little
bit<00:01:25.100> grab<00:01:25.820> some<00:01:26.030> clothes<00:01:26.540> hang<00:01:26.780> glider

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
bit grab some clothes hang glider

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.530 
bit grab some clothes hang glider
clothes<00:01:27.500> hanger<00:01:27.800> shaped<00:01:28.730> it<00:01:28.910> how<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:29.060> wanted<00:01:29.420> it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
clothes hanger shaped it how I wanted it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.750 
clothes hanger shaped it how I wanted it
so<00:01:29.720> these<00:01:29.840> will<00:01:30.080> stick<00:01:30.290> out<00:01:30.410> more<00:01:30.620> so<00:01:30.950> it'll

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
so these will stick out more so it'll

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.090 
so these will stick out more so it'll
prevent<00:01:32.090> it<00:01:32.240> from<00:01:32.270> tipping<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:33.170> propeller

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
prevent it from tipping and propeller

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.680 
prevent it from tipping and propeller
from<00:01:34.250> get<00:01:34.460> away<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.000> let's<00:01:35.150> go<00:01:35.210> ahead<00:01:35.300> and<00:01:35.510> see

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
from get away so let's go ahead and see

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.140 
from get away so let's go ahead and see
if<00:01:35.720> this<00:01:36.140> don't<00:01:36.350> work<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:37.550> hit<00:01:37.700> record<00:01:37.820> on<00:01:38.090> a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
if this don't work and hit record on a

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.210 
if this don't work and hit record on a
camera<00:01:38.390> now<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.350> could<00:01:39.500> also<00:01:39.620> get<00:01:39.800> underwater

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
camera now you could also get underwater

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.460 
camera now you could also get underwater
footage<00:01:40.430> by<00:01:40.760> doing<00:01:41.750> this<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.050> I'm<00:01:42.110> also<00:01:42.260> gonna

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
footage by doing this and I'm also gonna

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.890 
footage by doing this and I'm also gonna
see<00:01:42.650> if<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.830> can<00:01:42.980> make<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.390> run<00:01:44.390> like<00:01:44.570> a<00:01:44.600> boat

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
see if I can make it run like a boat

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:57.960 
see if I can make it run like a boat
before<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.320> take<00:01:45.620> off<00:01:45.800> this<00:01:46.640> is<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.820> first<00:01:47.090> test

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:06.250 

let's<00:01:58.970> go<00:01:59.150> throw<00:01:59.390> dinner<00:02:04.810> it's<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.990> little

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
let's go throw dinner it's a little

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:21.199 
let's go throw dinner it's a little
windy<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:09.700> doesn't<00:02:10.700> really<00:02:10.820> want<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.120> tip

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:29.339 

got<00:02:22.209> a<00:02:22.240> cut<00:02:22.480> mud<00:02:23.080> there<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.750> definitely<00:02:28.959> works

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
got a cut mud there it definitely works

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.870 
got a cut mud there it definitely works
like<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> boat<00:02:33.510> slightly<00:02:35.370> lightly<00:02:36.370> glide

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
like a boat slightly lightly glide

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.290 
like a boat slightly lightly glide
across<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.330> water<00:02:38.580> seal<00:02:39.580> maybe<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:39.910> can<00:02:40.120> find

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
across the water seal maybe I can find

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.840 
across the water seal maybe I can find
some<00:02:40.480> fish<00:02:40.720> down<00:02:40.959> there<00:02:42.900> well<00:02:44.160> turn<00:02:45.160> around<00:02:45.190> do

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
some fish down there well turn around do

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.030 
some fish down there well turn around do
a<00:02:45.880> 360<00:02:46.510> shot<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:46.989> water<00:02:47.230> we're<00:02:47.709> recording

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
a 360 shot in the water we're recording

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.910 
a 360 shot in the water we're recording
as<00:02:48.370> well
