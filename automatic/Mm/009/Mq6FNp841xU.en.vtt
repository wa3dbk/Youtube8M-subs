00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the painting process down into stages

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.139 
the painting process down into stages
the<00:00:36.420> first<00:00:36.450> stage<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.379> called<00:00:38.149> composition

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the first stage is called composition

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.360 
the first stage is called composition
and<00:00:39.770> I<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:40.949> use<00:00:41.160> charcoal<00:00:42.199> it<00:00:43.199> is<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.039> dress

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and I will use charcoal it is a dress

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
and I will use charcoal it is a dress
rehearsal<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> eventually<00:00:46.440> I'll

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
rehearsal really and eventually I'll

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.470

wipe<00:00:46.829> off<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.340> charcoal<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.090> helps<00:00:48.359> me

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
wipe off the charcoal but it helps me

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.029 
wipe off the charcoal but it helps me
establish<00:00:48.809> rhythm<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.300> scale<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:53.120> values<00:00:54.120> so

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
establish rhythm and scale and values so

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
establish rhythm and scale and values so
I'm<00:00:56.039> looking<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.579> gesture<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.149> rhythm<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
I'm looking for gesture and rhythm and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.520 
I'm looking for gesture and rhythm and
now<00:00:58.500> you'll<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.879> end<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
now you'll see the the end of the

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.290 
now you'll see the the end of the
composition<00:01:01.530> stage<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.940> fit

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
composition stage where I can fit

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
composition stage where I can fit
everything<00:01:03.570> on<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> canvas<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.949> wiped<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
everything on to the canvas I wiped the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.719 
everything on to the canvas I wiped the
canvas<00:01:06.210> off<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> move<00:01:07.650> into<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.430> stage

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
canvas off and now I move into the stage

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
canvas off and now I move into the stage
called<00:01:09.030> construction<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:10.049> making<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
called construction I'm making a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.020 
called construction I'm making a
commitment<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.280> working<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.700> oils

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
commitment because I'm working in oils

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450 
commitment because I'm working in oils
now<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.170> pretty<00:01:13.530> much<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> same<00:01:13.979> thing

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
now but I do pretty much the same thing

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.960 
now but I do pretty much the same thing
that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> did<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> charcoal<00:01:16.970> rhythmic

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that I did in with the charcoal rhythmic

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
that I did in with the charcoal rhythmic
lines<00:01:18.500> lines<00:01:19.500> indicating<00:01:20.250> separation<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
lines lines indicating separation of

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.280 
lines lines indicating separation of
values<00:01:22.100> then<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.509> terms<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.930> color

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
values then I think in terms of color

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.880 
values then I think in terms of color
and<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.970> exploratory<00:01:27.840> still<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> put<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and it's exploratory still so I put the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.039 
and it's exploratory still so I put the
color<00:01:29.100> down<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.670> scumbling<00:01:30.240> fashion

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
color down in a scumbling fashion

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.260 
color down in a scumbling fashion
I<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.130> apples<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:34.020> color<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
I don't think apples I think color I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.960 
I don't think apples I think color I
start<00:01:36.270> with<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> darks<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:37.670> leave<00:01:38.670> everything

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
start with the darks I leave everything

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.130 
start with the darks I leave everything
this<00:01:39.240> light<00:01:39.570> open

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this light open

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.289 
this light open
I'll<00:01:40.799> let<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> canvas<00:01:41.520> come<00:01:41.700> through<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
I'll let the canvas come through for the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.719 
I'll let the canvas come through for the
light<00:01:42.540> areas<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> you'll<00:01:44.040> notice<00:01:44.280> how<00:01:44.549> its

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
light areas and you'll notice how its

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.840 
light areas and you'll notice how its
layered<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.960> layers<00:01:46.500> abstract<00:01:47.189> layers<00:01:47.490> of

color very subtle color trying to
establish<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.750> tonality<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.369> room<00:01:53.960> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
establish the tonality of the room and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
establish the tonality of the room and
you'll<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.240> here<00:01:57.570> what<00:01:57.780> the<00:02:00.020> underpinning

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you'll see here what the underpinning

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.830 
you'll see here what the underpinning
looks<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.820> just<00:02:02.820> before<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> go<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
looks like just before I go on to the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.039 
looks like just before I go on to the
next<00:02:04.049> stage<00:02:04.490> which<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.520> called

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
next stage which is called

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.760 
next stage which is called
reconstruction<00:02:07.049> because<00:02:07.320> I'll<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.740> using

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
reconstruction because I'll be using

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.840 
reconstruction because I'll be using
line<00:02:08.310> once<00:02:08.760> again

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
line once again

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.810 
line once again
but<00:02:10.570> this<00:02:10.720> time<00:02:11.020> the<00:02:11.170> line<00:02:11.350> is<00:02:11.590> very<00:02:11.890> dark<00:02:12.250> it

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
but this time the line is very dark it

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.810 
but this time the line is very dark it
undoes<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.630> underpainting<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.640> pushes<00:02:15.640> me

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
undoes the underpainting and pushes me

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.340 
undoes the underpainting and pushes me
into<00:02:16.780> color<00:02:17.050> again<00:02:18.600> pushes<00:02:19.600> me<00:02:19.780> into<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> last

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
into color again pushes me into the last

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:31.440 
into color again pushes me into the last
stage<00:02:20.650> which<00:02:20.980> is<00:02:21.010> called<00:02:21.220> painting<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:31.270> now

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
stage which is called painting so now

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.620 
stage which is called painting so now
when<00:02:31.660> we<00:02:31.900> paint<00:02:32.820> we're<00:02:33.820> looking<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.390> color

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
when we paint we're looking for color

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.010 
when we paint we're looking for color
but<00:02:35.530> instead<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.070> scumbling<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:37.240> released<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
but instead of scumbling we released the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.490 
but instead of scumbling we released the
color<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.470> put<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:38.920> stroke<00:02:39.280> on<00:02:39.580> at<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.820> time

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
color we put one stroke on at a time

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.100 
color we put one stroke on at a time
enjoying<00:02:41.500> our<00:02:41.800> vision<00:02:42.250> looking<00:02:43.240> for<00:02:43.510> nuances

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
enjoying our vision looking for nuances

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.930 
enjoying our vision looking for nuances
and<00:02:44.260> subtleties<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.800> color<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:47.460> work<00:02:48.460> from<00:02:48.670> dark

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and subtleties of color I work from dark

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.130 
and subtleties of color I work from dark
to<00:02:49.030> light<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:50.160> eventually<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.600> paint<00:02:52.600> into<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
to light and eventually I paint into the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.050 
to light and eventually I paint into the
lights<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:54.900> that's<00:02:55.900> about<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.790> so<00:02:57.790> there's<00:02:57.970> a

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
lights and that's about it so there's a

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.790 
lights and that's about it so there's a
little<00:02:58.360> pain<00:02:59.250> broken<00:03:00.250> down<00:03:00.400> into<00:03:00.610> stages<00:03:01.800> it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
little pain broken down into stages it's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.100 
little pain broken down into stages it's
not<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.250> difficult

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110
