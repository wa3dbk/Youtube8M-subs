00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
potential is well I think I need to

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.790 
potential is well I think I need to
improve<00:02:52.390> more<00:02:52.660> my<00:02:52.810> ball<00:02:53.020> handling<00:02:53.290> them<00:02:53.680> all

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800

around<00:02:53.980> play<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.640> think<00:02:54.910> vastly<00:02:55.630> I<00:02:55.720> need<00:02:55.870> to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
around play but I think vastly I need to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.960 
around play but I think vastly I need to
prove<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:56.230> my<00:02:56.320> ball<00:02:56.560> hand<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.820> keep
