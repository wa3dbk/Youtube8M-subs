just saves everything so you can't

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.060 
just saves everything so you can't
really<00:02:42.120> beat<00:02:42.420> him<00:02:42.540> but<00:02:42.740> 3,900<00:02:43.740> coins<00:02:43.980> that's

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
really beat him but 3,900 coins that's

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.310 
really beat him but 3,900 coins that's
just<00:02:44.310> because<00:02:44.430> he<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:44.730> originally<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.959> left

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
just because he was originally a left

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.290 
just because he was originally a left
wing<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> left<00:02:47.640> mid<00:02:47.880> version

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
wing and this is a left mid version

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.240 
wing and this is a left mid version
obviously<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.959> his<00:02:49.140> price<00:02:49.410> has<00:02:49.650> gone<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:50.040> in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
obviously so his price has gone up in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.280 
obviously so his price has gone up in
that<00:02:50.459> sense<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.080> want<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
that sense but you know if you want to

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.229

eventually but obviously we'll just
close<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.200> out<00:04:37.380> now<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.680> get<00:04:37.800> onto<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.130> goal
