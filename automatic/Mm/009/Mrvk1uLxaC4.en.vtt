the following communication yeah and we
brought<00:00:29.310> our<00:00:29.460> own<00:00:29.670> wheel<00:00:29.939> once<00:00:30.330> again<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
brought our own wheel once again a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.920 
brought our own wheel once again a
fanatic<00:00:31.529> gt2<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.309> land<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.820> why<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.809> I'm

make the best game experience than the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.970 
make the best game experience than the
world<00:00:56.149> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> stuff<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:58.320> understand

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
world kind of stuff I don't understand

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.720 
world kind of stuff I don't understand
that<00:00:59.219> I<00:01:00.890> hope<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.039> say<00:01:02.219> something

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that I hope you say something

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.509 
that I hope you say something
interesting<00:01:03.090> about<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> physics<00:01:04.170> engine

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
interesting about the physics engine

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.800 
interesting about the physics engine
well<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> lot<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.880> refinements<00:01:06.510> really<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
well it's a lot of refinements really a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.179 
well it's a lot of refinements really a
physics<00:01:07.229> engine<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.650> something<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.040> could

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
physics engine is something you could

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.340 
physics engine is something you could
consider<00:01:08.400> never<00:01:08.850> complete<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.930> something

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
consider never complete it's something

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.899 
consider never complete it's something
that<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.530> continue<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.280> build<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.670> it's

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that you continue to build on it's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.640 
that you continue to build on it's
something<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> refine<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.320> something

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
something that you refine it's something

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.620 
something that you refine it's something
you<00:01:13.710> progress<00:01:14.070> certainly<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> build<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you progress certainly you build it as a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.830 
you progress certainly you build it as a
core<00:01:16.020> building<00:01:16.680> block<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.100> continue<00:01:17.520> to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
core building block you continue to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
core building block you continue to
improve<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.080> experience<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.950> certainly

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
improve the experience and certainly

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
improve the experience and certainly
improve<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> ability<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.390> player<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
improve the ability for the player to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.469 
improve the ability for the player to
fine-tune<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.159> physics<00:01:23.610> model<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.299> their

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
fine-tune the physics model to their

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
fine-tune the physics model to their
preference<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> very

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
preference because it is a very

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
preference because it is a very
subjective<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.759> build<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.060> physics

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
subjective thing to build a physics

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.170 
subjective thing to build a physics
model<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.320> person<00:01:28.799> or<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> group<00:01:29.579> of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
model it's one person or a group of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.179 
model it's one person or a group of
peoples<00:01:30.509> consensus<00:01:31.170> about<00:01:31.320> how<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.619> car<00:01:31.920> feels

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
peoples consensus about how a car feels

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
peoples consensus about how a car feels
on<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> track<00:01:32.729> now<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> force<00:01:34.140> feedback

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
on a track now on the force feedback

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.260 
on a track now on the force feedback
there's<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.070> whole<00:01:35.250> world<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.850> ready<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there's the whole world was ready for

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.300 
there's the whole world was ready for
the<00:01:36.329> wheel<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.500> had<00:01:37.950> some<00:01:38.189> good

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the wheel so we actually had some good

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.410 
the wheel so we actually had some good
effects<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> could<00:01:38.880> feel<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.329> was

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
effects you could feel that it was

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.210 
effects you could feel that it was
working<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.439> seem<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.070> reverse

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
working but we seem to have the reverse

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.730 
working but we seem to have the reverse
effects

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740
