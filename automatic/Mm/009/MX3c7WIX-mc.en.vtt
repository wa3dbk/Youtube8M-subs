00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 Roof of the tower 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.610
 I continue to work 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.730

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.320
 find it true but Dom addressed 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.410

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.800
 willing and agreeing, however, to stand under the standing bin 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.880
 on the 08 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.619
 For three years, the largest operator in Vienna 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.390
 Protective clothing rarely needs its people are peacefully know that well 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.389
 that is from professionals 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.480
 with the height I got myself Minister of Interior of the heir to the throne Kubica 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.310
 his that is 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.670
 Winsen 43 4 40 meters will not be a problem for the bees and generally 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.250
 the mine are looking for their costume from to nectar in Poland 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.490
 Radius of three kilometers so they expect one way 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.790
 Blumenfeld he necessarily dirt from the hive 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.730
 in the vicinity of three children Vienna collect then if one 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.090
 Tracht have found one with the source 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.400
 then they just show their concerns or spree waltz dancing trophies there

 is there something? 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.860
 and that's as possible here as it is 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 on the edge of a field 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:13.859
 In the big city they do not live where I stayed and pro also 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:14.759
 waterproof 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.909
 and more and more often in prominent locations such as the House of 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.909
 World in Berlin 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.659
 like those of unusual locations that's also the idea of ​​a new one 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.099
 Initiative in the 70th 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.449

 flying fore tank in the cev cup Tail of the honey bees transporting the Geneva people 

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.129
 the topics 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.610
 in the worst case, for example, in Berlin 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:43.609
 almost all wild bee species 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:46.889
 other species than the honey bee 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.560
 she's only part of this 3d data and everyone's leaps in results 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:56.479
 because every flight to premiere-training 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.489
 the three boxes so-called many projects will be at the new location 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.709
 privy 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.859
 In the city many of the 500 hobby beekeepers in Belgium appreciate the 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.859
 advantages 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.249
 it is 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:16.279
 Jan Berges whole whole series factors only the city the country safer 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.589
 superior eleven 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:22.010
 For one thing, having a lot of plants in their much larger plants means a lot 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.469
 It is more varied for the bees in the city, it is about two 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:30.219
 up to three degrees warmer - start we do not have the problem with 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:34.909
 Plant protection products or the modified organisms and others 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.919
 Reason is in the windy kW in the city their bees can keep their honey 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.689
 to sell on the better than they have to explore from the countryside 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.619
 also to change 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:48.809
 London in the city center 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:53.319

 the set and, of course, those of the Bauhaus style may be inserted, and so is ours 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.289
 the bullish is a tribute to the Bauhaus street says Romanus was counted 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.809
 it 

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:36.249
 The 32-year-old Londoner Kurt has been doing the trick for three years 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.349
 Protective suit though that assures that its bees are peaceful 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.350
 until 19 o'clock as well as Issuer the hobby is harmless if one a protective suit 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.080

 Harald Meller very like Stone 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.770
 from London to the castle 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.909
 at will 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.080
 back to a prominent location

 The Bellevue Palace is the seat of the German Federal President 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:18.270
 because here in the castle park Frank Hinrichs has the keeper of the cathedral six 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.629
 other bee colonies since 2007 already 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:23.520
