an<00:00:06.720> apricot<00:00:07.080> gem<00:00:07.560> I've<00:00:08.130> taken<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.670> four

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
an apricot gem I've taken about four

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.509 
an apricot gem I've taken about four
tablespoons<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.840> put<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:10.349> bowl<00:00:10.559> I've

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
tablespoons and put it into a bowl I've

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.430 
tablespoons and put it into a bowl I've
just<00:00:11.910> microwaved<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.259> nice

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
just microwaved that so I know it's nice

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
just microwaved that so I know it's nice
and<00:00:13.620> warm<00:00:13.880> and<00:00:14.880> what<00:00:15.030> I've<00:00:15.150> also<00:00:15.330> done<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.960> I've

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and warm and what I've also done is I've

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.800 
and warm and what I've also done is I've
added<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.770> teaspoon<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.699> water<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.359> just

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
added a teaspoon of water to this just

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
added a teaspoon of water to this just
to<00:00:18.900> pin<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> down<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> little<00:00:19.859> bit<00:00:20.010> more<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.580> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
to pin it down a little bit more so that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.349 
to pin it down a little bit more so that
it<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.619> workable<00:00:22.820> when<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> microwave

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it could be workable when you microwave

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.810 
it could be workable when you microwave
this<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.869> makes<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.710> workable<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
this it makes it pretty workable but you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.900 
this it makes it pretty workable but you
wanted<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.660> bit<00:00:27.990> thinner<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.849> I'm

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
wanted a little bit thinner and what I'm

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.310 
wanted a little bit thinner and what I'm
gonna<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.449> gonna<00:00:30.689> simply<00:00:30.990> pour

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
gonna do is I'm just gonna simply pour

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.139 
gonna do is I'm just gonna simply pour
it<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.650> strainer<00:00:33.110> just<00:00:34.110> like<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
it into a strainer just like that and

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.950 
it into a strainer just like that and
then<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.809> going<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.320> strain<00:00:37.770> out

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
then we're just going to strain out

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.869 
then we're just going to strain out
everything<00:00:39.960> except<00:00:40.680> all<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> little<00:00:41.340> biddies

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
everything except all the little biddies

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.560 
everything except all the little biddies
that<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> actual<00:00:43.200> jam<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.570> then

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that are in the actual jam and then

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.110 
that are in the actual jam and then
later<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:46.219> when<00:00:47.219> you're<00:00:47.340> making<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> fruit<00:00:47.910> tart

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
later on when you're making a fruit tart

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.920 
later on when you're making a fruit tart
you<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.500> heat<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> back<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.280> again<00:00:50.399> and

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
you can just heat this back up again and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
you can just heat this back up again and
you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.079> use<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> pastry<00:00:52.500> brush<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you can use a pastry brush and you can

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:05.819 
you can use a pastry brush and you can
put<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:55.309> your<00:00:56.780> fruit

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.840 

and<00:01:06.829> so<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:07.159> want<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.369> do<00:01:07.490> is<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:07.700> just

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
and so what you want to do is you just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.410 
and so what you want to do is you just
want<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.170> work<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:11.000> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.240> see

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
want to work this in and you can see

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.200 
want to work this in and you can see
that<00:01:11.539> you're<00:01:11.689> left<00:01:11.899> over<00:01:12.049> with<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.409> lot<00:01:13.180> what<00:01:14.180> I

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
that you're left over with a lot what I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.410 
that you're left over with a lot what I
will<00:01:14.450> do<00:01:14.659> is<00:01:14.810> microwave<00:01:15.259> this<00:01:15.470> again<00:01:15.770> and<00:01:16.420> then

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
will do is microwave this again and then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.010 
will do is microwave this again and then
I'll<00:01:18.409> run<00:01:18.619> it<00:01:18.740> through<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.009> sieve<00:01:19.220> again<00:01:20.020> so

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
I'll run it through the sieve again so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.429 
I'll run it through the sieve again so
they<00:01:21.110> can<00:01:21.259> get<00:01:21.380> some<00:01:21.649> more<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.880> actual<00:01:23.439> jam

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
they can get some more of the actual jam

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.010 
they can get some more of the actual jam
out<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.860> there<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.579> what<00:01:26.479> can<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.689> do<00:01:26.869> with

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
out of there and what can you do with

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.389 
out of there and what can you do with
this<00:01:27.110> leftover<00:01:27.500> stuff<00:01:27.860> well<00:01:28.069> you<00:01:28.159> could<00:01:28.280> put

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
this leftover stuff well you could put

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.830 
this leftover stuff well you could put
that<00:01:28.520> on<00:01:28.579> toast<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.420> you're<00:01:29.509> gonna<00:01:29.600> have<00:01:29.780> a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
that on toast and you're gonna have a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.300 
that on toast and you're gonna have a
nice<00:01:30.460> concentrated<00:01:31.460> little<00:01:32.090> apricot

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310
