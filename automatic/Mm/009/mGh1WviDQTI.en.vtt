have for you today is challenge number
eight<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.690> let's<00:00:13.620> see<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.160> thing<00:00:14.610> does

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
eight and let's see what this thing does

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.340 
eight and let's see what this thing does
so<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.660> 3x3<00:00:18.660> door<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so as you can see it is 3x3 door with a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.330 
so as you can see it is 3x3 door with a
lamp<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> middle<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:21.210> double<00:00:21.570> sided

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
lamp in the middle and it's double sided

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
lamp in the middle and it's double sided
because<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.730> didn't<00:00:24.000> wanted<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.359> show<00:00:24.689> any<00:00:24.960> ugly

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
because I didn't wanted to show any ugly

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.939 
because I didn't wanted to show any ugly
redstone<00:00:26.460> blocks<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.650> is

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
redstone blocks on it and it is

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.240 
redstone blocks on it and it is
extremely<00:00:29.730> compact<00:00:30.449> as<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
extremely compact as you can see here

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
extremely compact as you can see here
and<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> little<00:00:33.510> problem<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and it has a little problem with the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
and it has a little problem with the
animation<00:00:34.680> on<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.219> side<00:00:35.489> as<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.450> see

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
animation on this side as you can see

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.240 
animation on this side as you can see
when<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.140> when<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> closes<00:00:37.890> because

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
when it's and when it closes because

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
when it's and when it closes because
when<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> opens<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.270> fine<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.020> down<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
when it opens it's fine and down here I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.150 
when it opens it's fine and down here I
use<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.940> same<00:00:42.270> system<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.050> TT<00:00:43.739> Leno's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
use it the same system as TT Leno's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.510 
use it the same system as TT Leno's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
ok so this is the Redstone for it it's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.670 
ok so this is the Redstone for it it's
just<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:02.250> wide<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.850> has<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:04.019> same<00:01:04.229> size<00:01:04.470> as

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just too wide and has the same size as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
just too wide and has the same size as
that<00:01:04.710> beast<00:01:05.010> only<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> minimum

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that beast only out so it has a minimum

that beast only out so it has a minimum
size<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.740> guys<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.790> what's<00:01:09.299> your

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
size really guys so what's your

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.740 
size really guys so what's your
challenge<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:11.189> only<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.970> problem<00:01:12.570> with

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
challenge I see only one problem with

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.630 
challenge I see only one problem with
this<00:01:12.930> besides<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.740> animation<00:01:14.220> by<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.460> way<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this besides the animation by the way I

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
this besides the animation by the way I
try<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> fix<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.229> little

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
try to fix this this is a little

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.910 
try to fix this this is a little
modified<00:01:17.070> design<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.180> side<00:01:18.680> it<00:01:19.680> opens

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
modified design on this side it opens

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.090 
modified design on this side it opens
the<00:01:20.310> same<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.750> closes<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.560> those<00:01:22.860> two

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the same but it closes with those two

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
the same but it closes with those two
pieces<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.490> synchronizer<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.509> see

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
pieces on synchronizer as you can see

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
pieces on synchronizer as you can see
there<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.580> better

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
there which is a little bit better

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.080 
there which is a little bit better
alright<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.009> problem<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.850> here

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
alright so the problem I see here

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
alright so the problem I see here
besides<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> animation<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
besides the animation is this when the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.940 
besides the animation is this when the
door<00:01:32.850> opens<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:37.200> don't<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
door opens it is and I don't like it I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.670 
door opens it is and I don't like it I
really<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:39.000> like<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.170> all<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
really would like it to be on all the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.550 
really would like it to be on all the
time<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.909> challenge<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.930> 3x3

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
time so your challenge is to make a 3x3

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.289 
time so your challenge is to make a 3x3
door<00:01:43.799> with<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> lamp<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> middle<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.939> is

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
door with the lamp in the middle that is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.800 
door with the lamp in the middle that is
always<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:46.939> let<00:01:47.939> me<00:01:47.970> point<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.509> some

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
always on let me point out some

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.160 
always on let me point out some
restrictions<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> some<00:01:50.540> degrees<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.570> freedom

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
restrictions and some degrees of freedom

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.630 
restrictions and some degrees of freedom
I<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.500> know<00:01:52.850> first<00:01:54.049> when<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> made<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.619> one

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
I don't know first when I made this one

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.899 
I don't know first when I made this one
I<00:01:56.700> saw<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.630> very<00:01:58.200> ugly<00:01:58.500> beast<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.640> here

will power you don't need to make it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
will power you don't need to make it
double<00:02:48.450> sided<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.650> will<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:49.980> show<00:02:50.160> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
