00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
ones we're focusing on today are
yamimash<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.130> markiplier<00:01:11.729> because<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> lot<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
yamimash and markiplier because a lot of

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.000 
yamimash and markiplier because a lot of
people<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.630> been<00:01:12.689> requesting<00:01:13.049> markiplier

people have been requesting markiplier
so<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.250> figured<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> good<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so I figured this would be a good way to

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.210 
so I figured this would be a good way to
incorporate<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:16.229> into<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> video<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.100> now

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
incorporate them into the video so now

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.109 
incorporate them into the video so now
that<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.430> know<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> game<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.970> about

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

you lose the monsters basically shove

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.850
