so<00:00:10.500> Rupp<00:00:10.710> when<00:00:11.010> we're<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.519> camera

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
so Rupp when we're in the camera

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.690 
so Rupp when we're in the camera
settings<00:00:12.139> normally<00:00:13.139> I'm<00:00:13.349> more<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.950> 1080<00:00:14.460> guy

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
settings normally I'm more of a 1080 guy

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.490 
settings normally I'm more of a 1080 guy
and<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.480> lot<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.780> options<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.170> frame

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and I have a lot of options for frame

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
and I have a lot of options for frame
right<00:00:16.650> it's<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.859> varies<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.580> camera<00:00:18.029> but<00:00:18.570> in

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
right it's it varies by camera but in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.650 
right it's it varies by camera but in
this<00:00:18.990> particular<00:00:19.470> case<00:00:19.770> if<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.520> want<00:00:20.699> 60<00:00:21.240> P<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
this particular case if I want 60 P I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.960 
this particular case if I want 60 P I
have<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.529> back<00:00:22.680> down<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.920> 720<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
have to go back down to 720 is that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.210 
have to go back down to 720 is that
problematic<00:00:24.660> why<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.230> no<00:00:25.680> not<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.070> I

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
problematic why is that no not really I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.679 
problematic why is that no not really I
mean<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> thing<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.970> rich<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.390> that

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
mean the thing about it rich is that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
mean the thing about it rich is that
almost<00:00:28.019> every<00:00:28.560> DSLR<00:00:29.039> camera<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
almost every DSLR camera is not going to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.020 
almost every DSLR camera is not going to
actually<00:00:30.090> offer<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> 1080p<00:00:31.579> 60<00:00:32.579> mode<00:00:32.730> well

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
actually offer you a 1080p 60 mode well

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
actually offer you a 1080p 60 mode well
and<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.270> say<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.780> yet<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:35.040> sure<00:00:35.219> that

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
and I say as of yet really I'm sure that

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
and I say as of yet really I'm sure that
will<00:00:35.520> probably<00:00:35.910> come<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.300> processors<00:00:36.870> are

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
will probably come as processors are

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.869 
will probably come as processors are
better<00:00:37.260> memory<00:00:37.649> cards<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.040> faster<00:00:38.460> but

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
better memory cards get faster but

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.130 
better memory cards get faster but
that's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> lot<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> data<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> pump<00:00:39.870> through<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that's a lot of data to pump through and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's a lot of data to pump through and
when<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.320> cameras<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.770> most<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
when these cameras so most of the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.979 
when these cameras so most of the
manufacturers<00:00:41.730> probably<00:00:42.149> melt<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.660> right

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
manufacturers probably melt right right

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.420 
manufacturers probably melt right right
yeah<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.290> melt<00:00:43.710> right<00:00:43.800> before<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.190> eyes

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
yeah just melt right before your eyes

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
yeah just melt right before your eyes
okay<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.329> manufacturers<00:00:45.690> yeah

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
okay a lot of the manufacturers yeah

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.510 
okay a lot of the manufacturers yeah
they<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.469> force<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
they do force you if you want that

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.880 
they do force you if you want that
higher<00:00:47.700> frame<00:00:48.120> rate<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.809> go<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
higher frame rate to go back down to a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
higher frame rate to go back down to a
720p<00:00:50.730> mode<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.329> might<00:00:51.600> say<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> yourself

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
720p mode now you might say to yourself

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.250 
720p mode now you might say to yourself
well<00:00:52.680> I'm<00:00:52.860> working<00:00:53.190> 1080<00:00:53.809> that's<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.020> going

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
well I'm working 1080 that's not going

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.580 
well I'm working 1080 that's not going
to<00:00:55.320> work

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to work

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.709 
to work
sure<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.309> sure<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.940> right<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
sure it is sure it is right when we can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720 
sure it is sure it is right when we can
we<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> things<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:58.770> post<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
we can do a lot of things in in post you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
we can do a lot of things in in post you
know<00:00:59.820> push<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.410> NLE

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
know push in on it have our NLE

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.380 
know push in on it have our NLE
automatically<00:01:02.489> interpret<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> frame<00:01:03.120> size

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
automatically interpret the frame size

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.820 
automatically interpret the frame size
so<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.809> matches<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.170> other<00:01:04.320> footage<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.739> our

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so it matches the other footage in our

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
so it matches the other footage in our
timeline<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.850> on<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.119> forth<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.390> don't

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
timeline and so on and so forth so don't

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.300 
timeline and so on and so forth so don't
be<00:01:06.810> worried<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> key<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> we

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
be worried about it the key is that we

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.520 
be worried about it the key is that we
want<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.850> higher<00:01:09.150> frame<00:01:09.570> rate<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.869> 60

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
want to get that higher frame rate of 60

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.500 
want to get that higher frame rate of 60
frames<00:01:10.710> per<00:01:10.799> second<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.520> clear<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
frames per second not to be clear you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.719 
frames per second not to be clear you
could<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> very<00:01:13.710> marginally<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
could do this very marginally for

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.039 
could do this very marginally for
example<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> were<00:01:15.299> shooting<00:01:15.570> 1080<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
example if you were shooting 1080 you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.789 
example if you were shooting 1080 you
shot<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.350> 1080p<00:01:17.280> 30<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.850> 29<00:01:18.240> 97<00:01:18.509> yes<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> suppose

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
shot at 1080p 30 or 29 97 yes I suppose

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.070 
shot at 1080p 30 or 29 97 yes I suppose
you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.070> interpret<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.090> 23<00:01:21.750> 9<00:01:21.900> 8

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you can interpret that down to 23 9 8

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.679 
you can interpret that down to 23 9 8
but<00:01:22.680> very<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.939> gain<00:01:24.090> very<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
but very very little gain very little

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.969 
but very very little gain very little
slow<00:01:24.869> motion<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.439> happen<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
slow motion is going to happen there so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.170 
slow motion is going to happen there so
we<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.280> shoot<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> higher<00:01:26.850> frame

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
we want to shoot at that higher frame

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.789 
we want to shoot at that higher frame
rate<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.049> first<00:01:28.290> thing<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> need<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
rate so the first thing that you need to

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
rate so the first thing that you need to
do<00:01:29.040> obviously<00:01:29.729> besides<00:01:30.060> setting<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
do obviously besides setting up your

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.810 
do obviously besides setting up your
exposure<00:01:31.020> triangle<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.680> your<00:01:31.770> ISO<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
exposure triangle in your ISO and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.310 
exposure triangle in your ISO and
there's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> movie<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.079> we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
there's a movie for that there is we

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
other cameras are going to be a little

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
other cameras are going to be a little
bit<00:02:07.110> different<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.220> menus<00:02:08.670> pretty<00:02:08.940> much

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
bit different but the menus pretty much

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.600 
bit different but the menus pretty much
the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.869> mostly<00:02:10.229> shoot<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> Nikon<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.280> have<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
the same I mostly shoot a Nikon I have a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
the same I mostly shoot a Nikon I have a
choice<00:02:11.849> for<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.840> key

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
choice for this the key

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.890 
choice for this the key
again<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:14.250> high<00:02:14.490> frame<00:02:14.880> rate<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.480> think

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
again is that high frame rate and think

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
again is that high frame rate and think
about<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.590> only<00:02:16.770> need<00:02:17.040> 24<00:02:17.610> frames<00:02:17.880> per

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
about it if you only need 24 frames per

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.050 
about it if you only need 24 frames per
second<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.720> you've<00:02:19.349> got<00:02:19.530> 60<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.760> almost

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
second and you've got 60 you have almost

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.150 
second and you've got 60 you have almost
two<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> half<00:02:21.660> times<00:02:21.900> more<00:02:22.200> frames<00:02:22.500> now

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
two and a half times more frames now

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.589 
two and a half times more frames now
here's<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.640> big<00:02:23.819> thing<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:24.090> most<00:02:24.480> people

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
forget about this slow motion stuff the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.809 
forget about this slow motion stuff the
audio<00:02:27.510> will<00:02:28.260> not<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.800> in<00:02:29.069> sync

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819

rich that the audio is essentially going

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.220 
rich that the audio is essentially going
to<00:02:58.980> become<00:02:59.310> out<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.060> sync<00:03:00.239> out<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.690> sync<00:03:00.959> right

sync but they want the actual

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.170 
sync but they want the actual
performance<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.069> slow<00:03:08.310> motion<00:03:08.730> what

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
performance to be in slow motion what

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.270 
performance to be in slow motion what
they<00:03:09.299> actually<00:03:09.450> do<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.989> they<00:03:10.019> speed<00:03:10.980> up<00:03:11.130> the

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
they actually do is they speed up the

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.610 
they actually do is they speed up the
audio<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.850> lip-sync<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.290> really

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
audio and lip-sync to it really really

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.130 
audio and lip-sync to it really really
fast<00:03:13.799> all<00:03:14.250> recording<00:03:14.730> but<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.299> in<00:03:15.540> itself<00:03:15.870> is

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
fast all recording but that in itself is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.300 
fast all recording but that in itself is
a<00:03:16.170> special<00:03:16.620> skill<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:16.980> we're<00:03:17.100> just<00:03:17.250> doing

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
a special skill but we're just doing

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.949 
a special skill but we're just doing
some<00:03:17.549> b-roll<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:18.060> today<00:03:18.209> exactly<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:18.930> I

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
some b-roll here today exactly and I

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:19.729 
some b-roll here today exactly and I
think<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.440> where<00:03:19.620> this

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
think that's really where this

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.190 
think that's really where this
techniques<00:03:20.160> excels<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.540> sort<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.780> b-roll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
techniques excels is in sort of b-roll

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.319 
techniques excels is in sort of b-roll
where<00:03:22.500> you're<00:03:23.070> not<00:03:23.250> really<00:03:23.549> concerned<00:03:24.000> about

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
where you're not really concerned about

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.670 
where you're not really concerned about
the<00:03:24.660> audio<00:03:24.959> you're<00:03:25.170> more<00:03:25.290> concerned<00:03:25.620> about

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the audio you're more concerned about

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.740 
the audio you're more concerned about
getting<00:03:25.829> that<00:03:26.130> nice<00:03:26.280> smooth<00:03:26.910> slow<00:03:27.090> motion<00:03:27.450> so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
getting that nice smooth slow motion so

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.210 
getting that nice smooth slow motion so
let's<00:03:28.109> record<00:03:28.290> we<00:03:28.560> got<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.769> camera<00:03:29.010> set<00:03:29.190> up

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
let's record we got the camera set up

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.400 
let's record we got the camera set up
yep<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> little<00:03:30.329> bit<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.570> ice<00:03:30.930> tea<00:03:31.170> here

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
yep I have a little bit of ice tea here

likes more than one take why don't we
get<00:04:03.660> one<00:04:03.690> more<00:04:04.140> for<00:04:04.380> safety<00:04:04.410> okay<00:04:05.040> sure<00:04:05.280> I'll

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
get one more for safety okay sure I'll

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.960 
get one more for safety okay sure I'll
recycle<00:04:06.329> my<00:04:06.420> ice<00:04:06.540> tea<00:04:06.569> here<00:04:07.049> one<00:04:07.319> sec<00:04:07.970> we're

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
recycle my ice tea here one sec we're

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.610 
recycle my ice tea here one sec we're
good<00:04:09.120> we're<00:04:09.329> very<00:04:09.510> unconscious<00:04:09.930> here<00:04:10.319> making

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
good we're very unconscious here making

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.410 
good we're very unconscious here making
sure<00:04:10.739> we<00:04:10.889> reuse<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.459> props<00:04:11.730> as<00:04:12.060> opposed<00:04:12.359> to

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
sure we reuse the props as opposed to

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.059 
sure we reuse the props as opposed to
pouring<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.840> out<00:04:12.930> okay<00:04:13.590> let's<00:04:13.799> try<00:04:13.889> that<00:04:13.950> again

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
pouring it out okay let's try that again

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.190 
pouring it out okay let's try that again
take<00:04:14.760> two<00:04:14.790> here<00:04:15.239> take<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.720> same<00:04:15.870> picture<00:04:16.019> of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
take two here take the same picture of

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.430 
take two here take the same picture of
ice<00:04:16.350> tea<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.970> I'm<00:04:17.970> going<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.150> pour<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.510> in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:29.140 

up<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.160> down<00:04:22.310> here<00:04:27.550> alright<00:04:28.550> cool<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.120> of

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
up and down here alright cool so one of

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.400 
up and down here alright cool so one of
those<00:04:29.300> will<00:04:29.480> probably<00:04:29.570> work<00:04:29.870> creating<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.290> nice

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
those will probably work creating a nice

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.390 
those will probably work creating a nice
slow-motion<00:04:30.980> effect

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
slow-motion effect

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.490 
slow-motion effect
yeah<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:32.180> pretty<00:04:32.540> straightforward<00:04:32.810> we'll<00:04:33.410> go

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
yeah so pretty straightforward we'll go

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.230 
yeah so pretty straightforward we'll go
ahead<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.770> stop<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.160> camera<00:04:34.550> mm-hmm

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
ahead and stop the camera mm-hmm

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.150 
ahead and stop the camera mm-hmm
we<00:04:35.540> had<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.840> as<00:04:36.020> one<00:04:36.230> clip<00:04:36.530> with<00:04:36.740> two<00:04:36.920> takes

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
we had that as one clip with two takes

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.740 
we had that as one clip with two takes
on<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.370> same<00:04:37.520> card<00:04:37.820> we<00:04:38.000> could<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.270> busted<00:04:38.450> it

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
on the same card we could have busted it

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.080 
on the same card we could have busted it
but<00:04:39.260> it's<00:04:39.560> pretty<00:04:39.890> easy<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.550> now<00:04:40.790> that<00:04:41.000> we

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
but it's pretty easy and now that we

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.120 
but it's pretty easy and now that we
actually<00:04:41.120> have<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.690> digital<00:04:42.140> file<00:04:42.350> we're<00:04:42.950> going

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
actually have a digital file we're going

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.310 
actually have a digital file we're going
to<00:04:43.190> jump<00:04:43.460> into<00:04:43.640> three<00:04:44.150> popular<00:04:44.840> workflows<00:04:45.290> so

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
to jump into three popular workflows so

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.540 
to jump into three popular workflows so
when<00:04:45.620> we<00:04:45.710> come<00:04:45.860> back<00:04:46.010> we're<00:04:46.250> going<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.400> take<00:04:46.490> a

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
when we come back we're going to take a

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.630 
when we come back we're going to take a
look<00:04:46.820> at<00:04:47.000> Final<00:04:47.840> Cut<00:04:47.960> 10<00:04:48.290> Premiere<00:04:49.190> Pro<00:04:49.220> and

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
look at Final Cut 10 Premiere Pro and

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.430 
look at Final Cut 10 Premiere Pro and
then<00:04:49.970> stepping<00:04:50.300> up<00:04:50.540> to<00:04:50.660> something<00:04:50.930> like<00:04:51.020> After
