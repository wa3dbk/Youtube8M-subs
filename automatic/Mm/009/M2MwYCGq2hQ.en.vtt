00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
when i was worried about is that it was

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.660 
when i was worried about is that it was
a<00:00:28.720> really<00:00:29.050> long<00:00:29.199> course<00:00:29.500> it<00:00:29.650> was<00:00:29.770> 14<00:00:30.190> obstacles

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
a really long course it was 14 obstacles

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.970 
a really long course it was 14 obstacles
and<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.630> mode<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.169> biggest<00:00:32.469> effort<00:00:32.619> had<00:00:32.859> to

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
and the mode the biggest effort had to

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.049 
and the mode the biggest effort had to
be<00:00:33.070> done<00:00:33.219> at<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.489> end<00:00:33.609> it<00:00:33.730> was<00:00:33.850> a<00:00:33.879> very

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
be done at the end it was a very

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.549 
be done at the end it was a very
difficult<00:00:34.329> line<00:00:34.690> at<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.930> end<00:00:35.079> so<00:00:35.229> we<00:00:35.350> have<00:00:35.440> to

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
difficult line at the end so we have to

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.340 
difficult line at the end so we have to
keep<00:00:35.710> we<00:00:36.429> had<00:00:37.239> to<00:00:37.329> keep<00:00:37.479> in<00:00:37.659> mind<00:00:37.839> that<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.170> keep

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
keep we had to keep in mind that to keep

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.619 
keep we had to keep in mind that to keep
it<00:00:38.559> energy<00:00:38.920> till<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.219> end<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.609> at<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.510> end

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
it energy till the end and at the end

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.270 
it energy till the end and at the end
everything<00:00:40.929> work<00:00:41.199> out<00:00:41.379> this<00:00:41.649> so<00:00:41.889> i<00:00:41.920> was<00:00:42.190> very

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329

no I knew it was very difficult I heard
I<00:00:52.569> heard<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.929> the<00:00:53.229> warm<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.679> there<00:00:53.799> were<00:00:53.889> some

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:54.069 
I heard in the warm that there were some

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.949 
I heard in the warm that there were some
false<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:55.839> was<00:00:56.139> actually<00:00:56.649> not<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:58.600> was<00:00:58.749> not

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:58.959 
false but I was actually not it was not

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.289 
false but I was actually not it was not
busy<00:00:59.409> with<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.799> i<00:00:59.829> think<00:01:00.219> i<00:01:00.370> just<00:01:00.789> wanted<00:01:01.269> to

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
busy with that i think i just wanted to

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.329 
busy with that i think i just wanted to
stay<00:01:01.869> in<00:01:01.899> my<00:01:02.079> own<00:01:02.229> world<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.649> do<00:01:02.769> my<00:01:02.920> own<00:01:02.949> thing

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
stay in my own world and do my own thing

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.250 
stay in my own world and do my own thing
and<00:01:03.549> i<00:01:03.909> was<00:01:04.059> very<00:01:04.210> concentrated<00:01:04.659> oh<00:01:04.989> no<00:01:05.110> what<00:01:05.229> I

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
and i was very concentrated oh no what I

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.899 
and i was very concentrated oh no what I
had<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.890> I<00:01:05.950> knew<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.190> combination<00:01:06.400> but

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
had to do and I knew the combination but

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.030 
had to do and I knew the combination but
very<00:01:07.120> difficult<00:01:07.600> so<00:01:08.290> I<00:01:08.320> did<00:01:08.590> everything<00:01:08.830> to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
very difficult so I did everything to

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.310 
very difficult so I did everything to
constrain<00:01:09.520> myself<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.630> then

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
constrain myself on that and and then

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.770 
constrain myself on that and and then
that's<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.160> way<00:01:12.190> we<00:01:12.430> want<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:13.210> was<00:01:13.600> not

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
that's the way we want that I was not

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.680 
that's the way we want that I was not
really<00:01:13.930> thinking<00:01:14.290> about<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.620> other<00:01:14.650> system

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
really thinking about the other system

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.740 
really thinking about the other system
and<00:01:15.890> coming<00:01:16.890> off<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> triple<00:01:17.550> combination

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
and coming off the triple combination

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.590 
and coming off the triple combination
which<00:01:18.750> looked<00:01:19.200> extremely<00:01:19.530> difficult<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.420> had

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
which looked extremely difficult you had

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840 
which looked extremely difficult you had
to<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.020> knock<00:01:22.260> sir<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.400> lost<00:01:23.610> your

position on my stirrup and i had to do a
lot<00:01:38.190> of<00:01:38.310> effort<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.760> come<00:01:39.330> out<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.690> triple

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
lot of effort to come out of the triple

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.630 
lot of effort to come out of the triple
combination<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.980> that's<00:01:41.160> why<00:01:41.280> i<00:01:41.310> lost<00:01:41.550> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
combination and that's why i lost a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550 
combination and that's why i lost a
little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:41.910> my<00:01:42.030> stirrup<00:01:42.390> i<00:01:42.570> had<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.230> really

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
little bit my stirrup i had not really

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.680 
little bit my stirrup i had not really
balanced<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.010> i<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.220> normally<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
balanced that i have normally and and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.450 
balanced that i have normally and and
then<00:01:45.990> had<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.230> go<00:01:46.410> on<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.070> wanted

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then had to go on but you know I wanted

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.130 
then had to go on but you know I wanted
to<00:01:47.550> do<00:01:47.760> was<00:01:48.150> think<00:01:48.300> about<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.690> cereal<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.080> I

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
to do was think about my cereal but I

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.260 
to do was think about my cereal but I
knew<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> had<00:01:49.650> to<00:01:49.740> go<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.670> for<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> time

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
knew that I had to go go on for the time

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.920 
knew that I had to go go on for the time
and<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:53.040> saw<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.550> jump<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> blank<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
and I think I saw the jump the blank and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.330 
and I think I saw the jump the blank and
I<00:01:54.990> saw<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> distance<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.800> in<00:01:55.920> one<00:01:56.100> less

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
I saw the distance in the in one less

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.250 
I saw the distance in the in one less
one<00:01:56.730> strike<00:01:57.060> last<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.480> went<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
one strike last so I went for it and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.660 
one strike last so I went for it and
then<00:01:58.440> it<00:01:58.620> worked<00:01:58.860> out<00:01:58.950> super<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.580> was

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
then it worked out super but that was

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
then it worked out super but that was
just<00:01:59.960> yeah<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.620> one-hundredth<00:02:02.340> under

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
just yeah just one one-hundredth under

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.170 
just yeah just one one-hundredth under
the<00:02:02.850> time<00:02:03.060> allowed<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:04.290> time<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.490> factor<00:02:06.150> for

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
the time allowed was time a factor for

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.800 
the time allowed was time a factor for
candy<00:02:07.520> normally<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:08.729> candy<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.720> bit

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
candy normally for candy is a little bit

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.860

of<00:02:09.899> factor<00:02:10.200> i<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> also<00:02:11.210> i<00:02:12.210> always<00:02:12.750> have

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
of factor i have to also i always have

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.780 
of factor i have to also i always have
to<00:02:12.990> be<00:02:13.140> too<00:02:13.770> worried<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.310> time<00:02:14.520> i<00:02:14.550> have

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
mind when i'm jumping but to be honest

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.310 
mind when i'm jumping but to be honest
here<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.360> course<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.810> wrote<00:02:19.050> here

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
here all the course that I wrote here

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250 
here all the course that I wrote here
was<00:02:19.500> always<00:02:19.800> 56<00:02:20.760> seconds<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.239> time<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.230> I

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
was always 56 seconds in the time so I

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.479 
was always 56 seconds in the time so I
was<00:02:22.500> not<00:02:22.650> really<00:02:22.860> worried<00:02:23.040> about<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.310> time

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
was not really worried about the time

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.100 
was not really worried about the time
and<00:02:23.640> that's<00:02:23.700> maybe<00:02:23.910> also<00:02:24.120> i<00:02:24.209> was<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:24.900> time

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
and that's maybe also i was just in time

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.840 
and that's maybe also i was just in time
in<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.320> second<00:02:25.650> round<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.190> all<00:02:26.700> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
in a second round because I all the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.970 
in a second round because I all the
other<00:02:27.020> runs<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.260> did<00:02:28.440> when<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.590> was<00:02:28.620> very

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
other runs that I did when I was very

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.350 
other runs that I did when I was very
good<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.280> time<00:02:29.580> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.910> not<00:02:30.090> worried<00:02:30.330> about

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
good in time so I was not worried about

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.300 
good in time so I was not worried about
the<00:02:30.570> time<00:02:30.720> this<00:02:30.900> time<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.650> that's<00:02:31.920> why<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.070> was
