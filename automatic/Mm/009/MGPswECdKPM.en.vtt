00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
turn your shoulders with your boards so

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.770 
turn your shoulders with your boards so
that<00:01:54.950> your<00:01:55.069> entire<00:01:55.369> body<00:01:55.609> flows<00:01:56.450> around<00:01:56.569> in

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
that your entire body flows around in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.779 
that your entire body flows around in
the<00:01:56.869> 180<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.890> you'll<00:01:58.069> have<00:01:58.219> most<00:01:58.609> of<00:01:58.759> your

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
the 180 so you'll have most of your

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.919 
the 180 so you'll have most of your
weight<00:01:58.939> over<00:01:59.119> your<00:01:59.210> front<00:01:59.390> foot<00:01:59.509> when<00:01:59.810> you're

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
weight over your front foot when you're

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.840 
weight over your front foot when you're
initiating<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.469> slide<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.950> then<00:02:01.429> as<00:02:01.729> you

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
initiating the slide and then as you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.969 
initiating the slide and then as you
bring<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.210> around<00:02:02.299> past<00:02:02.990> 90<00:02:03.350> degrees<00:02:03.619> we<00:02:03.859> got

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
bring it around past 90 degrees we got

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.559 
bring it around past 90 degrees we got
started<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.369> want<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.639> transfer<00:02:05.119> some<00:02:05.389> of<00:02:05.420> that

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
started to want to transfer some of that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.749 
started to want to transfer some of that
weight<00:02:05.719> over<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.229> your<00:02:06.409> right<00:02:06.710> foot<00:02:07.039> or<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.549> mean

now going to be your front foot so that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.720 
now going to be your front foot so that
you<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.420> be

so<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.959> last<00:02:28.170> part<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:28.950> challenge<00:02:29.550> is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
so the last part of this challenge is

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.530 
so the last part of this challenge is
the<00:02:30.330> switch<00:02:31.170> backside<00:02:31.739> 180<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.060> switch<00:02:33.330> back

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the switch backside 180 and switch back

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.259 
the switch backside 180 and switch back
sides<00:02:33.810> are<00:02:34.140> not<00:02:34.379> fun<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.519> mean<00:02:35.730> they<00:02:35.849> stuck<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
sides are not fun I mean they stuck to

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.320 
sides are not fun I mean they stuck to
learn<00:02:36.420> they're<00:02:36.870> scary<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.560> hell<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.069> I<00:02:38.670> really

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
up doing it and I never thought I'd do

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.550 
up doing it and I never thought I'd do
because<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.430> scared<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.120> me<00:02:45.239> still<00:02:46.049> am<00:02:46.260> but

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
because I was scared of me still am but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.360 
because I was scared of me still am but
I<00:02:47.459> worked<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.180> them<00:02:48.299> a<00:02:48.360> little<00:02:48.480> bit<00:02:48.920> so<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.310> can

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
I worked on them a little bit so you can

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.580 
I worked on them a little bit so you can
learn<00:02:50.549> them<00:02:50.700> too<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:52.140> you're<00:02:52.260> learning<00:02:52.349> I'm

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
learn them too when you're learning I'm

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.530 
learn them too when you're learning I'm
just<00:02:52.830> trying<00:02:53.220> thinking<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.640> them<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.030> just

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
just trying thinking of them as just

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.589 
just trying thinking of them as just
like<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.349> opposite<00:02:55.769> of<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:56.370> regular<00:02:56.599> backside

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
like the opposite of a regular backside

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.210 
like the opposite of a regular backside
180<00:02:57.959> which<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.319> why<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.739> gonna<00:02:58.860> be<00:02:58.980> easier<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
180 which is why it's gonna be easier to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.430 
180 which is why it's gonna be easier to
them<00:02:59.519> sort<00:02:59.730> back<00:02:59.880> back<00:03:00.120> like<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:01.230> your

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
them sort back back like this if your

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.539 
them sort back back like this if your
feet<00:03:01.590> are<00:03:01.620> already<00:03:01.829> going<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.130> be<00:03:02.190> set<00:03:02.370> up<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
feet are already going to be set up the

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.039 
feet are already going to be set up the
way<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.819> they<00:03:02.940> should<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.510> know<00:03:03.599> having

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
way that they should be you know having

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.199 
way that they should be you know having
your<00:03:04.200> toes<00:03:04.380> over<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.860> rail<00:03:05.010> just<00:03:05.430> just<00:03:06.060> like

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
your toes over the rail just just like

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.360 
your toes over the rail just just like
an<00:03:06.299> irregular<00:03:06.599> backside<00:03:06.930> 180<00:03:07.230> only<00:03:08.010> defenses

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
an irregular backside 180 only defenses

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.030 
an irregular backside 180 only defenses
are<00:03:08.459> going<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.700> looking<00:03:08.970> over<00:03:09.209> your

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
are going to be looking over your

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.860 
are going to be looking over your
formerly<00:03:11.040> front<00:03:11.459> shoulder<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.360> me<00:03:12.629> back

formerly front shoulder it's me back

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.920

into<00:03:13.079> your<00:03:13.440> regular<00:03:13.590> stance<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:15.120> something

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
into your regular stance so something

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.619 
into your regular stance so something
that<00:03:16.019> helped<00:03:16.230> me<00:03:16.379> with<00:03:16.680> this<00:03:16.829> trick<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.370> just

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
that helped me with this trick is just

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.600 
that helped me with this trick is just
making<00:03:18.629> sure<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.530> really<00:03:19.829> turned<00:03:20.250> my<00:03:20.400> head

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
making sure that I really turned my head

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.430 
making sure that I really turned my head
and<00:03:21.200> swung<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.230> over<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.040> shoulder<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:24.440> kind

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
and swung it over that shoulder and kind

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
and swung it over that shoulder and kind
of<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.680> really<00:03:25.980> push<00:03:26.280> out<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.700> your<00:03:26.910> your

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
of just really push out with your your

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.539 
of just really push out with your your
front<00:03:28.110> foot<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.860> know<00:03:28.950> you're<00:03:29.099> normally<00:03:29.430> your

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
front foot you know you're normally your

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.710 
front foot you know you're normally your
front<00:03:29.730> foot<00:03:29.790> which<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.120> not<00:03:30.239> your<00:03:30.359> back<00:03:30.480> foot

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
front foot which is not your back foot

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360 
front foot which is not your back foot
we<00:03:31.109> should<00:03:31.290> really<00:03:31.470> swing<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:31.980> one<00:03:32.130> around

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
we should really swing that one around

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.330 
we should really swing that one around
push<00:03:33.030> out<00:03:33.239> with<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:33.780> think<00:03:34.739> about<00:03:34.799> landing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
push out with it and think about landing

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
push out with it and think about landing
all<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> foot

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
all that foot

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.690 
all that foot
as<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.600> recover<00:03:36.900> into<00:03:37.380> regular<00:03:37.560> stance<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
as you recover into regular stance so

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.340 
as you recover into regular stance so

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
front foot you don't want to have a lot

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.390
