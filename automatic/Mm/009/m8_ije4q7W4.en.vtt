00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hello everyone guys are the ones to give to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.790
 and today we are here in this new video 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.120
 which will not be particularly long or not 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.370
 it won't even be a gameplay let's say but 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.530
 I think it will be very very interesting 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 because we're going to talk a little about the calls 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
 clash of france therefore a topic that 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.710
 many do not know and therefore we see a 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.710
 to investigate this topic further 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.130
 I state guys that these things do not 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.440
 I invented it seems to me an obvious thing 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 but I wanted to say it anyway and I have 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.430
 found this guide on this forum 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.520
 so maybe you can find it below in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 description guide that is enough 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.330
 reliable because it is based on the terms and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 the conditions of the super selection then 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.730
 clash of clans and therefore precisely this is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.950
 as for those who don't know kids 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.620
 what is a bar good when a player 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.379
 is simply banished by a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.660
 something that can be a game a site 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.790
 a youtube channel all that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.830
 you want and therefore just a player 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.630
 or a person who does something 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.240
 that goes against the rules is banned 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.400
 and therefore cannot do certain things 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 can not access a game can not 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.170
 access a site and this thing precisely 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.899
 in some cases it can also happen on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.930
 clash of clans on bless guys exist 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.750
 4 types based on what you do 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.729
 first of all there is an offensive type of call 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.160
 so when someone offends someone 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.159
 in circle it is worth repeatedly rather 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.460
 than to an offensive name rather than it does 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 a village with something not too much 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.190
 nice to say the least and then 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.470
 this was the first type of ban 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.780
 the second concerns the players 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 who buy gems not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.340
 through clash of france but through 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.040
 of the external sites this thing guys have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.960
 absolutely illegal so don't do it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 among other things in the channels such as in Italy 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.790
 around the world they are shooting 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.650
 fake type with my name with the name of ronzo 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.390
 who write why free gems but I am 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.220
 link you won't have those things for 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.979
 please anyway for those who don't know 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.810
 there are some illegal sites 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.190
 where gem prices can be purchased 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.110
 maybe discounted 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.510
 maybe some of you might be 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 enticed the gems you perhaps come 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.640
 however you risk being banned 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.709
 the third one goes instead is a little more 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 common then that due to software or 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.140
 platforms not allowed by clash of 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.720
 france so to speak those who use ips type 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.890
 mode games rather than mod keynes a 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.300
 second of the 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.740
 sirons that you have this boy is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.290
 absolutely not therefore legal a 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.660
 your risk and danger you can use them 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.430
 or not I personally have already expressed the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.500
 my opinion are absolutely against 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.540
 these things, however, I know there is a great deal 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 people who simply use them 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.930
 do what you want alerted man 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.030
 half saved 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.650
 the last bathroom instead guys one thing 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.870
 a bit special that I didn't have 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.820
 never even thought because I always have it 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.280
 considered a fairly normal thing 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.700
 strange but normal is what concerns 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.380
 the sale exchange purchase of villages 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.060
 in fact guys these things are 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.580
 illegal for football terms 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.310
 clan for both the terms of itunes and sia 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.470
 for the terms google yes conditions 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.900
 then of course I don't know how they do a 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.180
 get you if you give the password and the nick 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 name a1 but in doubt I advise you to 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.080
 don't even try to sell the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.330
 village because then comes like a guy 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.430
 caio who says she give me the password then 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.840
 steals the village does not give you the money e 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.940
 then click push 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.340
 but having said this guys what it is 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.590
 the ban simply the player who 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.410
 is banned cannot access clash 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.630
 for hicks days the minimum duration of a 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.519
 ban is that of two days while the 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.890
 maximum duration is the definitive ban 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.110
 therefore infinite for the first type of ban 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.600
 so let's call it an offensive bathroom yes 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.400
 risks first a two-day call for tenders 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.820
 second call instead a call for tenders 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.130
 about ten days the third report 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.590
 involves a ban of 31 days and the fourth 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.660
 involves a definitive ban itself 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.340
 identical thing for the bathroom concerning 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.709
 buying gems through sites 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.230
 externals for those who are banned instead 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.180
 for software platforms then hicks 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.190
 smog games and bla bla bla you risk a 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.250
 year before 31 days then the second 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.289
 definitive ban signal obviously 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.090
 if it is such a minor thing even in 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.890
 in this case there may be a bathroom 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.660
 only two days for what concerns 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.940
 the purchase sale of villages the bathroom 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.190
 and definitive immediately because 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.510
 this would affect other companies 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.280
 as well as the super sel them then 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.900
 I wash my hands so you guys 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.910
 I hope I said everything I just wanted 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.020
 add one last thing maybe you can 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.790
 make the crafty 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.410
 if you are for example in a war between 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.210
 clan and see that an opponent one 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.160
 village with a content maybe 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.500
 something offensive 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.690
 if you want to say cheating and doing something 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.389
 very very incorrect but maybe there 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.520
 could win the war 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.919
 you can report this player to 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.600
 super sel and maybe hope it comes 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.580
 banned before the war 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.780
 I know it 's a very, very bad thing 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.510
 but there are those who do it 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.830
 I personally would never do it because 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.900
 I'm a good boy 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.690
 but in fact I told you so 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.669
 right for so I hope this video 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.740
 you enjoyed it if maybe you have some 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.330
 topics that are not very clear of 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.280
 clash of prince you want me 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.240
 read more you can write apple trees here 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.039
 below in the comments 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.479
