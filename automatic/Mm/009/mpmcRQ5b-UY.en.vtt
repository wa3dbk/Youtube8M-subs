the constant exposure of that sugar to
that<00:01:33.060> bacteria<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:34.500> allow<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.010> keep

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
that bacteria will allow them to keep

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.640 
that bacteria will allow them to keep
making<00:01:35.520> acid<00:01:35.910> and<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.229> acid<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.440> make

making acid and that acid that they make

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
making acid and that acid that they make
is<00:01:37.830> what<00:01:37.979> causes<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.520> teeth<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.940> sort<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
is what causes the teeth to sort of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.380 
is what causes the teeth to sort of
dissolve<00:01:39.479> away<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.950> issue<00:01:41.160> is<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
dissolve away the issue is that that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
dissolve away the issue is that that
formula<00:01:42.810> will<00:01:43.020> pull<00:01:43.290> around<00:01:43.500> those<00:01:43.830> front

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
formula will pull around those front

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
formula will pull around those front
teeth<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.580> you<00:01:44.760> give<00:01:45.150> them<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> formula<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
teeth if you give them the formula and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.660 
teeth if you give them the formula and
immediately<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:46.440> them<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> bed<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.310> yes<00:01:47.520> we

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
immediately put them to bed so yes we
