this is a chest workout I must say that
this<00:00:05.100> probably<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.480> best<00:00:06.509> routine<00:00:07.259> that<00:00:07.529> I

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
this probably is the best routine that I

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.220 
this probably is the best routine that I
have<00:00:07.919> made<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.550> far<00:00:08.580> for<00:00:09.210> my<00:00:09.420> chest<00:00:09.870> it

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
consists of only five exercises three

sets each and you can see the full
workout<00:00:15.929> including<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.830> amount<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> rest<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
workout including the amount of rest I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.029 
workout including the amount of rest I
took<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.119> between<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.199> description<00:00:19.890> of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
took in between in the description of

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.010 
took in between in the description of
this<00:00:20.250> video

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
this video

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.349 
this video
first<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.230> all<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> start<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.609> benchpress

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
first of all I start with a benchpress

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.439 
first of all I start with a benchpress
and<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.080> believe<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.740> used<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.580> seventy

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and I believe that I used about seventy

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
and I believe that I used about seventy
two<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> half<00:00:28.289> kilo<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.250> perform<00:00:29.760> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
two and a half kilo to perform this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
two and a half kilo to perform this
benchpress<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.990> at<00:00:31.109> least<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> first<00:00:31.800> set<00:00:32.070> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
benchpress or at least the first set and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.930 
benchpress or at least the first set and
after<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.380> removed<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.559> couple<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.190> weight

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
after that I removed a couple of weight

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
after that I removed a couple of weight
plates<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.989> went<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.770> about<00:00:38.340> ten<00:00:38.760> kilo

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
plates so I went down about ten kilo

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.560 
plates so I went down about ten kilo
eventually<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> final<00:00:41.100> set<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:42.300> trap

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
eventually in the final set the trap

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.200 
eventually in the final set the trap
sets<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:43.140> pretty<00:00:43.520> advanced<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:45.149> don't

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
sets are pretty advanced and I don't

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.080 
sets are pretty advanced and I don't
recommend<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> do<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.649> lot<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.610> drop

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
recommend you to do a lot of these drop

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020 
recommend you to do a lot of these drop
sets<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:49.050> workout<00:00:49.530> routine<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.700> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
sets in one workout routine and also not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
sets in one workout routine and also not
too<00:00:51.270> many<00:00:51.480> each<00:00:51.840> week<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.739> least<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
too many each week or at least not for

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760 
too many each week or at least not for
the<00:00:53.489> same<00:00:53.699> muscle<00:00:54.090> group<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.930> split<00:00:55.649> my

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the same muscle group so I split my

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.180 
the same muscle group so I split my
routine<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.670> five<00:00:57.300> muscle<00:00:57.780> groups<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
routine in five muscle groups and that

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.939 
routine in five muscle groups and that
way<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.850> add<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.809> drop<00:01:01.050> set<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.770> each

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
way I can add one drop set for each

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.910 
way I can add one drop set for each
muscle<00:01:02.340> group<00:01:02.570> easily<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> next<00:01:04.439> exercise

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
muscle group easily so the next exercise

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
muscle group easily so the next exercise
is<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> white<00:01:05.519> crip<00:01:05.909> dip<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.260> of

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
is a white crip dip and this is one of

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.649 
is a white crip dip and this is one of
my<00:01:07.560> favourite<00:01:08.040> chest<00:01:08.430> exercises<00:01:09.420> as<00:01:09.600> well

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
my favourite chest exercises as well

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.410 
my favourite chest exercises as well
even<00:01:10.560> though<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> bodyweight<00:01:11.820> exercise

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
even though it is a bodyweight exercise

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.080 
even though it is a bodyweight exercise
if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.140> perform<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.130> correctly<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> take

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
if you perform it correctly and take

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.410 
if you perform it correctly and take
your<00:01:15.299> time<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.080> after<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> bench<00:01:17.610> press<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
your time then after it bench press it

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.800 
your time then after it bench press it
is<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> pretty<00:01:19.380> intense<00:01:19.770> exercise<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.820> pretty

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is a pretty intense exercise and pretty

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
is a pretty intense exercise and pretty
difficult<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.650> more<00:01:22.920> than<00:01:23.100> three<00:01:23.490> sets<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
difficult to do more than three sets of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.649 
difficult to do more than three sets of
ten<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.689> fifteen<00:01:25.229> repetitions<00:01:26.330> then<00:01:27.330> another

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
ten to fifteen repetitions then another

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
ten to fifteen repetitions then another
three<00:01:28.170> sets<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.740> bench<00:01:29.310> presses<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.150> this

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
three sets of bench presses but this

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.660 
three sets of bench presses but this
time<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.930> inclined<00:01:31.530> variation<00:01:32.280> with

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
time the inclined variation with

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.109 
time the inclined variation with
dumbbells<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.350> reason<00:01:34.680> why<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.610> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
dumbbells and the reason why I do this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.569 
dumbbells and the reason why I do this
exercise<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.930> incline<00:01:37.380> position<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:38.130> because

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
exercise and incline position is because

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.940 
exercise and incline position is because
I<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> work<00:01:39.600> out<00:01:39.840> my<00:01:40.170> muscles<00:01:40.710> in

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I want to work out my muscles in

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.940 
I want to work out my muscles in
different<00:01:41.579> angles<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.110> all

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
different angles so first of all

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.090 
different angles so first of all
I<00:01:45.039> did<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.210> regular<00:01:46.479> benchpress<00:01:47.170> which<00:01:47.860> will

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
I did the regular benchpress which will

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.749 
I did the regular benchpress which will
ask<00:01:48.340> more<00:01:49.030> strength<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.869> my<00:01:50.560> complete<00:01:51.369> chest

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
ask more strength of my complete chest

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.300 
ask more strength of my complete chest
muscles<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.420> mostly<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.409> middle<00:01:53.710> section<00:01:54.189> of

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
muscles and mostly the middle section of

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.700 
muscles and mostly the middle section of
my<00:01:54.520> chest<00:01:54.789> muscles<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.539> the<00:01:55.960> incline<00:01:56.679> bench

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
my chest muscles and the incline bench

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.520 
my chest muscles and the incline bench
press<00:01:57.130> well<00:01:57.700> as<00:01:57.939> more<00:01:58.240> strength<00:01:58.750> from<00:01:59.079> my

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
press well as more strength from my

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.889 
press well as more strength from my
upper<00:02:00.070> part<00:02:00.369> of<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.670> chest<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:01.329> of<00:02:01.630> course

upper part of the chest and of course
the<00:02:02.140> white<00:02:02.770> crip<00:02:03.159> dip<00:02:03.640> will<00:02:04.030> target<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.990> lower

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
the white crip dip will target the lower

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.830

the isolation exercise called the

the isolation exercise called the
dumbbell<00:02:14.019> fly<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.799> I<00:02:15.310> chose<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.940> use<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.420> pretty

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
dumbbell fly and I chose to use a pretty

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.740 
dumbbell fly and I chose to use a pretty
light<00:02:17.260> weight<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.890> usually<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.610> will<00:02:19.030> use<00:02:19.330> about

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
light weight as usually I will use about

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.009 
light weight as usually I will use about
20<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.440> 22<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.220> half<00:02:21.280> kilo<00:02:21.940> but<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.510> time<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
20 to 22 and a half kilo but this time I

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.830 
20 to 22 and a half kilo but this time I
chose<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.440> do<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> leap<00:02:23.980> 15<00:02:24.489> kilo<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.239> this

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
chose to do a leap 15 kilo and this

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.110 
chose to do a leap 15 kilo and this
because<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.500> first<00:02:26.829> four<00:02:27.160> exercises<00:02:27.519> were

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
because the first four exercises were

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.990 
because the first four exercises were
already<00:02:28.510> pretty<00:02:28.900> good<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.640> intense<00:02:30.640> and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
already pretty good and intense and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.330 
already pretty good and intense and
therefore<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:32.290> chose<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.620> take<00:02:33.099> it<00:02:33.220> easy

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
therefore I just chose to take it easy

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.930 
therefore I just chose to take it easy
in<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.090> last<00:02:34.329> set<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:35.250> exercises<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.489> they

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
in the last set of exercises as they

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.080 
in the last set of exercises as they
warm<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.599> by<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.870> 10<00:02:38.530> burpees<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.190> after<00:02:39.940> that

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
warm up by the 10 burpees and after that

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.770 
warm up by the 10 burpees and after that
I<00:02:40.390> did<00:02:40.540> for<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.290> regular<00:02:41.860> push-ups<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.910> already
