 very well change 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.420
 but the truth is that it is very difficult 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.030
 change because I 've seen them all three 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.430

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.540
 chicarrones that you have next to gay with 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.820
 this sky what I have noticed 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.800
 also a little tuning but 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.230
 to do the first time you sing in 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.180
 a scenario like this with a group what 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.520
 you have done very well I feel that the three 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.560
 they had problems with tuning but 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.590
 I really enjoyed the presentation 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.900

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.270

 unfortunately I have to take a 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:13.230
 decision 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:15.180
 And it 's hard to be I want 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.910
 ask them to 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.449
