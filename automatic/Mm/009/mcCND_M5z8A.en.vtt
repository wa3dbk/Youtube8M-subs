00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
States let's take a look at article one

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.150 
States let's take a look at article one
section<00:00:34.469> eight<00:00:34.950> again<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> Congress<00:00:37.290> shall

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
section eight again the Congress shall

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
section eight again the Congress shall
have<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> power<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.760> coin<00:00:39.510> money<00:00:39.739> regulate

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
have the power to coin money regulate

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.260 
have the power to coin money regulate
the<00:00:40.860> value<00:00:41.010> thereof<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:43.670> so<00:00:44.670> let's<00:00:45.090> make<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the value thereof and so let's make a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.119 
the value thereof and so let's make a
distinction<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:46.020> between<00:00:46.050> pointing<00:00:46.920> money

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
distinction here between pointing money

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.060 
distinction here between pointing money
and<00:00:47.840> making<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.020> paper<00:00:49.200> currency<00:00:49.739> those<00:00:49.920> are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and making a paper currency those are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.869 
and making a paper currency those are
not<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.460> same<00:00:50.610> thing<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:53.100> second<00:00:53.579> source

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
not the same thing so my second source

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
not the same thing so my second source
would<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.149> right<00:00:54.780> underneath<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.550> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
would be right underneath that to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
would be right underneath that to
provide<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> punishment<00:00:58.230> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
provide for the punishment of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920 
provide for the punishment of
counterfeiting<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.000> securities<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.629> current

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
counterfeiting the securities in current

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.229 
counterfeiting the securities in current
point<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.289> United<00:01:01.559> States<00:01:01.940> so<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.090> also

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
point of the United States so it's also

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.770 
point of the United States so it's also
distinguished<00:01:03.870> between<00:01:04.430> coining<00:01:05.780> between

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
distinguished between coining between

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.370 
distinguished between coining between
current<00:01:07.110> coin<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.780> securities<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.990> security

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
current coin and securities as security

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.230 
current coin and securities as security
would<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.590> something<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.610> backed<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:12.000> an

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
would be something that is backed by an

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.160 
would be something that is backed by an
asset<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> made<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> deposit<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
asset so if you made a deposit of the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.600 
asset so if you made a deposit of the
bank<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.500> example<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> looked<00:01:17.310> online

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
bank for example and I looked online

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.570 
bank for example and I looked online
here<00:01:18.090> for<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.979> for<00:01:19.979> example<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.229> found

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
here for a for example of that and found

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
here for a for example of that and found
this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> 1772<00:01:24.600> book<00:01:24.930> something<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.650> little

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
this is a 1772 book something a little

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.770 
this is a 1772 book something a little
bit<00:01:26.130> before<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.659> Constitutional<00:01:27.659> Convention

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bit before the Constitutional Convention

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
bit before the Constitutional Convention
this<00:01:28.619> guy<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.979> describing<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> place

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
this guy is describing there's a place

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
this guy is describing there's a place
in<00:01:30.450> Amsterdam<00:01:31.320> where<00:01:31.560> people<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:33.799> buy<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
in Amsterdam where people will buy and

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
in Amsterdam where people will buy and
sell<00:01:35.549> Bank<00:01:35.880> credits<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.420> exchange<00:01:36.810> for

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
sell Bank credits in exchange for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.789 
sell Bank credits in exchange for
current<00:01:37.290> coin<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.130> current<00:01:38.610> coin<00:01:38.820> is

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
current coin so current coin is

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.990 
current coin so current coin is
distinguished<00:01:40.799> from<00:01:40.920> securities<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.790> bank

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
distinguished from securities here bank

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
distinguished from securities here bank
credit<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
credit would be you know you make a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.370 
credit would be you know you make a
deposit<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:45.149> some<00:01:45.360> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> coin<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.020> asset<00:01:46.290> to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
deposit of some kind of coin or asset to

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.859 
deposit of some kind of coin or asset to
the<00:01:46.470> bank<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.549> write<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> up<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.240> credit

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the bank and they write you up a credit

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.210 
the bank and they write you up a credit
that<00:01:48.990> would<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> security<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.950> those<00:01:50.100> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that would be a security so those are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
that would be a security so those are
two<00:01:50.250> different<00:01:50.369> things<00:01:50.670> those<00:01:51.360> thank<00:01:51.720> those

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
two different things those thank those

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
two different things those thank those
changes<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.770> making<00:01:53.070> money<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
changes are making money on the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.060 
changes are making money on the
difference<00:01:54.450> between<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.110> securities<00:01:55.920> and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
difference between the securities and

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.060 
difference between the securities and
the<00:01:56.159> coin<00:01:57.469> obviously<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> coin<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:58.920> have

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the coin obviously the coin would have

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.889 
the coin obviously the coin would have
some<00:01:59.280> kind<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.520> value<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.820> number<00:02:02.899> three

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
some kind of value there so number three

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.770 
some kind of value there so number three
let's<00:02:04.320> look<00:02:04.619> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.159> Tenth<00:02:05.880> Amendment

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.420 

which<00:02:10.780> states<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.680> powers<00:02:15.160> not

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
which states that the powers not

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.100 
which states that the powers not
delegated<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.180> United<00:02:16.569> States<00:02:16.750> by<00:02:17.080> the
