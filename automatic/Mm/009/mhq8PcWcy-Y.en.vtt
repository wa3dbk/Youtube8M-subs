00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hello everyone is a pleasure as always 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.450
 greet you here on this your channel 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.240
 delight and this time we are going to talk 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 of girls stickers stickers 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.310
 stamps or as you want 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.710
 call him but let's talk about these 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.480
 very nice accessories 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 in my case essential for the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.760
 Nail decoration are a complement 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.309
 very very useful to decorate or design 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.280
 our nails both natural and 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.200
 acrylics when we apply the girls is 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.989
 very important to do it with a pair of tweezers 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.260
 special in this case are a pair of tweezers 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 with a very finite tip to be able to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 detach in a complete way and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.250
 quick each of the stickers that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.320
 we will use can also be done 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.900
 with eyebrow tweezers 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.630
 but as the tip is a little thicker 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.760
 it costs more work and can reach 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.370
 breaking some stickers on everything 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.980
 when they are very thin when we use 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.480
 thick stickers like this is 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.580
 have to look good because the place 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.510
 we can not change it once 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.780
 Market Stall 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.360
 and you have to have preference for 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.330
 delgaditos stickers when we use 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.630
 natural nails why because the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.150
 thin stickers do not need 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.150
 encapsulate as when encapsulated 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.370
 with acrylic or other materials that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 form a simple transparent layer and 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.870
 simply the thinner they are 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.120
 easier application last up to par 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.390
 of the enamel during the same time as 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.510
 our own enameling 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.940
 and it's not going to look protruding like you 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.460
 I repeat when applying a top coat as a layer 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.460
 final is very good when they are a 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.570
 slightly thicker 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.970
 there are times that I use the encapsulation 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.860
 it's just an enamel with a higher 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.190
 density that the top with common 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.260
 when I use it so it's much more 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.739
 thick like this that is a 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.950
 that can even come off if you do not 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:21.829
 it hits very well it's important to apply two 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.860
 layers of top coat but let dry 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:27.060
 first the first one because because if not 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.120
 Bubbles are formed 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.860
 since we apply our stickers 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.290
 It is very very convenient 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.620
 press them well so they remain 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.290
 similar very very uniform the layer 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.230
 transparent end will give you that 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.210
 finished that we need and talking about 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.180
 the colors of the stickers when 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.720
 we use stickers claritos we can 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.230
 adapt very well to colors and designs that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.069
 more agree us why why when 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.799
 we apply a translucent enamel 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.370
 or a small stained glass like this 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:09.400
 the design anyway is going to look and 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.609
 we can complement what we can apply 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.550
 different colors and subsequently 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.560
 we can make points 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.890
 this is especially for those who do not 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.350
 we have the ability to do these 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.500
 drawings with brush 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.990
 This nail design that often 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.300
 freehand or there are many girls 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.770
 who have that great facility to do 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:38.850
 the flowers with acrylic paints 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.620
 like me many times I do not have that 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:44.440
 patience or that skill I do not have 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.430
 developed then why do I turn to 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.799
 the stickers 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.080
 as I comment you can complement 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.780
 with designs 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.640
 simultaneous that is to say we can 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.590
 add lines we can add points 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 we can add and complement with 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.210
 colors and in the end we have to finish 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:14.310
 with a transparent enamel 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.380
 one or two layers as appropriate 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.070
 like all stickers have a great 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.240
 range of designs and colors is why 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 which are one of my favorite elements 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.150
 I highly recommend you to dare to 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.270
 look to experiment 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.450
 make designs as much as your creativity 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.820
 it allows them I hope this video 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.230
 It is very useful to send them a 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.050
 huge huge kiss 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.490
 and see you in the next video up 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.640
 soon 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.640
 bye
