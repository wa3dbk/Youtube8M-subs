00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
wanted to show you a lick in C major two

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.720 
wanted to show you a lick in C major two
five<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.529> lick<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:22.949> two<00:00:23.010> five<00:00:23.279> ones<00:00:23.460> are<00:00:23.640> all

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
five one lick so two five ones are all

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.380 
five one lick so two five ones are all
over<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.180> place<00:00:24.410> in<00:00:25.410> jazz<00:00:26.130> standard<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.119> lot

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
over the place in jazz standard so a lot

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.890 
over the place in jazz standard so a lot
of<00:00:27.420> us<00:00:27.599> tend<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.670> teach<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> practice<00:00:30.510> those

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
of us tend to teach and practice those

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.250 
of us tend to teach and practice those
so<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.289> can<00:00:32.300> handle<00:00:33.300> those<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> various

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
so we can handle those in the various

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
so we can handle those in the various
scenarios<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:35.040> various<00:00:36.030> standards<00:00:38.989> when<00:00:39.989> one

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
scenarios of various standards when one

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
scenarios of various standards when one
idea<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> using<00:00:41.579> minor

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
idea I really like is using minor

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
idea I really like is using minor
Pentatonix<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:43.170> jazz<00:00:44.129> because<00:00:45.260> I've<00:00:46.260> got<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
Pentatonix in jazz because I've got a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
Pentatonix in jazz because I've got a
rock<00:00:47.520> background<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.300> people

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
rock background a lot of people

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.600 
rock background a lot of people
hopefully<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.920> know<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.250> follow<00:00:50.460> my

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
metal background if you're getting into

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.569 
metal background if you're getting into
jazz<00:00:54.620> instead<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> playing<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.399> minor

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
jazz instead of playing a minor

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
jazz instead of playing a minor
pentatonic<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> whole<00:00:57.539> song<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.230> we

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
pentatonic over the whole song like we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.430 
pentatonic over the whole song like we
do<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> Rock<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> times<00:00:59.550> or<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
do in Rock a lot of times or we make it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.329 
do in Rock a lot of times or we make it
bluesy<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.250> blue<00:01:02.699> scales<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:04.339> we

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
bluesy with blue scales and that and we

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.179 
bluesy with blue scales and that and we
can<00:01:05.460> actually<00:01:05.610> take<00:01:05.939> pentatonic<00:01:06.510> ideas<00:01:07.189> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
can actually take pentatonic ideas that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
can actually take pentatonic ideas that
you<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.299> you've<00:01:09.450> heard<00:01:09.630> from

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you that you you know you've heard from

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.520 
you that you you know you've heard from
various<00:01:10.640> musicians<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.180> Coltrane

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
various musicians like Coltrane

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
various musicians like Coltrane
Jerry<00:01:14.280> big<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.640> Z<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:16.430> use<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.000> more

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
Jerry big on Z and use them in a more

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.950 
Jerry big on Z and use them in a more
jazz<00:01:18.420> context<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:20.509> really<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> idea

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
jazz context so I really like the idea

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.899 
jazz context so I really like the idea
of<00:01:22.020> superimposing<00:01:22.830> various<00:01:23.670> minor

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
of superimposing various minor

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
of superimposing various minor
Pentatonix<00:01:24.710> to<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.860> different<00:01:26.189> chord<00:01:27.180> tones

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
Pentatonix to get different chord tones

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.840 
Pentatonix to get different chord tones
and<00:01:27.659> different<00:01:27.930> effects<00:01:28.340> over<00:01:29.340> over<00:01:29.729> each

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and different effects over over each

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.630 
and different effects over over each
chord<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.590> riff<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> lick<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
chord so in the riff in the lick that I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
chord so in the riff in the lick that I
showed<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.950> first<00:01:35.159> chords<00:01:35.460> D<00:01:35.670> minor<00:01:35.939> 7<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:39.710> if

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
showed the first chords D minor 7 so if

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.730 
showed the first chords D minor 7 so if
you<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> fifth<00:01:41.820> position<00:01:42.740> I'm

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you look at in the fifth position I'm

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.050 
you look at in the fifth position I'm
not<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.159> into<00:01:44.369> all<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> minor

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
not going to get into all the minor

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.420 
not going to get into all the minor
pentatonic<00:01:45.240> scales<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.229> but

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.980 

if<00:01:52.880> we<00:01:53.000> look<00:01:53.120> at<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.300> D<00:01:53.420> minor<00:01:53.630> pentatonic

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
if we look at the D minor pentatonic

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.820 
if we look at the D minor pentatonic
scale<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:55.580> took<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.970> just<00:01:56.210> started<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
scale I just took I just started on the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.170 
scale I just took I just started on the
G<00:01:58.570> down<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.900> next<00:02:00.080> note<00:02:00.490> down<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.550> fourth<00:02:01.970> so

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
G down to the next note down a fourth so

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.180 
G down to the next note down a fourth so
I<00:02:02.240> skipped<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.660> pentatonic<00:02:03.760> note<00:02:06.040> and<00:02:07.040> then<00:02:07.160> I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
I skipped the pentatonic note and then I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.500 
I skipped the pentatonic note and then I
went<00:02:07.370> down<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.730> the<00:02:07.820> next<00:02:08.000> pentatonic<00:02:08.509> note<00:02:10.510> so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
went down to the next pentatonic note so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.250 
went down to the next pentatonic note so
that's<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.870> little<00:02:12.290> motif<00:02:13.810> if<00:02:14.810> we<00:02:14.990> want<00:02:15.170> to

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
that's like a little motif if we want to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.280 
that's like a little motif if we want to
play<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.160> again<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:17.030> D<00:02:17.270> minor<00:02:17.620> pentatonic

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
play that again in D minor pentatonic

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.010 
play that again in D minor pentatonic
and<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.710> say<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.100> we<00:02:22.970> repeat<00:02:23.330> it<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:23.720> start

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
and we say we we repeat it now we start

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.100 
and we say we we repeat it now we start
on<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.170> D<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> you<00:02:29.480> could<00:02:29.750> take<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.930> little

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
on the D so you could take a little

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.510 
on the D so you could take a little
sequence<00:02:30.590> like<00:02:30.709> that<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:30.980> repeat<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.370> within

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
sequence like that and repeat it within

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.340 
sequence like that and repeat it within
the<00:02:31.820> scale<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.040> wanted<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.370> do<00:02:34.520> was

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
the scale but what I wanted to do was

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.420 
the scale but what I wanted to do was
adjust<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.940> over<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> g7<00:02:39.020> I'm<00:02:39.770> playing<00:02:40.250> I

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
adjust it so over the g7 I'm playing I

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.070 
adjust it so over the g7 I'm playing I
want<00:02:40.580> to<00:02:40.640> get<00:02:40.760> some<00:02:40.880> altered<00:02:41.209> tones<00:02:41.480> so

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
want to get some altered tones so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.390 
want to get some altered tones so
instead<00:02:42.350> of<00:02:42.440> sticking<00:02:42.770> with<00:02:43.010> D<00:02:43.130> minor

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
instead of sticking with D minor

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.680 
instead of sticking with D minor
pentatonic<00:02:44.290> which<00:02:45.290> would<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:45.590> been

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
pentatonic which would have been

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.850 
pentatonic which would have been
diatonic<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.780> very<00:02:47.959> melodic<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:48.590> everything

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
diatonic and very melodic and everything

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460 
diatonic and very melodic and everything
I<00:02:49.040> decided<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.910> switch<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.510> B<00:02:50.750> flat<00:02:50.900> minor

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
I decided to switch to a B flat minor

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.290 
I decided to switch to a B flat minor
pentatonic<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:54.130> that's<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.670> get<00:02:55.820> altered

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
pentatonic and that's to get altered

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.830 
pentatonic and that's to get altered
tones<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.709> g7<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.790> if<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.600> play<00:03:02.810> a

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
tones in the g7 and so if we play a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.770 
tones in the g7 and so if we play a
b-flat<00:03:03.260> in<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.550> same<00:03:04.760> general<00:03:05.060> area<00:03:05.269> so<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.630> was

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
b-flat in the same general area so I was

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.479 
b-flat in the same general area so I was
in<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.959> fifth<00:03:06.140> fret<00:03:06.290> Nam<00:03:06.500> shifting<00:03:07.100> up<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
in the fifth fret Nam shifting up to the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.280 
in the fifth fret Nam shifting up to the
sixth<00:03:07.760> fret<00:03:12.940> so<00:03:13.940> that's<00:03:14.120> over<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.540> G<00:03:14.720> seven<00:03:14.959> so

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
sixth fret so that's over the G seven so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
sixth fret so that's over the G seven so
that's<00:03:15.380> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.620> give<00:03:15.739> us<00:03:15.830> a<00:03:15.920> whole<00:03:16.010> bunch<00:03:16.070> of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
that's going to give us a whole bunch of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.690 
that's going to give us a whole bunch of
altered<00:03:16.670> tones<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:18.320> get<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.560> F<00:03:18.680> which<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.670> a

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
altered tones you get the F which is a

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.420 
altered tones you get the F which is a
minor<00:03:20.360> seventh<00:03:20.780> of<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.440> g7<00:03:21.739> chord<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.220> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
minor seventh of the g7 chord but the

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.880 
minor seventh of the g7 chord but the
rest<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.760> them<00:03:22.880> we've<00:03:23.780> got<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:24.050> B<00:03:24.200> flat<00:03:24.410> which

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
rest of them we've got the B flat which

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.309 
rest of them we've got the B flat which
is<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.540> sharp<00:03:26.540> nine

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
is the sharp nine

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.540 
is the sharp nine
got<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> flat<00:03:29.880> which<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.060> flat<00:03:31.180> nine

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
got the a flat which is the flat nine

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.530 
got the a flat which is the flat nine
you<00:03:33.550> got<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.849> flat<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.360> D<00:03:34.480> flat<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:36.540> that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
you got a flat and D flat so that's that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.059 
you got a flat and D flat so that's that
could<00:03:37.630> be<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.900> flat<00:03:38.200> six<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.650> sharp<00:03:38.890> five

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
could be the flat six of the sharp five

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.370 
could be the flat six of the sharp five
and<00:03:39.280> then<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.430> come<00:03:39.780> sharp<00:03:40.780> four<00:03:41.020> or<00:03:41.170> sharp

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
and then you come sharp four or sharp

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.780 
and then you come sharp four or sharp
eleven<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:44.099> so<00:03:45.099> that's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> good<00:03:45.489> one

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
eleven so so that's a good one

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.300 
eleven so so that's a good one
so<00:03:46.300> when<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.480> take<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:50.349> then<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.800> shift<00:03:51.130> it

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
so when I take this and then I shift it

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.390 
so when I take this and then I shift it
now<00:03:51.430> over<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.790> g7<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.709> then<00:03:56.709> when<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.160> finally

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
now over the g7 and then when I finally

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.300 
now over the g7 and then when I finally
go<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.819> C<00:03:58.000> major<00:03:58.180> seven<00:03:58.800> I'm<00:03:59.800> gonna<00:03:59.980> use<00:04:00.160> an

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
go to the C major seven I'm gonna use an

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.840 
go to the C major seven I'm gonna use an
E<00:04:00.400> minor<00:04:00.580> pentatonic<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:05.280> so<00:04:06.280> that's<00:04:06.459> starting

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
E minor pentatonic so so that's starting

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.500 
E minor pentatonic so so that's starting
on<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.090> B<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.220> I've<00:04:09.310> got<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:09.640> sheet<00:04:10.090> music<00:04:10.209> in

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
on the B so I've got the sheet music in

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.890 
on the B so I've got the sheet music in
the<00:04:10.600> tab<00:04:10.810> on<00:04:11.200> my<00:04:11.790> website<00:04:12.790> will<00:04:13.090> Christie<00:04:13.480> calm

I<00:04:42.910> would<00:04:43.510> suggest<00:04:43.840> taking<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:45.150> couple<00:04:46.150> of

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
I would suggest taking a couple of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.610 
I would suggest taking a couple of
approaches<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.720> expand<00:04:47.260> on<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:47.860> could

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
approaches to expand on this you could

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.650 
approaches to expand on this you could
you<00:04:50.620> could<00:04:50.800> sort<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.220> expand<00:04:52.210> on<00:04:52.390> what<00:04:52.539> I'm

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
you could sort of expand on what I'm

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.360 
you could sort of expand on what I'm
doing<00:04:52.960> just<00:04:53.080> with<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.440> scale<00:04:53.710> itself<00:04:54.039> stay

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
doing just with the scale itself stay

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.200 
doing just with the scale itself stay
where<00:04:54.550> you<00:04:54.729> are<00:04:54.760> stay<00:04:55.180> where<00:04:55.300> I<00:04:55.330> am<00:04:55.419> here<00:04:57.210> do

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
where you are stay where I am here do

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:07.260 
where you are stay where I am here do
different<00:04:58.539> things<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.550> kind<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.030> keep<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
different things so you kind of keep the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.120 
different things so you kind of keep the
same<00:05:07.479> scale<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:07.990> you<00:05:08.020> got<00:05:08.229> the<00:05:08.320> D<00:05:08.440> minor<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:08.950> B

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
same scale so you got the D minor that B

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.650 
same scale so you got the D minor that B
flat<00:05:09.370> minor<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.970> e<00:05:10.560> minor<00:05:11.560> pentatonic

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
flat minor and the e minor pentatonic

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.969 
flat minor and the e minor pentatonic
you<00:05:13.660> know<00:05:13.750> add<00:05:13.990> more<00:05:14.169> notes<00:05:14.410> play<00:05:14.710> around<00:05:14.860> with

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
you know add more notes play around with

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.770 
you know add more notes play around with
that<00:05:15.130> being<00:05:15.520> able<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.760> shift<00:05:16.030> between<00:05:16.630> the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
that being able to shift between the

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.120 
that being able to shift between the
scales<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.320> then<00:05:17.380> the<00:05:17.620> other<00:05:17.740> thing<00:05:17.919> is<00:05:17.950> to

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
scales and then the other thing is to

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.230 
scales and then the other thing is to
take<00:05:18.310> it<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.669> play<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:18.850> in<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> other

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
take it and play it in the other

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.990 
take it and play it in the other
position<00:05:19.900> so<00:05:20.169> I<00:05:20.380> like<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.160> teach<00:05:21.340> kind<00:05:21.880> of<00:05:21.940> a

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
position so I like to teach kind of a

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.620 
position so I like to teach kind of a
caged<00:05:22.240> mentality<00:05:23.880> the<00:05:24.880> Caged<00:05:25.060> system<00:05:25.090> has

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
caged mentality the Caged system has

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.719 
caged mentality the Caged system has
five<00:05:27.389> shapes<00:05:28.620> so<00:05:29.620> if<00:05:30.010> you're<00:05:30.190> learning<00:05:30.310> say<00:05:30.669> C

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
five shapes so if you're learning say C

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.510 
five shapes so if you're learning say C
major<00:05:31.060> scale<00:05:31.300> in<00:05:31.630> five<00:05:31.780> positions<00:05:32.289> that<00:05:33.250> those

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
major scale in five positions that those

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.740 
major scale in five positions that those
are<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.760> same<00:05:33.940> notes<00:05:34.150> is<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.419> a<00:05:34.450> minor

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
are the same notes is the a minor

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.810 
are the same notes is the a minor
pentatonic<00:05:35.159> so<00:05:36.159> you've<00:05:36.310> got<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.490> minor

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
pentatonic so you've got a minor

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.420 
pentatonic so you've got a minor
pentatonic<00:05:37.030> in<00:05:37.479> five<00:05:37.659> positions<00:05:38.200> so<00:05:39.010> if<00:05:39.310> I

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
pentatonic in five positions so if I

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.370 
pentatonic in five positions so if I
like<00:05:39.640> I<00:05:39.789> did<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.030> do

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
like I did to do

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.190 
like I did to do
here<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:41.550> the<00:05:41.670> fifth<00:05:41.910> fret<00:05:42.030> you'd<00:05:42.840> want<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.080> do

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
here on the fifth fret you'd want to do

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.420 
here on the fifth fret you'd want to do
it<00:05:43.350> like<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.620> know<00:05:43.710> other<00:05:43.950> positions<00:05:44.310> but

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
it like you know other positions but

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.430 
it like you know other positions but
here's<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.730> common<00:05:45.060> one<00:05:45.240> tenth<00:05:45.660> fret<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.990> then

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
here's a common one tenth fret and then

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.440 
here's a common one tenth fret and then
you<00:05:49.530> then<00:05:49.830> you'd<00:05:50.010> play<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.310> b-flat<00:05:50.760> minor<00:05:51.060> in

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
you then you'd play the b-flat minor in

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.300 
you then you'd play the b-flat minor in
the<00:05:52.110> same<00:05:52.350> area<00:05:54.710> one<00:05:55.710> thing<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:55.950> can<00:05:56.070> do<00:05:56.160> if

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
the same area one thing you can do if

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.130 
the same area one thing you can do if
you<00:05:57.120> don't<00:05:57.240> have<00:05:57.330> to<00:05:57.420> play<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.660> whole<00:05:57.780> scale

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
you don't have to play the whole scale

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.960 
you don't have to play the whole scale
all<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.500> time<00:05:58.710> you<00:05:59.460> can<00:05:59.580> just<00:05:59.760> stick<00:05:59.940> to<00:06:00.410> a

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
all the time you can just stick to a

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.430 
all the time you can just stick to a
couple<00:06:02.970> of<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.480> a<00:06:03.600> few<00:06:03.720> notes<00:06:03.900> or<00:06:04.140> a<00:06:04.170> couple

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
couple of just a few notes or a couple

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.740 
couple of just a few notes or a couple
of<00:06:04.530> strings<00:06:04.860> so<00:06:05.100> like<00:06:05.280> if<00:06:05.400> I<00:06:05.490> do<00:06:05.550> D<00:06:06.450> minor<00:06:06.800> 9

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
of strings so like if I do D minor 9

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.730 
of strings so like if I do D minor 9
just<00:06:09.750> stick<00:06:09.900> on<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.140> two<00:06:10.290> middle<00:06:10.530> strings

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
just stick on the two middle strings

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:18.290 
just stick on the two middle strings
fifth<00:06:11.490> fret<00:06:11.670> seventh<00:06:12.090> fret<00:06:16.970> see<00:06:17.970> how<00:06:18.060> that's

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
fifth fret seventh fret see how that's

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.810 
fifth fret seventh fret see how that's
so<00:06:18.570> easy<00:06:18.720> to<00:06:19.050> do<00:06:20.210> by<00:06:21.210> just<00:06:21.510> shifting<00:06:22.080> up<00:06:22.410> a<00:06:22.820> fret

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
so easy to do by just shifting up a fret

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:38.630 
so easy to do by just shifting up a fret
so<00:06:24.540> if<00:06:24.660> I<00:06:24.750> got<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:24.990> D<00:06:25.110> minor<00:06:36.200> so<00:06:37.340> I've<00:06:38.340> played

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
so if I got the D minor so I've played

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.880 
so if I got the D minor so I've played
you<00:06:39.120> know<00:06:39.210> theoretically<00:06:39.560> three<00:06:40.560> different

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
you know theoretically three different

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.680 
you know theoretically three different
pentatonic<00:06:41.460> scales<00:06:41.760> but<00:06:42.090> I've<00:06:42.210> just<00:06:42.240> taken

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
pentatonic scales but I've just taken

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.890 
pentatonic scales but I've just taken
that<00:06:42.930> idea<00:06:46.340> so<00:06:47.340> you<00:06:48.270> could<00:06:48.390> experiment<00:06:48.660> with

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
that idea so you could experiment with

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.470 
that idea so you could experiment with
that<00:06:48.990> like<00:06:49.170> just<00:06:49.350> try<00:06:49.680> two<00:06:49.740> strings<00:06:50.190> or<00:06:50.610> one

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480 
that like just try two strings or one

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.220 
that like just try two strings or one
even<00:06:52.130> just<00:06:53.130> to<00:06:53.640> get<00:06:53.820> going<00:06:54.030> and<00:06:54.330> then<00:06:54.750> expand

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
even just to get going and then expand

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.760 
even just to get going and then expand
your<00:06:55.980> your<00:06:56.820> fretboard<00:06:57.330> knowledge<00:06:58.230> as<00:06:58.410> you<00:06:58.440> as

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
your your fretboard knowledge as you as

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.160 
your your fretboard knowledge as you as
you<00:06:58.920> go<00:06:59.070> so<00:06:59.510> anyways<00:07:00.510> I'm<00:07:00.720> going<00:07:00.840> to<00:07:00.930> cut<00:07:01.050> that
