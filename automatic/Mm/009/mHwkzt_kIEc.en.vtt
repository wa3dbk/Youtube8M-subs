00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:19.387
Curiouser and curiouser,

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:27.225
It just gets curiouser and curiouser today.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.250
I knew who I was this morning,

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.299
but now, without warning,

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:42.383
I am someone else, or something else, but

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:46.416
I am not myself.

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:12.303
The further I go,

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:16.507
the less I seem to know.

00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.231
That's the way that it's been happening today.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.860
And the creatures that I am meeting here

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
are ridiculous exceedinglier,

00:01:35.974 --> 00:01:38.974
I am some place else, I need some help

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:42.944
to come back to myself.

00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:55.797
If only I could recite

00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:59.532
a song and get it right,

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:03.033
then I'd know I did have half my brain

00:02:04.813 --> 00:02:07.813
and the rest may follow it back again.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.810
But as soon as I start a song,

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:16.042
it comes out totally wrong!

00:02:16.385 --> 00:02:19.385
And the words I sing have no meaning,

00:02:22.028 --> 00:02:25.028
and everything just seems to become...

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:31.114
curiouser

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.059
and curiouser...

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.238
I just gets curiouser and curiouser today.

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.937
I knew who I was this morning,

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:52.247
but now, without warning

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140
I am someone else, or something else,

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.659
but I am not myself.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.610
Curious!
