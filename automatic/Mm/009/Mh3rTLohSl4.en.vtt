00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 very good guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 fourth questions and answers that I'm going to 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.010
 do on the channel in the description 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.389
 you have the other three videos, it's worth it 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.469
 that if you want to see them you have them in the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.330
 description so as not to repeat 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.769
 questions and good what you see in the background 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.450
 it's a game for warfare but good 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 the later I'm sorry if so much 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 the channel is going to hit a very 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.250
 drastic and they will start to see less 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.740
 gameplays and others because good here one 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.300
 focused in some other way but well 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.160
 we go there with the first question not 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.930
 born youtube saves when it was the first 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.789
 time you get your glasses sucking yourself 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 you have to here to have a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.070
 goop is worth every hand I tried to suck 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.890
 good 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.620
 I remember there for 15 years ago 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.950
 about four years that I was curious 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.980
 for knowing what it would be like to suck a 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.170
 penis and so on then one day I decided 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.840
 When I was showering, well, the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.309
 member became strong only you know 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.910
 sometimes the boys without thinking 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.820
 nothing is put on you and I said good we're going to 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.500
 try to lower your head little by little 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.320
 well I saw that it did not arrive because standing 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.810
 my penis did not reach 10 meters 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.270
 although we were small but good and I went to 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 sit down and well I tried little by little to lower 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.070
 so take out the tongue and so on and so 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.890
 because the rest do not think I imagine 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.240
 It's a little guariglio but the truth is 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.100
 is that they stop me sucking with 15 years 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.170
 a long time ago obviously ok let's go 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.789
 There is obviously no way 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.250
 I tried to suck and I do not understand people 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.050
 who thinks those weird things 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.910
 if you are fag and gives you to be able 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.420
 take the other and sucks another 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.070
 I do not know 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.659
 I've never tried that or I'm going to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.979
 trying is not something that happens to me 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.930
 by the mind I think that I see it as a 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.340
 little sick since fact part of the ti 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.659
 Even though it is true that there was 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.610
 a man who took off his ribs 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.229
 I do not know what to bend can be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 sucking will be a super weird move but 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 well let's leave that bullshit 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 because I think that is mentally ill 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.299
 more than anything else and we go to the next 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.090
 ask the next question na 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.350
 question was serious and fifteen cody some 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.360
 once you question this if your time in 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.619
 youtube is being a loss I do not know is 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.210
 that I like to upload videos but 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.100
 sincerely in a future of 4 years not 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.360
 I see myself uploading videos I wanted to know if 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.619
 you too you stop you ever 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.179
 reflect if your time from youtube 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.549
 could devote to other things 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.410
 a greeting crack sincerely me 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.450
 I question the youtube each and every one 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.250
 of the days each and every day 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.410
 I think if this is really worth it 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.600
 or not but also every day I think that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.000
 this is a dream and what I want is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.890
 get it and when I propose something 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.319
 until I fill up I will not stop or 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.940
 it is equal to the best in a future not 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.260
 He saw me on YouTube but with this I 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.030
 I can get to earn a living sometime 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.980
 it's going to be my job because it really is 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.230
 what I like and if I like something 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.450
 apart from that it gets in your head I'm going to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 go for it to sack do not let anything 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 nor will anyone prevent you 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.540
 and as much as you think it is impossible 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.579
 or however much do not you see yourself in here 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.250
 if you really like something and give for it 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.010
 and there is no more mystery to me 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.140
 I like youtube and as such I'm going to 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.819
 go behind him and it does not matter if 4 or 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.670
 5 years and I still like it simply 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.340
 adapt youtube to how I am in that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.140
 moment or how I am at that moment and not 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.060
 I know is my point of view I think that 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.310
 we all regret ever 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.139
 all the people like more or less me that 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.909
 they are stuck a bit with their channel 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.079
 although good my channel is a bit weird to 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.209
 times we take many times not 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.970
 we grow nothing and I think that's what 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.590
 what else makes you question things 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.530
 but good inside the bad good eye 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.060
 here to the city but good and I think 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.010
 that what makes you question being 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 on YouTube or not or see you or not because 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
 you know that depending on what to say 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.870
 some way the age of being here 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.939
 inside can make you question by the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.410
 people of 30 40 and 50 years earning the 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.240
 life with youtube 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.800
 and well then that the truth is that yes 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.150
 that I question it but not no 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.190
 I would have lost time because I have 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.810
 my time for that and I decide to do what 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.550
 do with it so nothing a greeting for 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590
 you and I hope the answer pretty much 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.510
 has served and well we go with the last 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.710
 question miriam molina here ask me 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.020
 how do you get into the world of 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.360
 Anime as you met him and by whom 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.860
 data go to questions make me focus 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.110
 in the world of good anime you know 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 Do not know naruto wampis and dragon 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.670
 ball for example is anime I only saw 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.150
 as drawings but one day I was by 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.410
 tuenti and a friend tweeted a picture of a 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.080
 anime called high school of the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.180
 dead my first anime so to speak of 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.970
 some way and I do not know I started to see that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.620
 anime and I liked it a lot then 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.970
 did not start to see more anime because 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.940
 well, I never had fun 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.170
 about having to read the subtitles 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.400
 sleeves do not just read it 's very weird that 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.850
 I read manga and I can like it a lot 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.990
 unanimous 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.729
 I did not like to read though 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.199
 end you get used to it and it's like 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.270
 if nothing I think it is that the book does not 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.479
 this is more I want to learn a little 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.530
 of Japanese you got some Japanese tea 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.389
 I can keep more or less a 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.800
 conversation could be done between 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.419
 quotes in plan like when you 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.040
 chapurrea 'singles' then I more or less 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.990
 could japanese 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.550
 and well the truth is that I went for 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.800
 that image that I saw I liked that anime and 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.630
 since then I started to see a lot more 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.040
 encourage that would be how you met him and 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.140
 by whom and good it would be for a friend who 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.600
 it's called kevin and the truth is that day 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.130
 today I do not regret having seen 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.750
 that image and of having gotten myself into this 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.009
 world since it has made me know 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.039
 many people 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.110
 do not see nor less simply make me 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.749
 circumvent reality and see other things and 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.789
 I like a lot because sometimes I 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.800
 it makes you think and so on and it's I do not know is 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.240
 quite fun to watch anime so 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.649
 nothing guys here we are going to leave this 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.360
