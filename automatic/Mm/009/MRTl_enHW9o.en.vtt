 this video is not going to be commented I'm not going 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.000
 to comment the game I will explain a 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.670
 little the class that I take and I'll go to 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 grain about what I want to talk about I have 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.950
 the msr col 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 streak specialist hard line hunter 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.420
 and extreme secondary conditions do not 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.570
 agreement which one I carry and I carry grenade 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.890
 smoke and knife throws made 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.890
 and now what was going 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:57.300
 I inform you that during these two 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.910
 months until it's not summer I'm not going to 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.800
 upload many videos for problems of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.800
 exams and all of that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:12.050
 I'm going to try to go up to some or some 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.810
 video of the play of the week 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.600
 of mini graf or something but I do not assure you 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 nothing 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.270
 because I have many exams lately 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.979
 and then the problem is that I 'm not going to 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.770
 I can record a lot, I will not be able to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.800
 connect a lot to play and not being able to 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:34.760
 play a lot I do not get good games 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.930
 and I will upload about all of 1000 craft me 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.490
 imagine of minecraft or of plays of the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.280
 week as you have already checked 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 this week I did not go up 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.490
 episode 4 I think that's what the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.110
 plays of the week is because I have not 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.430
 I could connect a lot and I have not done 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.780
 no good play 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 and also now I want to comment to you like this 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.610
 the new ones to say it some 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.840
 the new series that I'm going to upload to my 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.060
 channel that I'm going to upload 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.120
 I think there are four series of modern no 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.319
 four series of minecraft and modern 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:22.950
 warfare 3 are going to be two or three I think 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:28.159
 those of my black are going to be like that with 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.159
 the mods of house that willy rex uses 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.030
 a base like that I'll explain a little how 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.020
 are going to be the series end craft one 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 base on this in with the mods just using 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.750
 the mods another underground base 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.650
 and underground and then the others still 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.650
 I do not have it very clear 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.829
 but I will go up 4 sure 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.730
 and now the modern warfare 3 that I'm going 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.849
 to climb I think they are 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.879
 3 wait a second the notebook that the 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.700
 I point everything because if things do not 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.610
 forget the series and everything will go up 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:19.830
 the modern warfare 3 I will climb 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:23.620
 three series that one is already longer 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.239
 times that the play of the week 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.780
 the other two is that I bought a 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.780
 command of xbox 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.780
 I'm going to record all the games that I 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.900
 take out the command of xbox and let's see 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:41.510
 the process of mine playing 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.950
 if I'm better or worse what 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:49.060
 then I will also raise a slope as a 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.060
 label the difference 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.159
 and then another one that I have thought 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.370
 it's going to be from a game that I bought myself makes 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.700
 little and saint row the trees I think it 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.700
 He says 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.500
 that I'm going to go up like I'm doing 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.500
 by the city 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.160
 and I'm going to upload what else I'm going to 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.620
 climb I will also go up to channel three 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.079
 top 10 modes 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.139
 or see three types of top 10 that one goes 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.700
 to be a sniper another normal with laser 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.180
 against the weapons that go between the weapons 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:32.400
 and everything and another will be thrown to 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.400
 knife to all kinds of knives 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:40.060
 if you want you can pass clips and I 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.060
 point according creates 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.780
 according to what I'm going to score 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:53.580
 the top 10 will ascend into the canal to 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.889
 top 10 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:01.180
 and the rest I will give 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.569
 thanks for having sent me the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.330
 clips 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:10.069
 and also what else to say is that I do not know 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.069
 I think I've said all 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.680
 Well also tell you that still the 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.090
 titles of the series I do not have 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.190
 decided 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.080
 I have not said no yet be 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.080
 no serial title I have decided 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.960
 and I do not know what else to say or because I 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.960
 I think I 've already told everything 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.889
 so good yes 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.180
 nothing more that this during these two 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.350
 months I will not be able to upload many videos 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.150
 that in summer I will go up more and also 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.910
 tell you that for the reason that I do not upload 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.449
 many videos is because my computer does not 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.629
 is very good 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.100
 and I have I think it's a mega upload or 

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:57.350
 less 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.770
 and then it takes me a lot to render the 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.449
 video 7 hours and on to get up 8 or so 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.220
 and I'm going to buy a new computer 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.750
 it will take less to render 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.030
 can go up if I imagine equal to not 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.330
 be that I changed company that 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.330
 I'm thinking 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.750
 but it still does not follow 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.800
 tell you because I know everything is already 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.800
 saying 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.590
 that I know there is no more to tell 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:33.360
 the game has little left because I'm just going 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:36.480
 to raise half of the game because 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.430
 then the responder returns crazy and 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.220
 they kill me quite 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:46.850
 but here I think he had a run of 18 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.850
 of 17 with the sniper and the acr 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.630
 and I do not know what else to say because I 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.630
 I think there's nothing more to say 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.170
 here the streak fills me and I think that 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.030
 I'm going to leave it here because she 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.630
 he always starts to come back he answers a 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.630
 little crazy 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.150
 and nothing more to say to you and good bye
