00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.930
 we selected a team practically 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 all new 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.000
 the staff and had even experience of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.920
 organization own competition project 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.570
 but the team was relatively 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.570
 well committed 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.250
 we have evolved a lot of cars we have 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.980
 a project last year on types such as 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 this project because the car is good and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.440
 trustworthy 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 I think I've already finished enduro with 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.710
 a good placement is testing that the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 did 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.820
 taking all that is to have the experience 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 who played in a year on the track and see what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.390
 that works 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.479
 and we have to design have to 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.229
 build have you have work in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 team is timeline 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.729
 There's everything here. It's complete. It's a 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.710
 experience that everyone should have 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.970
 bruguera if you learn a lot 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.970
 will not have in the classroom 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.920
 one thing is you see in theory is not another 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.689
 thing is you put into practice this 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.369
 will come on time with solutions you 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.159
 I never imagined that I would need to know 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.549
 deal with a timeline with the boss 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.039
 called by the teacher charging time 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.110
 charging service and always trying to do 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.430
 the right is to learn to learn 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.430
 even learn that people are building 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.009
 the race that this professional thinks very 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.840
 interesting because it has everything 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.720
 working with all areas from the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.670
 marketing even with the own engineer 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.800
 mechanic developing the project until the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.230
 person who will attend will organize 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.800
 more workshop shows how the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.800
 our administration 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.710
 It's just an experience of a car is a 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.570
 life experience an experience of 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.570
 to be the team friendship work and everything 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.340
 just watched apps the mechanical engineers 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.260
 in MauÃ¡ is a perfect competition is not 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.640
 only do mechanical engineering business 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.190
 It is building the marzipan Mogiana 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.750
 and having fun here after the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.420

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.590
 Do you like with your friends and learning? 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.590
 presenting his power 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.910
 it is still good that it offers and the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.430
 people have to enjoy it and it was one 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.890
 something everyone should do at least 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.470
 some time for scientific what about 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.470
 It's good to have such an opportunity.
