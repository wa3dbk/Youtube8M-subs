00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
have an idea already what they could be
but<00:01:04.710> let's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> look<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.220> goal<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.519> no

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
problem with these accuracy accuracy

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
problem with these accuracy accuracy
feeling<00:01:07.350> pretty<00:01:07.500> good<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.220> let's<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> down

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
feeling pretty good so let's go the down

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600 
feeling pretty good so let's go the down
the<00:01:09.000> line<00:01:09.180> view<00:01:09.750> first<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.740> as<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the line view first of all so as we can

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.859 
the line view first of all so as we can
see<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.240> we're<00:01:12.360> not<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> spend

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
see from here we're not going to spend

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.630 
see from here we're not going to spend
too<00:01:12.990> much<00:01:13.110> time<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.340> look<00:01:14.549> at

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
too much time on this but if we look at

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.370 
too much time on this but if we look at
the<00:01:14.729> path<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> club<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> way<00:01:15.750> down<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the path of the club on the way down it

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.399 
the path of the club on the way down it
may<00:01:17.040> be<00:01:17.100> ever<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.790> slightly<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.020> top<00:01:19.229> of

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
may be ever so slightly over the top of

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.770 
may be ever so slightly over the top of
the<00:01:19.500> plane<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:20.580> cause<00:01:20.850> slight<00:01:21.180> directional

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the plane could cause slight directional

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
the plane could cause slight directional
problems<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.350> obviously<00:01:22.740> we<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> get

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
problems but obviously we want to get

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
problems but obviously we want to get
solid<00:01:23.700> contact<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.170> look<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
solid contact now if we look at it from

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
solid contact now if we look at it from
the<00:01:25.799> front<00:01:26.189> view<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.450> our<00:01:27.570> analysis

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
the front view so if we get our analysis

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.200 
the front view so if we get our analysis
lines<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.799> place<00:01:29.130> here<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> see

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
lines in place here just so we can see

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.630 
lines in place here just so we can see
what<00:01:30.360> goes<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> gets<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> top<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what goes on now as it gets the top of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.270 
what goes on now as it gets the top of
the<00:01:32.700> backswing<00:01:33.150> look<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> right<00:01:34.259> foot<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the backswing look at the right foot so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.770 
the backswing look at the right foot so
you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> trail<00:01:36.030> foot<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you can see the trail foot there is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
you can see the trail foot there is
rolling<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:37.979> rolling<00:01:38.159> out

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
rolling out and it's rolling out

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.830 
rolling out and it's rolling out
considerably<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.060> mean<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.720> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
considerably I mean this is going to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
considerably I mean this is going to
really<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> difficult<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> start

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
really make it difficult from the start

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
really make it difficult from the start
the<00:01:42.090> downswing<00:01:42.479> as<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.869> want<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.710> can<00:01:43.829> see

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the downswing as we want so we can see

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
the downswing as we want so we can see
that<00:01:44.070> right<00:01:44.399> foot<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> rolling<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that right foot is rolling now as the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.410 
that right foot is rolling now as the
downswing<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> starting<00:01:47.610> obviously<00:01:48.270> he's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
downswing is starting obviously he's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760 
downswing is starting obviously he's
going<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.600> play<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> lot<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.049> catch-up<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.649> get

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going to play a lot of catch-up to get

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
going to play a lot of catch-up to get
that<00:01:49.890> right<00:01:50.100> foot<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:50.700> push<00:01:51.000> from

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that right foot down and then push from

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
that right foot down and then push from
that<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:52.110> move<00:01:52.259> towards<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.829> gold<00:01:53.040> pull<00:01:53.250> them

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
that to move towards the gold pull them

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.190 
that to move towards the gold pull them
towards<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> target<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.689> can<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:54.990> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
towards the target and we can see as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.319 
towards the target and we can see as
Nicholas<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.100> coming<00:01:56.399> into<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.880> golf<00:01:57.090> ball

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
Nicholas is coming into the golf ball

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.899 
Nicholas is coming into the golf ball
the<00:01:57.689> head<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> hanging<00:01:58.560> back<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.159> shoulder<00:01:59.759> is

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the head is hanging back the shoulder is

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.569 
the head is hanging back the shoulder is
well<00:02:00.240> back<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.979> obviously<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> see<00:02:02.430> from

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
well back and obviously we can see from

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.010 
well back and obviously we can see from
here<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.850> shaft<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> pretty<00:02:03.540> much<00:02:03.630> pointing

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
here the shaft is pretty much pointing

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.480 
here the shaft is pretty much pointing
up<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.290> body<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.680> he<00:02:04.799> strikes<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> golf

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
up at the body as he strikes the golf

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.429 
up at the body as he strikes the golf
ball<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:06.240> means<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> bottom<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> swing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
ball which means the bottom of the swing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.680 
ball which means the bottom of the swing
is<00:02:07.619> happening<00:02:08.160> before<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.940> balls<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.390> sense

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
is happening before the balls make sense

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.240 
is happening before the balls make sense
makes<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> lot<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> sense<00:02:10.619> there<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.039> basically

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
makes a lot of sense there so basically

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.920 
makes a lot of sense there so basically
what<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.760> saying<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.450> spend<00:02:12.720> too

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
what we're saying is if you spend too

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.760 
what we're saying is if you spend too
much<00:02:13.110> time<00:02:13.170> be

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
much time be

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.710 
much time be
find<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> golf<00:02:14.340> ball<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.570> to<00:02:15.660> hit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
find the golf ball you are going to hit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330 
find the golf ball you are going to hit
the<00:02:15.870> ground<00:02:16.050> before<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.530> ball<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
the ground before the ball so if you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.650 
the ground before the ball so if you
don't<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.910> ground<00:02:18.120> before<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.510> ball

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
don't get the ground before the ball

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.880 
don't get the ground before the ball
maybe<00:02:18.870> if<00:02:18.990> you're<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> tee<00:02:19.350> peg<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.770> on<00:02:19.830> a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
maybe if you're on a tee peg or on a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.040 
maybe if you're on a tee peg or on a
nice<00:02:20.070> lie<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.940> might<00:02:21.090> get<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.330> good<00:02:21.510> strike<00:02:21.810> but

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
nice lie you might get a good strike but

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.900 
nice lie you might get a good strike but
it's<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.440> go<00:02:22.680> under<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.310> air<00:02:23.490> stand

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's going to go under the air stand

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's going to go under the air stand
somehow<00:02:24.180> it's<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.020> very<00:02:25.230> common<00:02:25.500> fault<00:02:26.450> racket

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
somehow it's a very common fault racket

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.970 
somehow it's a very common fault racket
it's<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.690> big<00:02:27.840> one<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.410> massive<00:02:28.710> one<00:02:28.740> who

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
it's a big one it's a massive one who

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710 
it's a big one it's a massive one who
the<00:02:29.100> ability<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.700> shift<00:02:29.940> weight<00:02:30.240> towards

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the ability to just shift weight towards

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.720 
the ability to just shift weight towards
a<00:02:30.780> target<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.590> think<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.250> good<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.610> is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
a target so I think the good thing is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.280 
a target so I think the good thing is
Andy<00:02:32.970> let's<00:02:33.150> get<00:02:33.330> straight<00:02:33.750> away<00:02:33.990> into<00:02:34.170> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
Andy let's get straight away into a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.530 
Andy let's get straight away into a
drill<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:34.950> show<00:02:35.370> how<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.940> do<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.330> so

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
drill and show how we can do this so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.180 
drill and show how we can do this so
actually<00:02:36.930> well<00:02:37.200> get<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> drill<00:02:37.860> ready

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
actually well get to get the drill ready

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.890 
actually well get to get the drill ready
but<00:02:38.640> let's<00:02:38.760> perhaps<00:02:39.000> go<00:02:39.180> with<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.540> we<00:02:39.660> want

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
but let's perhaps go with what we want

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.050 
but let's perhaps go with what we want
to<00:02:40.050> see<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.380> impact<00:02:40.890> okay<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.370> let<00:02:41.910> me<00:02:41.940> just

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
to see at impact okay so let me just

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.700 
to see at impact okay so let me just
place<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.110> right<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.350> get<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.590> in

place that in the right we get that in

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.110 
place that in the right we get that in

his right side at impact so again the

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.090 
his right side at impact so again the
shaft<00:02:57.720> leaning<00:02:58.080> back<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> lot<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.740> loft<00:02:58.890> is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
shaft leaning back a lot of loft is

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.710 
shaft leaning back a lot of loft is
presented<00:02:59.580> to<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.700> there<00:03:00.030> and<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.390> now

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
presented to that there and see that now

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
presented to that there and see that now
an<00:03:00.840> impact<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.380> talk<00:03:01.560> about<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.890> time<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.160> want

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
an impact we talk about all time we want

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.460 
an impact we talk about all time we want
to<00:03:02.370> be<00:03:02.430> into<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.970> lead<00:03:03.180> side<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:04.110> want<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.350> be

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
to be into the lead side we want to be

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.200 
to be into the lead side we want to be
most<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.490> weight<00:03:05.760> should<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.180> that

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
most of the weight should be on that

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.790 
most of the weight should be on that
left<00:03:06.510> leg<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.840> shaft<00:03:07.140> leaning<00:03:07.470> forward<00:03:07.740> you

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
left leg the shaft leaning forward you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.290 
left leg the shaft leaning forward you
can<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.100> loft<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.520> face<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.120> much

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
can see the loft on the face is so much

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.060 
can see the loft on the face is so much
different<00:03:09.720> there<00:03:09.840> now<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.230> I've<00:03:10.710> got<00:03:10.890> plenty

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
different there now and I've got plenty

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.220 
different there now and I've got plenty
of<00:03:11.190> rotation<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.510> lower<00:03:12.660> body<00:03:12.870> as<00:03:13.050> well

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
of rotation in the lower body as well

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.990 
of rotation in the lower body as well
they're<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:13.710> completely<00:03:14.490> different<00:03:14.820> there

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
they're so completely different there

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.270 
they're so completely different there
it's<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.660> present<00:03:15.810> a<00:03:16.280> massively

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
it's going to present a massively

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.460 
it's going to present a massively
different<00:03:17.730> ball<00:03:17.880> flight<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.420> also<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.900> contact

my bottom of the swing though can be

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.720 
my bottom of the swing though can be

Lyman stick on the ground all you need
you're<00:03:48.900> going<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.080> place<00:03:49.230> your<00:03:49.410> your<00:03:49.800> trail

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
you're going to place your your trail

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.560 
you're going to place your your trail
foot<00:03:50.310> right<00:03:50.580> in<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> center<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.330> and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
foot right in the center of that and

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.210 
foot right in the center of that and
this<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.050> where<00:03:52.290> as<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.560> saw<00:03:52.709> with<00:03:52.830> Nicklaus

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
this is where as we saw with Nicklaus

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.460 
this is where as we saw with Nicklaus
what<00:03:54.180> he<00:03:54.270> does<00:03:54.450> does<00:03:54.600> he<00:03:54.630> swings<00:03:55.050> back<00:03:55.290> the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
what he does does he swings back the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.350 
what he does does he swings back the
right<00:03:55.650> foot<00:03:55.950> rolls<00:03:56.280> onto<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.820> outside<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
right foot rolls onto the outside of

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.910 
right foot rolls onto the outside of
that<00:03:57.540> alignment<00:03:58.020> stick<00:03:58.170> onto<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.500> outside<00:03:58.800> of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
that alignment stick onto the outside of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.530 
that alignment stick onto the outside of
that<00:03:58.980> foot<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.459> we're<00:04:00.000> really<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.420> get

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that foot so we're really going to get

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.150 
that foot so we're really going to get
the<00:04:00.660> control<00:04:01.110> element<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.770> backswing

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the control element on the backswing

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.320 
the control element on the backswing
we're<00:04:02.310> going<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.490> put<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> pressure<00:04:03.030> through

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
we're going to put the pressure through

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.940 
we're going to put the pressure through
the<00:04:03.360> middle<00:04:03.690> of<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.810> foot<00:04:03.990> or<00:04:04.320> even<00:04:04.770> on<00:04:04.860> the

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
the middle of the foot or even on the

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.280 
the middle of the foot or even on the
inside<00:04:05.100> slightly<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.330> as<00:04:06.450> we<00:04:06.570> swing<00:04:06.840> back<00:04:07.050> now

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
inside slightly so as we swing back now

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.390 
inside slightly so as we swing back now
we're<00:04:07.470> going<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.620> make<00:04:07.800> sure<00:04:08.010> we<00:04:08.130> maintain

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
we're going to make sure we maintain

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.490 
we're going to make sure we maintain
that<00:04:08.730> pressure<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.660> from<00:04:09.959> here<00:04:10.140> now<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.410> you

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that pressure and from here now as you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.590 
that pressure and from here now as you
can<00:04:10.650> see<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.280> right<00:04:11.489> foot<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.880> rock<00:04:12.120> solid<00:04:12.330> on

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
can see that right foot is rock solid on

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.790 
can see that right foot is rock solid on
that<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.080> really<00:04:13.260> feel<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> weight

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
that and I can really feel the weight

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.500 
that and I can really feel the weight
and<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.430> pressure<00:04:14.670> through<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.090> trial<00:04:15.330> foot

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
and the pressure through that trial foot

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.570 
and the pressure through that trial foot
that<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.840> definitely<00:04:16.200> so<00:04:16.410> at<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.919> minimum<00:04:17.400> we

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
that is definitely so at a minimum we

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.949 
that is definitely so at a minimum we
want<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.910> weight<00:04:18.090> through<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.419> middle<00:04:18.870> of

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
want the weight through the middle of

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.990 
want the weight through the middle of
the<00:04:19.140> stick<00:04:19.380> there<00:04:19.590> if<00:04:19.770> Andy<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.520> as<00:04:20.700> you<00:04:20.790> said

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
the stick there if Andy is as you said

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.310 
the stick there if Andy is as you said
there<00:04:21.180> maybe<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.510> bit<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.690> advanced<00:04:22.109> if

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
there maybe a bit more advanced if

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.600 
there maybe a bit more advanced if
you've<00:04:22.440> got<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.650> mobility<00:04:23.130> in<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> hips

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
you've got the mobility in the hips

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.920 
you've got the mobility in the hips
fortunately<00:04:24.240> struggling<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> little<00:04:24.840> bit

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
fortunately struggling a little bit

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.540 
fortunately struggling a little bit
those<00:04:25.050> have<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.290> come<00:04:25.410> back<00:04:25.500> down<00:04:25.710> but<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.400> can

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
those have to come back down but you can

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.530 
those have to come back down but you can
see<00:04:26.760> you

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
see you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.330 
see you
pushing<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.960> weight<00:04:28.110> already<00:04:28.410> towards<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
pushing the weight already towards a

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.530 
pushing the weight already towards a
target<00:04:29.550> you've<00:04:29.880> got<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.060> think<00:04:30.180> that<00:04:30.360> you're<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
target you've got to think that you're a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.690 
target you've got to think that you're a
sprinter<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.500> blocks<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.430> want<00:04:32.610> to

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
sprinter in the blocks and you want to

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.520 
sprinter in the blocks and you want to
start<00:04:32.970> your<00:04:33.180> downswing<00:04:33.690> as<00:04:33.900> aggressively<00:04:34.410> and

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
start your downswing as aggressively and

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.830 
start your downswing as aggressively and
as<00:04:34.680> powerfully<00:04:35.220> as<00:04:35.280> possible<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.300> can<00:04:36.330> do<00:04:36.690> it

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
as powerfully as possible you can do it

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.390 
as powerfully as possible you can do it
if<00:04:36.960> you're<00:04:37.110> controlled<00:04:37.740> at<00:04:37.920> the<00:04:37.980> top<00:04:38.250> if

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
if you're controlled at the top if

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.160 
if you're controlled at the top if
you're<00:04:38.580> not<00:04:38.850> controlled<00:04:39.330> then<00:04:39.930> you're<00:04:40.110> not

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
you're not controlled then you're not

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.420 
you're not controlled then you're not
going<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.350> win<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.650> race<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.860> let's<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.370> do

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
going to win the race so let's just do

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.820 
going to win the race so let's just do
that<00:04:41.490> again<00:04:41.580> okay<00:04:42.120> so<00:04:42.260> control<00:04:43.260> I'm<00:04:43.410> building

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
that again okay so control I'm building

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.200 
that again okay so control I'm building
that<00:04:43.920> pressure<00:04:44.220> okay<00:04:44.550> feeling<00:04:45.000> it's<00:04:45.150> coming

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
that pressure okay feeling it's coming

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.090 
that pressure okay feeling it's coming
on<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.630> inside<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.140> right<00:04:46.470> foot<00:04:46.800> so

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
on the inside of that right foot so

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.410 
on the inside of that right foot so
there's<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> control<00:04:47.640> part<00:04:47.940> look<00:04:48.240> at<00:04:48.360> the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
there's the control part look at the

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.790 
there's the control part look at the
roll<00:04:48.570> part<00:04:48.780> for<00:04:48.960> me<00:04:49.020> okay<00:04:49.140> so<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.410> roll<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
roll part for me okay so the roll is the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.620 
roll part for me okay so the roll is the
downswing<00:04:50.340> where<00:04:50.490> as<00:04:50.550> we<00:04:50.700> shift<00:04:51.060> towards<00:04:51.510> that

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
downswing where as we shift towards that

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.540 
downswing where as we shift towards that
target<00:04:51.810> we<00:04:52.110> roll<00:04:52.380> off<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.650> alignment<00:04:53.340> stick

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
target we roll off that alignment stick

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.130 
target we roll off that alignment stick
and<00:04:53.730> then<00:04:54.090> shift<00:04:54.360> our<00:04:54.540> weight<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:54.930> lead

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
and then shift our weight to that lead

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.930 
and then shift our weight to that lead
side<00:04:55.380> as<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:55.650> can<00:04:55.770> see<00:04:55.950> there<00:04:56.160> I'm<00:04:56.520> shifting

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
side as you can see there I'm shifting

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.580 
side as you can see there I'm shifting
my<00:04:57.240> weight<00:04:57.270> now<00:04:57.630> and<00:04:57.780> getting<00:04:57.990> into<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.320> lead

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
my weight now and getting into that lead

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.190 
my weight now and getting into that lead
side<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.040> then<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.550> can<00:04:59.580> finish<00:04:59.880> through<00:05:00.300> onto

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
side and then I can finish through onto

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.840 
side and then I can finish through onto
that<00:05:01.320> time<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.860> again<00:05:02.220> just<00:05:02.400> do<00:05:02.520> another<00:05:02.700> one

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
that time that again just do another one

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.890 
that time that again just do another one
where<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.060> swing<00:05:03.270> down<00:05:03.390> to<00:05:03.540> where<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.750> ball

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
where you swing down to where the ball

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.390 
where you swing down to where the ball
would<00:05:04.020> be<00:05:04.110> ending<00:05:04.350> you<00:05:04.470> will<00:05:04.590> notice<00:05:05.040> Nicholas

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
would be ending you will notice Nicholas

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.890 
would be ending you will notice Nicholas
when<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:05.610> see<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:06.720> is
