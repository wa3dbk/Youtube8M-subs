actual<00:00:43.140> tests<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> program<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.770> what

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
actual tests so the program will what

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
actual tests so the program will what

the way you do this is you select a song

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.040 
the way you do this is you select a song
just<00:00:57.199> take<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.350> off<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> whenever<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.629> do

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
just take this off and whenever you do

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.000 
just take this off and whenever you do
hear<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> one<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:02.329> click<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.420> first<00:01:03.780> feet

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:22.480 

one<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.880> that's<00:01:09.060> bad<00:01:09.390> bad<00:01:10.970> one<00:01:15.950> fun<00:01:18.619> one<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
one so that's bad bad one fun one and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.460 
one so that's bad bad one fun one and
these<00:01:23.490> are<00:01:23.570> these<00:01:24.570> are<00:01:24.630> sort<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.020> loops

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
these are these are sort of like loops

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.670 
these are these are sort of like loops
but<00:01:25.890> these<00:01:26.400> last<00:01:26.790> three<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.210> more<00:01:27.479> just<00:01:28.229> normal

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
but these last three or more just normal

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:39.080 
but these last three or more just normal
so<00:01:28.860> long<00:01:32.810> 11<00:01:36.500> another<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so long 11 another thing is that it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.590 
so long 11 another thing is that it
actually<00:01:39.329> has<00:01:40.700> additional<00:01:41.700> two<00:01:42.060> songs<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
actually has additional two songs that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
if you're doing well or not but it also

if you're doing well or not but it also
gives<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:01.000> accuracy<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:04.180> way<00:02:04.240> you

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
gives you accuracy so that that way you

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.110 
gives you accuracy so that that way you
know<00:02:04.690> how<00:02:04.720> close<00:02:05.320> or<00:02:06.040> how<00:02:06.070> far<00:02:06.250> off<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.970> are

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
from finding the one another way is that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.240 
from finding the one another way is that
it<00:02:12.250> actually<00:02:13.200> shows<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.530> how<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.100> the
