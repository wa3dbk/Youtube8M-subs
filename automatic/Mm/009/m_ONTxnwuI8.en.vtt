platforms how do you get yourself food
it's<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.270> difficult<00:04:23.750> question<00:04:24.320> it's<00:04:25.010> probably

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it's a difficult question it's probably

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.810 
it's a difficult question it's probably
because<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:28.210> said<00:04:29.210> things<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:30.400> know<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:31.610> ways

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
because I said things you know in ways

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.159 
because I said things you know in ways
that<00:04:31.850> people<00:04:32.210> could<00:04:32.450> relate<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.750> and

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
that people could relate to and

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.070 
that people could relate to and
understand<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:35.210> also<00:04:35.330> think<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.810> it's

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
understand and I also think that it's

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.870 
understand and I also think that it's
because<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.530> was<00:04:36.650> consistently<00:04:37.370> single

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
because I was consistently single

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.280 
because I was consistently single
staying<00:04:38.120> with<00:04:38.300> us<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.630> you<00:04:38.750> now<00:04:38.870> are<00:04:39.020> saying

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
staying with us and you now are saying

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.340 
staying with us and you now are saying
and<00:04:39.740> what<00:04:40.610> happens<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.120> people<00:04:41.270> tend<00:04:42.169> to

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
and what happens is that people tend to

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.110 
and what happens is that people tend to
develop<00:04:42.680> some<00:04:43.010> sort<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.250> relationship<00:04:43.820> with

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
develop some sort of relationship with

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.970 
develop some sort of relationship with
you<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:45.200> think<00:04:45.410> that's<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.800> most

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
you and I think that's the most

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.220 
you and I think that's the most
important<00:04:46.490> thing<00:04:46.520> that<00:04:46.940> people<00:04:47.690> got<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.990> buy

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
important thing that people got to buy

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.640 
important thing that people got to buy
into<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:48.889> because<00:04:49.669> that's<00:04:50.300> why<00:04:50.570> people<00:04:51.020> like

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
into you because that's why people like

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.040 
into you because that's why people like
watching<00:04:52.190> a<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:52.910> people<00:04:53.300> something<00:04:53.750> it's

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
watching a so people something it's

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.140 
watching a so people something it's
because<00:04:54.190> they<00:04:55.190> know<00:04:55.400> what<00:04:55.550> they're<00:04:55.700> gonna<00:04:55.850> get

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
because they know what they're gonna get

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.540 
because they know what they're gonna get
then<00:04:56.600> what<00:04:56.810> they'll<00:04:57.020> see<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.500> just<00:04:58.400> other

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
then what they'll see and just other

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.250 
then what they'll see and just other
keeps<00:04:58.820> going<00:04:59.030> back<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.450> and<00:04:59.600> they<00:05:00.050> develop

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
keeps going back to it and they develop

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.140 
keeps going back to it and they develop
relationships<00:05:01.010> with<00:05:01.340> all<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.640> characters

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
relationships with all the characters

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.180 
relationships with all the characters
whatever<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.140> case<00:05:03.290> would<00:05:03.590> be<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:03.890> there<00:05:04.040> is

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
whatever the case would be so there is

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.030 
whatever the case would be so there is
really<00:05:04.220> nothing<00:05:04.970> that<00:05:05.650> different<00:05:06.650> from<00:05:06.770> how

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
really nothing that different from how

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.280 
really nothing that different from how
everything<00:05:07.490> else<00:05:07.669> overall<00:05:08.120> I<00:05:08.419> think<00:05:08.870> it's

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
everything else overall I think it's

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.320 
everything else overall I think it's
just<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.680> it's<00:05:09.890> a<00:05:10.100> it's<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.790> different<00:05:11.180> medium

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
just that it's a it's a different medium

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.750 
just that it's a it's a different medium
that<00:05:12.229> actually<00:05:12.710> still<00:05:13.040> has<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.280> same<00:05:13.460> rules

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
that actually still has the same rules

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.790 
that actually still has the same rules
and<00:05:14.510> that's<00:05:14.660> what<00:05:14.810> I've<00:05:14.900> been<00:05:14.930> named<00:05:15.200> kai
