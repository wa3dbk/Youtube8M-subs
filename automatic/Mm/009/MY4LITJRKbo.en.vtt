00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
could play it Namco Bandai did address
the<00:00:33.780> server<00:00:34.020> issues<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:35.340> still<00:00:35.579> not

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the server issues but they are still not

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.400 
the server issues but they are still not
fully<00:00:36.090> fix<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.540> said<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.899> were<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> get

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
fully fix I said they were going to get

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
fully fix I said they were going to get
some<00:00:37.559> more<00:00:37.710> servers<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.760> still<00:00:39.090> almost

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
some more servers it's still almost

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.560 
some more servers it's still almost
impossible<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> get<00:00:40.860> into<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.820> server<00:00:42.180> I

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
impossible to get into a server I

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.150 
impossible to get into a server I
basically<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> wait<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
basically just have to wait for it to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
basically just have to wait for it to
air<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> tell<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> servers

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
air around and tell me that the servers

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260 
air around and tell me that the servers
are<00:00:46.320> no<00:00:46.649> longer<00:00:46.890> available<00:00:47.219> nor<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.149> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
are no longer available nor me to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.880 
are no longer available nor me to
actually<00:00:48.390> play<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> game<00:00:48.960> or<00:00:49.230> get<00:00:49.440> invited<00:00:49.710> by

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
actually play a game or get invited by

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
actually play a game or get invited by
somebody<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> into<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
somebody to if you get into one of the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.220 
somebody to if you get into one of the
lobbies<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.379> play<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.460> still<00:00:54.059> annoying<00:00:54.480> but

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
lobbies to play it is still annoying but

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.729 
lobbies to play it is still annoying but
sometimes<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.920> works<00:00:56.070> sometimes<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.940> doesn't

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.080 
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
once<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:58.890> fully<00:00:59.129> fix<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.609> then<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.850> can

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
once they fully fix that then I can

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729 
once they fully fix that then I can
fully<00:01:00.270> recommend<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.930> until<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.530> mean

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
fully recommend it until then I mean

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.319 
fully recommend it until then I mean
unless<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.489> nothing<00:01:02.969> else<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.210> play

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
unless you have nothing else to play

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.560 
unless you have nothing else to play
then<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.619> will<00:01:05.040> probably<00:01:05.280> wait<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.420> if

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
then I will probably wait and see if

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.630 
then I will probably wait and see if
things<00:01:06.750> end<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.229> getting<00:01:07.530> better<00:01:07.830> now<00:01:08.369> these

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
things end up getting better now these

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
things end up getting better now these

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
concerned stamina is very very important

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.039 
concerned stamina is very very important
in<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.670> game<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.600> don't<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.869> any

in this game and if you don't have any
stamina<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.710> basically<00:01:35.040> can't<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.490> anything

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
stamina you basically can't do anything

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
you cannot defend yourself there's only

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
you cannot defend yourself there's only
thing<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
thing that I do not like about the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.649 
thing that I do not like about the
combat<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.320> far<00:01:40.530> as<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> story<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.729> did<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
combat as far as a story they did have a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.139 
combat as far as a story they did have a
nice<00:01:42.869> little<00:01:42.990> twist<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.250> story<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> do

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
nice little twist on the story so I do

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.999 
nice little twist on the story so I do
appreciate<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.899> because<00:01:46.259> initially<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.799> was

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
appreciate that because initially I was

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.289 
appreciate that because initially I was

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
the only other thing I could think of

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.860 
the only other thing I could think of
again<00:06:33.800> is<00:06:34.100> that<00:06:34.580> they're<00:06:34.790> worried<00:06:35.030> about<00:06:35.180> the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
again is that they're worried about the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.820 
again is that they're worried about the
new<00:06:36.640> generation<00:06:37.640> not<00:06:38.240> possibly<00:06:39.230> biting<00:06:39.710> on

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830

them<00:06:41.810> because<00:06:42.200> again<00:06:42.680> the<00:06:42.890> majority<00:06:43.430> is

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
them because again the majority is

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.090 
them because again the majority is
around<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.420> age<00:06:44.540> of<00:06:44.570> 24<00:06:45.110> they're<00:06:45.350> going<00:06:45.710> to
