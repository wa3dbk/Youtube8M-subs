00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Let's take care of how we handle them 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.240
 can write on the guitar 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.550
 Before that I would like to briefly again the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.370
 pages on the guitar thus explain the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.070
 first page is the bottom of the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.730
 high page the second page is the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.350
 b-side third page is the page then 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 the bass strings come the fourth page 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
 the idea is side fifth page is the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.699
 a page and the sixth page is the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.470
 the esa sound deep for our grip 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 pictures which we excel, it is equal to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.399
 very important to know that all pages 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 exactly reversed rum to be recorded 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.840
 that means the currency on the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 guitar on us on the guitar yes 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.550
 At the top is going to the bottom 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.129
 Drawn about it then comes the a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.280
 page the fifth page above then the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.250
 idea side then the cream on top 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 the b side and the top like the usa 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.550
 the drawn so very important in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 our handle images are the pages 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 exactly upside down then drawn 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 Let's draw the saddle in front 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.530
 this is this black or white one 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 piece of plastic where the sides drÃ¼ber run over 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.240
 good for the first bunch and for ours 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 Help, we only need three frets 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 accordingly, we draw ourselves as well 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.540
 only three colored sticks 1 1 23 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.689
 so now we come to the left hand 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.759
 with which we grab the handles 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 they are also called number 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 our index finger is the first finger 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.329
 the middle finger first second finger of the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.400
 Ringfinger is the third finger and the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.680
 little finger is the fourth finger of the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 thumb does not get a name then 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.619
 we only need as support for 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.619
 hold 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.340
 So we had ours to our grasp 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:50.150
 little finger the fourth finger in the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.040
 third band on the high heather so on 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.580
 the first page of our drawing entirely 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.430
 above 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 around the thumb of the right hand we have 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.100
 from the d page the best four pages 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.920
 struck that is the idea side 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.270
 the salary and the b side and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.370
 of course where our little finger 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.370
 On top of that, the high lays its side 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.230
 I'll show you the whole concept now 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.680
 big in the camera so we have 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.900
 our little finger in the third band 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.500
 on the lowest page very close 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 behind the third bunch of chopsticks and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.880
 have thumbs right hand 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.880
 struck the bottom four pages 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.810
 well then very few songs really 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.040
 only be played with a chord 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.050
 definitely need one more 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.660
 second handle there is very good 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.470
 the debriv on me at the same time again 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 is seized 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.570
 that works so we take his 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.330
 Forefinger lay down to the second bunch 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.140
 and then go to the third page of 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.100
 below so that's 123 index finger 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.770
 lies in the second bunch on the third 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.940
 side from below 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.770
 It is important that it is about the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.130
 finger in the right angle if possible 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.310
 on the sides is the second 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.500
 finger is also in the second bunch 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.010
 but on the first page so completely 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.880
 below 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.730
 also in the second volume and now comes the 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.300
 third finger to the lies in the third 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.490
 band on the second page from below 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.670
 So is the quasi so before the other 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.250
 both with thumbs right hand 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.730
 Let's beat the best four again 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.730
 pages 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.450
 i explained fast run so well 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:54.189
 index finger two of the bond and then on 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:57.170
 the third page from below middle finger 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.420
 also two of the bunch at the bottom 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.159
 the bottom side and the ring finger 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.239
 sitting on the second page where notes in the 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.859
 third bunch always looks as possible 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.150
 be just behind the bund town and 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.150
 the bottom four pages
