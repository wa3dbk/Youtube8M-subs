there's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.890> lot<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.160> different<00:00:20.490> weight<00:00:20.640> gain

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
there's a lot of different weight gain

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
there's a lot of different weight gain
programs<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.600> there<00:00:21.840> some<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.650> them<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.920> good

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
programs out there some of them are good

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.029 
programs out there some of them are good
some<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.760> them<00:00:23.880> are<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.210> good<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:25.039> this

of what to look for and as you can see

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
of what to look for and as you can see
here<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.189> wrote<00:00:32.579> certain<00:00:33.390> there's<00:00:33.690> certain

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
here I wrote certain there's certain

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
here I wrote certain there's certain
things<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.410> successful<00:00:35.130> weight<00:00:35.340> gain

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
things that successful weight gain

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
things that successful weight gain
programs<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.510> common<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.020> we're

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
programs all have in common so we're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
programs all have in common so we're
gonna<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.590> over<00:00:37.680> those<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.070> number<00:00:38.820> one

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
gonna go over those right now number one

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.610 
gonna go over those right now number one
of<00:00:39.480> course<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> weight<00:00:40.230> training<00:00:40.379> program

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
of course is a weight training program

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
of course is a weight training program
so<00:00:41.210> obviously<00:00:42.210> gaining<00:00:42.629> weight<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> building

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so obviously gaining weight and building

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.450 
so obviously gaining weight and building
muscle<00:00:43.320> means<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.070> gonna<00:00:44.129> need<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
muscle means that you're gonna need to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.549 
muscle means that you're gonna need to
hit<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> gym<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:46.020> want<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> tell<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
hit the gym and I want to tell you that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
hit the gym and I want to tell you that
right<00:00:47.399> off<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.520> bat<00:00:47.610> three<00:00:48.120> days<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> week<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
right off the bat three days a week is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.389 
right off the bat three days a week is
optimal<00:00:49.260> for<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.559> best<00:00:49.739> results<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
optimal for the best results and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.080 
optimal for the best results and
contrary<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.360> what<00:00:52.100> most<00:00:53.100> guys<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.640> or<00:00:53.879> some

some<00:01:14.700> sort<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.970> weight<00:01:15.150> gain<00:01:15.360> diet<00:01:15.780> and

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
some sort of weight gain diet and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
some sort of weight gain diet and
believe<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.820> 90%<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:18.990> effort<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
believe it or not 90% of your effort to

gain weight will be focused on your diet

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.749 
gain weight will be focused on your diet
the<00:01:22.229> reason<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> workout

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the reason is because if you workout

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.940 
the reason is because if you workout
three<00:01:24.689> days<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> week<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.439> an<00:01:25.530> hour<00:01:25.560> each

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
three days a week for an hour each

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.200 
three days a week for an hour each
that's<00:01:26.310> three<00:01:26.549> hours<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.850> weight<00:01:27.030> training

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
that's three hours of weight training

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
that's three hours of weight training
per<00:01:27.479> week<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> whole<00:01:29.220> rest<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
per week and you know the whole rest of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.950 
per week and you know the whole rest of
your<00:01:29.610> effort<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.479> focused<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
your effort is gonna be focused on

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.219 
your effort is gonna be focused on
eating<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.530> resting<00:01:32.509> your<00:01:33.509> weight<00:01:34.020> gain

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
eating and resting your weight gain

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.800 
eating and resting your weight gain
program<00:01:34.650> should<00:01:35.040> include<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.820> specific<00:01:36.210> diet

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
program should include a specific diet

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you grow faster so for example do you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
you grow faster so for example do you
know<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.520> difference<00:02:02.850> between<00:02:03.229> gaining<00:02:04.229> your

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
know the difference between gaining your

know the difference between gaining your
protein<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.520> chicken<00:02:06.030> versus<00:02:06.450> cottage

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
protein from chicken versus cottage

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.529 
protein from chicken versus cottage
cheese<00:02:07.049> some<00:02:07.979> guys<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.369> some<00:02:08.610> some<00:02:09.060> guys<00:02:09.209> don't

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
cheese some guys do some some guys don't

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.380 
cheese some guys do some some guys don't
but<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> what's<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> difference<00:02:11.430> cut<00:02:11.819> cottage

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
but so what's the difference cut cottage

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.520 
but so what's the difference cut cottage
cheese<00:02:12.660> can

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
cheese can

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.790 
cheese can

absorb at a slower rate and this kind of

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.490 
absorb at a slower rate and this kind of
protein<00:02:20.010> is<00:02:20.190> good<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.910> eat<00:02:21.120> at<00:02:21.690> night<00:02:22.170> before
