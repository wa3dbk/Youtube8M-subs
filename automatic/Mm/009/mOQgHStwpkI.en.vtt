00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
how to do this especially if you're

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.709 
how to do this especially if you're
already<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> saltwater<00:01:56.009> fishing<00:01:56.719> but

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
already in the saltwater fishing but

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.010 
already in the saltwater fishing but
you'll<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.560> hold<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.600> single<00:02:00.600> strand<00:02:00.869> with

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you'll just hold the single strand with

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.350 
you'll just hold the single strand with
a<00:02:01.049> pair<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> pliers<00:02:01.430> take<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> short<00:02:02.820> end<00:02:03.030> bend

a pair of pliers take the short end bend

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
a pair of pliers take the short end bend
it<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.750> make<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.899> 90<00:02:04.140> degree<00:02:04.259> angle<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.860> then

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it up to make a 90 degree angle and then

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.359 
it up to make a 90 degree angle and then
just<00:02:05.820> wrap<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.030> around<00:02:06.979> six<00:02:07.979> or<00:02:08.069> eight<00:02:08.220> good

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
just wrap it around six or eight good

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.270 
just wrap it around six or eight good
times

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.770 

try<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> make<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.519> as<00:02:13.670> tight<00:02:13.700> as<00:02:14.060> possible<00:02:14.120> that

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
try to make it as tight as possible that

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.320 
try to make it as tight as possible that
will<00:02:14.870> help<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.790> from<00:02:16.790> slipping<00:02:17.030> out<00:02:19.239> once<00:02:20.239> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
will help it from slipping out once you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.309 
will help it from slipping out once you
flip<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.599> around<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.989> couple<00:02:21.140> different

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
flip that around a couple different

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.490 
flip that around a couple different
times<00:02:21.530> you'll<00:02:21.890> want<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.099> bend<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.519> tag<00:02:23.060> end

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500

back and forth five or six times until

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.830 
back and forth five or six times until
it<00:02:27.530> pops<00:02:27.769> off<00:02:28.750> by<00:02:29.750> doing<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.019> it<00:02:30.170> creates

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
it pops off by doing this it creates

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.630 
it pops off by doing this it creates
