00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello project with the world on a string and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.110
 you kalashnikov against foliage video 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.599
 shot specially for the site super furniture 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.010
 kill so today I want with you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.970
 talk about parallel emphasis here 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 which is a very important part 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.160
 improvised milling table 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.599
 also improvised circulars 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.880
 today I will show you not quite ready 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.380
 emphasis in which plan is not quite ready 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.180
 there will still be an inclined plane on with 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.890
 grooves and so on i mean all those 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.850
 accessories that we use for 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.539
 milling table 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.309
 but since I think it's pretty 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.250
 complex product well then to all that i 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 I try to make it as simple as possible 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.039
 Yes, and all his bonds they require 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.039
 certain 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.930
 information as detailed as possible 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 because I hope something from that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.920
 you will see either partially or completely 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 you will use in your products 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 which means to repeat it 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.369
 or even improve 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.510
 you need the maximum amount 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.119
 Information is not so I love it here 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.580
 such clips now I first show 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.130
 how it works and then we'll talk 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.259
 what and why does it mean that you will immediately make a reservation 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.240
 moving parallel not here and not 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.280
 there since you will have this here 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.439
 Effect 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:39.229
 trembling we are just here as we see 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.610
 pretty easy and at any point we 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:53.970
 fix all 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:58.820
 fixes very securely we fixed 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 pressed our design 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.930
 moved as much as needed or 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.569
 Generally removed please work immediately 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.600
 make a reservation here we killed which 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.390
 responsible for these very 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 degrees although in this table it is not 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.990
 critically let's say milling but now 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.970
 for circular it is very important that is 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.890
 parallel carry here if somewhere 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.740
 something will be hanging out you can mica here 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.340
 work that is, there are still problems like this 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.470
 there will be a circular saw then 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.130
 may be critical there will be poly 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.590
 tree or something else and so i did 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.510
 and why did I do this, remove our 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 line we improvise move 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:51.940
 look on the one hand on the one hand 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.590
 Here we have this plane 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.710
 she rests here with us and work 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.370
 such a midnight when improvised 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.730
 that we inserted into the groove 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.820
 actually here is the most important part of her 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 how much can you exactly do with 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.320
 time since I will be this line 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.800
 use and for circular then here i am 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.040
 provided for two regulators which 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.110
 will give me the opportunity to this line 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.800
 slightly adjusted in terms of 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.440
 parallelism to angle 90 for a fraudster 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.090
 either to the tabletop or hoarded 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.100
 but now I have a problem here and worth 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.080
 I repeat I do not have so much 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.700
 time so that everything is completely out of that 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.490
 already tried to do on the net 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.990
 I want to notice this is quite a powerful clamp 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:53.150
 and such his construction as we see it 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:56.950
 rather than a model that is here 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.480
 we see from this side this model 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.810
 it is not so convenient for this particular 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.700
 operations although they both press so but with 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.500
 that side is much more convenient 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.280
 it doesn't even clamp on they 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.450
 on the contrary, as we see, I will come applied 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 your favorite 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.060
 mean with a favorite idea yes port that is 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.880
 removable why as i said it 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.500
 quite expensive clamps and of course 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.670
 you always want them as much as possible 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.650
 use if we do not work 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.540
 for example with an improvised table 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.150
 today we can take it off and calmly 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.840
 use another place of this kind 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.090
 clamping 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.890
 you could in your design 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.050
 used by bextrom this 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.660
 you do not need to have 12 constantly 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.840
 dead i mean this mode is not 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.900
 be sure to bury you in this product 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.880
 can do both clamps with removable 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.650
 ports 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.510
 Here is the construction as simple as 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.960
 we see on or quietly by them 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.960
 enjoy another place actually 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.210
 and one fixes well enough but I 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.900
 provided for two fixation points this 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.790
 works fast enough yes to 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.770
 to allow yourself two moves instead 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.500
 one but naturally at two points 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:18.270
 will always be reliable from this side and 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.560
 between the edge of our table top butts 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:25.260
 countertops yes and now this bar with me 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.510
 here the gap is about one and a half millimeter 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.940
 this is to ensure that when we 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.800
 move our parallel support with us 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.240
 Now this was not 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.220
 since the release if it is tightly tight 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.460
 it will reach the same plane to him 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:43.320
 will interfere so here now 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.960
 see again what do we need for 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:53.990
 that normally uses on 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.990
 Well, here we go. 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.340
 trying you see yes if i'm in one 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.830
 hand place 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.050
 it works practically no until here 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.050
 this he is very shivering 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:16.020
 here we fix it fixes very well 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:19.220
 notice i fixed one flesh but 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.220
 naturally better 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:27.580
 I know how good yes visible 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.750
 so we did the same here 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:37.389
 that is, the two sides we have very well 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:40.590
 fixed looks like this here as 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:46.810
 we see a ruler on both sides 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:55.050
 fix once again need something 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:56.169
 move pressed pressed tucked moved 1 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.720
 2 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:03.280
 All our ticker pinned she very 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.490
 securely fixed that is here 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.979
 worry is not worth the vibration especially 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.620
 if we have goggles the points will be rubberized 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:14.080
 it's very important here on my retainer 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.240
 without rubberized shell here 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.669
 rubber try to be with 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:25.659
 rubberized they are a little more expensive for me 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:27.820
 just wasn't having enough good 

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:31.949
 I work, in general, satisfied 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.949
 the result is such a powerful ruler 

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:39.120
 fixes but see detonates more 

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:53.800
 Well, such a model such better I mean 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.620
 I will continue to acquaint you with others 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.719
 components yes no this product 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:04.320
 because i hope it is interesting 

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:10.380
 so there you will be able to something 

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:13.930
 specifically for yourself to learn from 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:17.370
 what I show thanks a lot 

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.370
 I hope you were interested
