00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.089

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.070
 intense routine and I arrive I see that I already

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.990

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.899
 It 's every moment I go checking 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.079

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.090
 support groups as well as police 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.369
 we have a new tool is a new one 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.460
 tool used by the attack that is the 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.799
 online information and the online mines 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.560
 groups of steps where they are 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.009
 involved military police officers and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.530

 three is the one I see with priscila that we already 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.950
 we have to connect the program and 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.570
 especially this priscilla look of 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.180
 four hours is crazy because the time that 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.940
 everything is closing and before that I get 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.580
 The main story makes a chronicle is 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.540
 is often the reporter as I have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.180
 a reporter 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 afternoon crimes mostly in 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.630
 Metropolitan region 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.650
 I have to go get this reporter. 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.900
 often have a homicide 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.430
 tim happen just happened again 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.620
 thing in count and santa luzia 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.930
 Vespasian who crosses the city with this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.459
 Wonderful transit, we have people. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.840
 have to do magic radio is very 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.030
 dynamic we do not have time to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.709
 think about what you're going to do that has a 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.060
 program that goes like this coast is everything 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.090
 ready edited 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.620
 so it's very fast last night to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.670
 door has to be fast on the street gives 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.519
 return 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.349
 and we in this communication and it happens 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.099
 most of the time, reporter arrives 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.200
 for me 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.040
 the program goes to the air five it arrives 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.560
 for me 46 a matter of 12 minutes 15 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.659
 minutes or arrives with three matters I 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.690
 I have to shake the three reduce 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:18.299
 maximum 65 minutes ware quickly 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.220
 sometimes you have to twist your voice when 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.560
 involves less when involving a victim 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.790
 which can not be identified then the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.790
 People have to have a connection too. 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.099
 quickly and directly and with our operator 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.659
 patrol audio starts at 5 and 5 ends 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.599
 5 to 6 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.829
 I just got it and I have to 50 minutes of these 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.600
 50 minutes 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:43.040
 basically 25 are commercial 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.170
 I have to try my best, put the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.400
 whats going on in the newspapers 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.290
 Every year I can not stop catching you. 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.780
 an important matter everyone loved 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.740
 not turning on the radio can not 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.210
 happened this 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.090
 so often it has to fit 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.040
 even is doing maggi have to stay tuned 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.270
 is also suddenly catching the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.640
 what are paulo 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.570
 Of course people know that people do not 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.270
 journalism we have to prioritize 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.610
 location or proximity to what you have 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.770
 more to do with juve you put a 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.800
 drug trafficking you place in the 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:18.080
 homicide is totally different than it has 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.730
 weight and more so when the murder 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.160
 reporter talks about two things 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.420
 same time happening I have here a 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.790
 drug trafficking 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.050
 I have a theft and I have robbery 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.940
 theft followed by death 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.360
 trot that I'm going to provoke followed by 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.360
 death 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.340
 chay patrol it has a characteristic 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.910
 many people call it sensationalism 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.190
 he stays because you do not know if you 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.770
 already studying there is that subject but there in 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.370
 forward are going to study what she sells is what 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.860
 sells 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.350
 have already been made is the 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.380
 today patrol consumer 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.910
 like is much more IBOPE you 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.699
 put the violence of course tried 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.560
 also keep but it can keep there is 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.030
 the public asks for this public like 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.050
 When I'm on fire, shall we say? 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.990
 like this 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.639
 It's the patrol he went through a 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.830
 reformulation 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.020
 there are at least just over three 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.569
 months I do not know, let's say like this from the 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.909
 beginning of the year is the one before it was presented 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:25.110
 by the oak lounge that now deputy 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:27.379
 Federal is in Brasilia and the successor 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.470
 was renato I was already in production 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:34.199
 before already with loud it is only who was already a 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.900
 desire to change the format of itatiaia 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:38.490
 patrol is particularly I thought 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.069
 it was archaic 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.599
 lacking more action along the lines of 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.210
 police programs that I hear that I 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:47.849
 I see on television, talk has to change. 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.530
 tava very well vignettes not 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.379
 format that had been 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.599
 a police program is missing that 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.159
 climate of action , that's when I 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:58.259
 I started with renato we entered a 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.250
 consensus we sat there in the studio with 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.129
 the operator 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.819
 we chose the tracks the dollar follow from 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:08.310
 program 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:10.710
 I think we put more action is and seems 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.569
 that has fallen in popular taste the 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.229
 people like cars a return 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:18.900
 positive an orientation that people 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.870
 always bring the human side is the 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.300
 victim is not only one 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.120
 official thing not to stay alone in the speech 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.659
 Police do not we try to show not 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.550
 just get the police matter put 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:35.120
 in the air and leave little everywhere 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.409
 of course we have the vignettes 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.879
 that the plastic part of the 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.029
 composition of the program when it is 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:44.729
 murder us even speech was little 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:47.550
 Everywhere but this is you can pick up 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:50.550
 any police program is on the 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.099
 television on the radio brings this and 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.129
 now has done studies that prove 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:58.500
 which is the audience in which the public 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:00.330
 It's cool for you to see that we have 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.849
 now also the issue of 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.800
 not be sought by that victim. 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.830
 after some time a month later 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.580
 How are some matters yes? 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.190
 special that we are also 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.949
 making a program as soon as a 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:16.919
 factual and clear that the fact that the 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.050
 There is no way, you know. 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:20.650
 that the bug catches facebook again 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.889
 tool tool people 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:26.530
 I'm going to be interacting with the 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:28.360
 listeners with the netizens who are 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.100
 I enjoy listening to the program more 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:33.009
 also enjoying the website 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.960
 giving opinions several times we do 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:38.139
 the polls to be able to bring this 

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.800
 hearing the public's opinion on the 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.800
 patrol 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:49.360
