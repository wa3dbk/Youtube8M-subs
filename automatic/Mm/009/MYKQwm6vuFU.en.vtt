00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
it involves rice which is a grain which

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.470 
it involves rice which is a grain which
really<00:00:53.370> isn't<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.790> our<00:00:53.880> dogs<00:00:54.059> supposed<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
really isn't what our dogs supposed to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.170 
really isn't what our dogs supposed to
eat<00:00:54.630> but<00:00:55.380> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> filler<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.700> not<00:00:56.910> claiming

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
eat but it's a filler I'm not claiming

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.750

this next raw diet is the best it is not

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.760

but<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.690> still<00:01:00.930> better<00:01:01.170> than<00:01:01.290> kibble

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
but it's still better than kibble

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
but it's still better than kibble
because<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.219> still<00:01:02.430> involves<00:01:02.670> raw<00:01:02.969> chicken

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
