technology<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.760> achieve<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.270> it<00:02:49.510> comes<00:02:50.170> to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
technology to achieve this it comes to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.960 
technology to achieve this it comes to
the<00:02:50.560> will<00:02:50.740> of<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.950> authorities<00:02:51.610> if<00:02:51.790> they've

age should be increased this will be

age should be increased this will be
difficult<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:57.310> achieve<00:02:57.460> so<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.270> very<00:02:58.510> least

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810
