00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hayatou world of razac so small video 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.750
 damage with regard to the island this 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
 who had last year on the a14 I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.650
 why do not you do them 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.139
 best moments of the packs that I could 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.490
 have in it wanted to classify the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.719
 tons what will happen very 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.250
 soon, here it is in less than one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.449
 week does not really know the date 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.920
 for what they ask is when 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.640
 layton need is really not the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.289
 official date 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.609
 but what can I tell you guys 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.010
 it happens in less than one 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.179
 week is sure and sure if 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 it's not in the week that comes 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.710
 because there are still 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 rumors that say it can be 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 friday or in the weekend so has so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 it's not it's not this weekend it will be 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.190
 sure and certain Wednesday before wednesday 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.629
 so the 6th of May normally that's it 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 it's before the simulator it's safe and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.760
 certain 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.230
 so I thought why not you 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.030
 do the best packs that I could 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.739
 have on the twitter thread of the year 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.510
 previous to know that me if you do not 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 do not follow the previous year on was 14 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.600
 basic when I see the plates 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.980
 were not at all lucky and at 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.199
 from the moment you're wrong but I 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.390
 thought to have about one touch per 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.710
 week something like that on average and 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 good it was not crazy texts but 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.350
 it was good overall it's 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.640
 not the most ugly it was hard to say 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 means of all that I could have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.790
 every time and so here I am 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.280
 say why not make yourself a little 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.960
 video for that for this occasion 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 I hope you enjoy it I give 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 to see I believe pretty much if I have not 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.439
 happy and when I confronted the black 6 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.299

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.710
 almost all have stopped 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.540
 it was the year the previous ones so that 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.009
 it's a year exactly a little less 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.020
 some should do the maybe 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.220
 some of ten eleven months so 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.170
