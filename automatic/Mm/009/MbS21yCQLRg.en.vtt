angle<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.069> backwards<00:02:03.719> towards<00:02:04.719> the<00:02:04.780> front

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
angle it backwards towards the front

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.280 
angle it backwards towards the front
here<00:02:05.319> so<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.460> helps<00:02:06.759> draw<00:02:07.689> in<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.960> bunch<00:02:08.170> of

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
here so that helps draw in a bunch of

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.719 
here so that helps draw in a bunch of
the<00:02:08.380> finer<00:02:08.650> gold<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:09.250> it<00:02:09.370> gets<00:02:09.490> caught

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the finer gold and then it gets caught

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
the finer gold and then it gets caught
in<00:02:09.880> underneath<00:02:10.180> under<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.660> punch<00:02:10.900> plate

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
in underneath under the punch plate

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.710 
in underneath under the punch plate
everything<00:02:12.340> else<00:02:12.490> rolls<00:02:12.760> off<00:02:13.000> every<00:02:13.510> all<00:02:13.690> the

the punch plate from here you see it
kind<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.170> comes<00:02:44.350> up<00:02:44.500> on<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.800> bottom<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.520> end

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.580 
to guide the water down with a second
car<00:03:32.170> but<00:03:32.350> below<00:03:35.940> last<00:03:36.940> thing<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.480> found<00:03:38.470> this

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
car but below last thing I found this

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.550 
car but below last thing I found this
little<00:03:38.769> way<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:40.000> must<00:03:40.239> be<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> kick<00:03:40.930> some<00:03:41.350> kind

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
little way this must be a kick some kind

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.520 
little way this must be a kick some kind
of<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.709> kitchen<00:03:42.130> utensil<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.900> just<00:03:44.140> basically

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
of a kitchen utensil it just basically

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.360 
of a kitchen utensil it just basically
works<00:03:44.980> good<00:03:45.640> as<00:03:46.170> classifier<00:03:47.170> so<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:48.130> set

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
works good as classifier so I just set

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.910 
works good as classifier so I just set
that<00:03:48.519> right<00:03:48.579> on<00:03:48.850> top<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.360> carpet<00:03:49.920> it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
that right on top of this carpet it

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.590 
that right on top of this carpet it
classifies<00:03:51.610> big<00:03:51.850> enough<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.329> kind<00:03:52.510> of

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
classifies big enough that it kind of

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.229 
classifies big enough that it kind of
sits<00:03:52.810> in<00:03:52.900> between<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.730> bucket

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
sits in between the the bucket

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.539 
sits in between the the bucket
it<00:03:55.780> doesn't<00:03:56.170> really<00:03:56.320> sit<00:03:56.560> down<00:03:56.590> on<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.160> carpet

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
it doesn't really sit down on the carpet

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.190 
it doesn't really sit down on the carpet
so<00:03:57.850> you<00:03:58.000> can<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.390> dump<00:03:58.570> your<00:03:58.720> dirt<00:03:58.959> right<00:03:59.170> in

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
so you can just dump your dirt right in

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.479 
so you can just dump your dirt right in
the<00:03:59.440> top<00:03:59.650> here<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.209> goes<00:04:01.540> through<00:04:02.280> go<00:04:03.280> down

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the top here it all goes through go down

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.350 
the top here it all goes through go down
under<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> carpet

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
under the carpet

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.130
