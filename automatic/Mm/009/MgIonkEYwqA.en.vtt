 hello people welcome today sunday 4 are 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.240
 12:30 in the morning 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.860
 many years but I can not sleep 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.230
 so I would have cut them 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.920
 as of how 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.180
 connect with brands because you can not 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.180
 connect insurance 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.480
 of Minecraft 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.280
 and they go to Manchester points once again 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.149
 they go to the server list section 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.149
 look, I'm connected 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.180
 and hence, here are all the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.570
 servers the name of the server 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.460
 I do not know what this is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.700
 and here is clean that can be 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.700
 connect 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.350
 Well, when we have not 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.760
 meditate 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.760
 crowd with your challenges 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.430
 we close this or yes 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.020
 true 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.020
 almost unforgettable 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.570
 ah yes 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.570
 like manchester i love him 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.549
 to be able to connect a server has 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.560
 to be the server online because if 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.560
 they put the ip of a server that is 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.670
 of flight Ecuador are all online 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.370
 this now 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.590
 as one of these I did offline they are not going 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.500
 to connect and I'm going to tell you error in the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 connection to the server so I do not know 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.540
 connect what you say opportune in fort 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.890
 after 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.230
 to say that surely not because no no 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:54.420
 I observed to be true is the control v 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.260
 obviously they copied it or if they are going to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.129
 write manually 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:03.629
 you know what they put the name 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.629
