reveal<00:00:38.910> trailer<00:00:39.300> maybe<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.260> too<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

a<00:00:47.250> lie<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:54.230> tech<00:00:55.230> demo<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.910> did<00:00:57.180> feel

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
a lie a tech demo was but sure did feel

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.389 
a lie a tech demo was but sure did feel
like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> major<00:00:57.989> leap<00:00:58.500> backwards<00:00:59.129> when<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
like a major leap backwards when it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.150 
like a major leap backwards when it
actually<00:00:59.609> came<00:01:00.030> out<00:01:00.300> kills<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.590> promise<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160

at<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> game<00:01:18.330> originally<00:01:18.990> promised<00:01:19.830> shame<00:01:20.549> on

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
at the game originally promised shame on

at the game originally promised shame on
me<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:20.970> thinking<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> would<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.590> we've<00:01:22.890> been

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
me for thinking it would but we've been

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.200 
me for thinking it would but we've been
lied<00:01:23.310> worse

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.130 

White<00:01:30.960> Knight<00:01:31.220> okay<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.760> is<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.690> so<00:01:33.960> much

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
White Knight okay this is not so much

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.859 
White Knight okay this is not so much
graphics<00:01:34.770> which<00:01:35.250> were<00:01:35.580> very<00:01:35.640> much<00:01:36.090> downgraded

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
graphics which were very much downgraded

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.640 
graphics which were very much downgraded
but<00:01:37.409> gameplay<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.420> completely<00:01:39.420> flipped<00:01:39.840> what

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
but gameplay was completely flipped what

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.490 
but gameplay was completely flipped what
once<00:01:40.920> look<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.400> very<00:01:41.760> smooth<00:01:42.500> strategic

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
once look like a very smooth strategic

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.310 
once look like a very smooth strategic
combat<00:01:44.070> system<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:45.000> awesome<00:01:45.479> combo<00:01:45.960> attacks

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
combat system with awesome combo attacks

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.609 
combat system with awesome combo attacks
and<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:46.979> was<00:01:47.490> stripped<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.570> an<00:01:48.720> MMO<00:01:49.259> fair

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and so on was stripped to an MMO fair

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.430 
and so on was stripped to an MMO fair
type<00:01:49.950> gameplay<00:01:50.670> talk<00:01:51.330> about<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> major<00:01:51.990> letdown

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and I actually like white knight but

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.580 
and I actually like white knight but

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
watchdogs for the most part and thought

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.999 
watchdogs for the most part and thought
of<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.269> as<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> very<00:02:09.720> solid<00:02:10.259> first<00:02:10.500> game<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
of it as a very solid first game and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.310 
of it as a very solid first game and
what<00:02:11.550> will<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> long-running<00:02:12.570> franchise

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
what will be a long-running franchise

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.400 
what will be a long-running franchise
saying<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.519> the<00:02:14.970> obviously<00:02:15.570> downgraded

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
saying that the obviously downgraded

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.590 
saying that the obviously downgraded
graphics<00:02:16.950> effects<00:02:17.340> and<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.790> on<00:02:18.000> right<00:02:18.390> in

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
graphics effects and so on right in

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.259 
graphics effects and so on right in
front<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.959> us<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.350> just<00:02:19.560> wrong<00:02:19.950> also<00:02:20.880> stripping

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
front of us is just wrong also stripping

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.030 
front of us is just wrong also stripping
away<00:02:21.390> some<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> hacking<00:02:22.320> mechanics<00:02:22.890> as

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
away some of the hacking mechanics as

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.430 
away some of the hacking mechanics as
well<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.550> streamlining<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.660> which<00:02:25.170> might

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
well and streamlining it which might

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.840 
well and streamlining it which might
have<00:02:25.560> been<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.709> good<00:02:25.920> idea<00:02:25.980> since<00:02:26.489> we<00:02:26.700> never

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
have been a good idea since we never

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
have been a good idea since we never
personally<00:02:27.630> played<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.110> type<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> game<00:02:28.709> but

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
personally played that type of game but

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.449 
personally played that type of game but
still<00:02:29.730> kind<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.600> screwed<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:31.980> downgrade
