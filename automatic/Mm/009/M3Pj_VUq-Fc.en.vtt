00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
itself like I said it's just Hollow so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.150

the<00:02:43.310> die<00:02:43.550> cuts<00:02:43.850> there<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.270> they<00:02:44.360> kind<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.630> move

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the die cuts there so they kind of move

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.080 
the die cuts there so they kind of move
outwards<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.040> then<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:46.610> just<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:46.970> these

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
outwards and then you just have these

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.540 
outwards and then you just have these

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
have the ability to move up and down

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.600 
have the ability to move up and down
just<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.870> little<00:02:50.900> bit<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.830> mostly<00:02:52.250> you're<00:02:52.460> just

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
gonna get them swiveling left and right

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.550 
gonna get them swiveling left and right
so<00:02:55.580> he's<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:55.880> overly<00:02:56.420> poseable<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.530> a

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you can see inside the dome it kind of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.610 
you can see inside the dome it kind of

looks like it's sitting in some liquid
there<00:04:38.770> which<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.070> really<00:04:39.340> nice<00:04:39.550> touch<00:04:39.910> on

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
there which is a really nice touch on

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.600 
there which is a really nice touch on
the<00:04:40.270> brain<00:04:40.930> itself<00:04:41.289> is<00:04:41.470> nice<00:04:41.889> bright<00:04:42.280> pink

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
the brain itself is nice bright pink

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.860 
the brain itself is nice bright pink
color<00:04:42.849> and<00:04:42.940> does<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.389> little<00:04:43.660> bit<00:04:43.750> of<00:04:43.810> a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
color and does have a little bit of a

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.140 
color and does have a little bit of a
nice<00:04:44.020> paint<00:04:44.530> wash<00:04:44.740> on<00:04:45.009> there<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.000> a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
nice paint wash on there so it is a

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.540 
nice paint wash on there so it is a
great<00:04:46.539> looking<00:04:47.020> little<00:04:47.320> piece<00:04:47.560> it<00:04:48.340> just

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
great looking little piece it just

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.129 
great looking little piece it just
doesn't<00:04:48.820> really<00:04:49.060> do<00:04:49.270> anything<00:04:49.570> other<00:04:49.930> than

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
doesn't really do anything other than

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:51.600 
doesn't really do anything other than
that<00:04:50.320> but<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.500> guess<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:50.889> doesn't<00:04:51.070> really<00:04:51.310> need

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
that but I guess it doesn't really need

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.850 
that but I guess it doesn't really need
to<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.000> mean<00:04:52.030> it<00:04:52.270> looks<00:04:52.630> like<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.080> brain<00:04:53.259> and<00:04:53.530> of

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
to I mean it looks like the brain and of

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.230 
to I mean it looks like the brain and of
course<00:04:54.099> it's<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.340> great<00:04:54.580> addition<00:04:54.789> to<00:04:55.090> have
