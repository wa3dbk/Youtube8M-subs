00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we've got the Leningrad these arms plus

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.380 
we've got the Leningrad these arms plus
and<00:00:31.340> like<00:00:37.340> first<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.399> all<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.149> explain

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and like first of all like to explain

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.979 
and like first of all like to explain
exactly<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.500> work<00:00:41.000> for<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.390> look<00:00:42.690> down

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
exactly how these work for a look down

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
exactly how these work for a look down
on<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> front<00:00:43.530> will<00:00:43.890> correspond<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.489> much

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
on the front will correspond to how much

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.590 
on the front will correspond to how much
light<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.620> twist<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.300> so<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
light and you twist this so that it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.770 
light and you twist this so that it
matches<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.559> dial<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:51.030> set<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.449> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
matches that little dial you set your a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 
matches that little dial you set your a
si<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> same<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:53.280> ISO<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.360> whatever

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
si which is the same as ISO to whatever

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.750 
si which is the same as ISO to whatever
your<00:00:54.780> film<00:00:54.989> speed<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.469> you've<00:00:56.430> got<00:00:56.640> your

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
your film speed is you've got your

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
your film speed is you've got your
aperture<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.390> shutter<00:00:57.510> speeds<00:00:58.050> down

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
aperture and your shutter speeds down

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.639 
aperture and your shutter speeds down
the<00:00:58.469> bottom<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> twist<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:01.050> until<00:01:01.530> it

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the bottom so you twist this until it

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.030 
the bottom so you twist this until it
lines<00:01:01.890> up<00:01:02.129> with<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
lines up with the line and then you can

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.539 
lines up with the line and then you can
see<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.580> we're<00:01:06.000> gonna<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.330> shooting<00:01:07.549> about

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
see here we're gonna be shooting about

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.020 
see here we're gonna be shooting about
2.8<00:01:09.979> 100th<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> second

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
2.8 100th of a second

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.980 
2.8 100th of a second
I<00:01:12.090> always<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:12.990> shoot<00:01:13.909> with<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.299> slightly

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I always like to shoot with a slightly

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.499 
I always like to shoot with a slightly
wider<00:01:16.380> aperture<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.400> would<00:01:17.580> say<00:01:17.850> because

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
wider aperture that it would say because

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.539 
wider aperture that it would say because
these<00:01:18.689> are<00:01:18.900> quite<00:01:19.080> old<00:01:19.350> light<00:01:19.650> meters<00:01:20.070> it's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
these are quite old light meters it's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.899 
these are quite old light meters it's
got<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.729> cold<00:01:21.000> shoe<00:01:21.240> there<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.570> well<00:01:22.880> like<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
got a cold shoe there as well like a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
got a cold shoe there as well like a
meter<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:25.049> their<00:01:25.229> unfortunate<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.979> drop

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
meter to see their unfortunate I drop

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.149 
meter to see their unfortunate I drop
this<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.670> still<00:01:26.939> doesn't<00:01:27.180> work<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.009> it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this and still doesn't work but if it

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.039 
this and still doesn't work but if it
did<00:01:29.310> work<00:01:29.460> there's<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> calibration<00:01:30.600> screen

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
did work there's a calibration screen

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.090 
did work there's a calibration screen
back<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.220> switch<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
back there you just switch that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.160 
back there you just switch that
correspond<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.189> another<00:01:35.369> likely<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.030> take

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.660 

with<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> Leningrad<00:01:40.770> thought<00:01:41.010> you<00:01:41.220> were<00:01:41.370> Scot

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
with the Leningrad thought you were Scot

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.160 
with the Leningrad thought you were Scot
leave<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.180> side<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.690> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.780> bring<00:01:43.020> up

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
leave on the side so you can bring up

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.870 
leave on the side so you can bring up
another<00:01:43.320> scale<00:01:43.830> to<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.370> more<00:01:44.550> accurate

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.270 

the<00:01:50.880> plus<00:01:51.210> Mitra<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.780> cheap<00:01:52.560> alternative<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the plus Mitra is a cheap alternative to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.190 
the plus Mitra is a cheap alternative to
the<00:01:53.580> like<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.790> meter<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.420> works<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.780> exactly

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the like a meter but it works in exactly

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.500 
the like a meter but it works in exactly
the<00:01:55.320> same<00:01:55.500> way<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.979> managed<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.030> pick<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
the same way you managed to pick one of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.910 
the same way you managed to pick one of
these<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.660> there<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.320> wide<00:01:58.470> they're<00:01:58.770> not

these up there and wide they're not

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
these up there and wide they're not
going<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.220> that<00:01:59.400> accurate<00:01:59.720> until<00:02:00.720> they're

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
going to be that accurate until they're

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.190 
going to be that accurate until they're
calibrated<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.630> hot<00:02:03.780> she<00:02:03.990> wants

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
calibrated and a little hot she wants

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770 
calibrated and a little hot she wants
