00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

this<00:00:00.210> coating<00:00:00.570> is<00:00:00.870> way<00:00:01.079> better<00:00:01.230> than<00:00:01.410> this<00:00:01.650> if

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
this coating is way better than this if

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.039 
this coating is way better than this if
this<00:00:02.639> night<00:00:02.909> would<00:00:03.240> have<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.810> quality

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
this night would have this quality

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
this night would have this quality
coating<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.950> would<00:00:05.580> give<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.879> 5<00:00:06.120> ok<00:00:06.750> so<00:00:07.940> that's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
coating I would give it a 5 ok so that's

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.790 
coating I would give it a 5 ok so that's
a<00:00:09.090> part<00:00:09.360> that<00:00:09.540> related<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> knife<00:00:10.530> now

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
a part that related to the knife now

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.140 
a part that related to the knife now
about<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:12.389> sheath<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.219> sheath<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.580> my

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
about the sheath and sheath in my

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.080 
about the sheath and sheath in my
opinion<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:16.710> makes<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.220> knife<00:00:17.490> cost

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
opinion it's what makes this knife cost

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.769 
opinion it's what makes this knife cost
fifty<00:00:18.539> bucks<00:00:18.750> okay<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.880> why<00:00:21.240> I'm<00:00:21.390> saying<00:00:21.600> that

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
fifty bucks okay and why I'm saying that

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.650 
fifty bucks okay and why I'm saying that
because<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.680> they<00:00:22.920> put<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:24.000> good<00:00:24.269> cutting

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
because if they put the good cutting

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.170 
because if they put the good cutting
sheet<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.830> knife<00:00:26.039> which<00:00:26.789> wouldn't

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
sheet for this knife which wouldn't

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960 
sheet for this knife which wouldn't
probably<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.779> way<00:00:28.349> more<00:00:28.680> expensive<00:00:29.310> than<00:00:29.730> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
probably be way more expensive than this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.709 
probably be way more expensive than this
one<00:00:31.009> this<00:00:32.009> night<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.520> outstanding<00:00:33.000> okay

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
one this night would be outstanding okay

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.770 
one this night would be outstanding okay
so<00:00:33.780> overall<00:00:34.640> quality<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.030> knife<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> shit

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
so overall quality of the knife and shit

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
so overall quality of the knife and shit
would<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:36.989> outstanding<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.129> why<00:00:38.280> I'm<00:00:38.399> saying

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
would be outstanding so why I'm saying

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.340 
would be outstanding so why I'm saying
that<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> good<00:00:39.570> quality<00:00:39.870> sheet<00:00:40.170> you

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
this knife so when I put this knife

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
this knife so when I put this knife
inside<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.369> sheet<00:01:05.810> okay<00:01:06.810> like<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.920> see

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.510 
inside the sheet okay like that you see
the<00:01:11.189> click<00:01:11.520> did<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> hear<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.369> up

the click did you hear it so I put it up
take<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.439> clicks<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.670> it's

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
take it out put it back clicks so it's

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
take it out put it back clicks so it's
very<00:01:18.180> solid<00:01:18.930> okay<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:19.619> not<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> follow

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
very solid okay it's not going to follow

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
very solid okay it's not going to follow
but<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> knife<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:24.270> inside

but when I put this knife in this inside
the<00:01:25.170> sheet<00:01:25.530> okay

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.800 

it<00:01:34.159> doesn't<00:01:34.520> click<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.179> there's<00:01:35.390> no<00:01:35.539> clicking

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
it doesn't click so there's no clicking

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.279 
it doesn't click so there's no clicking
mechanism<00:01:36.409> here<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.549> mean<00:01:37.789> I<00:01:38.170> don't<00:01:39.170> want

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
mechanism here and I mean I don't want

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.669 
mechanism here and I mean I don't want
to<00:01:39.409> seem<00:01:40.159> too<00:01:40.189> picky<00:01:40.609> but<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.780> only<00:01:44.560> kind<00:01:45.560> of

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
to seem too picky but the only kind of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.309 
to seem too picky but the only kind of
the<00:01:46.399> only<00:01:46.670> point<00:01:46.939> where<00:01:47.149> I<00:01:47.179> can<00:01:47.420> secure<00:01:47.929> it<00:01:47.960> is

00:01:48.309 --> 00:01:48.319 
the only point where I can secure it is

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.669 
the only point where I can secure it is
this<00:01:48.909> strap<00:01:49.909> okay<00:01:50.569> so<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.869> can<00:01:51.049> just<00:01:51.079> secure

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
this strap okay so you can just secure

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.469 
this strap okay so you can just secure
it<00:01:51.709> with<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:52.009> buckle<00:01:52.549> it's<00:01:52.939> not<00:01:53.060> going<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.329> fall

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
it with a buckle it's not going to fall

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.779 
it with a buckle it's not going to fall
off<00:01:53.539> of<00:01:53.689> course<00:01:54.969> but<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:57.439> know<00:01:57.619> i<00:01:57.859> would

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
off of course but you know i would

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.949 
off of course but you know i would
rather<00:01:58.939> prefer<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.780> have<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.490> secure<00:02:01.959> sheet

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
rather prefer to have a secure sheet

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.359 
rather prefer to have a secure sheet
like<00:02:03.170> this<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.689> but<00:02:05.689> that's<00:02:05.899> my<00:02:06.049> opinion<00:02:06.369> some

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
like this so but that's my opinion some

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.160 
like this so but that's my opinion some
people<00:02:07.700> probably<00:02:07.849> wouldn't<00:02:08.179> care<00:02:08.539> much<00:02:08.869> about

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
people probably wouldn't care much about

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.819 
people probably wouldn't care much about
it<00:02:09.769> okay<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:12.790> that's<00:02:13.790> overall<00:02:14.510> everything<00:02:15.410> I

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
it okay and that's overall everything I

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.670 
it okay and that's overall everything I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
that I can really say here is that I'd

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.110 
that I can really say here is that I'd
never<00:02:24.200> used<00:02:24.530> this<00:02:24.680> knife<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.489> field<00:02:25.730> sorry

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
I do not know how it's going to perform

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.910 
I do not know how it's going to perform
and<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:29.209> would<00:02:29.900> be<00:02:30.079> interesting<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.620> compare
