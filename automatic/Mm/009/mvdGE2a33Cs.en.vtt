00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.860
 it's everyone knows zerka auchan is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.140
 find for a new video of 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.640
 click on club du bac 2 2 en 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.220
 multiplayer for xp in part 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.620
 custom on the ps3 in update 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.250
 1.08 so I think this gleeks works 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.170
 also on xbox so first one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.070
 who had been marouane by month and 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.809
 glitch hack codes 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.480
 so we found all three we got 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.940
 helped each other to finally redo 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.320
 this gleeks rafter patch so it will take 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.450
 necessarily a game mode that 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.850
 is called is steep and 8 and finally from 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.739
 preference if you wanted xp thoroughly who 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.900
 is a key play mode so would add 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.659
 subscribers on my psn for the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.760
 transfer to your account so that the 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.190
 rotate his play mode to the fullest 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 or else we trade and you by 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.170
 comments try to tell you he 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.330
 is the game mode is reduced and for 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.580
 that everyone can do it or 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.990
 otherwise I think it can work with 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.630
 any saved game mode 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.240
 so to realize will slip after 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.130
 patch you will end up with a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 group with your friend who will help you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.070
 all through the blick 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.079
 so you go to a your friend where 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
 he will join you survival in even a 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.170
 time your group eminence 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.030
 you will have to dissolve the group 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.810
 so you will end up in the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.490
 Main Menu 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.619
 once in the main menu you 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.810
 go put your cursor on local 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.549
 and once that's done you just have to 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.610
 do triangle and you will join 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.200
 your friend who will join before if 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.969
 you have joined or you are going to fall 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.020
 in local part which will mean that 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.090
 the geek will not work 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.100
 or otherwise you 're handling a group 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.200
 so if you have a group you have 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.789
 normally do not have prestige 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.430
 you just have to go on part 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.640
 public and normally it goes well 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.250
 just to your right of your nickname he 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.679
 there will be a 0.6 year off well run 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.229
 your friend will have to load the mode of 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.940
 game air and fairness and he's going to have to 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.520
 put his second joystick and you 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.410
 so join once your friend who 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.200
 you joined you will just have to go 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.540
 especially from tv my channel and you go 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.840
 go on custom parts and you 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.190
 go loaded air is excited so I the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.480
 repeat again I think it 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.280
 walk with all modes of play so 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.319
 I recommend this for people 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.210
 which seems to us rld and tchitÃ© de mai de 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.700
 the general scrum 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.980
 weening points scored and once that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 you have loaded r &amp; d chity you go 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.520
 find you some of which 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.110
 custom you will have to put 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.030
 your second controller and you go 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.850
 to join your friend who has 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.620
 previously joined so if everything happens 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.420
 well participation is all alone 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.800
 so me she had already started because 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.960
 that I already had another subscriber she 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.840
 joined my friend once the party 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.690
 get started and ben you will play and you 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.310
 can you xp thoroughly so me there I 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.470
 start with my love eat a who is 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.240
 my assault rifle one of my favorite 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160
 no I do not think everyone cares 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.800
 so as you will have seen that he 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.050
 was only level 2 and at the end of 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.480
 the party he's going to be level 7 have 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.980
 very little time is the best way 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.050
 rotten game Pippa thoroughly because, 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.850
 does in some way the air game mode 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.370
 is excited it's a game mode that has 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.080
 been hacked so it's someone who 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.900
 was coming to the dock the I do not know how 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.270
 he did and thanks to him that there is some 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.010
 next destruction with unlimited life 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.780
 and unlimited 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.820
 so normally it is not possible 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.430
 to put limited life into research 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.320
 destruction and thanks to this hack and ben on 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.110
 can do it so at each he you 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.550
 deign over 500 of xp so we are not 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.800
 not even one afternoon you can 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.900
 make one or two precise very easily 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.450
 you can xp thoroughly your ratio 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.910
 all the medals and your weapons 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.830
 especially your xp and your souls pass 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.750
 complex art that's like it's 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.570
 search destruction with life 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.800
 inc is so you said xp to max and you 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.040
 will be able to do all you girls 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.140
 the most difficult so we do not go 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.390
 let go of a green thumb maxim for 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.720
 this exclusivity that really have some 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.940
 heavy 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.370
 finally a redeemer patch for xp in 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.960
 channel part I will make a video if 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.180
 it's possible to ship against bots 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.180
 for now we have not found anything but 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.430
 know that if we have already found the base 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.770
 glitch jeans will not be easy to 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.410
 find an extension that will take us 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.200
 maybe to bring back boots in the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.990
 part and it will also do if they at 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.220
 maximum so nice panassie again a 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.170
 time a little green thumb for this 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.540
 super excused goals and found by marouane 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.490
 month and glitch hack coach does very 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.930
 be careful not to make too many kills 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.420
 because otherwise there will be risks 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.250
 you not like xp because 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.870
 every kill it's over five hundred 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.580
 of xp and I would like the motorcycle homeland for 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.150
 next videos and to everyone 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.150
 mailly
