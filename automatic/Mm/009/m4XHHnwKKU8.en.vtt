you how to do a little bit more of a

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:12.549 
you how to do a little bit more of a
complex<00:00:11.690> not<00:00:11.960> a<00:00:11.990> little<00:00:12.230> bit<00:00:12.320> more<00:00:12.440> than

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
complex not a little bit more than

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.400 
complex not a little bit more than
advanced<00:00:12.799> not<00:00:13.040> it's<00:00:13.940> a<00:00:14.000> stacked<00:00:14.330> si<00:00:14.809> first

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
advanced not it's a stacked si first

straights and a stacked si and I was
actually<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:23.630> first<00:00:23.660> one<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.170> make<00:00:25.009> the

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
actually the first one to make the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.919 
actually the first one to make the
tutorial<00:00:25.550> for<00:00:25.609> that<00:00:25.699> pocket<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:26.570> you<00:00:26.660> can<00:00:26.689> find

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
tutorial for that pocket so you can find

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.630 
tutorial for that pocket so you can find
it<00:00:27.019> here<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.199> YouTube<00:00:27.349> it's<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.279> really<00:00:28.490> nice

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
it here on YouTube it's a really nice

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.279 
it here on YouTube it's a really nice
pocket<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:29.150> lot<00:00:29.359> of<00:00:29.480> people<00:00:29.689> end<00:00:29.779> up<00:00:29.900> using<00:00:30.080> it

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:30.289 
pocket a lot of people end up using it

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.950 
pocket a lot of people end up using it
so<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.130> stack<00:00:31.369> si<00:00:31.789> is<00:00:32.330> where<00:00:32.540> you<00:00:32.599> essentially

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
so the stack si is where you essentially

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.540 
so the stack si is where you essentially
use<00:00:33.230> an<00:00:33.530> si<00:00:34.220> on<00:00:34.940> two<00:00:35.660> holes<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.320> mesh<00:00:36.560> to<00:00:37.250> stack

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
use an si on two holes of mesh to stack

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.209 
use an si on two holes of mesh to stack
them<00:00:37.790> right<00:00:38.120> on<00:00:38.360> top<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.660> each<00:00:38.870> other<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:39.320> Mark

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
them right on top of each other and Mark

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.700 
them right on top of each other and Mark
Matthew<00:00:40.399> Jesus<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.059> a<00:00:41.120> stick<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.620> was

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
Matthew Jesus and a stick and it was

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.590 
Matthew Jesus and a stick and it was
really<00:00:42.890> functional<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:43.850> really<00:00:44.000> helpful<00:00:44.239> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
really functional and really helpful and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.479 
really functional and really helpful and
it<00:00:45.079> can<00:00:45.199> actually<00:00:45.320> almost<00:00:45.649> be<00:00:45.859> applied<00:00:46.160> to<00:00:46.460> a

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
it can actually almost be applied to a

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.040 
it can actually almost be applied to a
lot<00:00:46.879> of<00:00:46.910> sticks<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.270> really<00:00:47.510> does<00:00:47.629> have<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.840> lot

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
lot of sticks and really does have a lot

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.069 
lot of sticks and really does have a lot
of<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.590> lot<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.129> practical<00:00:49.579> use<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
of a lot of practical use so the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.619 
of a lot of practical use so the
tutorial<00:00:51.559> follow<00:00:51.800> this<00:00:52.449> it's<00:00:53.449> pretty

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
tutorial follow this it's pretty

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.029 
tutorial follow this it's pretty
in-depth<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:54.199> should<00:00:54.350> be<00:00:54.410> able<00:00:54.769> to<00:00:54.859> see

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
in-depth and you should be able to see

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.349 
in-depth and you should be able to see
pretty<00:00:55.219> easily<00:00:55.460> how<00:00:55.730> to<00:00:55.760> do<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.149> but

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
pretty easily how to do it but

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.209 
pretty easily how to do it but
essentially<00:00:57.230> what<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.440> idea<00:00:57.710> behind<00:00:57.829> it<00:00:58.100> is<00:00:58.160> a

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
essentially what the idea behind it is a

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.529 
essentially what the idea behind it is a
two<00:00:58.989> pushes<00:00:59.989> two<00:01:00.410> holes<00:01:00.679> of<00:01:00.800> mesh<00:01:00.980> together

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
two pushes two holes of mesh together

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.880 
two pushes two holes of mesh together
launching<00:01:02.539> them<00:01:02.690> therefore<00:01:03.050> creating<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.710> deep

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
launching them therefore creating a deep

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.520 
launching them therefore creating a deep
defined<00:01:04.250> pocket<00:01:04.730> stack<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.930> side<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:06.170> goes

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
defined pocket stack that side just goes

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.920 
defined pocket stack that side just goes
one<00:01:06.800> step<00:01:06.830> further<00:01:07.180> put<00:01:08.180> those<00:01:08.360> two<00:01:08.540> diamonds

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
one step further put those two diamonds

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.540 
one step further put those two diamonds
literally<00:01:09.380> right<00:01:09.530> on<00:01:09.560> top<00:01:09.860> of<00:01:09.890> each<00:01:10.070> other<00:01:10.370> and

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
literally right on top of each other and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.880 
literally right on top of each other and
it<00:01:11.420> creates<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:12.020> little<00:01:12.260> bit<00:01:12.350> more<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.770> a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
it creates just a little bit more of a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.170 
it creates just a little bit more of a
deeper<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.280> find<00:01:13.310> pocket<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.060> not<00:01:14.330> by<00:01:14.540> much<00:01:14.890> so

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
deeper to find pocket but not by much so

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.490 
deeper to find pocket but not by much so
what<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.210> found<00:01:17.510> is<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:17.780> this<00:01:18.020> isn't<00:01:18.290> really<00:01:18.410> a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
what I found is that this isn't really a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.710 
what I found is that this isn't really a
replacement<00:01:18.950> for<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:19.310> -<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:20.210> actually<00:01:20.360> really

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
replacement for a - it actually really

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.450 
replacement for a - it actually really
helped<00:01:21.020> especially<00:01:21.560> like<00:01:21.890> in<00:01:22.010> this<00:01:22.130> head<00:01:22.340> with

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
helped especially like in this head with

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.010 
helped especially like in this head with
the<00:01:22.550> Evo<00:01:22.760> X<00:01:22.910> where<00:01:23.150> there<00:01:23.240> wasn't<00:01:23.480> a<00:01:23.720> lot<00:01:23.750> of

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the Evo X where there wasn't a lot of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.830 
the Evo X where there wasn't a lot of
sidewall<00:01:24.710> holes<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.090> order<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.360> get<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.510> well

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
sidewall holes so in order to get a well

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.020 
sidewall holes so in order to get a well
channeled<00:01:27.260> mid<00:01:27.440> pocket<00:01:27.890> I<00:01:28.070> had<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.730> pull<00:01:29.000> the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
channeled mid pocket I had to pull the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.360 
channeled mid pocket I had to pull the
mesh<00:01:29.360> down<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:30.680> was<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.830> sidewall

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
mesh down and then there was a sidewall

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.140 
mesh down and then there was a sidewall
hole<00:01:31.520> gap<00:01:31.730> so<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:32.390> used<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:33.080> stacked<00:01:33.950> si<00:01:34.490> to

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
hole gap so I used a stacked si to

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.000 
hole gap so I used a stacked si to
really<00:01:35.390> pile<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.930> Diamonds<00:01:36.380> up<00:01:36.530> right<00:01:36.860> in<00:01:36.980> the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
really pile the Diamonds up right in the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.310 
really pile the Diamonds up right in the
middle<00:01:37.150> while<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.180> couldn't<00:01:38.720> do<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.960> -<00:01:39.140> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
middle while I couldn't do it - that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.420 
middle while I couldn't do it - that
would<00:01:39.410> be<00:01:39.440> very<00:01:39.530> tight<00:01:39.980> because<00:01:40.100> there<00:01:40.310> was

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
would be very tight because there was

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.460 
would be very tight because there was
such<00:01:40.580> a<00:01:40.610> sidewall<00:01:41.060> hole<00:01:41.240> gap<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.660> could<00:01:42.260> do<00:01:42.440> a

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
such a sidewall hole gap I could do a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.290 
such a sidewall hole gap I could do a
stack<00:01:42.980> that<00:01:43.190> side<00:01:43.460> right<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.760> that<00:01:43.910> hole<00:01:44.090> and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
stack that side right on that hole and

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.450 
stack that side right on that hole and
that<00:01:44.840> would<00:01:44.960> give<00:01:45.080> me<00:01:45.230> you<00:01:46.040> know<00:01:46.160> in<00:01:46.310> deep

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
that would give me you know in deep

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.090 
that would give me you know in deep
define<00:01:46.790> mid<00:01:47.000> pocket<00:01:47.440> whereas<00:01:48.440> if<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.680> used<00:01:48.980> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
define mid pocket whereas if I used a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.290 
define mid pocket whereas if I used a
two<00:01:49.280> down<00:01:49.490> here<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:49.730> probably<00:01:49.970> would<00:01:50.240> have

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
two down here I probably would have

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.690 
two down here I probably would have
shifted<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.690> little<00:01:50.840> bit<00:01:50.960> lower<00:01:51.290> than<00:01:52.160> it<00:01:52.310> is<00:01:52.460> so

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
shifted a little bit lower than it is so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.460 
shifted a little bit lower than it is so
that's<00:01:52.820> how<00:01:53.480> I've<00:01:53.630> been<00:01:53.780> using<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.230> stacked

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
that's how I've been using the stacked

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.430 
that's how I've been using the stacked
si<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:55.520> when<00:01:55.850> I<00:01:55.880> don't<00:01:56.600> have<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.840> Sabol<00:01:57.290> hole

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
si is when I don't have a Sabol hole

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.500 
si is when I don't have a Sabol hole
placement<00:01:57.710> exactly<00:01:58.220> where<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.400> want<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.940> can

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
placement exactly where I want it I can

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.170 
placement exactly where I want it I can
use<00:01:59.690> that<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.920> Cobra<00:02:01.280> X's<00:02:01.610> have<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:01.910> problem

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
use that the Cobra X's have this problem

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.120 
use that the Cobra X's have this problem
the<00:02:02.450> EO<00:02:02.630> X's<00:02:03.080> have<00:02:03.230> this<00:02:03.380> problem<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.950> some

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the EO X's have this problem and some

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.800 
the EO X's have this problem and some
the<00:02:04.460> proton<00:02:04.850> power<00:02:05.090> some<00:02:05.360> other<00:02:05.510> heads<00:02:05.690> as

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
the proton power some other heads as

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.290 
the proton power some other heads as
well<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.260> I've<00:02:07.010> used<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.400> sort<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> remedy

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
well so I've used this sort of remedy

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.210 
well so I've used this sort of remedy
for<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.629> but<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.899> could<00:02:09.050> also<00:02:09.200> use<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.440> as<00:02:09.739> a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
for that but you could also use it as a

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.770 
for that but you could also use it as a
replacement<00:02:10.399> for<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.849> two<00:02:11.030> or<00:02:11.060> three<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.690> to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
replacement for a two or three just to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.300 
replacement for a two or three just to
make<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.080> more<00:02:12.230> defined<00:02:12.410> pocket<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.099> now<00:02:13.220> I'll

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
make it more defined pocket so now I'll

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.140 
make it more defined pocket so now I'll
show<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.520> how<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.819> string<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.810> stacked<00:02:15.409> si

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
show you how to string the stacked si

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.860 
show you how to string the stacked si
alright<00:02:17.150> guys<00:02:17.299> so<00:02:17.450> now<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.599> going<00:02:17.689> to<00:02:17.780> show

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
alright guys so now I'm going to show

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.910 
alright guys so now I'm going to show
you<00:02:17.930> how<00:02:18.109> to<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.469> stacked<00:02:19.129> s

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
you how to do a stacked s

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.120 
you how to do a stacked s
so<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.760> an<00:02:20.880> SI<00:02:21.300> but<00:02:21.960> two<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.319> them<00:02:22.440> stacked

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
so this is an SI but two of them stacked

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.820 
so this is an SI but two of them stacked
in<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:23.790> side<00:02:24.720> will<00:02:24.930> hole<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.380> this<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.680> what

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
in one side will hole and this is what

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.490 
in one side will hole and this is what
Morgan<00:02:26.130> Matthews<00:02:26.250> uses<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.990> lot<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.260> people

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
Morgan Matthews uses and a lot of people

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.600 
Morgan Matthews uses and a lot of people
really<00:02:28.590> like<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.220> here's<00:02:29.430> what<00:02:29.520> we're

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
really like it so here's what we're

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
really like it so here's what we're
gonna<00:02:29.670> do<00:02:29.880> we're<00:02:30.780> gonna<00:02:30.870> come<00:02:31.140> down<00:02:31.380> through

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
gonna do we're gonna come down through

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.750 
gonna do we're gonna come down through
the<00:02:32.520> top<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.780> first<00:02:34.020> whole<00:02:34.200> mesh<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:35.640> when

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
the top of the first whole mesh and when

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.880 
the top of the first whole mesh and when
you're<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:35.910> back<00:02:36.209> around<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.050> come<00:02:37.650> down

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
you're on back around and come down

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.640 
you're on back around and come down
through<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.610> top<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.870> second<00:02:40.260> whole<00:02:40.380> mesh

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
through the top of the second whole mesh

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.350 
through the top of the second whole mesh
so<00:02:41.430> there<00:02:41.580> we<00:02:41.670> go<00:02:41.700> right<00:02:41.940> there

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so there we go right there

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.810 
so there we go right there
like<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> -<00:02:43.530> we're<00:02:43.980> coming<00:02:44.130> down<00:02:44.370> from<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.790> top

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
like a - we're coming down from the top

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.150 
like a - we're coming down from the top
and<00:02:45.240> set<00:02:45.420> up<00:02:45.510> through<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> bottom<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.380> we're

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and set up through the bottom and we're

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.120 
and set up through the bottom and we're
not<00:02:47.220> gonna<00:02:47.370> come<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:48.590> through<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> outside<00:02:50.069> of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
not gonna come in through the outside of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.810 
not gonna come in through the outside of
the<00:02:50.280> side<00:02:50.459> wall<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:52.220> then<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:53.459> we're<00:02:53.760> gonna

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
the side wall so then first we're gonna

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.870 
the side wall so then first we're gonna
come<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.709> through<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.890> bottom<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.520> this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
come up through the bottom of this

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.100 
come up through the bottom of this
second<00:02:57.270> hole<00:02:57.360> mesh<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:58.070> under<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.160> string

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
second hole mesh and under the string

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.880 
second hole mesh and under the string
then<00:03:01.110> we're<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.380> take<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.680> same

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
then we're going to take that same

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.550 
then we're going to take that same
string<00:03:02.250> go<00:03:03.090> back<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.720> first<00:03:03.989> hole<00:03:04.260> mesh

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
string go back to that first hole mesh

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:13.729 
string go back to that first hole mesh
and<00:03:05.930> come<00:03:08.150> up<00:03:10.160> through<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> bottom<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.739> under

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
and come up through the bottom and under

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.070 
and come up through the bottom and under
the<00:03:13.830> sidewall<00:03:14.250> string<00:03:14.550> without<00:03:15.540> going

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
the sidewall string without going

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.890 
the sidewall string without going
through<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:17.070> sidewall<00:03:17.640> hole<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.660> look<00:03:18.810> a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
through the sidewall hole so it look a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.530 
through the sidewall hole so it look a
little<00:03:18.989> weird<00:03:19.489> until<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.580> pull<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.940> tight<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
little weird until you pull it tight and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.340 
little weird until you pull it tight and
then<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.830> can<00:03:22.980> see<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:24.450> has<00:03:24.600> stacked<00:03:25.019> those

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
then you can see it has stacked those

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.590 
then you can see it has stacked those
two<00:03:25.650> diamonds<00:03:26.040> right<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.030> top<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.360> each<00:03:27.420> other

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
two diamonds right on top of each other

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.690 
two diamonds right on top of each other
and<00:03:28.200> I'll<00:03:28.350> create<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.590> nice<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.010> find<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.459> deep

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
and I'll create a nice to find a deep
