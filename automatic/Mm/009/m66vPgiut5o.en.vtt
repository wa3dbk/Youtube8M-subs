 And I think that I want to loosen 4 points like an eyelid 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:19.880
 Then I think that it is safer if you close your eyes for a moment like this in a poor white 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:24.469
 So that the arms of the brush won't stab so it will lie sideways 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:30.050
 Put on fluffy and take a deep breath to relax 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:32.860

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.470
 It is finished 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.650
 Now I feel that the eyes of the person who did it were patchy and refreshed when you compare it to just one side 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:27.080
 I think it feels a little bit more moist 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.880
