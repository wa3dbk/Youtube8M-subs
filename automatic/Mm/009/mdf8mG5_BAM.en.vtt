there's<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> little<00:04:10.560> brief<00:04:10.950> how-to<00:04:11.790> with<00:04:12.239> the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
there's a little brief how-to with the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.140 
there's a little brief how-to with the
app<00:04:12.540> emoji<00:04:13.140> characters<00:04:14.030> unfortunately<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
app emoji characters unfortunately the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.750 
app emoji characters unfortunately the
font<00:04:15.420> does<00:04:15.660> not<00:04:15.870> work<00:04:16.260> in<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:20.010> Adobe<00:04:20.310> software

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
font does not work in the Adobe software

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.120 
font does not work in the Adobe software
so<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:21.989> way<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.169> have<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.410> do<00:04:22.740> it<00:04:22.919> and

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
so this is the way you have to do it and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.170 
so this is the way you have to do it and
maybe<00:04:23.430> at<00:04:23.610> some<00:04:23.640> future<00:04:24.180> date

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
maybe at some future date

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.439 
maybe at some future date
we'll<00:04:25.509> make<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:25.930> a<00:04:26.850> universal<00:04:27.850> font<00:04:28.150> that

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
we'll make this a universal font that

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.080 
we'll make this a universal font that
works<00:04:28.690> in<00:04:28.930> all<00:04:29.020> applications<00:04:29.860> but<00:04:30.729> like<00:04:30.970> I

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
works in all applications but like I

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.040 
works in all applications but like I
said<00:04:31.300> before<00:04:31.509> there's<00:04:31.960> 889<00:04:34.050> different
