today I was going to be stepping over
the<00:00:30.539> bridge<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.199> original<00:00:31.859> enterprise<00:00:32.250> as

that is a virtual reality experience

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.459 
that is a virtual reality experience
available<00:00:36.059> for<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.540> testing<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.260> well

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
available for just testing out as well

sadly<00:00:38.160> I<00:00:38.309> couldn't<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.850> program<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
sadly I couldn't get that program to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
sadly I couldn't get that program to
work<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.860> engineering<00:00:40.860> deck<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.280> cool

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
work but engineering deck is cool

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310 
work but engineering deck is cool
engineering<00:00:42.450> decks<00:00:42.809> cool

incredible<00:00:57.770> as<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.300> Trekkie<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
incredible as a Trekkie this is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
incredible as a Trekkie this is
incredible<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.580> realistic<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.990> can't

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
incredible this is so realistic I can't

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.950 
incredible this is so realistic I can't
even<00:01:07.560> begin<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> tell<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
even begin to tell you the only thing I

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.780 
even begin to tell you the only thing I
would<00:01:10.020> say<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.159> ceiling<00:01:12.320> it<00:01:13.430> feels<00:01:14.430> really

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
would say is the ceiling it feels really

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.740 
would say is the ceiling it feels really
low<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.479> maybe<00:01:18.830> maybe<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.150> body<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
low but maybe maybe I'm in the body of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
low but maybe maybe I'm in the body of
someone<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.890> lot<00:01:23.070> taller<00:01:23.400> than<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.790> am<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
someone a lot taller than I am I'm

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.789 
someone a lot taller than I am I'm
actually<00:01:24.330> quite<00:01:24.720> short<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.140> real<00:01:25.320> life<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
actually quite short in real life so to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.800 
actually quite short in real life so to
have<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> ceiling<00:01:26.400> seem<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.090> close<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.689> my

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
have a ceiling seem this close to my

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
have a ceiling seem this close to my
head<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.439> rather<00:01:28.979> unusual<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:31.280> this<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
head is rather unusual but this is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
head is rather unusual but this is
incredible<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.360> mean<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.810> using<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
incredible I mean I'm using the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
incredible I mean I'm using the
development<00:01:35.400> kit<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> oculus<00:01:36.600> rift

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
development kit one of the oculus rift

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
development kit one of the oculus rift
so<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.590> HD<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.310> me<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.610> this

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
so this is not HD for me but this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
so this is not HD for me but this
actually<00:01:39.000> looks<00:01:39.509> incredible<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:41.280> looks

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
actually looks incredible this looks

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.319 
actually looks incredible this looks
like<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.119> am<00:01:42.570> literally<00:01:43.170> staring<00:01:44.009> at<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.970> set

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
like I am literally staring at the set

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.249 
like I am literally staring at the set
of<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.780> TV<00:01:46.020> show<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.829> not<00:01:47.329> pixely<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.689> me<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
of a TV show it's not pixely for me it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.359 
of a TV show it's not pixely for me it
it's<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.070> cartoony<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.939> any<00:01:51.060> way<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:52.100> feel<00:01:53.100> like

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
it's not cartoony in any way I feel like

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.380 
it's not cartoony in any way I feel like
I<00:01:53.549> could<00:01:53.759> reach<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> touch<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.710> table

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.140 

now<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.920> actually<00:02:00.250> be<00:02:00.550> played

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
now this this can actually be played

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.790 
now this this can actually be played
with<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:02.020> controller<00:02:03.010> and<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:05.380> I<00:02:05.560> wasn't

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
with a controller and if I wasn't

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.999 
with a controller and if I wasn't
recording<00:02:06.460> right<00:02:06.670> now<00:02:07.410> then<00:02:08.410> that's<00:02:08.800> what<00:02:08.979> I

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
recording right now then that's what I

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.830 
recording right now then that's what I
would<00:02:09.250> be<00:02:09.369> doing<00:02:09.399> I'd<00:02:09.789> be<00:02:09.940> literally<00:02:10.360> standing

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
would be doing I'd be literally standing

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.380 
would be doing I'd be literally standing
up<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.350> using<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.770> controller<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.670> move<00:02:13.209> around

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
up and using a controller to move around

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.190 
up and using a controller to move around
because<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.740> turn<00:02:14.920> my<00:02:15.160> head<00:02:15.430> and<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:16.570> hits

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
because I can turn my head and then hits

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.199 
because I can turn my head and then hits
you<00:02:17.650> know<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.100> forward<00:02:18.459> button<00:02:18.640> which<00:02:19.030> in

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
you know the forward button which in

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.750 
you know the forward button which in
this<00:02:19.390> case<00:02:19.660> is<00:02:19.930> W<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:21.550> move<00:02:21.730> forward<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.550> can

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
this case is W to move forward and I can

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.630 
this case is W to move forward and I can
strafe<00:02:25.120> oh<00:02:26.370> man<00:02:27.370> oh<00:02:28.140> man

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
strafe oh man oh man

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.740 
strafe oh man oh man
but<00:02:30.640> because<00:02:30.880> I'm<00:02:31.000> recording<00:02:31.510> I'm

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
but because I'm recording I'm

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.690 
but because I'm recording I'm
deliberately<00:02:32.320> staying<00:02:32.770> sort<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.220> facing

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
deliberately staying sort of facing

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.960 
deliberately staying sort of facing
front<00:02:34.390> words<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:38.040> I'm<00:02:39.040> gonna<00:02:39.400> use<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.790> mouse

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
front words and I'm gonna use the mouse

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.240 
front words and I'm gonna use the mouse
to<00:02:40.000> about<00:02:40.630> turn<00:02:41.019> now<00:02:41.350> because<00:02:41.709> otherwise<00:02:41.980> I'm

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
to about turn now because otherwise I'm

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
to about turn now because otherwise I'm
gonna<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.489> facing<00:02:42.910> away<00:02:43.030> from<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.390> camera<00:02:43.480> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
gonna be facing away from the camera and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.320 
gonna be facing away from the camera and
the<00:02:43.959> microphone<00:02:44.370> look<00:02:45.370> at<00:02:45.550> this<00:02:45.700> are<00:02:46.000> that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the microphone look at this are that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.570 
the microphone look at this are that
actually<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.780> walked<00:02:47.050> into<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.620> table<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
actually I walked into the table and it

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.400 
actually I walked into the table and it
nudged<00:02:48.850> me<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.630> side<00:02:49.870> as<00:02:50.140> though<00:02:50.290> it

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
nudged me to the side as though it

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.250 
nudged me to the side as though it
really<00:02:50.800> was<00:02:50.980> there<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.630> not<00:02:52.780> gonna<00:02:52.900> open

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
really was there this is not gonna open

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.250 
really was there this is not gonna open
is<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:55.000> is<00:02:55.090> right<00:02:55.390> in<00:02:55.570> front<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.870> my<00:02:56.019> face

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
is it that is right in front of my face

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.259 
is it that is right in front of my face
I<00:02:56.500> feel<00:02:56.800> like<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.190> can<00:02:57.370> touch<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.700> it's

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
I feel like I can touch it it's it's

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.180 
I feel like I can touch it it's it's
just<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.780> strange<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.350> my<00:03:02.560> hand<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:02.980> not

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
just so strange that my hand is not

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.740 
just so strange that my hand is not
touching<00:03:03.489> anything<00:03:03.910> in<00:03:04.180> there<00:03:06.420> got<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.510> warp

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
touching anything in there got the warp

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.560 
touching anything in there got the warp
core<00:03:08.019> over<00:03:08.260> there<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.620> let's<00:03:08.650> have<00:03:08.890> a<00:03:08.950> look

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
core over there so let's have a look

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.660 
core over there so let's have a look
exactly<00:03:10.570> what<00:03:11.079> is<00:03:11.260> on<00:03:11.880> leave<00:03:12.880> this<00:03:13.180> table<00:03:13.480> oh

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
man I just want to reach out and tap all

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:27.380 
man I just want to reach out and tap all
the<00:03:20.350> buttons<00:03:21.390> or<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.450> touch<00:03:22.840> screen<00:03:23.230> buttons

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390

actually being able to look down into
where<00:04:12.099> the<00:04:12.250> warp<00:04:12.489> core<00:04:12.819> is<00:04:13.410> look<00:04:14.410> down<00:04:15.010> over

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
where the warp core is look down over

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.280 
where the warp core is look down over
the<00:04:15.610> edge<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.060> barrier<00:04:16.479> that's<00:04:16.900> pretty

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
the edge of the barrier that's pretty

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.789 
the edge of the barrier that's pretty
crazy

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
crazy

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:27.470

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
thought there's something standing there

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.160 
thought there's something standing there

that's meant to be there unless that's

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.070 
that's meant to be there unless that's
like<00:05:02.650> where<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.910> toilets<00:05:04.330> are<00:05:04.480> cuz<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.870> never

episode where anyone ever mentioned they

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.260

remember this area I'm pretty sure in

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.340 
remember this area I'm pretty sure in
the<00:05:16.300> first<00:05:16.600> series<00:05:16.990> data<00:05:18.360> or<00:05:19.360> somebody<00:05:20.140> I

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
the first series data or somebody I

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.950 
the first series data or somebody I
think<00:05:20.830> it<00:05:20.890> was<00:05:20.980> data<00:05:21.250> he<00:05:22.150> took<00:05:22.360> out<00:05:22.540> all<00:05:22.570> the

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.680 
think it was data he took out all the
with<00:05:23.080> all<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.530> chips<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.150> he<00:05:25.150> had<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.510> put

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
with all the chips and he had to put

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.540 
with all the chips and he had to put
them<00:05:25.870> back<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.470> order<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.980> stop<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.160> warp-core

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.090 
them back in order to stop a warp-core
breach<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.450> he<00:05:29.290> was<00:05:29.440> super<00:05:29.710> super<00:05:29.830> fast

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
breach and he was super super fast

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.500 
breach and he was super super fast
because<00:05:30.430> he's<00:05:30.550> an<00:05:30.669> Android<00:05:30.850> and<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.360> always

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
because he's an Android and I always

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.270 
because he's an Android and I always

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
a huge Star Trek fan I loved

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.300 
a huge Star Trek fan I loved
next-generation<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.530> classic<00:05:44.919> series

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
next-generation and the classic series

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.850 
next-generation and the classic series
both<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.910> those<00:05:46.030> were<00:05:46.390> just<00:05:46.720> fantastic<00:05:47.530> to<00:05:47.560> me

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
both of those were just fantastic to me

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.680 
both of those were just fantastic to me
I<00:05:47.890> didn't<00:05:48.340> particularly<00:05:48.640> get<00:05:48.970> into<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:49.540> other

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
I didn't particularly get into the other

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.760 
I didn't particularly get into the other
series<00:05:50.140> like<00:05:50.169> ds9<00:05:50.740> or<00:05:51.280> Voyager<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.960> this<00:05:53.590> is

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
series like ds9 or Voyager so this is

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.260 
series like ds9 or Voyager so this is
the<00:05:53.950> best<00:05:54.190> thing<00:05:54.400> ever<00:05:54.669> it's<00:05:54.940> a<00:05:55.000> shame<00:05:55.240> I

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
the best thing ever it's a shame I

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.570 
the best thing ever it's a shame I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
couldn't get the bridge of the classic

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.650 
couldn't get the bridge of the classic
enterprise<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:59.110> work<00:06:00.120> because<00:06:01.120> that's<00:06:01.450> why<00:06:01.630> I

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660
