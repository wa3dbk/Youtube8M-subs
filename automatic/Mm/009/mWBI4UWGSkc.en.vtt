00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.200
 yucca yalonen just told you that 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.420
 for totally unimportant last year 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.240
 last season and the whole history of relationships with 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.250
 versus dynamo in playoffs but like u 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.199
 players things are not likely 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.640
 forgot in wants with you the address you need 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.550
 replant his fans into his account from 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.699
 the world give it 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.800
 in general, for the players it also does not have 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.540
 values ​​are another thing that of course we 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.430
 remember what last year itself completed and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.699
 determined to prove that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.110
 this year we are stronger than 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:48.729
 four matches played against dynamo 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.989
 Does the regular season succeeded 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:55.750
 follow the team play 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.940
 legs unfortunately not failed 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.559
 nature we see it is not in me 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.510
 dream last year's moment how are you 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 scoring throwing the puck rather he 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.339
 the judge flies away the gates from you 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.719
 mastic 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.810
 but I don’t know about dreams but definitely 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.090
 Of course this moment scrolled more than once in 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.299
 head and hope that this year shama 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.360
 they will fly skids here 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.350
 goal or was not you 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.880
 Can you say a year of his corner 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.840
 I agree of course it was right 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.420
 guest patients 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 but the conclusion is that the frontal marine video 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.310
 run up pages to drink from arya media 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.560
 file in html 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.390
 yes answer the previous question I personally 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.640
 did not watch the wheel freely while playing 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.950
 dynamo but classes began and certainly 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.420
 taken away from an opponent and not only 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.310
 from a practical or theoretical point 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.310
 view of this series we will be ready 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.600
 rockets on top of the bosses and yes I 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.490
 I agree that most likely to melt 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.670
 and discipline and it is she who we give 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.729
 most important attention if we are 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.739
 stick to the system and play smoothly 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.010
 as it is required of us by the coaching 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.010
 headquarters then our chances will increase significantly 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.790
 we have already proved that you can play very 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.790
 quality hockey 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:31.580
 win of games he grew choice 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.590
 criteria and and the world that is this is the final 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390
 western conference this will create 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.930
 it is clear that this is super responsible 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.739
 matches 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.690
 all season it is clear that they will not 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.910
 light it will be and villar will 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.540
 tough and in case it will 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 necessary we are also ready to play well 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.400
 maybe even a little dirty if 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 rival will us if rival were 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 behave this way 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:06.850
 treat smelting 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.020
 you are on his hands the front side of course 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.870
 I would like to 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.400
 a similar result that we showed 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.260
 last year did not happen again 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.700
 we all really want this we 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.770
 We strive but we must understand that these are games 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.720
 vs incumbent champion team 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:32.620
 everyone understands that these matches will be on 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.260
 absolutely absolute team level 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.710
 strongly in this case we are confident 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.090
 we know that we are strong and can 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.290
 show a very high quality game and 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.290
 able to go further
