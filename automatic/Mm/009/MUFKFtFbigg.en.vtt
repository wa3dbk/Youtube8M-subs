today I'm maker 101 we're going to talk
about<00:00:03.270> joinery<00:00:07.309> when<00:00:08.309> woodworkers<00:00:08.940> talk

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
about joinery when woodworkers talk

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.879 
about joinery when woodworkers talk
about<00:00:09.360> joinery<00:00:09.780> they<00:00:10.349> really<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.710> mean

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
about joinery they really just mean

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.080 
about joinery they really just mean
sticking<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.460> pieces<00:00:11.759> of<00:00:11.820> wood<00:00:11.969> together

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
sticking two pieces of wood together

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240 
sticking two pieces of wood together
usually<00:00:12.690> not<00:00:12.870> just<00:00:12.900> by<00:00:13.230> nailing<00:00:13.530> or<00:00:13.860> screwing

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
usually not just by nailing or screwing

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.919 
usually not just by nailing or screwing
them<00:00:14.429> together<00:00:14.580> there's<00:00:15.330> an<00:00:15.450> infinite<00:00:15.900> number

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
them together there's an infinite number

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.450 
them together there's an infinite number
of<00:00:16.199> ways<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:17.130> only<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.400> to

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
of ways to do this we're only going to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.340 
of ways to do this we're only going to
talk<00:00:17.609> about<00:00:17.760> five<00:00:18.090> today<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.140> five

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
talk about five today these are five

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.929 
talk about five today these are five
that<00:00:19.529> don't<00:00:19.680> take<00:00:19.859> any<00:00:20.039> real<00:00:20.279> special<00:00:20.699> tools

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
that don't take any real special tools

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.000 
that don't take any real special tools
and<00:00:21.300> are<00:00:21.449> kind<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.720> easy<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.199> now<00:00:22.380> generally

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and are kind of easy to do now generally

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
and are kind of easy to do now generally
the<00:00:23.130> type<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.340> joinery<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.060> choose<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the type of joinery that you choose is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.390 
the type of joinery that you choose is
dependent<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.320> two<00:00:25.500> things<00:00:25.740> strength<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
dependent on two things strength and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.890 
dependent on two things strength and
appearance<00:00:26.880> sometimes<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> need<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.660> really

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
appearance sometimes you need a really

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.779 
appearance sometimes you need a really
strong<00:00:27.930> joint<00:00:28.500> sometimes<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.429> need<00:00:29.580> one

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
strong joint sometimes you need one

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.030 
strong joint sometimes you need one

will<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:33.989> useful<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.350> your<00:00:34.590> next<00:00:34.710> project<00:00:34.860> now

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
will be useful for your next project now

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.280 
will be useful for your next project now
the<00:00:35.579> first<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> Dowling<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the first one is Dowling and for this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
the first one is Dowling and for this
you<00:00:37.469> only<00:00:37.649> need<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> drill<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.670> idea<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you only need a drill the idea is that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.209 
you only need a drill the idea is that
you<00:00:39.450> drill<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.930> corresponding<00:00:40.649> hole<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.070> both

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
you drill a corresponding hole in both

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.040 
you drill a corresponding hole in both
pieces<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> wood<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.149> same<00:00:42.329> diameter<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
pieces of wood the same diameter as the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.959 
pieces of wood the same diameter as the
dowel<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.829> using<00:00:44.040> then<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.850> use

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
dowel that you're using then you use

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.700 
dowel that you're using then you use
some<00:00:45.180> glue<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.690> knock<00:00:45.870> all<00:00:46.110> three<00:00:46.350> pieces<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
some glue and knock all three pieces of

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.650 
some glue and knock all three pieces of
wood<00:00:46.890> together<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.879> simple<00:00:48.149> strong

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
wood together it's a very simple strong

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
wood together it's a very simple strong
and<00:00:48.960> easy<00:00:49.110> joint<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.770> next<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.460> mitering

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and easy joint to do next up is mitering

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.760 
and easy joint to do next up is mitering
if<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.300> watch<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.750> saws<00:00:51.989> episode<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> maker

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
if you watch the saws episode of maker

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.439 
if you watch the saws episode of maker
101<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.399> heard<00:00:53.579> me<00:00:53.699> talk<00:00:53.850> about<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.210> miter

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
101 you heard me talk about the miter

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
101 you heard me talk about the miter
saw<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.320> useful<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:55.829> cutting

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
saw which is really useful for cutting

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
saw which is really useful for cutting
angles<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.940> wood<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.320> use<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> miter

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
angles on wood now you can use a miter

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.319 
angles on wood now you can use a miter
saw<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.160> cut<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.850> very<00:00:59.969> quickly

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
saw to cut this and do it very quickly

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.270 
saw to cut this and do it very quickly
and<00:01:00.570> easily<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.050> could<00:01:01.170> also<00:01:01.410> use<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> handsaw

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and easily you could also use a handsaw

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.920 
and easily you could also use a handsaw
in<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> miter<00:01:02.789> box<00:01:03.030> it's<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.719> bit

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in a miter box it's just a little bit

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.990 
in a miter box it's just a little bit
more<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.489> cut<00:01:05.790> two

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
more work basically you just cut two

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
more work basically you just cut two
angles<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.350> connect<00:01:07.770> those<00:01:07.890> two

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
angles and then you connect those two

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.620 
angles and then you connect those two
pieces<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> wood<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.030> angle<00:01:09.360> using

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
pieces of wood at that angle using

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.980 
pieces of wood at that angle using
screws<00:01:10.290> nails<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.189> even<00:01:11.549> dowels<00:01:11.810> usually<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
screws nails or even dowels usually this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630 
screws nails or even dowels usually this
glue<00:01:13.200> involved<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.310> you're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.549> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
glue involved and if you're going to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.330 
glue involved and if you're going to
make<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> frame<00:01:15.270> or<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.020> box<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.710> any<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.100> that's

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
make a frame or a box of any kind that's

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.590 
make a frame or a box of any kind that's
going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> ninety<00:01:17.970> degree<00:01:18.090> angle<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
going to have a ninety degree angle you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to have a ninety degree angle you
just<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> make<00:01:19.229> sure<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.439> both<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
just have to make sure that both of the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.160 
just have to make sure that both of the
angles<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.640> wood<00:01:20.850> add<00:01:21.060> up<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> 90<00:01:21.990> degrees

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
angles on your wood add up to 90 degrees

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.050 
angles on your wood add up to 90 degrees
they<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.890> complementary<00:01:23.250> normally

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
they have to be complementary normally

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.120 
they have to be complementary normally
that's<00:01:24.240> done<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.509> 45<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> 45<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.040> you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that's done with 45 and a 45 but you

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
that's done with 45 and a 45 but you
could<00:01:26.250> do<00:01:26.340> any<00:01:26.490> combination<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:27.330> long<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.600> they

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
could do any combination as long as they

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
could do any combination as long as they
add<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.320> 90<00:01:28.470> degrees<00:01:28.680> then<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.579> data

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
add up to 90 degrees then there's data

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
add up to 90 degrees then there's data
wing<00:01:30.030> basically<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.900> cut<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> slot<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
wing basically you cut a slot that's the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
wing basically you cut a slot that's the
same<00:01:32.310> size<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> piece<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> wood<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.840> then

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
same size as a piece of wood and then

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
same size as a piece of wood and then
you<00:01:34.110> fit<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.500> piece<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.860> wood<00:01:34.979> into<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.579> slot

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
you fit that piece of wood into the slot

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.850 
you fit that piece of wood into the slot
that's<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.540> all<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.710> can

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that's really all there is to it you can

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.590 
that's really all there is to it you can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
use it dado blade on your saw which cuts

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.289 
use it dado blade on your saw which cuts
a<00:01:40.079> slot<00:01:40.470> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> single<00:01:41.340> blade<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:42.150> could

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
a slot with a single blade or you could

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.960

joiner has a spinning blade that cuts a
crescent-shaped<00:02:09.780> slot<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.170> cut<00:02:11.320> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
crescent-shaped slot you cut the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.080 
crescent-shaped slot you cut the
matching<00:02:11.770> slots<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.250> two<00:02:12.370> pieces<00:02:12.520> of<00:02:12.670> wood<00:02:12.910> and

then you use a biscuit and some glue to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.470 
then you use a biscuit and some glue to
join<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.280> all<00:02:15.370> together<00:02:15.520> there's<00:02:16.270> three

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
join it all together there's three

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.900 
join it all together there's three
different<00:02:16.570> sizes<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.230> biscuits<00:02:17.620> 0<00:02:18.040> 10<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.610> 20

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
different sizes of biscuits 0 10 and 20

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.760 
different sizes of biscuits 0 10 and 20
and<00:02:19.090> your<00:02:19.660> biscuit<00:02:19.960> joiner<00:02:20.200> should<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.740> a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
and your biscuit joiner should have a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.650 
and your biscuit joiner should have a
corresponding<00:02:21.250> depth<00:02:21.790> marking<00:02:22.270> that<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.510> can

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
corresponding depth marking that you can

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.630 
corresponding depth marking that you can
set<00:02:22.990> for<00:02:23.200> whatever<00:02:23.620> size<00:02:24.040> biscuit<00:02:24.490> you're

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
set for whatever size biscuit you're

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.699 
set for whatever size biscuit you're
using<00:02:24.880> last<00:02:25.300> up<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.900> pocket<00:02:26.140> hole<00:02:26.410> now

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
using last up is the pocket hole now

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.050 
using last up is the pocket hole now
this<00:02:26.890> one's<00:02:27.100> nice<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:27.940> easy

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
this one's nice because it's pretty easy

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.930 
this one's nice because it's pretty easy
to<00:02:28.300> do<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.900> often<00:02:29.080> pretty<00:02:29.500> hidden<00:02:29.940> you

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
to do but it's often pretty hidden you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.520 
to do but it's often pretty hidden you
can<00:02:31.120> put<00:02:31.300> two<00:02:31.480> pieces<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.750> wood<00:02:31.959> together<00:02:32.110> with

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
can put two pieces of wood together with

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.990 
can put two pieces of wood together with
the<00:02:32.740> hidden<00:02:33.040> joint<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:33.610> then<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.850> can

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
the hidden joint but then you can

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.400 
the hidden joint but then you can
actually<00:02:34.180> access<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.840> joint<00:02:35.050> if<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.290> ever

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
actually access the joint if you ever

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.320 
actually access the joint if you ever
want<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.620> take<00:02:35.770> them<00:02:35.950> apart<00:02:36.070> again<00:02:36.400> it's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
want to take them apart again it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.390 
want to take them apart again it's
easiest<00:02:37.780> if<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.020> use<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> jig<00:02:38.650> but<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.220> do

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
easiest if you use a jig but you can do

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.190 
easiest if you use a jig but you can do
it<00:02:39.489> freehand<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.120> want<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.510> basically<00:02:40.870> you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
it freehand if you want to basically you

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.110 
it freehand if you want to basically you
drill<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.470> hole<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:41.980> an<00:02:42.070> angle<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:42.640> then<00:02:43.030> you

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
drill a hole at an angle and then you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.550 
drill a hole at an angle and then you
drive<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> screw<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:44.050> connect<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.410> two

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
drive a screw in to connect the two

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.710 
drive a screw in to connect the two
pieces<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.890> wood<00:02:45.100> if<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.120> really<00:02:46.450> wanted<00:02:46.690> to

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
pieces of wood if you really wanted to

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.449 
pieces of wood if you really wanted to
hide<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.140> can<00:02:47.380> put<00:02:47.560> in<00:02:47.650> some<00:02:47.830> wooden<00:02:48.130> plugs

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
hide it you can put in some wooden plugs
