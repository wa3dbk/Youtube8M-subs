00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
choose you whatever that means but it's

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.360 
choose you whatever that means but it's
there's<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> moment<00:00:13.650> where<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.009> know<00:00:14.040> that

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.760 
there's a moment where you know that
this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> story<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.179> have<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> tell

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.620 

what<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.280> do<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.670> really<00:00:24.120> to<00:00:24.300> try<00:00:24.540> to

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
what I like to do is really to try to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.430 
what I like to do is really to try to
create<00:00:24.990> empathy<00:00:26.029> between<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.600> and<00:00:27.960> the

protagonist<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> game<00:00:29.520> because<00:00:29.760> one<00:00:30.660> if

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
protagonist in the game because one if

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.810 
protagonist in the game because one if
once<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.320> feel<00:00:31.619> empathy<00:00:32.010> for<00:00:32.220> a<00:00:32.460> character

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
once you feel empathy for a character

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.640 
once you feel empathy for a character
then<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.960> will<00:00:34.200> start<00:00:34.650> sharing<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:36.450> he<00:00:36.930> feels

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.020 

it's<00:00:40.650> not<00:00:40.890> necessarily<00:00:41.460> creating<00:00:41.910> a

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's not necessarily creating a

people that interactive storytelling was
possible<00:01:40.649> to<00:01:41.149> that<00:01:42.149> it<00:01:42.270> could<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.689> an

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
possible to that it could be an

needed to convince people beyond is a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.580 
needed to convince people beyond is a
bit<00:01:53.460> different<00:01:53.820> challenge<00:01:54.450> because<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.500> have

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
bit different challenge because we have

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.529 
bit different challenge because we have
a<00:01:55.619> larger<00:01:56.039> community<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.579> fans<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.149> people<00:01:57.450> who

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
what beyond is going to be but still

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.099 
what beyond is going to be but still
there<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:05.060> people<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.179> both<00:02:06.479> ends<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.020> a

spectrum that we need to convince
on<00:02:10.460> one<00:02:11.240> side<00:02:11.510> we<00:02:11.570> have<00:02:11.860> hardcore<00:02:12.860> gamers<00:02:13.280> who

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
on one side we have hardcore gamers who

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.090 
on one side we have hardcore gamers who
think<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.720> game<00:02:15.080> should<00:02:15.110> only<00:02:15.620> be<00:02:15.920> about

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
think that game should only be about

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.850 
think that game should only be about
shooting<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:16.970> abid<00:02:17.270> action<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:17.990> killing<00:02:18.710> and

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
games and we think that video games are

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.180 
games and we think that video games are
just<00:02:44.989> about<00:02:45.170> violence<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:46.010> there's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
just about violence and that there's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.310 
just about violence and that there's
nothing<00:02:46.580> there<00:02:46.760> for<00:02:46.790> them<00:02:47.209> or<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:48.080> there<00:02:48.230> are

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
nothing there for them or that there are

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.620 
nothing there for them or that there are
too<00:02:48.440> complex<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:49.010> play<00:02:49.250> or<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.790> they<00:02:50.300> are<00:02:50.450> not

too complex to play or them they are not
interested<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.290> shooting<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.430> say<00:02:52.610> no
