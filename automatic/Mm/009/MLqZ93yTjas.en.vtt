there you go my indicator is a source
block<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.430> lava<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:54.880> the<00:00:55.809> more<00:00:55.989> that<00:00:56.020> goes<00:00:56.200> in

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
block of lava and the more that goes in

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.069 
block of lava and the more that goes in
the<00:00:56.770> more<00:00:57.399> that<00:00:57.520> it<00:00:57.640> fills<00:00:57.850> up<00:00:58.059> I've<00:00:58.809> got<00:00:58.989> it

the more that it fills up I've got it
set<00:00:59.230> up<00:00:59.290> so<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.530> each<00:00:59.770> one<00:00:59.920> of<00:00:59.980> these

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
set up so that each one of these

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.720 
set up so that each one of these
dispensers<00:01:00.700> represents<00:01:01.510> sections<00:01:02.290> of<00:01:02.980> 64

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
dispensers represents sections of 64

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.600 
dispensers represents sections of 64
buckets<00:01:04.149> all<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:05.079> way<00:01:05.199> up<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:06.369> way<00:01:06.490> I<00:01:06.520> did

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
buckets all the way up the way I did

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.809 
buckets all the way up the way I did
that<00:01:06.969> let's<00:01:07.390> bring<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.020> overlay<00:01:08.469> back<00:01:08.819> now

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:09.819 
that let's bring the overlay back now

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.669 
that let's bring the overlay back now
the<00:01:09.909> way<00:01:10.030> I<00:01:10.060> did<00:01:10.209> that<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.749> because<00:01:11.289> these

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
the way I did that is because these

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.359 
the way I did that is because these
chests<00:01:12.340> are<00:01:12.520> six<00:01:13.149> by<00:01:13.600> nine<00:01:14.039> which<00:01:15.039> means<00:01:15.310> that

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
chests are six by nine which means that

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.459 
chests are six by nine which means that
they're<00:01:15.520> fifty<00:01:15.909> four<00:01:16.149> blocks<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:16.899> fifty<00:01:17.289> four

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:17.469 
they're fifty four blocks so fifty four

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.249 
they're fifty four blocks so fifty four
buckets<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.299> then<00:01:19.299> plus<00:01:19.509> two<00:01:19.719> dispensers

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
buckets and then plus two dispensers

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.279 
buckets and then plus two dispensers
make<00:01:20.950> 64<00:01:21.579> pretty<00:01:22.209> easy<00:01:22.389> so<00:01:22.689> you<00:01:22.779> just<00:01:22.929> read<00:01:23.139> off

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
make 64 pretty easy so you just read off

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.359 
make 64 pretty easy so you just read off
each<00:01:23.529> chest<00:01:23.969> now<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:26.049> I<00:01:26.200> said<00:01:26.229> this<00:01:26.889> is<00:01:27.159> not

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
each chest now like I said this is not

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.779 
each chest now like I said this is not
efficient<00:01:28.090> or<00:01:28.299> compact<00:01:29.200> or<00:01:31.139> sane<00:01:32.139> um<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:33.549> is

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
efficient or compact or sane um this is

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.779 
efficient or compact or sane um this is
this<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.810> showy<00:01:35.049> this<00:01:35.469> is<00:01:35.649> me<00:01:35.799> having<00:01:36.219> fun<00:01:36.579> and

reason other than it looks cool and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.339 
reason other than it looks cool and
possibly<00:01:41.200> could<00:01:41.380> burn<00:01:41.529> down<00:01:41.679> my<00:01:41.740> whole<00:01:42.009> base

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
possibly could burn down my whole base

possibly could burn down my whole base
I'm<00:01:44.349> not<00:01:44.590> going<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.859> do<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:45.520> big<00:01:46.299> tutorial<00:01:46.929> for

I'm not going to do a big tutorial for
this<00:01:47.259> because<00:01:47.499> be<00:01:47.829> honest<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:49.090> can<00:01:49.299> be<00:01:49.329> built

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
this because be honest this can be built

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.169 
this because be honest this can be built
better<00:01:49.929> I<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.679> fact<00:01:50.709> would<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.399> someone<00:01:51.819> out

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
there to look at this design and go I

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.980 
there to look at this design and go I
know<00:01:54.520> how<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.849> make<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:55.240> better<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.659> know<00:01:55.899> how

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
know how to make that better I know how

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.739 
know how to make that better I know how
to<00:01:56.079> make<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.349> smaller<00:01:56.709> faster<00:01:57.310> cheaper<00:01:57.749> that

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
to make it smaller faster cheaper that

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.260 
to make it smaller faster cheaper that
would<00:01:58.869> be<00:01:58.959> great<00:01:59.310> currently<00:02:00.310> it's<00:02:00.609> seven

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
would be great currently it's seven

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.440 
would be great currently it's seven

an<00:02:04.539> older<00:02:04.869> version<00:02:05.049> over<00:02:05.499> here<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:08.020> also

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
an older version over here and it's also

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.589 
an older version over here and it's also
seven<00:02:09.069> blocks<00:02:09.250> wide<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.759> eight<00:02:09.880> blocks<00:02:10.060> d<00:02:10.390> but

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
seven blocks wide in eight blocks d but

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.320 
seven blocks wide in eight blocks d but
I<00:02:10.869> don't<00:02:11.140> know<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:12.070> main<00:02:12.250> problem<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.880> in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
I don't know the main problem is that in

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.710 
I don't know the main problem is that in
order<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.780> dispense<00:02:14.350> a

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.350 

Allah<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.500> source<00:02:17.830> block<00:02:18.130> when<00:02:18.760> an<00:02:18.940> item<00:02:19.060> goes

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
Allah the source block when an item goes

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.500 
Allah the source block when an item goes
into<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.810> chest<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.350> then<00:02:20.650> pick<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> back<00:02:21.220> up

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
into the chest and then pick it back up

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.840 
into the chest and then pick it back up
when<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.630> empty<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> chest<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:24.280> need<00:02:24.820> a

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
when you empty the chest you need a

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.900 
when you empty the chest you need a
pulse<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.540> need<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.720> dual<00:02:26.530> edge<00:02:26.920> detector

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
pulse you need a dual edge detector

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.780 
pulse you need a dual edge detector
something<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.930> sends<00:02:29.440> out<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> pulse<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
something that sends out a pulse when it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.200 
something that sends out a pulse when it
sees<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> signal<00:02:31.570> start<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.140> when<00:02:32.710> it<00:02:32.800> stops<00:02:33.210> so

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
sees a signal start and when it stops so

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.200 
sees a signal start and when it stops so
what<00:02:34.360> I'm<00:02:34.450> using<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.990> these<00:02:35.740> guys<00:02:35.980> here<00:02:36.430> we've

block and then just a line of redstone

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.730 
block and then just a line of redstone
to<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:43.060> repeater<00:02:43.510> I<00:02:43.720> need<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.110> line<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.470> need<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
to a repeater I need the line I need the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.250 
to a repeater I need the line I need the
repeater<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.270> dispensers<00:02:47.020> don't

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
repeater so that the dispensers don't

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.860 
repeater so that the dispensers don't
talk<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.680> each<00:02:47.740> other<00:02:47.950> um<00:02:49.740> now<00:02:50.740> it's<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.870> lever

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
talk to each other um now it's a lever

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.000

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
so if I stick a lever here now watch the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.190 
so if I stick a lever here now watch the
anybody<00:03:01.330> who's<00:03:01.450> not<00:03:01.570> familiar<00:03:01.750> with<00:03:02.110> this

you'll see what I mean you got the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.710 
you'll see what I mean you got the
repeater<00:03:03.670> there<00:03:03.910> i<00:03:04.090> turn<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.930> lever<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.440> oh

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
repeater there i turn the lever on oh

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.120 
repeater there i turn the lever on oh
okay<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:07.780> can't<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.560> repeater<00:03:08.920> because

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
okay you can't see the repeater because

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.120 
okay you can't see the repeater because
I'm<00:03:09.280> not<00:03:09.580> standing<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.090> right<00:03:10.209> spot<00:03:11.130> flying

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
I'm not standing the right spot flying

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.460 
I'm not standing the right spot flying
that's<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.580> flying's<00:03:12.940> for<00:03:13.209> okay<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.320> can

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
that's what flying's for okay you can

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.560 
that's what flying's for okay you can
see<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> repeater<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> turn<00:03:16.240> the<00:03:16.390> light

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
see the repeater so I turn the light

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.460 
see the repeater so I turn the light
leave<00:03:16.840> her<00:03:16.959> off<00:03:18.540> nothing<00:03:19.540> happens<00:03:20.110> because<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
leave her off nothing happens because it

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.390 
leave her off nothing happens because it
happens<00:03:20.800> too<00:03:20.950> fast<00:03:20.980> great<00:03:22.800> well<00:03:23.800> okay<00:03:24.190> there's

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
happens too fast great well okay there's

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.490 
happens too fast great well okay there's
a<00:03:24.459> very<00:03:24.700> short<00:03:25.090> redstone<00:03:25.570> pulse<00:03:25.900> because<00:03:26.350> when

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
a very short redstone pulse because when

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.009 
a very short redstone pulse because when
the<00:03:26.620> redstone<00:03:27.040> block<00:03:27.370> moves<00:03:27.760> it's<00:03:28.510> not<00:03:28.750> able

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
the redstone block moves it's not able

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.340 
the redstone block moves it's not able
to<00:03:29.200> power<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.650> line<00:03:29.950> for<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.870> tiny<00:03:31.870> amount<00:03:32.110> of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
to power this line for a tiny amount of

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.440 
to power this line for a tiny amount of
time<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> couple<00:03:33.010> of<00:03:33.100> ticks<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.330> long

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
time a couple of ticks but it's long

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.030 
time a couple of ticks but it's long
enough<00:03:34.510> for<00:03:35.110> the<00:03:35.200> repeater<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.650> pick<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.920> up

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
enough for the repeater to pick it up

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.949 
enough for the repeater to pick it up
shove<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.610> through<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.850> block<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.360> activate

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
shove it through the block and activate

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.020 
shove it through the block and activate
the<00:03:38.260> dispenser<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:39.010> i'll<00:03:39.640> just<00:03:39.700> show<00:03:40.000> you

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
the dispenser so i'll just show you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.240 
the dispenser so i'll just show you
again<00:03:40.300> if<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.540> stick<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:40.900> here<00:03:41.040> turn<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.190> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
again if I stick this here turn on the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.460 
again if I stick this here turn on the
lever<00:03:42.989> lava<00:03:43.989> block<00:03:47.700> no<00:03:48.700> lava<00:03:48.940> block<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.930> that's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
lever lava block no lava block so that's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.199 
lever lava block no lava block so that's
the<00:03:50.680> basic<00:03:51.040> idea<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.580> instead<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.850> levers

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
the basic idea so instead of levers

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.699 
the basic idea so instead of levers
we're<00:03:52.420> just<00:03:52.570> using<00:03:52.720> comparators<00:03:53.380> and

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
we're just using comparators and

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.830 
we're just using comparators and
repeaters<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.970> are<00:03:55.090> all<00:03:55.180> scattered<00:03:55.720> around

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
repeaters that are all scattered around

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.780 
repeaters that are all scattered around
really<00:03:56.680> messily<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:58.660> this<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> not<00:03:59.530> a<00:03:59.890> good

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
really messily this this is not a good

really messily this this is not a good

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.930 
putting a torch I'm in a creative world
okay<00:04:13.920> but<00:04:14.920> yeah<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.209> idea<00:04:16.330> is<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:17.820> get<00:04:18.820> the

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
okay but yeah so the idea is you get the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.699 
okay but yeah so the idea is you get the
toss<00:04:19.180> in<00:04:19.450> your<00:04:19.479> lava<00:04:19.720> buckets<00:04:20.169> up<00:04:20.290> here<00:04:20.530> this

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
toss in your lava buckets up here this

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.540 
toss in your lava buckets up here this
is<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.890> trap<00:04:21.190> chest<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.870> they<00:04:22.870> get<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.550> toss

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
is a trap chest so they get to just toss

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.640 
is a trap chest so they get to just toss
them<00:04:24.789> in<00:04:24.970> without<00:04:25.150> them<00:04:25.479> leaving

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
them in without them leaving

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.150 
them in without them leaving
now<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.639> good<00:04:27.820> thing<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:28.150> with<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.750> design

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
now the good thing is with this design

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.490 
now the good thing is with this design
it<00:04:30.160> seems<00:04:30.669> to<00:04:30.850> filter<00:04:31.180> so<00:04:31.419> fast<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:32.110> right

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
it seems to filter so fast that right

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.270 
it seems to filter so fast that right
now<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.740> top<00:04:33.389> lava<00:04:34.389> block<00:04:34.780> in<00:04:35.020> my<00:04:35.289> MA<00:04:35.530> my<00:04:35.800> meter

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
now the top lava block in my MA my meter

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.120 
now the top lava block in my MA my meter
is<00:04:36.520> on<00:04:37.330> but<00:04:38.050> as<00:04:38.139> soon<00:04:38.259> as<00:04:38.350> this<00:04:38.500> chest<00:04:38.800> empties

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
is on but as soon as this chest empties

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.159 
is on but as soon as this chest empties
it'll<00:04:39.490> turn<00:04:39.639> itself<00:04:39.940> off<00:04:40.150> again<00:04:40.210> but<00:04:40.990> none<00:04:41.139> of

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
it'll turn itself off again but none of

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.409 
it'll turn itself off again but none of
the<00:04:41.320> others<00:04:41.560> will<00:04:41.770> so<00:04:42.610> that<00:04:42.639> closes<00:04:43.270> they

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
the others will so that closes they

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.270 
the others will so that closes they
start<00:04:43.720> flowing<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:46.590> yeah<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:47.919> said<00:04:47.949> this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
start flowing and yeah like I said this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.010 
start flowing and yeah like I said this
one<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.759> on<00:04:48.940> because<00:04:49.270> there's<00:04:49.419> still<00:04:49.630> stuff<00:04:49.750> in

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
one is on because there's still stuff in

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.570 
one is on because there's still stuff in
that<00:04:50.050> chest<00:04:50.470> but<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.889> as<00:04:51.039> it<00:04:51.220> filters<00:04:51.550> down

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that chest but is as it filters down

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.180 
that chest but is as it filters down
it's<00:04:52.419> already<00:04:52.720> activated<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.590> bottom<00:04:53.979> block

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
it's already activated the bottom block

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.250 
it's already activated the bottom block
and<00:04:56.669> there<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:57.729> go<00:04:57.789> now<00:04:58.720> of<00:04:58.810> course<00:04:58.870> you<00:04:59.110> could

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
and there you go now of course you could

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.420 
and there you go now of course you could
do<00:04:59.320> this<00:04:59.470> with<00:04:59.650> Kabul<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.070> can<00:05:00.190> do<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.370> with

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
do this with Kabul you can do this with

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.939 
do this with Kabul you can do this with
whatever<00:05:00.760> you<00:05:01.000> want<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.240> put<00:05:01.419> in<00:05:01.570> here<00:05:01.810> this<00:05:02.800> is

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
whatever you want to put in here this is

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.510 
whatever you want to put in here this is
just<00:05:03.160> an<00:05:03.460> item<00:05:03.910> silo<00:05:04.330> with<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.539> fancy<00:05:04.780> output

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
just an item silo with a fancy output

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.620 
just an item silo with a fancy output
but<00:05:06.520> I<00:05:06.550> would<00:05:06.760> really<00:05:06.880> like<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.300> make<00:05:07.389> it<00:05:07.539> a

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
but I would really like to make it a

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.510 
but I would really like to make it a
smaller<00:05:07.900> fancy<00:05:08.380> output<00:05:08.770> because<00:05:09.010> this<00:05:09.280> is

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
smaller fancy output because this is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.810 
smaller fancy output because this is
ridiculous<00:05:10.889> anyway<00:05:11.889> just<00:05:12.639> a<00:05:12.760> silly<00:05:13.560> dumb

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
ridiculous anyway just a silly dumb

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.060 
ridiculous anyway just a silly dumb
useless<00:05:15.820> thing<00:05:16.330> that<00:05:16.810> you<00:05:17.380> know<00:05:17.500> this<00:05:17.770> is<00:05:17.830> what

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
useless thing that you know this is what

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.520 
useless thing that you know this is what
mine<00:05:18.250> crafts<00:05:18.610> about<00:05:18.820> right<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.300> guess<00:05:20.289> I<00:05:20.380> could

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
mine crafts about right I guess I could

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.990 
mine crafts about right I guess I could
make<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.770> symmetric<00:05:21.010> by<00:05:21.430> putting<00:05:21.699> a<00:05:21.760> ball

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
make that symmetric by putting a ball

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.230 
make that symmetric by putting a ball
there<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.510> oh<00:05:22.690> well<00:05:23.020> too<00:05:23.320> late<00:05:23.349> now<00:05:24.240> anyway

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
there but oh well too late now anyway

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.629 
there but oh well too late now anyway
