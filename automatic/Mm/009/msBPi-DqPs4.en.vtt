because I'm in the middle of exams and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.590 
because I'm in the middle of exams and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
so and got lots of breakouts and you
probably<00:01:44.369> noticed<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:44.939> i<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.390> use

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
probably noticed that i don't use

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.310 
probably noticed that i don't use
foundation<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:47.270> don't<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.329> using<00:01:48.750> foundation

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
foundation I don't like using foundation

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.370 
foundation I don't like using foundation
that<00:01:49.649> often<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:52.049> dry<00:01:52.320> skin

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that often is because I really dry skin

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.819 
that often is because I really dry skin
and<00:01:52.880> if<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.060> use<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:55.079> foundation<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and if I use a little foundation and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.569 
and if I use a little foundation and
light<00:01:56.070> concealer<00:01:57.560> my<00:01:58.560> face<00:01:59.009> would<00:01:59.280> stop

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
light concealer my face would stop

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.060 
light concealer my face would stop
fracking<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> desert<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.680> I<00:02:04.680> guess<00:02:05.040> it's

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
fracking like a desert and I guess it's

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.880 
fracking like a desert and I guess it's
a<00:02:05.280> good<00:02:05.399> thing<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.119> i<00:02:08.690> won't<00:02:09.690> have<00:02:09.840> really<00:02:10.679> bad
