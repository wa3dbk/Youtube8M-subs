 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.020
 one from Latin America 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.389
 continuing with the description of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.850
 transcription process in this video 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.840
 let's see how the union of the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.400
 arn polymerase to the DNA sequence 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.349
 how does the beginning of the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.669
 transcription followed by elongation 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.560
 of the arn that is synthesized and how 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.070
 The process ends at the stage of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.070
 termination 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 the first step is the union of the rn 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:42.269
 DNA polymerase where it occurs in the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 promoter region it should be noted that in 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.030
 prokaryotes this process comes in shape 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.010
 direct recognition and union 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.949
 through the sigma factor of the enzyme 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 whereas in eukaryotes a 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.570
 start of transcription complex 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.370
 in which a whole series of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.360
 transcription factors that we will see in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.460
 the next video 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.269
 completed the binding of the enzyme to the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.269
 DNA sequence 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.850
 is going to start the process of 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.759
 transcript in which you are going to 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.000
 partially unwind the chain of 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.479
 DNA and the polymerase will start at 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.479
 synthesize 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 the arn 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.110
 once the synthesis of the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.490
 first 56 nucleotides is going to release 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.700
 the sigma factor of the enzyme 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 and the central enzyme will continue with 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.680
 what is the elongation of the chain of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 arn 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.970
 so here we have the arn that goes 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.020
 synthesizing 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.120
 the elongation process will continue 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 on the part of the polymerase goes to 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840
 continue 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:10.130
 until it meets a sequence 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.380
 specific in the DNA that is the sequence 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.440
 terminator 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.390
 the arrival of the enzyme to this sequence 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:26.650
 will cause them to destabilize the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.650
 union and be released on the one hand the DNA 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.850
 for another 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:41.710
 the newly synthesized arn chain 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.710
 and on the other the enzyme arn polymerase 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.310
 that is to say that the arrival to the sequence 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.650
 is over now is the signal for 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.650
 conclude the transcription process 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.450
 in the next video we will see in 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:01.690
 detail how this process occurs in 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.129
 eukaryotes and we'll see the factors of 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.129
 transcript involved 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.770
 to see the continuation of this topic 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.580
 educationally I recommend that you see the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.580
 next video
