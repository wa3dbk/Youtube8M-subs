00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.199
 you have rear lift cylinders 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.279
 auxiliary greasing points this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.489
 in case we have three distributors plus the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.469
 distributor that I was talking about 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:31.759
 before the side arm that you 

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:31.759
 the braking system goes to the diverter 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 a cylinder of the system canisters 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.190
 suspension of the anti-dumping lift 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.539
 and below is seen part of the tank 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.289
 which goes into the interior of the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.120
 circle of the left rear wheel 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 from there you can see the oil level 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 hook of three sled or leased 200 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.500
 quintals 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 oil trabucco plug at the back 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.740
 we have control of the lift e 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.180
 a distributor if this distributor 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.520
 clearly we attach the third 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.159
 hydraulic point c we facilitate in 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.990
 moment we have to go attack 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.970
 determined at 30 the third point 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 plumbing is not in the most position 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:49.330
 adequate fuel tank cap with 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 retina and filter or chain of blue with 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.530
 the usual security system 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 front linkage integrated with 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.850
 buttons for height management 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.220
 for the attack therefore of the equipment 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:21.280
 front an additional hydraulic intake 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:25.900
 of god the hook on the front e 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 the incineration of peace is suspended from 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.310
 this other part via the piston 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:48.920
 in this case we do not have the side members 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:51.520
 reinforcement and the four-cylinder water nef 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.520
 radiators 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:05.459
 those points where I release for 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:05.459
 facilitate cleaning garrett turbine 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.540
 with gate failures 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.880
 end to see the air filter 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.390
 finizio plant in braking bosh pump 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:54.830
 proponents of behind common rail 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.830
 here is the engine control unit 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.390
 engine control unit 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:17.470
 fateful have the whole plant of 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:21.070
 sgr quite compact clearly in 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.040
 4 cylinders the distance between fender scr 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:28.620
 very limited trying to get in 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.620
 all inside 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:41.389
 tube that goes into the where I think that 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:41.389
 intercooler away
