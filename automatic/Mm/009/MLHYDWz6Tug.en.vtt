00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.610
 if the blood need for speed you squeal 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.910
 tire pleases hearing casting vinyl tuning not 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.460
 empty words adrenaline is not all 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.000
 pass by buckle up tight and 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.900
 let me introduce you to pretty 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.970
 original racing game under 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.580
 name road smash 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.070
 if you're used to everybody afterburner 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.920
 and limit aids and yet they already 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.379
 managed to get a little tired 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.079
 time requests rabid races then 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.750
 maybe we can intrigue you 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.480
 well, or at least interest the channel 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:54.520
 fell down and provides an overview on the road game 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:56.530
 smash crazy races how do you think 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.899
 can I play a game with this 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.370
 associated with the machines where you need to drive 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.010
 just one finger 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.860
 well if it comes to road smash what's the answer 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.810
 definitely yes and racing is this game 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.420
 difficult to call in principle we are from anyone 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.719
 don't run away we don't catch anyone we 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.569
 just go for fun let 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:19.569
 speeds over 200 well so much more fun 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:22.389
 true if I was asked what genre 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.779
 best suited to this game I would 

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:28.119
 Immediately answered runner you think that not 

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:30.789
 happens runners with cars but here 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.340
 read the same and if you do not believe that 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.920
 listen the further let's take a minute 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.459
 go to the garage and see what we do 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.560
 here pleased the gentlemen developers 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.810
 immediately striking fleet of cars and 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.039
 starting from zadripannogo well on the framework 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.179
 the rest of the golf courses yes just the same 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.169
 a spacecraft called 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.590
 ferrari 

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:55.689
 then you and the BMP and out in the spirit of chevrolet 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.849
 general for every taste and color 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.249
 there are no special characteristics of cars and 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:02.279
 only 2 are essentially important here 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.659
 the speed will stop and only on it and 

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:07.200
 manageability to have time to go around 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.280
 all traffic that's all but tuning 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.440
 pleased so pleased 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.200
 he is limited to paint and casting and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 Stickers however in this framework choose 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 there is what 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.550
 over a dozen different offers 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.530
 only buy can be bought as for 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.019
 game currency in a compartment with her game on 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.629
 the choice and only for her game 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.450
 this as for unique stickers and 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:33.940
 cast in terms of donat we have the usual 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.640
 canister when one race consumed 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.940
 one unit of fuel that we buy either 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.989
 for donate or waiting for recovery but 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.200
 this will surprise no one else 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.040
 we have a map where at first there are only two tracks 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.739
 and all choose the track to your liking and start 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.019
 drive on the local latitudes during the ride 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.760
 We get money experience and indescribable 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.640
 the joy of traffic which is first 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.950
 rarely comes across exactly and then 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.380
 reckless drivers begin to undercut everything 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.230
 more and more often there are whole traffic jams on 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.620
 the road but we are not lucky we can go 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.110
 quietly and slowly but surely we can 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.380
 put pressure on nitrous oxide here 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.810
 how much do you want and let's go into space with such 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.410
 driving points money accrue to where 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 faster 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.780
 and if it really became boring 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.000
 regret cutting the other cars in 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.639
 sideways tried not recommend it 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.459
 Immediately a failure But to pass almost closely 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:36.060
 or shandarahnu its piece of iron though 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.010
 more like a carbon ass on the hood 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.799
 gapered floor for joy 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.859
 but here and the police do not sleep there 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.299
 asterisks in the manner of gta than there are more 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.650
 mind and meaner 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:53.079
 although the race is only fun 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.720
 essentially the whole point of the game is to 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.940
 races purchase tuning new cars and 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.190
 open the next tracks as we see 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.440
 next asphalt is not here it can 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.599
 for the better the game is original in its own way 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.519
 combined in itself a mixture of racing wounds and rao 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.040
 local tyunin and drawing cars 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.099
 pleased tracks looks on this background 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.790
 Worse, however, the panorama camera is such that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.519
 local beauties simply and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.190
 the music in the game is unobtrusive and pleasant 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.070
 Donat is not a critical game itself 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.310
 Russian language and distributed 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.639
 is free 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.100
 As for the specifics of the game, well 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.840
 talk about personal feelings then 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.590
 considering that the game is available to everyone and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.410
 so everyone can say so download and 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.150
 try it out of use at least not 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.729
 bored if not very long 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.550
 linger but for about 15 minutes 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.770
 in the evening we pass well and that's it 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.759
 With you was kinat and channel pod alive until 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.759
 new meetings
