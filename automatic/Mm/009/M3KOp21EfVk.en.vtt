00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.300
 you ask us different 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.080
 plants that can be grown in the garden 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.380
 and not much to load itself 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.300
 some worries i have it 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.700
 unpretentious plant which is good 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.059
 winters with us in central Russia 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.250
 Here is one of such unpretentious plants 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:38.059
 I want to introduce it now 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.260
 liatris koloskova and here on the package 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.530
 she looks like that and she is very 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.190
 It looks beautiful in the garden when 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.630
 growing to get a whole bunch of these 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.800
 lilac candles 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:58.340
 still she is white in Russian 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.579
 different plants eat up to 80 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.460
 centimeters tall and dwarf which 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.119
 only 40 centimeters and such here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.920
 plants they are very interesting to inscribe in 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.430
 different compositions because 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.479
 agree they have a very unusual 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.810
 form grow this plant perfectly 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.770
 easy and now the stores have 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.729
 planting material 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.539
 and here are just us readers and viewers 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.090
 of our site just ask here 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.179
 what can I buy in the store from that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.700
 what is and will surely survive well here I am 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.700
 I want to just introduce this liatris 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.420
 koloskova and she sold here such 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.929
 nodules and look here already 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:53.630
 sprouts she has a good immediately 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:55.429
 several stalks here begin and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.950
 Here is each one . 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.529
 it will further develop in the department 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.329
 club nyuk and it will be possible later 

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:05.450
 divide here see how much is here 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.700
 tubers in this bag 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.920
 they really have a different quality 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.319
 come across one that's so good to see 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.410
 green but there is only by new 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.030
 chic who's that you see 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.819
 dried so browse 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.099
 please carefully and and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.319
 if you need to take some measures 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.989
 This is a necessary tuber 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 soak before planting but these tuber 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.560
 points are also possible in growth promoters 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.269
 such a conqueror ah you can dunk 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.319
 for how many minutes 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.590
 Dad got the description in the package, see 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.310
 Yes, that can not be planted here if 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.379
 Now we have to end with you 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.889
 April, then there is still unknown what 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.840
 the weather will be and it is possible that there will be 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:57.169
 Overseas here are such plants that are 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.269
 long lay in the store we can be 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.790
 they are weakened and of course and i would 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.799
 waited a little bit to be sure 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.590
 that we do not have severe frosts 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:09.290
 will keep here such tubers they 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.810
 fairly dense you can still while 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.419
 the fridge support them and sprouts here 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.269
 not very big if you buy from 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:20.239
 liatris too long shoots then i would 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.609
 advised to put in a pot and now in 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.310
 potty watch these tuber 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.419
 glasses how will they grow by watering 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
 them and then later 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.340
 the program you in the pot they grow up 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.650
 straight transshipment 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.019
 not transplant namely transshipment with 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.900
 lump of earth where the spine runs well here 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.470
 you will put in the ground where necessary 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.949
 plant 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.759
 This plant liatris very love 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:49.840
 the sun he can grow in shaded 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:52.840
 a place but then here these inflorescences 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.040
 beautiful lilac will be less and 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.209
 winter hardiness of this plant will be 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.400
 less if it grows up shadows and if here 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.280
 in the sun you put him but it 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400
 just the glow is especially here if 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.469
 against the setting sun you plant it 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.680
 It will look very nice 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:14.930
 now how deep 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.940
 so I would advise this here plants 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.280
 which is already here with such points 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.460
 look they started to blossom here 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.280
 leaflets and if you plant deep right away 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.710
 it will be hard for them to go out already 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.610
 the surface is this sheet about what 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.150
 already reveal so I advised so 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.460
 here first lune some dig 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.189
 five centimeters deep 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.310
 just such a little hole to deepen here 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.000
 about well, even centimeters from hitting not 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.060
 more 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.969
 loose earthman that was covered and everything and 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.729
 like that to leave, but when they rise 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:54.789
 sprouts here pour the land there 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.669
 so about here are all any tubers of them 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.310
 put on response to 33 heights the most 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.370
 bulbs then count here here it is 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.389
 bulb height and here's about somewhere on 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:11.050
 5 cm you need to bury this cable us 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:14.110
 how much each tuber yogi should 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.319
 to stand apart but to immediately 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.770
 you got a beautiful bouquet here I am 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:26.439
 Like this I will spread it all 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:31.419
 Now I would somehow distribute them in 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:36.190
 I still have this tuber here 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:40.000
 they are sold in peat 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:44.139
 or scream dragged the little ones not 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.550
 strawberries are still very small club 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:51.520
 and then somehow I would have distributed them 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.800
 somewhere around 5-7 centimeters so that 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.409
 each tuber night was 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.650
 place to develop and where 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.680
 further grow their babies if 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.240
 this big bush grows already there 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.919
 be up to 25-30 here these magnificent 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.490
 candles and it looks just 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:14.080
 great and the rest is care 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.960
 absolutely not complicated just need 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.509
 water honestly i'm even my liatris 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.830
 and do not fertilize say that some 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:26.439
 liatris and bad winters 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.389
 I now think that it is quite possible this 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:31.120
 here winter hardiness is also associated with 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.759
 feedings when you start plants 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.080
 feed here these tubers are very fast 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.969
 growing but 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.110
 structure they have such 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.150
 I am loose 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.730
 and here such club is not bad points earthly 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.010
 my liatris probably already exists a forest 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.640
 Seven years I have him for this time 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.600
 I have transplanted to another location shared 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.820
 neighbors 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.400
 that is, everything is fine so here 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.280
 such a plant does not require absolutely 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.720
 no complicated worries can be bought at 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.020
 the store and will delight you with great 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.020
 beautiful flowers
