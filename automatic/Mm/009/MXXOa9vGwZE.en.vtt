00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.639
 Hello everyone does as good a 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.860
 a few videos I told you I was 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.080
 preparing a thing for having arrived at 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.029
 the two thousand subscribers and one of 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.650
 you gave me the idea that because not 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.470
 it was like a kind of house of 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.810
 auctions that will auction some item and 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.509
 the one that pushed more because it was the one that 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.110
 I was wearing it well today we are going to do 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:38.760
 the first auction with him with the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.190
 raised money raised I'll keep it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.149
 like a boat 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.030
 to pay part of the contest prize 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.149
 I'm preparing that I still do not go 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.820
 to say nothing then for now we 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.640
 let's focus on today's auction the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.719
 puja starts with 10,000 berries and is a 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.299
 I batch the lot that consists one thing 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.570
 do you kill works of many you ask me 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.730
 although you can get it by writing 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 but 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.400
 but it's hard to get it and not all 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.590
 they have then apart this yes that is a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.900
 object costs more to get what 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.930

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.610

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.290
 I found there at last on my island 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 Japanese and taken and I thought well 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.480
 with what said the bid starts with 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.290
 10,000 go pushing on the 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:43.170
