00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.890 

ac1<00:00:06.480> here's<00:00:07.319> my<00:00:07.710> theory<00:00:08.099> on<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:09.120> unlock<00:00:09.599> kill

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
ac1 here's my theory on the unlock kill

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.160 
ac1 here's my theory on the unlock kill
streak<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.880> you<00:00:11.880> can<00:00:12.030> see<00:00:12.330> horizontally

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
streak as you can see horizontally

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.660 
streak as you can see horizontally
there's<00:00:13.380> three<00:00:13.799> kill<00:00:14.040> streaks<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
there's three kill streaks and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.750 
there's three kill streaks and
vertically<00:00:15.450> there's<00:00:16.109> 5<00:00:17.240> 3<00:00:18.240> by<00:00:18.420> 5<00:00:18.779> matrix

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
vertically there's 5 3 by 5 matrix

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.410 
vertically there's 5 3 by 5 matrix
meaning<00:00:20.900> i'm<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.230> guessing<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:23.180> it<00:00:24.180> makes

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
meaning i'm just guessing but it makes

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.620 
meaning i'm just guessing but it makes
logical<00:00:24.689> sense<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:27.380> 3<00:00:28.380> by<00:00:28.560> 5<00:00:29.630> matrix

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
logical sense to me a 3 by 5 matrix

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.880 
logical sense to me a 3 by 5 matrix
meaning<00:00:31.790> okay<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.590> first

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
meaning okay as you can see the first

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.020 
meaning okay as you can see the first
vertical<00:00:35.610> set<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.420> unlocks<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.309> first<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.850> on

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
vertical set of unlocks the first one on

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.709 
vertical set of unlocks the first one on
the<00:00:39.059> top<00:00:39.329> very<00:00:39.870> top<00:00:40.200> left<00:00:40.680> hand<00:00:40.800> corner<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.730> 3

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the top very top left hand corner is 3

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
the top very top left hand corner is 3

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.650 
killstreak second one below that is 5
kill<00:00:46.200> streaks<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> after<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
kill streaks and the one after that the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.840 
kill streaks and the one after that the
third<00:00:48.870> one<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.969> 7<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.750> fourth<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.850> nine

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
third one is 7 the fourth one is nine

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.290 
third one is 7 the fourth one is nine
and<00:00:54.440> two<00:00:55.440> c-130<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:57.020> 11<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.940> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.030> people<00:01:00.120> got

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and two c-130 is 11 a lot of people got

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
and two c-130 is 11 a lot of people got
this<00:01:00.420> confused<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.170> think<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.620> 15

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
this confused they think there's 15

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
this confused they think there's 15
different<00:01:02.789> types<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> killstreaks<00:01:04.189> what<00:01:05.189> I'm

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
different types of killstreaks what I'm

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.230 
different types of killstreaks what I'm
guessing<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.900> three<00:01:09.900> sets<00:01:10.650> of

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
guessing is that there is three sets of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
guessing is that there is three sets of
kill<00:01:12.240> streaks<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.420> unlocked<00:01:15.900> based

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
kill streaks that can be unlocked based

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.270 
kill streaks that can be unlocked based
on<00:01:18.110> what<00:01:19.110> level<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:20.450> so<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:23.040> three

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on what level that you are so the three

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.429 
on what level that you are so the three
by<00:01:23.430> five<00:01:23.670> matrix<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.570> give<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:26.479> 720<00:01:27.479> possible

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
by five matrix can give you 720 possible

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.090 
by five matrix can give you 720 possible
combinations<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.700> counter<00:01:30.060> somebody<00:01:30.509> else<00:01:31.100> so

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
combinations to counter somebody else so

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.569 
combinations to counter somebody else so
for<00:01:32.310> example<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.939> first<00:01:33.240> role<00:01:33.799> will<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.920> will

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
for example the first role will be will

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
for example the first role will be will
be<00:01:35.689> basically<00:01:36.890> UAV<00:01:38.450> second<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:39.750> 5

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
be basically UAV second one will be 5

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.539 
be basically UAV second one will be 5
kill<00:01:40.710> streak<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.869> airstrike<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
kill streak which is a airstrike the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.270 
kill streak which is a airstrike the
third<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.600> would<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.810> seven<00:01:46.439> which<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
third one would be seven which is

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.539 
third one would be seven which is
helicopter<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.869> nine<00:01:49.340> would<00:01:50.340> be

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
helicopter and then nine would be

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.539 
helicopter and then nine would be
something<00:01:51.270> like<00:01:51.710> um<00:01:54.619> nine<00:01:55.619> killstreak<00:01:56.130> Colin

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
something like um nine killstreak Colin

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.870 
something like um nine killstreak Colin
sniper<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.570> something<00:01:58.110> like<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.549> then<00:01:59.549> once

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
sniper or something like that then once

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.850 
sniper or something like that then once
you<00:02:00.000> move<00:02:00.149> up<00:02:00.270> again<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.350> unlock<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you move up again and you unlock the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.880 
you move up again and you unlock the
second<00:02:02.280> roll<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:03.479> highest<00:02:03.899> next<00:02:04.590> level

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
second roll on your highest next level

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.119 
second roll on your highest next level
prestige<00:02:05.210> then<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.810> example<00:02:07.259> somebody<00:02:07.829> might

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
prestige then for example somebody might

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.010 
prestige then for example somebody might
have<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> combination<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.539> first<00:02:09.780> one

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have the combination for the first one

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.960 
have the combination for the first one
for<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> three<00:02:11.069> kill<00:02:11.340> which<00:02:11.640> would<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.849> in<00:02:11.910> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
for the three kill which would be in the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940 
for the three kill which would be in the
second<00:02:12.330> row<00:02:12.450> first<00:02:13.290> men

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
second row first men

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.660 
second row first men
on<00:02:14.280> top<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.599> UAV<00:02:16.260> blocker<00:02:16.670> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
on top they would have UAV blocker so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.449 
on top they would have UAV blocker so
let's<00:02:18.030> say<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.239> your<00:02:18.989> first<00:02:19.319> combination<00:02:20.040> of

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
let's say that your first combination of

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.030 
let's say that your first combination of
killstreaks<00:02:20.940> had<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:22.019> set<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.769> then<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
killstreaks had that set and then the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.820 
killstreaks had that set and then the
next<00:02:23.069> person<00:02:23.519> set<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.209> have<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.750> set<00:02:25.709> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
next person set would have a set to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.550 
next person set would have a set to
counter<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.430> first<00:02:26.700> set<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> third

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
counter the first set and then the third

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.030 
counter the first set and then the third
set<00:02:29.069> would<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> counter<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.890> offset<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
set would have a counter to offset the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.750 
set would have a counter to offset the
second<00:02:32.430> set<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.250> highest<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> can

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
second set so the highest you can

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.080 
second set so the highest you can
probably<00:02:36.180> go<00:02:36.300> up<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> 11<00:02:37.620> kill<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.160> then

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
probably go up to is 11 kill and then

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
probably go up to is 11 kill and then
that's<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.569> encounter<00:02:39.840> streak<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.160> say

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
that's an encounter streak so let's say

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.600 
that's an encounter streak so let's say
for<00:02:41.459> example<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.660> first<00:02:42.900> one<00:02:43.110> UAV<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:44.310> the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
for example the first one UAV is the

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
for example the first one UAV is the
first<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:46.670> horizontal<00:02:47.780> pick<00:02:48.780> then<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> second

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
first a horizontal pick then the second

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.170 
first a horizontal pick then the second
horizontal<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> top<00:02:51.630> would<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.470> UAV

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
horizontal one to the top would be UAV

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.300 
horizontal one to the top would be UAV
blocker<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.900> then<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.110> third<00:02:55.170> one<00:02:55.349> you<00:02:56.160> know

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
blocker and then the third one you know

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.970 
blocker and then the third one you know
whatever<00:02:56.910> you<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.569> think<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:58.019> what<00:02:58.950> could

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
whatever you can think of what could

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.199 
whatever you can think of what could
counter<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.640> UAV<00:03:00.000> blocker<00:03:00.390> or<00:03:00.599> UAV<00:03:00.930> jammer<00:03:01.079> or

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
counter a UAV blocker or UAV jammer or

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.180 
counter a UAV blocker or UAV jammer or
UAV<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.660> mean<00:03:04.380> what<00:03:04.590> would<00:03:04.620> be<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.890> counter<00:03:05.160> for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
UAV I mean what would be the counter for

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.550 
UAV I mean what would be the counter for
those<00:03:05.430> two<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.720> then<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.019> second<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
those two so then the second so that

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.729 
those two so then the second so that
would<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.750> second<00:03:09.750> set<00:03:09.930> down<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.380> second

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
would be the second set down the second

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.069 
would be the second set down the second
three<00:03:10.980> would<00:03:11.130> be<00:03:11.160> those<00:03:11.880> three<00:03:12.150> those<00:03:12.720> three

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
three would be those three those three

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.949 
three would be those three those three
five<00:03:13.560> sets<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.819> have<00:03:15.000> airstrike<00:03:15.690> what

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
five sets so you have airstrike what

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.220 
five sets so you have airstrike what
counters<00:03:16.319> are<00:03:16.500> strike<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.299> then<00:03:18.299> what's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
counters are strike and then what's

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.930 
counters are strike and then what's
really<00:03:19.500> intriguing<00:03:19.620> is<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.190> number<00:03:20.700> nine

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
really intriguing is the number nine

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.150 
really intriguing is the number nine
like<00:03:21.720> what<00:03:22.049> would<00:03:22.200> be<00:03:22.380> number<00:03:22.650> nine<00:03:22.829> like<00:03:23.160> um

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
like what would be number nine like um

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.099 
like what would be number nine like um
UAV<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.819> know<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.569> called<00:03:27.690> in

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
UAV or you know you just called in

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.559 
UAV or you know you just called in
snipers<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.609> what<00:03:29.790> do<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:29.940> use<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.239> counter

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
snipers so what do you use the counter

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.680 
snipers so what do you use the counter
snipers<00:03:30.630> or<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.950> just<00:03:32.160> called<00:03:32.489> in<00:03:32.730> recon<00:03:33.239> or

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
snipers or you just called in recon or

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.800 
snipers or you just called in recon or
or<00:03:34.109> you<00:03:34.170> just<00:03:34.530> got<00:03:34.940> nine<00:03:35.940> kills<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.660> have

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
or you just got nine kills you can have

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.069 
or you just got nine kills you can have
a<00:03:37.850> Gatling<00:03:38.850> gun<00:03:38.880> or<00:03:39.329> machine<00:03:39.690> gun<00:03:39.900> dropped

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
a Gatling gun or machine gun dropped

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.559 
a Gatling gun or machine gun dropped
into<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.560> position<00:03:41.329> um<00:03:43.430> then<00:03:44.430> what<00:03:45.090> counters

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
into your position um then what counters

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.030 
into your position um then what counters
they<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.290> c-130<00:03:47.250> or<00:03:47.730> what<00:03:48.500> what<00:03:49.500> other<00:03:49.709> thing

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
they a c-130 or what what other thing

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.830 
they a c-130 or what what other thing
could<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.250> call<00:03:50.579> in<00:03:50.760> at<00:03:50.910> eleven<00:03:51.299> kill<00:03:51.510> streak

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
could you call in at eleven kill streak

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.190 
could you call in at eleven kill streak
so<00:03:52.410> basically<00:03:52.950> these<00:03:53.069> are<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:54.200> killstreaks

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
so basically these are like killstreaks

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.379 
so basically these are like killstreaks
to<00:03:55.380> counter<00:03:55.739> other<00:03:56.040> people's<00:03:56.670> kill<00:03:57.000> streaks

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
to counter other people's kill streaks

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.740 
to counter other people's kill streaks
in<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:58.470> game<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:59.069> mean<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.329> idea<00:04:00.690> that

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
in a game I mean this is the idea that

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.240 
in a game I mean this is the idea that
i'm<00:04:01.019> getting<00:04:01.410> i<00:04:01.560> could<00:04:01.829> be<00:04:01.980> wrong<00:04:02.010> but<00:04:02.549> um<00:04:04.250> you

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
i'm getting i could be wrong but um you

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.190 
i'm getting i could be wrong but um you
know<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.609> that's<00:04:05.819> basically<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.690> gist<00:04:07.019> of<00:04:07.079> the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
know so that's basically the gist of the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.860 
know so that's basically the gist of the
idea<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:08.099> that<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.639> case<00:04:08.670> you<00:04:09.150> get<00:04:09.239> 720

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
idea if that is the case you get 720

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.879 
idea if that is the case you get 720
combinations<00:04:10.799> there's<00:04:11.760> 33<00:04:12.750> per<00:04:13.169> each<00:04:13.380> slap

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
combinations there's 33 per each slap

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.190 
combinations there's 33 per each slap
that<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.639> change<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.209> counter<00:04:15.720> somebody

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that you can change to counter somebody

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.279 
that you can change to counter somebody
so<00:04:16.950> depending<00:04:17.639> on<00:04:17.880> your<00:04:18.359> level<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.229> you

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
so depending on your level that you

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.520 
so depending on your level that you
achieve<00:04:19.829> that's<00:04:20.700> how<00:04:21.450> many<00:04:21.690> per<00:04:22.019> slot<00:04:22.289> that

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
achieve that's how many per slot that

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.810 
achieve that's how many per slot that
you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.800> open<00:04:23.099> so<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.460> got<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
you can open so if you got to the

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.570 
you can open so if you got to the
highest<00:04:24.090> level<00:04:24.390> then<00:04:25.110> you'd<00:04:25.320> have<00:04:25.349> easy<00:04:26.340> has

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
highest level then you'd have easy has

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.500 
highest level then you'd have easy has
the<00:04:26.880> possibility

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
the possibility

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.670 
the possibility
three<00:04:28.080> for<00:04:28.380> each<00:04:28.560> slat<00:04:29.010> combination<00:04:30.500> for<00:04:31.500> that

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
three for each slat combination for that

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.340 
three for each slat combination for that
set<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:33.060> that's<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.300> my<00:04:33.510> thoughts<00:04:33.840> totally

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
set so that's just my thoughts totally

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.460 
set so that's just my thoughts totally
seeing<00:04:34.650> name<00:04:34.830> wrong<00:04:35.160> I<00:04:35.370> don't<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:36.470> 30

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
seeing name wrong I don't know 30

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:44.820 
seeing name wrong I don't know 30
standing<00:04:37.950> by

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.890 

you
