you can take a drive offline using the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.140 
you can take a drive offline using the
software<00:00:22.310> currently<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:24.029> our

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
software currently we have all our

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.990 
software currently we have all our
drives<00:00:24.420> online<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.160> use<00:00:26.640> double

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
drives online and we can use double

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.669 
drives online and we can use double

execute<00:00:32.160> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.220 

and<00:00:41.579> now<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> software<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
and now the software is going to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.380 
and now the software is going to
indicate<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> failed<00:00:44.670> drive<00:00:44.969> the

indicate that we have a failed drive the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.299 
indicate that we have a failed drive the
hardware<00:00:45.780> will<00:00:46.050> show<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.500> blinking<00:00:47.040> amber

just for demonstration purposes I'll put

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.050 
just for demonstration purposes I'll put
the<00:01:25.509> drive<00:01:25.719> back<00:01:25.929> in<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.409> we'll<00:01:27.399> see<00:01:27.429> in<00:01:27.880> our

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
the drive back in and we'll see in our

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.880 
the drive back in and we'll see in our
software<00:01:30.179> that<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.329> drive<00:01:31.569> has<00:01:31.810> been<00:01:31.890> put

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
software that the drive has been put

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.559 
software that the drive has been put
back<00:01:33.039> into<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.310> drove<00:01:33.579> into<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.270> server<00:01:36.569> the

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
back into the drove into the server the

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.609 
back into the drove into the server the
lights<00:01:37.929> on<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.380> server<00:01:38.770> will<00:01:39.100> indicate<00:01:39.819> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
lights on the server will indicate that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.169 
lights on the server will indicate that
the<00:01:41.619> drive<00:01:41.829> is<00:01:42.069> coming<00:01:42.310> back<00:01:42.429> online<00:01:42.670> this

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
the drive is coming back online this

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.749 
the drive is coming back online this
process<00:01:43.689> it<00:01:44.319> takes<00:01:44.469> approximately<00:01:44.950> 30

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
process it takes approximately 30

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.819 
process it takes approximately 30
seconds<00:01:46.240> or<00:01:46.329> so<00:01:46.359> for<00:01:46.929> the<00:01:47.469> server<00:01:47.709> to

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
seconds or so for the server to

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.910 
seconds or so for the server to
recognize<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.670> drive<00:01:50.849> at<00:01:51.849> which<00:01:52.030> time<00:01:52.299> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
recognize the drive at which time the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.050 
recognize the drive at which time the
bottom<00:01:53.920> light<00:01:54.069> will<00:01:54.189> start<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.520> blink<00:01:54.700> as<00:01:54.909> an

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
bottom light will start to blink as an

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.270 
bottom light will start to blink as an
activity<00:01:55.329> indicator<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.349> then<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.099> top

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
activity indicator and then the top

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.669 
activity indicator and then the top
light<00:01:57.489> will<00:01:57.670> come<00:01:57.789> on<00:01:57.849> green<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.989> show<00:01:59.020> that

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
light will come on green to show that

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.319 
light will come on green to show that
the<00:02:00.039> server<00:02:00.250> has<00:02:00.340> recognized<00:02:00.849> the<00:02:01.000> new<00:02:01.149> drive

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
the server has recognized the new drive

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.089 
the server has recognized the new drive
then<00:02:04.329> using<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.989> open<00:02:05.349> meadow<00:02:05.469> software<00:02:05.979> you

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
then using the open meadow software you

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.089 
then using the open meadow software you
can<00:02:06.219> come<00:02:06.429> back<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:08.170> will<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.679> the

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
can come back and you will see that the

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.030 
can come back and you will see that the
drivers<00:02:09.429> been<00:02:09.519> recognized<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.650> it<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.769> in<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
drivers been recognized and it is in a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
drivers been recognized and it is in a
rebuilding<00:02:12.549> state<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:14.370> then<00:02:15.370> your<00:02:15.549> virtual

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
rebuilding state and then your virtual

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.360 
rebuilding state and then your virtual
disk<00:02:16.329> will<00:02:17.170> show<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.799> is<00:02:17.950> still<00:02:18.160> in<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
disk will show that it is still in a

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.009 
disk will show that it is still in a
degraded<00:02:18.760> state<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.359> will<00:02:19.450> stay<00:02:19.660> that<00:02:19.840> way

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
degraded state and it will stay that way

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.640 
degraded state and it will stay that way
until<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:21.090> rebuild<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.239> complete

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.820 

and<00:02:28.159> that's<00:02:28.400> pretty<00:02:28.580> much<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.530> see

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
and that's pretty much it you can see

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.820 
and that's pretty much it you can see
how<00:02:30.980> easy<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.940> replace<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.810> SAS<00:02:33.590> hard

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
how easy it is to replace a SAS hard
