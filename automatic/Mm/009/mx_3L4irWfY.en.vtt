00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.630 

looks<00:02:11.920> like<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.190> should<00:02:12.220> attach<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.630> perhaps

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
looks like it should attach here perhaps

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.190 
looks like it should attach here perhaps
he's<00:02:15.640> got<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> comb<00:02:16.090> or<00:02:16.300> feet<00:02:16.630> here<00:02:17.010> interesting

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
he's got a comb or feet here interesting

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.559 
he's got a comb or feet here interesting
so<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.260> think<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.680> pulls<00:02:21.010> apart<00:02:21.220> not<00:02:22.090> sure<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
so I think it pulls apart not sure the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.250 
so I think it pulls apart not sure the
best<00:02:22.870> way<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.620> though<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.959> so

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
best way to do it though like so

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.630 
best way to do it though like so
push<00:02:26.590> down<00:02:26.770> those<00:02:27.010> two<00:02:27.220> things<00:02:29.190> not<00:02:30.190> sure

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
push down those two things not sure

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.290 
push down those two things not sure
exactly<00:02:31.000> here<00:02:31.420> um<00:02:33.690> let's<00:02:34.690> see<00:02:36.000> okay<00:02:37.000> end<00:02:37.150> up

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
exactly here um let's see okay end up

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
think I like his ability shown on one of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.240 
think I like his ability shown on one of
these<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:23.980> yeah<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.170> one<00:03:26.680> hundred<00:03:26.950> forty

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
these so yeah so one hundred forty

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.680 
these so yeah so one hundred forty
hundred<00:03:27.519> twenty<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.090> heard<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.450> front

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
hundred twenty and I heard on the front

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.810 
hundred twenty and I heard on the front
so<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.620> piece<00:03:29.829> doesn't<00:03:30.040> move<00:03:30.310> out<00:03:30.459> just<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
so that piece doesn't move out just the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.910 
so that piece doesn't move out just the
button<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:31.810> that's<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.140> like<00:03:32.530> button<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:32.860> use

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
button so that's the like button you use

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.710 
button so that's the like button you use
to<00:03:33.220> actually<00:03:33.340> separate<00:03:33.850> them<00:03:34.000> didn't<00:03:34.630> work

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
to actually separate them didn't work

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.550 
to actually separate them didn't work
the<00:03:34.840> best<00:03:34.989> for<00:03:35.230> me<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:35.739> oh<00:03:35.980> well<00:03:37.290> top<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:38.320> back

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
the best for me but oh well top it back

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.270 
the best for me but oh well top it back
up<00:03:38.799> there<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.459> came<00:03:39.760> back<00:03:39.970> up<00:03:40.209> um<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.859> guess

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
up there that came back up um I guess

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.039 
up there that came back up um I guess
that's<00:03:42.430> just<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.760> help<00:03:42.790> click<00:03:43.540> fit<00:03:43.720> things<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
that's just to help click fit things and

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.330 
that's just to help click fit things and
I<00:03:44.109> was<00:03:44.230> trying<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> use<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.799> open<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.220> up

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
I was trying to use that to open it up

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.370 
I was trying to use that to open it up
so<00:03:45.670> anyways<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:47.260> is<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.829> mutant<00:03:48.310> Helios

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
so anyways that is the mutant Helios

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:56.550 
so anyways that is the mutant Helios
snapback<00:03:50.380> in<00:03:50.620> there<00:03:50.920> maybe<00:03:52.890> um<00:03:55.290> I'll<00:03:56.290> learn

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
snapback in there maybe um I'll learn

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.180 
snapback in there maybe um I'll learn
these<00:03:56.829> one<00:03:57.100> day<00:03:57.600> there<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:58.720> go

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
these one day there we go

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.039 
these one day there we go
so<00:04:00.190> then<00:04:00.340> this<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.269> kind<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.630> weird<00:04:01.720> they<00:04:01.870> has

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
so then this is kind of weird they has

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.810 
so then this is kind of weird they has
like<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.560> bay<00:04:02.739> well<00:04:03.040> I<00:04:03.100> guess<00:04:03.250> those<00:04:03.579> are<00:04:03.609> the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
like the bay well I guess those are the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.670 
like the bay well I guess those are the
legs<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.120> these<00:04:04.239> are<00:04:04.390> more<00:04:04.540> so<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.840> arms<00:04:05.290> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
legs and these are more so the arms and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.699 
legs and these are more so the arms and
not<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.489> legs<00:04:06.840> but<00:04:07.840> let's<00:04:08.320> see<00:04:08.410> if<00:04:08.470> we<00:04:08.530> can<00:04:08.620> get

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
not the legs but let's see if we can get

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.360 
not the legs but let's see if we can get
this<00:04:08.799> guy<00:04:09.040> closed<00:04:09.400> up<00:04:09.609> okay<00:04:11.070> fold<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.160> tail

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
this guy closed up okay fold the tail

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.060 
this guy closed up okay fold the tail
back<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.090> close<00:04:13.989> that<00:04:14.019> back<00:04:14.739> up<00:04:16.829> fold<00:04:17.829> the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
back and close that back up fold the

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.270 
back and close that back up fold the
feet<00:04:18.400> or<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.269> arms<00:04:19.720> or<00:04:19.900> whatever<00:04:20.019> up

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
feet or the arms or whatever up

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.000 
feet or the arms or whatever up
horn<00:04:21.400> head<00:04:21.850> here<00:04:22.840> we<00:04:22.930> go<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.590> he<00:04:23.680> closes<00:04:23.950> up

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
horn head here we go so he closes up
