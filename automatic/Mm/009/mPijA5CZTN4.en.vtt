00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
converter this is using six beads I've

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.440 
converter this is using six beads I've
used<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.679> 10<00:01:47.950> mil<00:01:48.190> eight<00:01:48.399> mil<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.789> six<00:01:49.000> mil<00:01:49.240> bead

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
used a 10 mil eight mil and six mil bead

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.010 
used a 10 mil eight mil and six mil bead
on<00:01:49.630> one<00:01:49.810> end<00:01:50.100> passed<00:01:51.100> on<00:01:51.280> my<00:01:51.460> dangle<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.179> then

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
on one end passed on my dangle and then

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.809 
on one end passed on my dangle and then
repeated<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.770> pattern<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.280> beads<00:01:54.490> on<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
repeated the pattern of the beads on the

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.639 
repeated the pattern of the beads on the
other<00:01:54.940> side<00:01:55.270> both<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.810> which<00:01:56.110> have<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.410> loop

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
other side both of which have a loop

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.550 
other side both of which have a loop
either<00:01:57.039> end<00:01:57.369> in<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.640> wire<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:59.170> to<00:01:59.229> make<00:01:59.530> a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
either end in the wire now to make a

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.120 
either end in the wire now to make a
beaded<00:01:59.800> chain<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.479> make<00:02:02.259> your<00:02:02.500> loop<00:02:02.649> head<00:02:02.890> pin

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
beaded chain so make your loop head pin

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.300 
beaded chain so make your loop head pin
pass<00:02:03.940> your<00:02:04.149> bead<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:04.679> grip<00:02:05.679> above<00:02:06.009> with<00:02:06.160> your

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
pass your bead on grip above with your

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.279 
pass your bead on grip above with your
round<00:02:06.520> nose<00:02:06.610> pliers

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
round nose pliers

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.160 
round nose pliers
and<00:02:08.439> Bend<00:02:08.830> all<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.519> way<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:10.000> now<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:11.019> is

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and Bend all the way around now this is

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.440 
and Bend all the way around now this is
gonna<00:02:11.290> be<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.500> bit<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.769> fancy<00:02:11.980> chair<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:13.180> so

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
gonna be a bit of a fancy chair and so

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.059 
gonna be a bit of a fancy chair and so
does<00:02:13.659> the<00:02:13.780> normal<00:02:14.110> live<00:02:14.230> which<00:02:14.409> I'll<00:02:14.590> cut<00:02:14.829> off

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
does the normal live which I'll cut off

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.160 
does the normal live which I'll cut off
we're<00:02:15.939> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.269> grip<00:02:16.629> it<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.900> we're<00:02:17.049> going

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
we're going to grip it and we're going

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.110 
we're going to grip it and we're going
to<00:02:17.260> bend<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.799> wire<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.159> a<00:02:18.250> spiral<00:02:18.610> around<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
to bend the wire in a spiral around the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.240 
to bend the wire in a spiral around the
bead

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
bead

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.870 
bead
that<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:22.360> makes<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.690> look<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.960> bit<00:02:22.990> fancier

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
that just makes it look a bit fancier

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.120 
that just makes it look a bit fancier
okay<00:02:24.880> now<00:02:25.030> trim<00:02:25.330> off<00:02:25.480> your<00:02:25.690> wire<00:02:25.870> fairly<00:02:26.860> close

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
okay now trim off your wire fairly close

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.060 
okay now trim off your wire fairly close
to<00:02:27.340> your<00:02:27.460> other<00:02:27.550> end<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.650> see<00:02:29.710> how

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
to your other end and you can see how

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.830 
to your other end and you can see how
sharp<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.790> because<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.180> want<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
sharp that is because I just want it to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.690 
sharp that is because I just want it to
wrap<00:02:32.020> around<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.590> touch<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:33.040> pliers<00:02:33.310> over

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
wrap around and touch the pliers over

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
open your looped end and fasten it on to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.660 
open your looped end and fasten it on to
the<00:02:41.500> next<00:02:41.709> speed<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.160> you've<00:02:42.280> made<00:02:42.520> in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
the next speed that you've made in

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.480 
the next speed that you've made in
exactly<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.510> same<00:02:43.780> way<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:45.130> makes<00:02:45.370> a

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
exactly the same way and it makes a

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.060 
exactly the same way and it makes a
chain<00:02:45.760> which<00:02:46.570> adds<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.959> your<00:02:47.110> converter<00:02:47.560> which

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
chain which adds to your converter which

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.220 
chain which adds to your converter which
adds<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.550> your<00:02:48.760> dangle<00:02:49.770> there<00:02:50.770> we<00:02:50.950> go<00:02:51.100> I<00:02:52.230> hope

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
adds to your dangle there we go I hope
