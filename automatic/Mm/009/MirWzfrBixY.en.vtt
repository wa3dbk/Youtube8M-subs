00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.240
 good afternoon everyone tell you a little bit 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 briefly about the alteration of the backlight on the panel 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 lada granta as in most 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.019
 modern on vintage dashboard all just 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
 that is, here is studio dikie smd 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.539
 pairs but mounting then here they are there 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.920
 and so on all remake is very 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.119
 just how she understands will not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 explain because there she is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.150
 Understands much easier than previous 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.920
 the panels that described there are changing everything 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.449
 you just need a minimum of tools 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.820
 a minimum of parts that is, I am now garages 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.969
 I sat quietly in the evening itself to booze 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.489
 without much I donâ€™t cook for myself 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.670
 workplace like with other brushes yes 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.559
 then it is still easier in that sense 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.969
 smd diodes you on them in pair of course such 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.129
 there will be no bright backlighting but I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.899
 advised all pieces of 30 american 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 still glue but this is a mastery 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.699
 because the principle is good brightness 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.520
 it turns out you can and under reduce by 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.410
 lover in one word here they are sleeping at 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.579
 disassembly be careful now i focus 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 in sight so this connector here and here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.729
 his mate now I will show here 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.350
 his mate is here and so that they are not 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.240
 bend do not break then it will be uncomfortable 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 collect this display there we are 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 We will not shoot and the obverse of the screen, too 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.229
 We will not do as it is not stated 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.450
 desire to do here is not so easy 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 screen large the native uncomfortable 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.610
 Here you do not need to remove the light filter there 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.500
 No, because the diode is originally here 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.570
 here these here they stand green there always 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.520
 no filter with no arrows Aha 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.329
 before that is , it will be necessary to erase 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.460
 red from the morning orange varnish spraying 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.210
 make little white in this case will 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 blue scales 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 white scales blue arrows and blue 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.399
 Kranchik here that is how would but in this 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 the moment is my opinion the most successful 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.210
 color combination is obtained as it is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 ford focus 3 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
 approximately donor LEDs 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.700
 i don't like them 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.759
 tape all the usual diode 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.229
 LEDs are used with them 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.479
 not for by their them here this strunal 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.009
 too, this is not yet perepoy on 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.930
 the arrows are so small 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.489
 LEDs so therefore as if here from 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.099
 they have a poorly visible polarity i 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.630
 pre- cooked yourself . and called 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.750
 there neatly on dialing touch 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.540
 here and here I lit the stadium to myself 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 memory and where is minus and where is plus 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.480
 these diodes are just like that now 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.269
 Again, the focus on the sight here with us 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.959
 bevel here comes java tick mark 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.430
 specifically this is our minus this plus all 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.769
 that is, we still do what it is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.739
 standard solder old solder 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.540
 new well here we solder neatly not much 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.310
 overheat because they are very 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 afraid of overheating is not yet 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.269
 booze on this same country booze well 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 besides these these mean when to be and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.989
 vypayat neatly you ate a handful of them 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.430
 how much do you need to take a heavy on pro 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.959
 calls every ring to him 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.850
 glowed he must dimly dimly 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.260
 shine if it is lit means everything 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.970
 ok we didn't overheat when 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.310
 solder also then in the workplace already 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.349
 . call him about the call to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.660
 slightly highlighted there are and 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.989
 overheating they often die therefore still 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.540
 time I say do not get carried away boil it 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.910
 what else to tell why the shield means 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.620
 on the table you don't check it out like 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.250
 the backlight turns on here 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.319
 can tires 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.329
 so as much as possible so that all 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.010
 correctly five times check not 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.989
 overheating diode and all gathered 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.389
 then twisted then you can already 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.459
 on the working machine to check it yet 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.290
 nuance before shooting arrows 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.790
 take a photo like i used to say like 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.069
 they take a look down to their bottom 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.440
 position and take a picture of yourself 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.650
 memory so that the arrows put on 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.480
 in the correct order, that is, that they are not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.420
 shifted down 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.870
 up there or up thank you all good luck 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.870
 who write incomprehensible answer without any problems
