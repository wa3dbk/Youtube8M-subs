devices how about a 90 degree field of
view<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.989> rift<00:01:01.140> has<00:01:01.350> various<00:01:01.770> features

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
view and the rift has various features

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
view and the rift has various features
in<00:01:02.309> planning<00:01:02.789> stages<00:01:03.059> such<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:03.719> 1080p<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
in planning stages such as 1080p in the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
in planning stages such as 1080p in the
future<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.799> not<00:01:04.860> yet<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.309> narrow<00:01:05.519> almost

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
future but not yet you narrow almost

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.310 
future but not yet you narrow almost
certainly<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.450> obviously<00:01:06.810> they've<00:01:06.990> designed

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
certainly so obviously they've designed

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
certainly so obviously they've designed
it<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> graphics<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.400> ps4<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:09.090> mind

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it with the graphics of the ps4 in mind

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.730 
it with the graphics of the ps4 in mind
so<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:09.960> experience<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:10.680> they

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
so the people can experience it but they

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.440 
so the people can experience it but they
all<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> offset<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
all be offset that's right not it is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
all be offset that's right not it is
currently<00:01:12.840> wired<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.710> once<00:01:13.979> got<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> big

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
currently wired not once got a big

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
currently wired not once got a big
15-foot<00:01:15.000> bit<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> ah<00:01:15.780> yes<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> trip<00:01:16.590> over

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
15-foot bit about it ah yes to trip over

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.440 
15-foot bit about it ah yes to trip over
and<00:01:16.920> fall<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.280> things<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> left<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.270> got

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and fall on things when you left you got

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
and fall on things when you left you got
it<00:01:18.540> honestly<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.080> like<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> good<00:01:19.650> old<00:01:19.770> days

yes and also a purchasing unit which

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.800 
yes and also a purchasing unit which
works<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.340> conjunction<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> ps4<00:01:24.180> that's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
works in conjunction with the ps4 that's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.600 
works in conjunction with the ps4 that's
right<00:01:25.110> you'll<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.710> uses<00:01:26.189> its<00:01:26.369> own

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
right you'll see it uses its own

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
right you'll see it uses its own
processing<00:01:27.270> part<00:01:27.420> as<00:01:27.689> well<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
processing part as well as the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.109
