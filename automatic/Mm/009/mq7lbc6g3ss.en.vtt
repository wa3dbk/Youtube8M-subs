so there's no line so how I do that is I
carefully<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.880> take<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.390> take<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.350> brush

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
carefully just take it take the brush

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
carefully just take it take the brush
and<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.399> swipe<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.509> side<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:09.929> see

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and then just swipe the side but you see

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.290 
and then just swipe the side but you see
there's<00:02:10.349> only<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> little<00:02:10.770> bit<00:02:10.979> left<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
there's only a little bit left on the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.980 
there's only a little bit left on the
foam

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
foam

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.800 
foam
so<00:02:13.770> I'm<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.370> using<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.790> little<00:02:15.240> bit<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.690> go

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
so I'm just using that little bit to go

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.600 
so I'm just using that little bit to go
down<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.260> side<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.770> just<00:02:16.920> light<00:02:17.340> but

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
down the side so it's just light but

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.040 
down the side so it's just light but
it's<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> make<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.600> there's<00:02:18.780> no

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
it's going to make it so that there's no

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.570 
it's going to make it so that there's no
line<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:20.700> sides<00:02:22.010> make<00:02:23.010> sure<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.250> hold<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
line on the sides make sure to hold the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.790 
line on the sides make sure to hold the
hand<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.090> enough<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.020> see<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.470> going

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
hand up enough for you to see that going

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.190 
hand up enough for you to see that going
down<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.220> sides<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.690> very

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
down the sides it really is just a very

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.320 
down the sides it really is just a very
little<00:02:31.980> bit<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.520> left<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.940> there<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.180> then

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
little bit that's left on there and then

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.750 
little bit that's left on there and then
of<00:02:33.810> course<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.350> feather<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.460> there's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
of course just feather that so there's

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.980 
of course just feather that so there's
no<00:02:36.090> line<00:02:36.410> when<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.560> color<00:02:37.770> shows<00:02:38.100> up<00:02:38.990> all

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
no line when that color shows up all

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.820 
no line when that color shows up all
right<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:41.100> hand<00:02:41.400> done<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:41.940> now

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
right so that's this hand done right now

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.250 
right so that's this hand done right now
do<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.950> other<00:02:44.010> hand<00:02:44.340> show<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.760> again<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.990> put

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
the sides carefully move over here so

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.790 
the sides carefully move over here so
you<00:03:17.250> can<00:03:17.600> get<00:03:18.600> that<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.990> better<00:03:19.260> view<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.680> this

pushing it down this side so there's no
white<00:03:39.900> line<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:41.510> I'd<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.870> add<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.410> that

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.970 
your body make sure that when you do
your<00:04:20.489> elbows<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.540> take<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> towel<00:04:22.230> after

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
your elbows you take a towel after

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.430 
your elbows you take a towel after
you're<00:04:23.130> done<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.669> just<00:04:24.060> dab<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.080> on

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you're done and then just dab it on

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.960 
you're done and then just dab it on
there<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.010> take<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.340> towel<00:04:26.550> and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
there you just take the towel and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.840 
there you just take the towel and
push<00:04:27.300> gently<00:04:27.900> so<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.680> doesn't<00:04:28.950> over<00:04:29.400> develop

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
push gently so that doesn't over develop

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.000 
push gently so that doesn't over develop
because<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.780> tends<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.380> those<00:04:31.650> creases

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
because it tends to go in those creases

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.990 
because it tends to go in those creases
all<00:04:32.760> right<00:04:33.500> final<00:04:34.500> step<00:04:34.830> now<00:04:35.580> I'm<00:04:35.880> going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.690> I

sure to get any of the cover lotion off

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.560 
sure to get any of the cover lotion off
of<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.620> knuckles<00:04:50.130> because<00:04:50.370> when<00:04:51.090> we<00:04:51.210> put<00:04:51.420> that

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
of the knuckles because when we put that

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.470 
of the knuckles because when we put that
on<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.990> can<00:04:52.170> get<00:04:52.350> inside<00:04:52.830> those<00:04:53.250> little<00:04:54.120> cracks

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
on it can get inside those little cracks

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.540 
on it can get inside those little cracks
in<00:04:54.750> there<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.260> we<00:04:55.980> don't<00:04:56.130> want<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.310> to

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
in there and we don't want that to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.730 
in there and we don't want that to
discolor<00:04:57.000> so<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.780> best<00:04:57.990> thing<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.230> do<00:04:58.470> is

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
discolor so the best thing to do is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.220 
discolor so the best thing to do is
