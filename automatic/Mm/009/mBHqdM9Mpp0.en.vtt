00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 In the following we show you how 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.460
 interactive whiteboards in lectures 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.830
 seminars can be used 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.230
 interactive whiteboard unites the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.220
 Aspects of beamer and notebook with 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.220
 those of a blackboard 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.600
 There are a number of unimagined ones 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.070
 possibilities more teaching first 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.790
 seminar setting but very briefly the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.949
 Expiration of the seminar with this today 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 hour we will access the concrete 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.320
 possible access to the shortening bioly 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.559
 After that we go to videos 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.070
 the interactive whiteboard lasts 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.760
 faster and, above all, more comfortable 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.050
 operate as notebook and beamer alone 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.540
 What's more, that's all 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.340
 is storable so I have results 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.170
 which have been worked out already in the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 next session may be available 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.930
 tie it directly by me 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.360
 and also the students directly on board 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 I am authentic and I work 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.510
 my seminars can be spontaneously addressed to the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.510
 to adapt students' needs 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.619
 I still like that all of me 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.479
 I have digital media available 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.390
 Can videos can pictures that 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.729
 embed internet and so without big 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.229
 effort very vivid and very 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 create appealing seminars 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.660
 I have dirk bushels 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.170
 Working with the smartboard does a lot 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.390
 fun 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.840
 you can just add the content you want 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.119
 worked together in the course for everyone 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.869
 save and next time on it 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.390
 Come back 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.160
 it is just a big help in the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.850
 Language lessons many possibilities 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.850
 provides 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.240
 expand light previous work with 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.290
 models as well as the intellectual change 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.500
 between fabric of particles level and 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.940
 this thinking models, the designation then 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.020
 also friendly as scientific 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.020
 accepted models 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.730
 good question 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.430
 if you look at the models 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.610
 Inserted change there is that divided 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.960
 model that describes this atom 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.790
 spherical structure 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.370
 he comes View purely so 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.370
 There are suitable models 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.520
 during the lecture prepared with it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.569
 But depending on the situation, I'll foil it 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.400
 change can complement 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.980
 This will make my event less 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.200
 Static and I can follow this 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.130
 save files and the student 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.130
 provide 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 For over eight years we are now in 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.230
 our department interactive 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.280
 whiteboards 1 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.890
 We also have it with the new lecturer 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.819
 very good experiences made 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.159
 in my opinion, you can 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.690
 technologies of this kind in the teaching 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.690
 Do not give up today
