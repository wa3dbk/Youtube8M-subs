I<00:00:22.369> just<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> swirl<00:00:24.150> your<00:00:24.420> asparagus

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
I just need to swirl your asparagus

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.400 
I just need to swirl your asparagus
around<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.410> clean<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.430> cold<00:00:26.939> water

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
around to clean it in some cold water

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.690 
around to clean it in some cold water
doesn't<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.710> much<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:30.529> tip<00:00:31.529> here<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.399> gonna

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
doesn't take much the tip here is gonna

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
doesn't take much the tip here is gonna
be<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> part<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.719> hardest<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> clean

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
be the part that's hardest to clean

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.049 
be the part that's hardest to clean

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
because it gets the grit but usually

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.319 
because it gets the grit but usually
just<00:00:36.500> swirling<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.649> around<00:00:37.910> cleans<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.059> well

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
just swirling it around cleans it well

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.950 
just swirling it around cleans it well
enough<00:00:40.579> damn<00:00:41.579> snapping<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> quite<00:00:42.930> easy

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
enough damn snapping it is quite easy

enough damn snapping it is quite easy
the<00:00:43.730> asparagus<00:00:44.730> seems<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.329> exactly<00:00:45.420> what

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the asparagus seems to know exactly what

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.779 
the asparagus seems to know exactly what
to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> needs<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.760> help

part now I do know a lot of people save
the<00:01:05.519> woody<00:01:05.729> ends<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.840> peel<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the woody ends you can peel them if you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.490 
the woody ends you can peel them if you
like<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:10.040> they<00:01:11.040> put<00:01:11.280> them<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.430> soups<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
like and they put them in soups and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.770 
like and they put them in soups and
stocks<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.860> things<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.330> little

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
stocks and things like that I'm a little

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.740 
stocks and things like that I'm a little
too<00:01:16.020> lazy<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> could<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.790> tend

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
too lazy to do that but you could I tend

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990 
too lazy to do that but you could I tend
to<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:18.990> toss<00:01:19.170> mine<00:01:19.409> away<00:01:19.729> let<00:01:20.729> me<00:01:20.790> show<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to just toss mine away let me show you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.109 
to just toss mine away let me show you
again<00:01:22.490> grab<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> tell<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
again grab it and you can tell some of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
again grab it and you can tell some of
them<00:01:30.530> some<00:01:31.530> start<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> look<00:01:32.009> Whittier<00:01:32.400> than

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
them some start to look Whittier than

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
them some start to look Whittier than
others<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> difference

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
others like you see the difference

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.520 
others like you see the difference
between<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:34.890> two<00:01:35.450> my<00:01:36.450> guess<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
between these two my guess is that this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.469 
between these two my guess is that this
one<00:01:37.829> will<00:01:38.340> snap<00:01:38.930> further<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:41.270> because<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
one will snap further up because this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.810 
one will snap further up because this
would<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.170> woody<00:01:43.439> or<00:01:43.619> than<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.220> nice<00:01:44.430> green

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
would be woody or than this nice green

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.569 
would be woody or than this nice green
stock<00:01:45.530> so<00:01:46.530> let's<00:01:46.710> see<00:01:48.649> experiment<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:52.579> that's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
stock so let's see experiment so that's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.130 
stock so let's see experiment so that's
where<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.909> snapped<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.869> where<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
where that snapped and that's where that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.639 
where that snapped and that's where that
snapped

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
snapped

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.130 
snapped
so<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.189> didn't<00:01:59.520> you<00:02:00.180> didn't<00:02:00.390> lose<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.930> of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
so it didn't you didn't lose as much of

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.280 
so it didn't you didn't lose as much of
it<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> nice<00:02:02.130> tender<00:02:02.930> stock<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.170> we

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it from the nice tender stock that we

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.280 
it from the nice tender stock that we
had<00:02:04.500> here<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.719> nothing<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:06.960> do

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
had here so nothing you can really do

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.560 
had here so nothing you can really do
about<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.849> that's<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.539> it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570
