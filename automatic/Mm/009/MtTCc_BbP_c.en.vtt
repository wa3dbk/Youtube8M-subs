00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 happily welcome know before i 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.099
 Loved to play Minecraft and already somewhere 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.490
 a year ago I saw some TV shows 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.769
 made in this game and suddenly today I 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 remembered them among the heaps of shit 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.140
 there were interesting projects 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.970
 but they were very few and so I decided 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
 do reviews on these tv series 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.380
 i won't just show shit i 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 I will recommend the most interesting 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.360
 of these TV shows and shit shows oh 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:38.489
 someone I'm a nightmare I'm horror flying to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.530
 the wings of the night and you will never survive in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 this city 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 you clearly understand clearly and now I 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.649
 need to leave 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:01:14.280
 I hope the series and servants will not delay 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:17.520
 detained the only one who does not know how 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.220

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:52.110

 girls 2 fails here 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.850
 monolith territory said something to me 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.320
 it seems that this was the first and the last 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.140
 emotions in this series 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.030
 Yes, in general, it does not matter what you 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.500
 blood will flow from my ears soon 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.560
 would have eyeballs and then shove in 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.790
 yourself in the ass and so do not only me 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.950
 one and no less important is that I'm an asshole 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.959
 and with that I understood nothing and now we 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.650
 see gorgeous and exciting 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.440
 battles 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.480
 We just worried about the main character and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.220
 the most important thing in the series is the dialogue 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.030
 which no one can boast 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:47.600
 good movie of our time 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:47.600
 what valente heard 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:02.410
 site to leave while I'm not a parable my 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:09.390

 damn mutants too many mutants and then 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:41.360
 what was that cumshot know what the trouble 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.410
 of this madness is that the whole is incomprehensible 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.840
 the essence of what is happening 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.540
 I personally saw all this time only 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.060
 running around it is not clear whom and speaking not 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.730
 it is clear that children have some plot 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.390
 ok let's go together carefully 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.360
 let's listen 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.780
 one interesting and incomprehensible dialogue for me 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.780
 and you were a genius there will be views on my footprint 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.360
 the last here from where 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.120
 I want to die, I still do not understand 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.830
 but I do not even want to understand and then there 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:38.080
 one wonderful expression 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:42.820
 and I will start soon and will kill for what I was typing 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:52.230

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.850

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.310

 burn and after watching this nightmare I 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.020
 I thought I'd rather jerk off than 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.020
 spent time on this
