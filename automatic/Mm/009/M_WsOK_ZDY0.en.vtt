three inches or 7 to 9 centimeters
distance<00:01:00.470> to<00:01:00.680> it<00:01:00.800> then<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.030> wrap<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:02.840> dump

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
distance to it then you wrap you dump

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.149

that on one end and place it between
your<00:01:07.719> feet<00:01:08.719> so<00:01:09.440> that<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.400> got<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.700> solid<00:01:11.060> hold

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
your feet so that you got the solid hold

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.710 
your feet so that you got the solid hold
and<00:01:11.690> dampen<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.290> can<00:01:12.560> be<00:01:12.740> sure<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.790> won't<00:01:14.030> slip

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
and dampen and can be sure it won't slip

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.789 
and dampen and can be sure it won't slip
from<00:01:15.229> your<00:01:15.290> feet<00:01:16.360> then<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:17.390> slowly<00:01:18.290> lean

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
from your feet then you slowly lean

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.530 
from your feet then you slowly lean
forward<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:19.880> your<00:01:20.120> board<00:01:20.560> so<00:01:21.560> that<00:01:22.130> your<00:01:22.640> knees

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
forward on your board so that your knees

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.370 
forward on your board so that your knees
are<00:01:23.869> beyond<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.650> edge<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.159> board<00:01:25.430> and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
are beyond the edge of the board and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.969 
are beyond the edge of the board and
steady<00:01:27.380> your<00:01:27.560> upper<00:01:27.920> body<00:01:28.159> with<00:01:28.790> your<00:01:29.119> abs

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
steady your upper body with your abs

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.950 
steady your upper body with your abs
again<00:01:30.979> make<00:01:31.159> sure<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.820> have<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:32.030> solid<00:01:32.479> hold<00:01:32.659> on

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
again make sure you have a solid hold on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.649 
again make sure you have a solid hold on
the<00:01:33.049> dumbbell<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.770> then<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.670> start<00:01:35.330> the

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
the dumbbell and then you start the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.420 
the dumbbell and then you start the
movement<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:37.610> go<00:01:37.820> slowly<00:01:38.540> up<00:01:39.250> until<00:01:40.250> your

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
movement you go slowly up until your

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.740 
movement you go slowly up until your
lower<00:01:40.640> legs<00:01:40.939> are<00:01:41.119> vertical<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:42.490> slowly<00:01:43.750> down

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
lower legs are vertical and slowly down

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.830 
lower legs are vertical and slowly down
again<00:01:45.220> if<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:46.430> just<00:01:46.640> learn<00:01:47.000> the<00:01:47.240> movement<00:01:47.720> I

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
again if you just learn the movement I

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.410 
again if you just learn the movement I
suggest<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:49.549> very<00:01:49.580> light<00:01:50.060> weight

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
suggest you do so with very light weight

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.940 
suggest you do so with very light weight
so<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.640> make<00:01:52.850> really<00:01:53.150> sure<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.920> a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
so you can make really sure you have a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.870 
so you can make really sure you have a
solid<00:01:55.430> hold<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:57.020> dumbbell<00:01:58.009> when<00:01:58.580> you<00:01:58.700> lose

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
solid hold of the dumbbell when you lose

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.359 
solid hold of the dumbbell when you lose
more<00:01:59.180> weight<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.750> it<00:02:00.619> won't<00:02:00.799> slip<00:02:01.040> from<00:02:01.280> your

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
more weight and it won't slip from your

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.380 
more weight and it won't slip from your
feet<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.450> won't<00:02:02.659> hurt<00:02:02.869> yourself<00:02:03.790> also<00:02:04.790> in

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
feet and you won't hurt yourself also in

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.569 
feet and you won't hurt yourself also in
my<00:02:05.600> experience<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.650> easier<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.400> this

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
my experience it is easier to do this

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.779 
my experience it is easier to do this
movement<00:02:07.880> with<00:02:08.479> bare<00:02:09.170> feet<00:02:09.500> because<00:02:10.459> bare

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
movement with bare feet because bare

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.180 
movement with bare feet because bare
feet<00:02:11.090> give<00:02:11.659> you<00:02:11.930> more<00:02:12.260> grip<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.690> dumbbell

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
feet give you more grip on the dumbbell

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.699 
feet give you more grip on the dumbbell
finally<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.599> quite<00:02:17.900> all<00:02:18.140> right

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
finally it is quite all right

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.530 
finally it is quite all right
if<00:02:19.329> you<00:02:20.329> can't<00:02:20.659> lock<00:02:21.260> your<00:02:21.530> legs<00:02:21.860> here<00:02:22.540> with

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
if you can't lock your legs here with

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.960 
if you can't lock your legs here with
your<00:02:23.720> range<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.110> movement<00:02:24.680> because<00:02:25.459> it<00:02:25.819> is

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
your range of movement because it is

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.080 
your range of movement because it is
simply<00:02:26.390> not<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.569> good<00:02:26.840> idea<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:28.040> lock<00:02:28.610> your<00:02:28.879> legs

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
simply not a good idea to lock your legs

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.229
