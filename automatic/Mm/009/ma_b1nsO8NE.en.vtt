to display it on the screen and access
the<00:00:06.540> different<00:00:06.710> pieces<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.099> it<00:00:08.130> if<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.429> wanted

different<00:00:08.910> buttons<00:00:09.420> or<00:00:09.719> whatnot<00:00:10.130> so<00:00:11.130> we'll

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
different buttons or whatnot so we'll

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.240 
different buttons or whatnot so we'll
just<00:00:11.519> go<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.150> or<00:00:12.330> code<00:00:12.630> real<00:00:12.780> quick<00:00:13.250> so

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
just go to in or code real quick so

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.440 
just go to in or code real quick so
we're<00:00:14.400> gonna<00:00:14.490> need<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.759> create<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> variable

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
we're gonna need to create a variable

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.320 
we're gonna need to create a variable
for<00:00:15.660> GUI<00:00:16.230> enabled<00:00:16.740> this<00:00:17.010> will<00:00:17.279> make<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.090> if

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
for GUI enabled this will make it so if

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
for GUI enabled this will make it so if
the<00:00:18.480> GUI<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.960> displayed<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:19.890> screen<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.640> not

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the GUI is displayed on screen or not

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.269 
the GUI is displayed on screen or not
displayed<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.449> screen<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.890> started<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
displayed on screen so it started the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.769 
displayed on screen so it started the
game<00:00:23.400> we're<00:00:23.580> gonna<00:00:23.670> set<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> false<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.720> it

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
game we're gonna set that to false so it

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
game we're gonna set that to false so it
didn't<00:00:24.990> show<00:00:25.170> up<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:26.250> our<00:00:26.430> update<00:00:26.609> function

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
didn't show up and our update function

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.710 
didn't show up and our update function
we<00:00:27.449> are<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:28.019> add<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:29.210> if<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.420> press<00:00:30.689> down

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
we are going to add in if you press down

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.170 
we are going to add in if you press down
the<00:00:31.140> end<00:00:31.320> key<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:33.180> will<00:00:33.480> either<00:00:33.770> enable<00:00:34.770> or

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
the end key it will either enable or

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.139 
the end key it will either enable or
disable<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.930> key<00:00:37.140> depending<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:38.030> what<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
disable the key depending on what is

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.959 
disable the key depending on what is
pressed<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.800> can<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> simple

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
pressed and you can just use that simple

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
pressed and you can just use that simple
code<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.420> down<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
code to do so so and then we go down to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.580 
code to do so so and then we go down to
our<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.590> GUI<00:00:46.890> function<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> is<00:00:47.610> where

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
our on GUI function this is where

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.959 
our on GUI function this is where
different<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.950> GUI<00:00:50.219> buttons<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
different things like GUI buttons and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.619 
different things like GUI buttons and
GUI<00:00:51.120> labels<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.989> whatnot<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> handled<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.270> if

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
GUI labels and whatnot is handled so if

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.319 
GUI labels and whatnot is handled so if
GUI<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.079> enabled<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.670> pretty<00:00:56.850> much<00:00:56.969> just

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
GUI is enabled so that pretty much just

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.290 
GUI is enabled so that pretty much just
means<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.649> enabled<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.340> true<00:00:59.879> without

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
means do we enabled is true without

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.250 
means do we enabled is true without
adding<00:01:00.750> equals<00:01:01.440> equals<00:01:01.710> true<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.260> then

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
adding equals equals true to it and then

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.340 
adding equals equals true to it and then
we<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:04.769> create<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.610> simple<00:01:05.850> button<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.049> will

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
we can create a simple button so it will

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.670 
we can create a simple button so it will
create<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.310> GUI<00:01:08.580> button<00:01:09.170> it'll<00:01:10.170> create<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
create a GUI button it'll create a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.399 
create a GUI button it'll create a
rectangle<00:01:11.750> size<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.049> located<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:16.259> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
rectangle size is located here for the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.930 
rectangle size is located here for the
length<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.810> height<00:01:18.810> for<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
length and height for it

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.360 
length and height for it
and<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.930> yeah<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.570> where<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> want<00:01:25.080> to

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
and so yeah this is where you want to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.650 
and so yeah this is where you want to
actually<00:01:26.370> display<00:01:28.160> your<00:01:29.160> GUI<00:01:29.400> button<00:01:29.730> on<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
actually display your GUI button on the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.430 
actually display your GUI button on the
screen<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:32.190> for<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.700> width<00:01:33.020> we'll<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
screen so for the width we'll take the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.980 
screen so for the width we'll take the
screen<00:01:34.710> width<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.280> whatever<00:01:36.270> your<00:01:36.420> window<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
screen width so whatever your window is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.290 
screen width so whatever your window is
adjusted<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> it'll<00:01:38.070> take<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> divide

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
adjusted to it'll take that and divide

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.290 
adjusted to it'll take that and divide
it<00:01:39.450> by<00:01:39.480> 2<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.230> it'll<00:01:40.410> Center<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> same<00:01:42.090> thing

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
it by 2 so it'll Center it same thing

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.270 
it by 2 so it'll Center it same thing
for<00:01:42.480> height<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.070> if<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.400> are<00:01:44.610> creating<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.510> game

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
for height so if you are creating a game

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.860 
for height so if you are creating a game
where<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.580> want<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.030> user<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.600> able<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
where you want the user to be able to

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.010 
where you want the user to be able to
adjust<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.230> window<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.070> don't<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.020> GUI

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
adjust the window you don't want the GUI

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.010 
adjust the window you don't want the GUI
to<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.470> offset<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.220> we'll<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.730> use<00:01:54.020> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to get offset so we'll just use the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.850 
to get offset so we'll just use the
screen<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.620> tell<00:01:55.830> where<00:01:56.370> where<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> for

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
screen to tell where where it is so for

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
screen to tell where where it is so for
this<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.130> yeah<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.730> divides<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.150> by<00:02:00.180> 2<00:02:00.300> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
this one yeah it divides it by 2 and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
this one yeah it divides it by 2 and
then<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:00.960> -<00:02:01.230> is<00:02:01.380> by<00:02:01.530> 40<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.010> we're<00:02:02.190> gonna

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
then it - is by 40 because we're gonna

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.010 
then it - is by 40 because we're gonna
be<00:02:02.520> putting<00:02:02.760> these<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:05.630> like<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.660> row<00:02:07.550> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
be putting these in a like a row and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
be putting these in a like a row and
yeah<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.470> one's<00:02:10.679> by<00:02:10.860> 40<00:02:11.310> 20<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.530> that's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
yeah so this one's by 40 20 and that's

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.790 
yeah so this one's by 40 20 and that's
just<00:02:13.980> yeah<00:02:14.490> normal<00:02:15.060> amount<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.680> will

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
just yeah normal amount so this one will

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.820 
just yeah normal amount so this one will
be<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:16.950> top<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.430> middle<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.910> bottom<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.600> then

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
be on top the middle and bottom and then

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.610 
be on top the middle and bottom and then
if<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.010> press<00:02:20.310> exit<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.610> close<00:02:24.620> this

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
if we press exit then it will close this

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.180 
if we press exit then it will close this
whole<00:02:25.890> menu<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.270> pretty<00:02:27.390> basic<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:29.100> if

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
whole menu so it's pretty basic so if

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.070 
whole menu so it's pretty basic so if
you<00:02:29.280> click<00:02:29.520> on<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> certain<00:02:29.970> button<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.930> can

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you click on a certain button you can

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.710 
you click on a certain button you can
put<00:02:31.260> code<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.390> put<00:02:33.540> whatever

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
put code in here so you can put whatever

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.020 
put code in here so you can put whatever
code<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.080> want<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.860> says<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.610> click

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
code you want so it just says if I click

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.229 
code you want so it just says if I click
on<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.360> button<00:02:37.160> it<00:02:38.160> ain't<00:02:38.430> activate<00:02:39.090> this

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
on this button it ain't activate this

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.380 
on this button it ain't activate this
code<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.780> can<00:02:39.959> make<00:02:40.640> different<00:02:41.640> menus<00:02:41.970> pop-up

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
code you can make different menus pop-up

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.260 
code you can make different menus pop-up
if<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.690> wanted<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.830> mean<00:02:44.340> 4<00:02:44.550> options<00:02:44.970> you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
if you wanted so I mean 4 options you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.370 
if you wanted so I mean 4 options you
can<00:02:45.450> make<00:02:45.660> a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

like<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> um<00:02:50.300> another<00:02:51.300> GUI<00:02:51.810> pop-up<00:02:52.380> for<00:02:52.920> your

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
like a um another GUI pop-up for your

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.460 
like a um another GUI pop-up for your
actual<00:02:53.760> options<00:02:54.330> like<00:02:54.570> for<00:02:54.750> video<00:02:55.020> options

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
actual options like for video options

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.320 
actual options like for video options
and<00:02:55.680> stuff<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.190> adjust<00:02:57.180> different

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and stuff you can adjust different

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.060 
and stuff you can adjust different
things<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.930> game<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.560> wanted<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.040> for

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
things in game if you wanted to do for

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.600 
things in game if you wanted to do for
audio<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:03:00.000> adjust<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.660> volume<00:03:00.690> of

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
audio you can adjust the volume of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.700 
audio you can adjust the volume of
certain<00:03:02.610> objects<00:03:03.030> in<00:03:03.120> your<00:03:03.240> game<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.750> stuff

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
certain objects in your game and stuff

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.940 
certain objects in your game and stuff
like<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:05.600> that's<00:03:06.600> pretty<00:03:07.320> much<00:03:07.800> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
like that so that's pretty much the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.690 
like that so that's pretty much the
basics<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:09.140> standard<00:03:10.140> GUI<00:03:10.350> code<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.890> might<00:03:11.520> go

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
basics of a standard GUI code I might go

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.980 
basics of a standard GUI code I might go
into<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.090> little<00:03:12.270> bit<00:03:12.480> more<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.960> a

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
into this a little bit more and do a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.450 
into this a little bit more and do a
more<00:03:13.260> advanced<00:03:13.560> one<00:03:13.800> in<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:13.950> future<00:03:14.280> with

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
more advanced one in the future with

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.620 
more advanced one in the future with
like<00:03:14.720> sliding<00:03:15.720> buttons<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.790> our<00:03:17.790> sliders<00:03:18.300> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
like sliding buttons and our sliders and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.230 
like sliding buttons and our sliders and
different<00:03:19.080> buttons<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.500> stuff<00:03:19.710> like<00:03:19.890> that

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
different buttons and stuff like that

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.450 
different buttons and stuff like that
but<00:03:21.240> for<00:03:21.630> now<00:03:21.870> you're<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:22.380> gonna<00:03:22.560> throw<00:03:23.400> it

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
but for now you're just gonna throw it

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.820 
but for now you're just gonna throw it
on<00:03:23.610> your<00:03:23.760> main<00:03:24.030> camera<00:03:24.510> or<00:03:24.720> whatever<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.590> want

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
on your main camera or whatever you want

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.190 
on your main camera or whatever you want
it's<00:03:26.360> probably<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.450> best<00:03:27.630> throat<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.080> your

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
it's probably the best throat on your

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.380 
it's probably the best throat on your
main<00:03:28.350> camera<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:29.520> we<00:03:29.850> can<00:03:29.970> go<00:03:30.060> ahead<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.270> hit

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
main camera and we can go ahead and hit

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.040 
main camera and we can go ahead and hit
start<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.100> I<00:03:32.190> go<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.430> press<00:03:32.640> n<00:03:32.880> you'll<00:03:33.750> see

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
start so if I go and press n you'll see

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.710 
start so if I go and press n you'll see
my<00:03:34.380> little<00:03:35.220> menu<00:03:35.580> pops<00:03:35.820> up<00:03:36.000> if<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.300> press<00:03:36.540> n

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
my little menu pops up if I press n

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.020 
my little menu pops up if I press n
again<00:03:36.990> it'll<00:03:37.620> go<00:03:37.740> away<00:03:38.090> same<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.480> click<00:03:39.810> exit

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
again it'll go away same if I click exit

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.450 
again it'll go away same if I click exit
it'll<00:03:42.030> go<00:03:42.150> away<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.050> see<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:44.280> GUI

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
it'll go away and you see how the GUI

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.710 
it'll go away and you see how the GUI
centered<00:03:44.970> if<00:03:45.210> I<00:03:45.300> were<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:46.640> adjust<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:48.240> screen

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
centered if I were to adjust this screen

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.920 
centered if I were to adjust this screen
it<00:03:49.170> would<00:03:49.290> stay<00:03:49.730> centered<00:03:50.960> and<00:03:51.960> stuff<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.910> yeah

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
it would stay centered and stuff so yeah

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.440 
it would stay centered and stuff so yeah
you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:55.110> click<00:03:55.620> with<00:03:55.800> either<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.520> left<00:03:57.210> or

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
you can click with either the left or

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.310 
you can click with either the left or
right<00:03:57.960> mouse<00:03:58.140> button<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:59.780> would<00:04:00.780> probably<00:04:01.020> need

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
right mouse button I would probably need

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.230 
right mouse button I would probably need
to<00:04:01.530> disable<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.100> ray<00:04:02.340> casting<00:04:02.880> for<00:04:03.120> these

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
to disable the ray casting for these

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.560 
to disable the ray casting for these
buttons<00:04:03.660> because<00:04:04.200> my<00:04:04.800> character<00:04:05.330> moves<00:04:06.330> and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
buttons because my character moves and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.770 
buttons because my character moves and
everything<00:04:07.020> still<00:04:07.440> when<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.460> click<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:08.910> but

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
everything still when I click on it but

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.980 
everything still when I click on it but
if<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.990> right<00:04:10.200> click<00:04:10.230> it<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.820> does<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.030> but

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
if I right click it just does that but

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.110 
if I right click it just does that but
yeah<00:04:13.110> so<00:04:13.320> it's<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.560> basic<00:04:13.950> way<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.160> setup<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.670> menu

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
yeah so it's a basic way to setup a menu

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.170 
yeah so it's a basic way to setup a menu
um<00:04:15.500> you<00:04:16.500> can<00:04:16.680> attach<00:04:16.980> different<00:04:17.220> functions<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
um you can attach different functions to

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360 
um you can attach different functions to
when<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.600> click<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> button<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.440> stuff<00:04:19.859> or<00:04:20.160> you

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
when you click a button and stuff or you

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.210 
when you click a button and stuff or you
can<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:21.080> enable<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.350> different<00:04:22.710> GUI<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.010> pop

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
can just enable a different GUI to pop
