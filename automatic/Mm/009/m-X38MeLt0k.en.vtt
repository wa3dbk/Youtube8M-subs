00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.820
 hello youtube friends good in 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.130
 this occasion I want to share with 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.039
 you this new implement that has 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.259
 gone out for fishing specifically 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:14.209
 for night fishing you see that when 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:16.279
 one goes to a place totally in lures 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.790
 one asks for a lure for night fishing 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.020
 and they only give him a thread of color 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.970
 phosphorescent 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.770
 or at best they are are and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 decoy that is really phosphorescent 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.850
 so you see in the dark but 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 of the type that charges is to control for and 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.810
 and it is what you can see here 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 we have professional paint is not 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:44.079
 powder paint from which they are washed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.679
 It consists of viscous paint with 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.989
 epoxy so you can stick to the 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.780
 lure and also be against water 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.570
 good because we are interested in this type of 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.159
 paint that is fluorescent paint 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.039
 good because the phosphorescent paint in 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.710
 which we regularly use in projects 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.189
 of crafts or to decorate the car 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.799
 the house o emits long visible waves 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.509
 to the human eye and in this case as the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.939
 painting is florescent emits waves 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.759
 short as gamma waves and waves 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.710
 they go up and why are we interested in this because 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.899
 fish precisely see the waves 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:25.030
 gamma and v to exemplify the best 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.030
 let's see how I would see a fish 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.570
 precisely these lures 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.020
 we have an ultraviolet light and that's how it is 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.909
 how the fish would see precisely 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.040
 these lures are exaggeratedly 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.830
 attractants and a friend the use of 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.770
 night and in low california and could 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.640
 catch several saws 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.270
 it really is a very very very painting 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.869
 good that we are importing from us is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.060
 the new thing that is being used to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.420
 for fishing 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.739
 good friends how important this is 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.980
 paint is that you do not wash them with the 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.060
 water usually the paintings the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.220
 present are dust and powder 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.489
 simply what it does is that at 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.110
 moment to put it in the water they wash 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.930
 is that now here in Mexico almost 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.860
 nobody sells with insula live of that type 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:34.330
 of paint the good thing is that it is made of 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.209
 a viscous base and it also has a 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 epoxy base so that you can 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.500
 fix the decoy and do not drop the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.830
 painting and well then I will explain 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.190
 so quickly how 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.190
 this 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.520
 basically the painting we're going to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.420
 use in a 3 to 1 ratio 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.520
 what does this mean 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.520
 Well, what are we going to use? 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.620
 three drops of paint 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.860
 a part of epoxy 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.950
 a very very viscous paint 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.400
 today I stop to be used with the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.000
 base against the water that is this that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 we have here 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.400
 we have a boot 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.860
 for this you can use you if 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.530
 they want a brush but in my case I 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.190
 I prefer to do with a toothpick because I 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.780
 allows you to paint better the lure that 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.780
 let's go use 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.400
 since we have been stirring it 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.790
 perfectly fine 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 we can use it to start painting 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:13.000
 the lure in this case to the spoon that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.939
 we have here we were putting 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.570
 while some points we can follow 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:24.139
 putting points we can touch up yet 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.099
 more this lure putting him 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:32.110
 other attractive points here touching the 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.110
 fins of the lower part 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.930
 and touching the fin 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.930
 Exterior 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.950
 we can even do it if we want 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.790
 us here 1 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.790
 a little stingray 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.380
 we can focus more on the gills 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.820
 We can even make both 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.560
 they look 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.340
 fluorescent so that directly 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.730
 attack the fish on the hook 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.700
 really it gives very good results for 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:24.560
 I want to share this video with you 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.560
 us and well then so would a 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.560
 fish 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.810
 this friends is exaggeratedly attractive 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.580
 and the best thing about this is that you can 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.990
 use the same desires that you have 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.510
 had always but now 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.300
 use them also at night 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:49.700
 good friends of youtube I hope that you 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.730
 the video has been useful 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:56.680
 Any questions or comments here we are 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.680
 so see you later
