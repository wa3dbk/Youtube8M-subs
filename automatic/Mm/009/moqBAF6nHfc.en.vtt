I<00:01:05.729> mean<00:01:06.180> sometimes<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:07.290> I'll<00:01:07.470> sit<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
I mean sometimes like I'll sit down with

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
I mean sometimes like I'll sit down with
pedals<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.760> turn<00:01:09.000> knobs<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.990> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
pedals and just turn knobs and it's the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.679 
pedals and just turn knobs and it's the
combination<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.310> notes<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
combination of those notes with that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
combination of those notes with that
tone<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> pedal<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.920> determines<00:01:14.549> if

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
tone of the pedal that determines if

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.920 
tone of the pedal that determines if
it's<00:01:14.790> cool<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> might<00:01:15.659> inspire

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
it's cool or not and it might inspire

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
it's cool or not and it might inspire
you<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.350> write<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> new<00:01:16.770> idea<00:01:17.070> oh<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.090> this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
you to write a new idea oh you know this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
you to write a new idea oh you know this
note<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.930> display<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.560> your<00:01:19.740> own<00:01:19.890> or

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
though if I'm writing those kind of

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.080 
though if I'm writing those kind of
parts<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.830> you'll<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:26.970> foundation

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
parts can be you'll have your foundation

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120 
parts can be you'll have your foundation
maybe<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.750> course<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.590> rhythm<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
maybe your course and your rhythm and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.940 
maybe your course and your rhythm and
your<00:01:29.280> baseline<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:29.970> whatever<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.600> those

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
your baseline or whatever and then those

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.219 
your baseline or whatever and then those
the<00:01:31.950> tones<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.360> guitar<00:01:33.720> parts<00:01:34.020> that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the tones that are the guitar parts that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
the tones that are the guitar parts that
require<00:01:34.500> sound<00:01:35.189> design<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.549> tone<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.750> do

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
require sound design and tone I can do

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.600 
require sound design and tone I can do
those<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> track<00:01:37.710> while<00:01:37.950> recording<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
those in the track while recording and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.609 
those in the track while recording and
like<00:01:38.790> start<00:01:39.180> turning<00:01:39.540> knobs<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> see<00:01:40.470> how

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
like start turning knobs and you see how

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.980 
like start turning knobs and you see how
it<00:01:40.799> sits<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.310> everything<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
it sits with everything I think that's a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.920 
it sits with everything I think that's a
very<00:01:43.140> important<00:01:43.710> part<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.930> think

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
very important part is to I think

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.170 
very important part is to I think
sometimes<00:01:46.530> sometimes<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.369> maybe

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sometimes sometimes you see maybe

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.060 
sometimes sometimes you see maybe
beginners<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.110> those<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.560> cool<00:01:49.860> tone

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
job I wanted to keep it really simple I

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.819 
job I wanted to keep it really simple I
have<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.329> a<00:02:43.360> lot<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.629> sound<00:02:43.959> design<00:02:44.230> things

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
have to do a lot of sound design things

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.839 
have to do a lot of sound design things
so<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.090> went<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> G<00:02:46.720> system<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:48.280> my<00:02:48.459> opinion

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
so I went to the G system in my opinion

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.280 
so I went to the G system in my opinion
there's<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> lot<00:02:49.150> of<00:02:49.239> effects<00:02:49.540> processors<00:02:50.140> out

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
there's a lot of effects processors out

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.710 
there's a lot of effects processors out
there<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.739> messing<00:02:51.220> with<00:02:51.250> them<00:02:51.579> over<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
there and messing with them over the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.319 
there and messing with them over the
years<00:02:53.019> they<00:02:53.470> tend<00:02:53.799> to<00:02:53.890> get<00:02:54.160> noisy<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
years they tend to get noisy and the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.479 
years they tend to get noisy and the
quality<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.780> effects<00:02:56.200> isn't<00:02:56.530> as<00:02:56.590> good<00:02:56.829> but<00:02:57.069> TC

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
quality of effects isn't as good but TC

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.250 
quality of effects isn't as good but TC
has<00:02:57.549> always<00:02:57.790> been<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.060> really<00:02:58.329> quality<00:02:58.720> product

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
has always been a really quality product

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.949 
has always been a really quality product
and<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.549> wanted<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.269> get<00:03:01.420> something<00:03:01.750> that

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
and so I wanted to get something that

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.900 
and so I wanted to get something that
could<00:03:02.109> simply<00:03:02.500> switch<00:03:02.829> my<00:03:03.040> channels<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.700> turn

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
could simply switch my channels and turn

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.090 
could simply switch my channels and turn
on<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> course<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.930> delay<00:03:05.290> in<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.620> reverb

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
on a course and the delay in a reverb

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.460 
on a course and the delay in a reverb
and<00:03:06.340> vibrato<00:03:06.790> all<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.359> flick<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.870> button<00:03:07.900> it

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and vibrato all the flick of a button it

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.890 
and vibrato all the flick of a button it
was<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.920> was<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.670> jeesus<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.269> that<00:03:10.450> works

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
was it was the jeesus and that works

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.390 
was it was the jeesus and that works
really<00:03:11.049> well<00:03:11.410> for<00:03:11.470> me<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.889> then<00:03:12.010> what<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.160> want

really well for me and then what I want
to<00:03:12.489> add<00:03:12.639> stuff<00:03:13.000> to<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:13.840> very<00:03:14.079> easy
