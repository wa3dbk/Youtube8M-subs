00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
playing it in the back end and I got the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.970 
playing it in the back end and I got the
timing<00:02:42.940> down<00:02:43.209> really<00:02:43.480> good<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.080> then<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.620> moved

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
timing down really good and then I moved

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.540

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
up to the to the big stage and for some

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.220 
up to the to the big stage and for some
reason<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.970> timing<00:02:49.390> just<00:02:49.420> changed<00:02:49.959> on<00:02:50.080> me<00:02:50.200> a

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
reason the timing just changed on me a

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.220 
reason the timing just changed on me a
little<00:02:50.380> bit<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.860> I<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:53.080> it

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
little bit so I don't know because it

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.740 
little bit so I don't know because it
was<00:02:53.380> wireless<00:02:53.830> controllers<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:55.269> sometimes

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
was wireless controllers it sometimes

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.320 
was wireless controllers it sometimes
that<00:02:56.350> isn't<00:02:56.500> pick<00:02:56.799> up<00:02:56.980> like<00:02:57.220> right<00:02:57.459> away<00:02:57.610> and<00:02:58.090> I

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
that isn't pick up like right away and I

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.930 
that isn't pick up like right away and I
and<00:02:58.660> I<00:02:58.750> noticed<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.200> ones<00:02:59.380> in<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.370> back<00:03:00.670> where

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
and I noticed the ones in the back where

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.020 
and I noticed the ones in the back where
we<00:03:01.930> wire<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:02.920> i<00:03:03.250> don't<00:03:03.549> know<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.730> had

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
we wire so i don't know if that had

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.400 
we wire so i don't know if that had
anything<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.390> do<00:03:04.570> with<00:03:04.600> it<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:05.170> threw<00:03:05.350> me

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
anything to do with it but it threw me

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.870 
anything to do with it but it threw me
off<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:05.890> bit<00:03:06.100> what's<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.700> thought

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
off just a little bit what's the thought

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640 
off just a little bit what's the thought
process<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.480> not<00:03:07.660> choosing<00:03:07.959> yourself<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
process of not choosing yourself as the

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.890 
process of not choosing yourself as the
guy<00:03:08.860> you're<00:03:09.010> using<00:03:09.510> why<00:03:10.510> wouldn't<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.780> go

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
guy you're using why wouldn't you go

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.710 
guy you're using why wouldn't you go
with<00:03:11.049> yourself<00:03:11.410> out<00:03:11.560> there<00:03:11.769> i<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.390> think

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
with yourself out there i I just think

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.840 
with yourself out there i I just think
that's<00:03:13.900> wrong<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:14.830> like<00:03:15.370> voting<00:03:15.610> for

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
that's wrong but like voting for

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.920 
that's wrong but like voting for
