was brown and maybe he's still brown I
took<00:00:30.630> him<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.990> vet<00:00:31.019> about<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> month<00:00:31.769> ago<00:00:31.890> he

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
told me he was Brown because of a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.110 
told me he was Brown because of a
calcium<00:00:34.680> deficiency<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> reason<00:00:36.030> why

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
calcium deficiency and the reason why

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
calcium deficiency and the reason why
when<00:00:36.300> he<00:00:36.420> runs<00:00:36.630> he<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:36.989> drag<00:00:37.170> his<00:00:37.320> stomach

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when he runs he would drag his stomach

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
when he runs he would drag his stomach
because<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.700> bones<00:00:39.450> weren't<00:00:39.899> strong<00:00:40.079> enough

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
because the bones weren't strong enough

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.560 
because the bones weren't strong enough
the<00:00:40.469> hole<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:41.640> belly<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.770> so<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
the hole is his belly up and so I

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.880 
the hole is his belly up and so I
started<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> dust<00:00:45.960> his<00:00:46.050> crickets<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.710> stuff

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
started to dust his crickets and stuff

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.180 
started to dust his crickets and stuff
like<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.530> he<00:00:49.530> told<00:00:49.680> me<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.829> force-feed

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
like that and he told me to force-feed

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
like that and he told me to force-feed
him<00:00:50.430> some<00:00:50.640> baby<00:00:50.820> food<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> while<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
him some baby food for a while and that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
him some baby food for a while and that
it<00:00:51.899> worked<00:00:52.079> out<00:00:52.230> very<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> baby

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it worked out very well because the baby

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.040 
it worked out very well because the baby
food<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.879> wouldn't<00:00:54.030> swallow<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> would

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
food you wouldn't swallow it it would

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.560 
food you wouldn't swallow it it would
just<00:00:55.079> cake<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.129> into<00:00:56.399> his<00:00:56.520> mouth<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.120> rot

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just cake up into his mouth and just rot

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.270 
just cake up into his mouth and just rot
and<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.530> think<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.870> anyways<00:01:01.280> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
