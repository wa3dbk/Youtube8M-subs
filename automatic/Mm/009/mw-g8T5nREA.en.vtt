in short we hope that the need to
increase<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.850> debt<00:01:53.180> ceiling<00:01:53.390> could<00:01:53.930> be<00:01:54.080> an

increase the debt ceiling could be an

increase the debt ceiling could be an
opportunity<00:01:54.440> to<00:01:55.040> make<00:01:55.220> some<00:01:55.430> very<00:01:55.670> hard
