00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello is in the palomera and if we change 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
 a little bit of being but because today we have 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.960
 a special capsule if you know my name 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.059
 surely you remember I'm cynthia and 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 we are going to have a special capsule of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.330
 star trek into the times 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.670
 we know that the movie is missing a lot 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 to be released on May 17 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 come to our cinema halls 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 but we are truly excited 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.039
 and as we already see it is super fashionable 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 because he will also be the director of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.550
 star wars episode 7 then we decided 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550
 make him a special capsule 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:47.050
 I tell you when it was confirmed that he was leaving 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.289
 to be the second part of star trek that 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.710
 come and ramses in 2009 was not 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.350
 as very safe rather studies 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.600
 paramount are not very safe and all the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.659
 cast was going to be again but they were 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.269
 confirmed is crispin is zachary 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.630
 fifth zoe saldana is not eric or 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.560
 that was the bad guy I shoot normally 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.560
 his feet 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 squeezing 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.670
 by ianz 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.100
 that is about star trek into the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 darkness we are going to talk to you 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 adventures of Captain Kirk this is well 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.760
 when the crew of the enterprise is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.250
 call back home they are 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.470
 with an unstoppable force of terror value 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.930
 according to solar terror within your 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.500
 own organization is tornado a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.930
 floats and this comes in some way to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.390
 threaten the world and they are in a 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.360
 crisis then they will treat you as you already 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.810
 we know about saving the world and attacking 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.640
 to the enemy where they will put to the test 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 this friendship bond they have and about 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.210
 all try to save all the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.130
 members of the crew I love you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.500
 comment that the producer of this tape 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.840
 star trek into the darkness was here 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.300
 in Mexico presenting about 30 minutes 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.759
 exclusive the appointment we had the 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.610
 opportunity to see it classes to stop and 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.830
 I want to tell you that you can not imagine 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.840
 the quality of the effects that the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.239
 tape to start is the first 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.940
 movie that we're going to see that was done in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.190
 3d and also in there is more because if you 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.050
 They do not know what I wanted them to be that 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.280
 the movie come out in 3d format 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.590
 because it's fashion because it 's more 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.210
 profitable you already know but the problem is 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.400
 that the director wanted to do then 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.190
 we can do both but it's going to be the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.930
 first film that combines the two 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.010
 formats so it's probably going to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.130
 be amazing 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.620
 Benicio del Toro wanted to not want to 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.230
 contemplated to make the villain of the 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.270
 movie but finally he did not get the 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.420
 paper if a Briton did not get it 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.030
 that maybe they do not remember but it's called 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.520
 benedict cumberbatch or if the name is 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.730
 something strange but they have seen it 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.590
 in the movie war horse that 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.060
 He directed spielberg 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.430
 spielberg is indeed who it 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500
 recommended and brahms because in case 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.050
 you do not know they are very good friends 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.400
 another reason no more saw back 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.220
 the reasons no other of the data 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.440
 curious about this movie as I already 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.040
 I said is that technologies are being used 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.960
 new ones and I want to tell you that even the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.940
 spores that can see are very 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.560
 detailed a very comment 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.870
 characteristic that the producer did 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.270
 is that he was not particularly a fan of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.800
 star trek but became a fan 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.530
 because he believes that the movies he is 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.860
 doing and brahms about this series does not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.709
 are particularly for the fans or for 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.150
 the trekkies if it is not for all 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.890
 people who like cinema and have 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.569
 reason if you want to see this 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.760
 movie is not necessary that Moscow the 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.489
 one does not even know that there is a 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.620
 series that was super famous and that 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.349
 show that if you want to see it 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.989
 they will enjoy it I promise you but 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.630
 now we have a surprise and the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.720
 we leave with some scenes behind 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.930
 cameras that he loaned to me 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.380
 of golf you are very alive of ashley 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.480
 It is lighter to mark 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.960
 and for fourth experience I think the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.960
 spot bones oscar and the chaco 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.639
