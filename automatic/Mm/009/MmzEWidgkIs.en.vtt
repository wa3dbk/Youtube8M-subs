description below this is a new cell
number<00:02:14.150> point<00:02:14.659> for<00:02:14.870> me

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.800 

main<00:02:17.620> reason<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.160> went<00:02:18.400> was<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:20.260> buy<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
main reason I went was to buy this

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.100 
main reason I went was to buy this
extremely<00:02:22.810> expensive<00:02:23.260> torso<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.690> it's<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
extremely expensive torso but it's the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.610 
extremely expensive torso but it's the
little<00:02:27.240> guilt<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.170> monkey<00:02:29.470> head

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
little guilt or so with the monkey head

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.740 
little guilt or so with the monkey head
this<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.400> for<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> sig<00:02:31.030> fig<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.480> don't<00:02:31.630> want

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
this is for a sig fig that I don't want

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.980 
this is for a sig fig that I don't want
to<00:02:31.810> build<00:02:32.020> for<00:02:32.430> quite<00:02:33.430> some<00:02:33.670> time<00:02:33.700> now<00:02:34.120> it's

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
to build for quite some time now it's

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.890 
to build for quite some time now it's
used<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.460> it's<00:02:36.730> being<00:02:37.000> pretty<00:02:37.180> good<00:02:37.390> shape<00:02:37.570> so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
used and it's being pretty good shape so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.870 
used and it's being pretty good shape so
cool<00:02:38.110> but<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.890> was<00:02:38.980> still<00:02:39.190> like<00:02:39.310> four<00:02:39.580> dollars

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
cool but it was still like four dollars

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.000 
cool but it was still like four dollars
and<00:02:40.030> seven<00:02:40.330> cents<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.660> it<00:02:43.750> is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and seven cents so that is what it is

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and seven cents so that is what it is
then<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.190> needed<00:02:45.520> one<00:02:46.330> more<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.780> these<00:02:47.850> ramps<00:02:48.850> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
then I needed one more of these ramps to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.900 
then I needed one more of these ramps to
go<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:50.500> my<00:02:50.530> crossing<00:02:51.130> where<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.310> train<00:02:51.520> is<00:02:51.700> in

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
go for my crossing where the train is in

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.680 
go for my crossing where the train is in
the<00:02:52.000> city<00:02:52.210> and<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:53.410> grabbed<00:02:53.620> some<00:02:54.390> black<00:02:55.390> legs

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the city and I grabbed some black legs

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.780 
the city and I grabbed some black legs
for<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.410> remaining<00:02:56.770> tour<00:02:57.010> soles<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.430> my<00:02:57.490> sig

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
for the remaining tour soles of my sig

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.250 
for the remaining tour soles of my sig
fig<00:02:58.000> that<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.870> need<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.230> complete<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:04.260> grab

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
fig that I need to complete and I grab

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.020 
fig that I need to complete and I grab
this<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:05.740> because<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:06.340> thought<00:03:06.850> was<00:03:07.000> a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
this one just because I thought was a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.460 
this one just because I thought was a
cool<00:03:07.240> little<00:03:07.390> tour<00:03:07.600> so<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.960> probably<00:03:08.170> change

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
cool little tour so I probably change

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.310 
cool little tour so I probably change
off<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.770> head<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.130> hair<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:11.170> was

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
off the head and the hair but it was

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.200 
off the head and the hair but it was
cheap<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.710> think<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.700> just<00:03:12.850> looked<00:03:13.030> cool<00:03:13.180> so

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
cheap I think and it just looked cool so

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.290 
cheap I think and it just looked cool so
I<00:03:13.390> grab<00:03:13.630> that<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.710> then<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.160> grab<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.550> one<00:03:15.760> for

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
I grab that and then I grab this one for

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.880 
I grab that and then I grab this one for
a<00:03:16.330> sig<00:03:16.570> fig<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.080> I<00:03:17.230> don't<00:03:17.440> think<00:03:17.680> I'm<00:03:17.770> gonna

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
a sig fig and I don't think I'm gonna

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.250 
a sig fig and I don't think I'm gonna
end<00:03:18.070> up<00:03:18.130> building<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.580> because<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.570> is<00:03:19.750> not<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
end up building it because it is not the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.250 
end up building it because it is not the
original<00:03:20.380> sig<00:03:20.830> fig<00:03:21.070> for<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.370> person<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.260> if

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
original sig fig for this person and if

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.960 
original sig fig for this person and if
I'm<00:03:23.410> probably<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.800> going<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.130> go<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.790> the

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
I'm probably just going to go with the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.290 
I'm probably just going to go with the
original<00:03:25.030> I'm<00:03:25.990> just<00:03:26.980> not<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.130> big<00:03:27.190> fan<00:03:27.490> of<00:03:27.730> the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
original I'm just not a big fan of the

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.720 
original I'm just not a big fan of the
alternates<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:30.160> which<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.490> good<00:03:30.700> for

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
alternates out there which is good for

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.480 
alternates out there which is good for
most<00:03:31.630> people<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.020> for<00:03:32.200> me<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.400> have
