00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550

personal<00:02:20.550> or<00:02:20.760> past<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:23.880> were

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
personal or past and I think they were

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.030 
personal or past and I think they were
trying<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.570> do<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.990> little<00:02:25.290> bit<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.680> when

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
trying to do a little bit of this when

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.310 
trying to do a little bit of this when
it<00:02:26.070> came<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.300> castle<00:02:27.450> mania<00:02:27.900> episode

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
it came to the castle mania episode

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.980 
it came to the castle mania episode
where<00:02:28.530> Twilight<00:02:28.920> found<00:02:29.160> their<00:02:29.760> old<00:02:30.030> diary<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
where Twilight found their old diary and

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.380 
where Twilight found their old diary and
it<00:02:31.260> showed<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.700> those<00:02:32.700> from<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.910> time<00:02:33.150> period

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
it showed that those from a time period

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.020 
it showed that those from a time period
where<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.560> were<00:02:34.620> moving<00:02:35.010> into<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.640> castle

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
where they were moving into the castle

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.750 
where they were moving into the castle
and<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.180> castle<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.540> being<00:02:36.780> built<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.760> I

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
and the castle is being built and I

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.520 
and the castle is being built and I
think<00:02:39.360> they're<00:02:39.480> just<00:02:39.510> being<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.080> much<00:02:40.200> fun<00:02:40.410> to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
think they're just being so much fun to

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.950 
think they're just being so much fun to
learn<00:02:40.680> more<00:02:40.980> about<00:02:41.040> them<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:42.000> characters<00:02:42.540> not

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
learn more about them as characters not

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.050 
learn more about them as characters not
just<00:02:43.200> as<00:02:43.320> these<00:02:43.500> omnipotent<00:02:44.040> beings<00:02:44.850> they

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
just as these omnipotent beings they

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.780 
just as these omnipotent beings they
just<00:02:45.240> happen<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.540> rule<00:02:45.960> over<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.560> place<00:02:46.830> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
just happen to rule over this place so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.360 
just happen to rule over this place so
yeah<00:02:48.210> I<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.660> like<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.470> see<00:02:49.620> their<00:02:49.800> past<00:02:50.040> and
