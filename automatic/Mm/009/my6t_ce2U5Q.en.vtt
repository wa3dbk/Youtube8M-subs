placement of immediate implant so our
crown<00:00:57.930> comes<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:59.000> let's<00:01:00.000> take<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.449> at<00:01:00.510> the

crown comes off let's take a look at the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.650 
crown comes off let's take a look at the
cat<00:01:00.780> scan<00:01:00.960> again<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:02.520> ikat<00:01:02.879> image<00:01:03.239> gives<00:01:03.480> us

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
cat scan again the ikat image gives us

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
cat scan again the ikat image gives us
so<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:03.989> information<00:01:04.070> with<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> make

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so much information with which to make

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.070 
so much information with which to make
this<00:01:05.760> diagnosis<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> wonderful

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
this diagnosis and is a wonderful

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
this diagnosis and is a wonderful
teaching<00:01:07.290> aid<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.430> can<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
teaching aid as you can see we have a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.140 
teaching aid as you can see we have a
fairly<00:01:09.360> thick<00:01:09.750> alveolar<00:01:10.710> wall<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.880> area

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
fairly thick alveolar wall and the area

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.580 
fairly thick alveolar wall and the area
the<00:01:12.270> cuspid<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.930> should<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.320> good

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the cuspid so we should have good

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.620 
the cuspid so we should have good
thickness<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> bone<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.360> can<00:01:15.479> see

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
thickness for the bone and you can see

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.039 
thickness for the bone and you can see
we<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.930> palliative<00:01:16.560> bone<00:01:16.710> palatal<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
take a look at the x-ray now and get a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
take a look at the x-ray now and get a
pre-op<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.759> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
pre-op of what we're going to do as you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
pre-op of what we're going to do as you
can<00:01:30.299> see<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> monitor<00:01:31.170> we've<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.710> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
can see on the monitor we've put a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
can see on the monitor we've put a
little<00:01:31.950> schematic<00:01:32.220> index<00:01:32.820> implant<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:34.200> the

little schematic index implant over the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
little schematic index implant over the
x-ray<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.009> shows<00:01:35.250> us<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.640> again<00:01:35.939> we're

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
x-ray here to shows us that again we're

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.300 
x-ray here to shows us that again we're
probably<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.020> react<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.439> late<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
probably going to react you late this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
probably going to react you late this
implant<00:01:38.850> when<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.240> take<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.600> number<00:01:39.900> 11<00:01:40.229> 11

a fracture or the post out and the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.319 
a fracture or the post out and the
decision<00:01:46.290> now<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.040> an<00:01:47.640> implant

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
decision now is to go to an implant

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
decision now is to go to an implant
restoration<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.860> will<00:01:50.009> see<00:01:50.220> later<00:01:50.430> she

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
restoration as you will see later she

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.780 
restoration as you will see later she
actually<00:01:51.000> has<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> very<00:01:51.600> large<00:01:51.810> implant<00:01:52.560> Rick

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
actually has a very large implant Rick

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.100 
actually has a very large implant Rick
reconstruction<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.000> upper<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.689> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
reconstruction on the upper right and so

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
reconstruction on the upper right and so
she's<00:01:55.350> done<00:01:55.560> well<00:01:55.799> has<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.280> historical

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
she's done well has a good historical

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.139 
she's done well has a good historical
record<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.509> implant<00:01:57.930> therapy<00:01:58.820> as<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> can

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
record with implant therapy as you can

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.020 
record with implant therapy as you can
see<00:02:00.329> again<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.290> need<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> re<00:02:02.100> angulate<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
see again the need to re angulate the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.149 
see again the need to re angulate the
implant<00:02:03.479> through<00:02:03.810> past<00:02:04.320> extraction<00:02:04.979> site

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
implant through past extraction site

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.429 
implant through past extraction site
it's<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> pretty<00:02:05.939> common<00:02:06.360> effect<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:07.290> you're

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it's a pretty common effect when you're

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.770 
it's a pretty common effect when you're
placing<00:02:07.680> these<00:02:07.950> anterior<00:02:08.459> implants<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.479> let's

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
placing these anterior implants so let's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.540 
placing these anterior implants so let's
get<00:02:09.959> started<00:02:10.110> with<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.679> we're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
get started with that we're going to be

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.920 
get started with that we're going to be
taken<00:02:11.879> out<00:02:12.000> number

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
taken out number

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.009 
taken out number
let's<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.829> that<00:02:14.010> larger<00:02:14.189> tractor<00:02:14.730> farming<00:02:15.120> do

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
let's get that larger tractor farming do

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.869 
let's get that larger tractor farming do
you<00:02:16.109> have<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.500> okay<00:02:17.250> we'll<00:02:17.400> go<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.579> Minnesota

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
you have that okay we'll go to Minnesota

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.160 
you have that okay we'll go to Minnesota
right<00:02:18.390> now<00:02:21.799> and<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:24.420> those<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.780> would<00:02:24.959> just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
right now and for those you would just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.259 
right now and for those you would just
begin<00:02:25.319> your<00:02:25.590> surgical<00:02:25.950> career<00:02:26.430> if<00:02:26.640> you're

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
begin your surgical career if you're

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.880 
begin your surgical career if you're
just<00:02:27.390> starting<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.409> important<00:02:28.829> to

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
just starting that it is important to

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.619 
just starting that it is important to
start<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.250> learn<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.579> use<00:02:29.730> retractors<00:02:30.389> rather

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
start to learn to use retractors rather

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.170 
start to learn to use retractors rather
than<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:31.049> fingers<00:02:31.489> it's<00:02:32.489> always<00:02:32.670> easy<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
than your fingers it's always easy to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.240 
than your fingers it's always easy to
perhaps<00:02:33.569> give<00:02:34.079> what<00:02:34.290> God<00:02:34.469> gave<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:34.709> us<00:02:34.920> first

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
perhaps give what God gave to us first

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.879 
perhaps give what God gave to us first
but<00:02:36.000> you'll<00:02:36.239> find<00:02:36.540> over<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.170> years<00:02:37.379> it's<00:02:37.650> much

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
but you'll find over the years it's much

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.440 
but you'll find over the years it's much
better<00:02:38.159> to<00:02:38.310> go<00:02:38.579> ahead<00:02:38.819> and<00:02:39.000> learn<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.269> use

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
better to go ahead and learn to use

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.440 
better to go ahead and learn to use
these<00:02:39.689> instruments<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:41.239> one<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> best

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
pinching as we normally would so we're

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.770 
pinching as we normally would so we're
going<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.430> talking<00:03:20.579> about<00:03:20.790> number<00:03:21.209> 11<00:03:21.599> here

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
going to be talking about number 11 here

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.909

and this is going to be coming out and

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.699 
and this is going to be coming out and
again<00:03:23.400> we're<00:03:23.579> going<00:03:23.729> to<00:03:23.849> do<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.709> typical

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
again we're going to do a typical

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.920 
again we're going to do a typical
periosteal<00:03:26.370> release<00:03:26.909> and<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.479> if<00:03:27.569> we<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:27.810> get

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
periosteal release and see if we can get

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.159 
periosteal release and see if we can get
this<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.290> elevate<00:03:28.799> out<00:03:28.919> very<00:03:29.189> easily<00:03:30.049> if<00:03:31.049> you

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
this to elevate out very easily if you

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.869 
this to elevate out very easily if you
look<00:03:31.290> very<00:03:31.349> closely<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.280> might<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.639> able<00:03:32.699> to

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
look very closely you might be able to

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.170 
look very closely you might be able to
see<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.829> little<00:03:34.829> scar<00:03:35.099> tissue<00:03:35.430> up<00:03:35.609> here<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:36.000> she

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
see a little scar tissue up here for she

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.670 
see a little scar tissue up here for she
had<00:03:36.329> previous<00:03:36.810> work<00:03:36.959> done<00:03:37.169> up<00:03:37.319> here<00:03:37.379> if<00:03:37.620> you

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
had previous work done up here if you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
had previous work done up here if you
look<00:03:37.829> very<00:03:37.859> closely<00:03:38.250> there's<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.150> little

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
look very closely there's just a little

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.689 
look very closely there's just a little
bit<00:03:39.659> of<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.840> scar<00:03:40.229> band<00:03:40.439> connective<00:03:41.280> tissue<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
bit of a scar band connective tissue so

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.399 
bit of a scar band connective tissue so
what<00:03:41.849> we<00:03:41.939> need<00:03:42.060> to<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.209> careful<00:03:42.449> if<00:03:42.959> we<00:03:43.169> need<00:03:43.319> to

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
what we need to be careful if we need to

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.530 
what we need to be careful if we need to
raise<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> flap<00:03:43.919> here<00:03:44.189> this<00:03:44.790> might<00:03:45.180> give<00:03:45.419> us

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
raise a flap here this might give us
