00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.939
 hello together today I want you 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.939
 a breakfast time 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:20.160
 for the breakfast you need urgently 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:26.090
 a little fruit and an apple one 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.090
 berry a banana orange a bit 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.470
 lime juice 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:35.660
 I have now but you do not have to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.860
 still make walnut kernels and coat 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:45.570
 I'll take care of that and as well 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.090
 First let's take the flights 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.490
 I stephan so very practical apple 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.140
 because he comes up with stale and concepts 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.840
 on 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:06.689
 So there is the apple only once 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.119
 gutted then comes completely in the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.390
 head in 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:14.040
 the banana the chance of course how 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.659
 should not be mature, of course 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.649
 No more green at the pear 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:30.090
 she does not have such a big housing 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:33.060
 The city â€‹â€‹of Aachen by and remove 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.119
 then there's just that little housing 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.859
 That is not really much as I said 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.569
 otherwise you have to actually 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.170
 does not continue to snow or is now 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:42.170
 still very firm 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:57.869
 and that would be the pear the strunk 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.590
 of course also cut off the top 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590
 study agreement 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:14.770
 the orange I have from the of the 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:18.400
 Plastic kitchen utensils manufacturer 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.320
 will start with tea will get an orange 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.920
 the front are such a cutting edge and 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.690
 behind but spatel there can 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.460
 Just now with these with this one 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 But cut the bowl so left 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:37.930
 cut in like that and can you then with 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.970
 with the other side with the asparagus 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.350
 easily peel off 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.910
 I think that's very convenient because 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.490
 then you have the whole despite not 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.050
 always under the fingernails hang that 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.450
 is not always so nice 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.260
 if you have peeled those then 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.000
 you just halve that's enough 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.260
 actually already up here this thick 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.260
 that's the problem 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:19.480
 and now not much is added 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:20.560
 So a splash first splash 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.340
 lemon juice 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.790
 come now that could vary 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:31.810
 I do not want us to be that fat 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.180
 have come now 50 grams already the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.280
 or 30 are enough for me 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.300
 differently 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.440
 15 30 30 grams of oatmeal from 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.550
 the true core 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.930
 I do not have that yet 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.120
 done that today, for the first time since 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:55.150
 namely as 12 help and almonds the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:59.260
 me three pieces and the whole is now 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.500
 still poured with water and indeed 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:10.660
 come now 200 gram happiest 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:13.080
 cold water 200 came that was enough in the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.080
 usually off 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.330
 now it is 220 but it is coming 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.370
 not on it 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.040
 and that usually gives two glasses 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.890
 full 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:42.950
 I'll pull that off in the morning 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.810
 always purely built thereby directly to the 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.630
 Fruit what should eat in our day about 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.810
 one has to look directly then intus so that 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.460
 Now I'll have shorter ones 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.720
 tried times but I would always 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.630
 to make a minute and therefore 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.410
 really really small a minute on 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.410
 level 10 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.480
 so that's really nice now 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.480
 small 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.010
 that's what you can see 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.450
 Of course, I had already in 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.210
 another video also shown 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.970
 An answer is salad or something 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:25.460
 make it clean and that we are so in now 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:27.860
 of course the consistency is of course now 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:33.620
 still very viscous, of course 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:37.370
 already say that is now 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.350
 do not know what you grow up so down 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.690
 So I can still press 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.150
 this cao cao reflex then it because it 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:50.750
 but still really fluid 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:55.210
 Now I'll try cheers 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.210
 delicious very nice and frosty 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.510
 Of course the oranges are also good 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.480
 I can only recommend it to you out there 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.550
 really such a satisfactor when i am 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.980
 then in the morning these two glasses 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.340
 That's about enough to drink 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.080
 at noon to 12.13 o'clock good depending on 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.169
 But yesterday I drink up to 13 o'clock 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.490
 It is definitely out and me 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.710
 find it a good alternative to his 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:28.480
 normal breakfast and I hope he 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.330
 makes the time to try the times of 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.290
 and see you again in the next video 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.290
 bye bye
