so<00:02:01.829> great<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.280> them<00:02:02.570> but<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:03.780> again<00:02:03.810> hardly

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
so great for them but then again hardly

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.950 
so great for them but then again hardly

were kind of proving the whole Pirates
code<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.880> really<00:02:28.330> more<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.110> a<00:02:29.200> guideline<00:02:29.410> but

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
code is really more of a guideline but

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.150 
code is really more of a guideline but
nevertheless<00:02:30.280> he<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.810> guess<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.920> he

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
nevertheless he was I guess because he

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.830 
nevertheless he was I guess because he
was<00:02:33.340> somewhat<00:02:33.880> friendly<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.300> Davos<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.750> was

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.440 
time also could have used him as means
to<00:06:24.950> get<00:06:25.280> a<00:06:25.340> lot<00:06:25.730> of<00:06:25.760> favor<00:06:26.180> with<00:06:26.330> the<00:06:26.840> throne

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
to get a lot of favor with the throne

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.390 
to get a lot of favor with the throne
but<00:06:29.890> throughout<00:06:30.890> the<00:06:31.040> course<00:06:31.250> the

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
but throughout the course the

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.910 
but throughout the course the
conversation<00:06:32.200> decided<00:06:33.200> not<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.830> so

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920 
conversation decided not to and so

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.250 
conversation decided not to and so
though<00:06:34.100> he<00:06:34.220> did<00:06:34.430> not<00:06:34.460> side<00:06:34.850> with<00:06:34.880> Ned<00:06:35.330> he<00:06:36.110> also

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
though he did not side with Ned he also

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.660 
though he did not side with Ned he also
didn't<00:06:36.710> sell<00:06:36.920> him<00:06:37.040> out<00:06:37.190> either<00:06:37.370> that<00:06:37.610> he

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
didn't sell him out either that he

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.610 
didn't sell him out either that he
basically<00:06:37.790> just<00:06:38.090> said<00:06:38.270> you<00:06:38.960> were<00:06:38.990> never<00:06:39.290> here

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620 
basically just said you were never here

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.340 
basically just said you were never here
and<00:06:40.390> that's<00:06:41.390> that's<00:06:41.600> work<00:06:41.810> ends<00:06:42.080> in<00:06:42.230> this

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:42.350 
and that's that's work ends in this

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.620 
and that's that's work ends in this
chapter<00:06:42.560> 2<00:06:42.800> that<00:06:43.040> davalos<00:06:44.000> kind<00:06:44.210> of<00:06:44.270> says<00:06:44.420> as

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
chapter 2 that davalos kind of says as

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.760 
chapter 2 that davalos kind of says as
just<00:06:45.410> like<00:06:45.530> me<00:06:45.710> I<00:06:45.860> was<00:06:46.190> never<00:06:46.370> here<00:06:46.490> so<00:06:47.620> we<00:06:48.620> get

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
just like me I was never here so we get

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.990 
just like me I was never here so we get
a<00:06:48.800> little<00:06:48.920> bit<00:06:49.130> of<00:06:49.190> information<00:06:49.400> about<00:06:49.850> this

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
a little bit of information about this

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.310 
a little bit of information about this
chapter<00:06:50.300> we<00:06:50.420> find<00:06:50.660> that<00:06:50.720> a<00:06:50.840> little<00:06:50.990> bit<00:06:51.110> more

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
chapter we find that a little bit more

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.530 
chapter we find that a little bit more
about<00:06:51.530> what<00:06:51.590> Dallas<00:06:52.400> is<00:06:52.550> up<00:06:53.000> to<00:06:53.180> and<00:06:53.210> what's

about what Dallas is up to and what's
going<00:06:53.780> on<00:06:53.870> with<00:06:53.930> him<00:06:54.170> and<00:06:54.380> that's<00:06:54.530> cool

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
going on with him and that's cool

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.170 
going on with him and that's cool
because<00:06:54.770> we<00:06:54.950> like<00:06:55.100> Dallas<00:06:55.490> Dallas<00:06:55.640> is<00:06:55.940> a<00:06:55.970> good

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
TV show as well I think they actually

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.840 
TV show as well I think they actually
nailed<00:07:02.180> him<00:07:02.390> pretty<00:07:02.660> good<00:07:03.250> we<00:07:04.250> like<00:07:04.430> Dallas

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
that story is going to go and what's

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.330 
that story is going to go and what's

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
going to happen with him probably not as

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.070 
going to happen with him probably not as
much<00:07:10.490> as<00:07:10.550> the<00:07:11.000> main<00:07:11.210> characters<00:07:11.930> but

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
much as the main characters but

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.970 
much as the main characters but
nevertheless<00:07:12.380> this<00:07:12.740> seems<00:07:12.980> interesting<00:07:14.980> he's

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:15.980 
nevertheless this seems interesting he's

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.210 
nevertheless this seems interesting he's
going<00:07:16.250> to<00:07:16.370> go<00:07:16.490> talk<00:07:16.700> to<00:07:16.730> his<00:07:17.000> is<00:07:18.040> hook<00:07:19.040> it<00:07:19.130> up

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
going to go talk to his is hook it up

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.740 
going to go talk to his is hook it up
with<00:07:19.310> a<00:07:19.370> phrase<00:07:19.610> and<00:07:19.850> we<00:07:20.120> all<00:07:20.240> want<00:07:20.390> to<00:07:20.420> see<00:07:20.570> bad

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
with a phrase and we all want to see bad

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.640 
with a phrase and we all want to see bad
things<00:07:20.780> happen<00:07:21.260> to<00:07:21.290> the<00:07:21.410> phrase<00:07:22.270> we<00:07:23.270> do<00:07:23.650> so

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:24.650 
things happen to the phrase we do so

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.500

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
hopefully you know that's how that will

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.380 
hopefully you know that's how that will
end<00:07:26.720> I<00:07:26.990> guess<00:07:27.680> we'll<00:07:27.860> see<00:07:28.010> but<00:07:28.520> that's<00:07:29.090> all<00:07:29.240> we

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.390 
end I guess we'll see but that's all we

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.790 
end I guess we'll see but that's all we
have<00:07:29.510> for<00:07:29.540> this<00:07:29.750> chapter<00:07:30.170> as<00:07:30.350> I<00:07:30.470> said<00:07:30.650> there's

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 
have for this chapter as I said there's

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.260 
have for this chapter as I said there's
not<00:07:30.950> a<00:07:30.980> whole<00:07:31.160> lot<00:07:31.220> of<00:07:31.370> content<00:07:31.790> and<00:07:31.940> it<00:07:32.180> was

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
not a whole lot of content and it was

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.610 
not a whole lot of content and it was
basically<00:07:32.450> just<00:07:32.630> catching<00:07:33.080> up<00:07:33.230> on<00:07:33.410> what's

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
