gonna get to our experiment here let's
take<00:00:43.860> our<00:00:44.070> snow<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.879> we're<00:00:45.090> pour<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.510> two

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
take our snow and we're pour it in two

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.150 
take our snow and we're pour it in two
little<00:00:46.610> beads<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.850> water<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.890> right<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:49.920> our

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
little beads of water here right on our

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.580 
little beads of water here right on our
piece<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> plastic<00:00:51.079> alright<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.500> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
piece of plastic alright so what you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
piece of plastic alright so what you
want<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.770> look<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.030> angle<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> bead

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
want to look at is the angle of the bead

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.630 
want to look at is the angle of the bead
okay<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:55.739> we're<00:00:55.890> trying<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.430> with

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
okay and what we're trying to do with

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299 
okay and what we're trying to do with
our<00:00:56.670> wax<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.359> cut<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.140> angle<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
our wax is cut that angle down so it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
our wax is cut that angle down so it's
nice<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> flat<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> smooth<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.809> when

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
nice and flat and smooth because when

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.150 
nice and flat and smooth because when
you're<00:01:01.109> going<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.410> your<00:01:01.559> snowboard<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.070> your

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
you're going on your snowboard of your

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.490 
you're going on your snowboard of your
skis<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.910> hitting<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> angle<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.199> it's

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
skis you're hitting that angle and it's

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
skis you're hitting that angle and it's
slowing<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.399> what<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.390> doing<00:01:06.420> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
slowing you down and what we're doing is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.930 
slowing you down and what we're doing is
by<00:01:07.020> putting<00:01:07.320> wax<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.860> our<00:01:07.979> board<00:01:08.190> it's<00:01:08.729> going

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
by putting wax on our board it's going

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.969 
by putting wax on our board it's going
to<00:01:09.000> hit<00:01:09.209> that<00:01:09.479> cut<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.259> angle<00:01:10.530> down<00:01:10.709> and

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to hit that cut the angle down and

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.410 
to hit that cut the angle down and
you're<00:01:11.099> going<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.429> writing<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.000> nice<00:01:12.179> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
you're going to be writing it's nice and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.419 
you're going to be writing it's nice and
smooth<00:01:12.660> even<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> flats<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.160> let's<00:01:14.310> take

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
smooth even on the flats so let's take

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.609 
smooth even on the flats so let's take
our<00:01:14.580> surfactant<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.959> on<00:01:16.050> the<00:01:16.289> top<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
our surfactant and put on the top of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.210 
our surfactant and put on the top of
these<00:01:16.709> beads<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> take<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> little<00:01:20.039> bit

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
these beads here so take a little bit

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.990 
these beads here so take a little bit
affect<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.890> put<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.160> on<00:01:23.369> top<00:01:23.399> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
affect it put it right on top and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.120 
affect it put it right on top and
immediately<00:01:24.959> as<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.229> hits<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.560> top<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.039> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
immediately as it hits the top of that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
immediately as it hits the top of that
water<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:27.090> already<00:01:27.420> spreading<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
water it's already spreading it out it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
water it's already spreading it out it
changes<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.099> angle<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.550> bead<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:29.940> changing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
changes the angle of bead it's changing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
changes the angle of bead it's changing
the<00:01:30.569> water<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.800> round<00:01:32.700> convex<00:01:33.390> shape

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the water from that round convex shape

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.190 
the water from that round convex shape
into<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> flat<00:01:35.429> smooth<00:01:35.880> shape<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:36.989> rub

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
into a flat smooth shape and we just rub

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
into a flat smooth shape and we just rub
it<00:01:37.319> around<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.910> going<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.300> doesn't

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
it around and it's just going it doesn't

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
it around and it's just going it doesn't
go<00:01:39.660> back<00:01:39.840> together<00:01:40.020> doesn't<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.709> that<00:01:40.860> angle

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
go back together doesn't make that angle

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.830
