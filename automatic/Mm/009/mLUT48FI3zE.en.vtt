to<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.530> country<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.920> didn't<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

to the country I didn't know the
language<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:48.059> well<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.610> took<00:00:50.789> me<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
language very well so it took me a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.430 
language very well so it took me a
couple<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.360> years<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.780> acquainted<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
couple of years to get acquainted and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.290 
couple of years to get acquainted and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
then I think I really i clearly remember

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.389 
then I think I really i clearly remember
maybe<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:58.260> when<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

what may I was like twelve twelve years
old<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.960> 13<00:01:01.289> years<00:01:01.320> old<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.699> woke<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.149> one
