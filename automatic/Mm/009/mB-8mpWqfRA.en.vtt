session<00:00:09.980> now<00:00:10.980> when<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.250> say<00:00:11.429> I'm<00:00:11.550> destroying<00:00:11.969> my

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
session now when I say I'm destroying my

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.270 
session now when I say I'm destroying my
back<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.570> mean<00:00:12.870> in<00:00:13.170> this<00:00:13.320> pull<00:00:13.590> session<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.070> think

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
back I mean in this pull session I think

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.580 
back I mean in this pull session I think
I<00:00:14.519> did<00:00:14.700> upwards<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.330> twenty<00:00:15.750> six<00:00:16.049> sets<00:00:16.379> between

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
I did upwards of twenty six sets between

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.340 
I did upwards of twenty six sets between
my<00:00:16.980> back<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.550> biceps<00:00:18.000> for<00:00:18.300> me<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> natural

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
my back and biceps for me for a natural

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
my back and biceps for me for a natural
that's<00:00:19.949> quite<00:00:20.369> high<00:00:20.580> trying<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.029> push<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
that's quite high trying to push it a

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.300 
that's quite high trying to push it a
little<00:00:22.170> bit<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.560> keeping<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> weight

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
little bit here keeping the weight

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.009 
little bit here keeping the weight
moderate<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> volume<00:00:24.600> high<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.990> course

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
moderate but the volume high of course

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.140 
moderate but the volume high of course
if<00:00:25.439> you're<00:00:25.920> doing<00:00:26.070> more<00:00:26.250> volume<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> got<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
if you're doing more volume you got to

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.609 
if you're doing more volume you got to
lower<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.449> intensity<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> weight<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.500> you

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
lower the intensity the weight that you

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.009 
lower the intensity the weight that you
can<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.820> won't<00:00:30.000> see<00:00:30.210> me<00:00:30.359> grind<00:00:30.779> out

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
can use and you won't see me grind out

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.590 
can use and you won't see me grind out
really<00:00:31.289> any<00:00:31.590> reps<00:00:32.450> partially<00:00:33.450> because

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
really any reps partially because

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
really any reps partially because
training<00:00:34.200> six<00:00:34.469> times<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.950> week<00:00:35.329> you<00:00:36.329> know<00:00:36.480> if

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
training six times a week you know if

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.619 
training six times a week you know if
you<00:00:37.230> pursue<00:00:37.620> failure<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> set<00:00:38.850> that's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you pursue failure on a set that's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
you pursue failure on a set that's
really<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.379> impair<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.100> recovery

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
really gonna impair your recovery

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.830 
really gonna impair your recovery

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
especially when you're training with

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.110 
especially when you're training with
such<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> high<00:00:43.530> volume<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.700> instead<00:00:44.910> what

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
such a high volume so instead what

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430 
such a high volume so instead what
you're<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.750> when<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> say<00:00:46.110> destroy

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
you're going to see when I say destroy

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.500 
you're going to see when I say destroy

I'm saying all kinds of soreness because

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.110 
I'm saying all kinds of soreness because
of<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.780> volume<00:00:58.520> people<00:00:59.520> say<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.820> know

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of that volume people say you know

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 
of that volume people say you know
everybody<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> bodybuilder<00:01:01.620> or

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
everybody want to be a bodybuilder or

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
everybody want to be a bodybuilder or
they<00:01:02.039> want<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.399> aesthetic<00:01:02.879> but<00:01:03.000> they

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
they want to get aesthetic but they

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.910 
they want to get aesthetic but they
don't<00:01:03.329> want<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.690> put<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.110> time<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.710> truth

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
don't want to put in that time the truth

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
don't want to put in that time the truth
is<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.580> natural<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.390> gonna<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.290> long

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
is as a natural that's gonna take a long

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.710 
is as a natural that's gonna take a long
while<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> see<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> lot<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.330> training

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
while so you see a lot of training

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
while so you see a lot of training
sessions<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.650> where<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> look

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
sessions like this where I look

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
sessions like this where I look
relatively<00:01:11.820> similar<00:01:12.000> maybe<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.750> bit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
relatively similar maybe a little bit

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.690 
relatively similar maybe a little bit
gains<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.560> certainly<00:01:14.100> doing<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> seal

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
gains I think certainly doing the seal

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.580 
gains I think certainly doing the seal

does he does it completely flat to get a

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
does he does it completely flat to get a
better<00:01:23.270> contraction<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:24.840> itself

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
better contraction in the back itself

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
better contraction in the back itself
I'm<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> huge<00:01:26.100> fan<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.340> chess<00:01:26.729> supported<00:01:27.299> rows

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
I'm a huge fan of chess supported rows

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749 
I'm a huge fan of chess supported rows
in<00:01:27.720> order<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.049> properly<00:01:28.439> target<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.520> back

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
in order to properly target your back

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.450 
in order to properly target your back
not<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.390> momentum<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.590> often<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.100> case<00:01:32.250> on

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
not use momentum as is often the case on

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.190 
not use momentum as is often the case on
something<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> bent-over<00:01:33.270> row<00:01:33.540> but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
something like the bent-over row but

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
something like the bent-over row but
back<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.680> saying<00:01:35.450> everybody

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
back to what I was saying everybody

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.350 
back to what I was saying everybody
wanna<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:37.049> aesthetic<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.250> takes<00:01:38.700> time<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
wanna be aesthetic it takes time and

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.429 
wanna be aesthetic it takes time and
