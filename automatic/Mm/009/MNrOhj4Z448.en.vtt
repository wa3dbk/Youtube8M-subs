usually comes with some trade-offs and

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.909 
usually comes with some trade-offs and
it's<00:00:27.539> true<00:00:27.839> that<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.199> evo<00:00:28.439> shift<00:00:28.470> doesn't

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:28.919 
it's true that the evo shift doesn't

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.589 
it's true that the evo shift doesn't
have<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> couple<00:00:29.579> of<00:00:29.669> the<00:00:29.789> higher-end<00:00:29.999> features

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
have a couple of the higher-end features

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.500 
have a couple of the higher-end features
but<00:00:31.229> it<00:00:31.349> still<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.829> lot<00:00:32.040> going<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.699> I'm

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
but it still got a lot going for it I'm

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.599 
but it still got a lot going for it I'm
going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> start<00:00:33.899> with<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> design<00:00:34.469> first<00:00:34.769> the

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
going to start with the design first the

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.549 
going to start with the design first the
evo<00:00:35.940> shift<00:00:35.969> has<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.719> similarities<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
evo shift has some similarities to the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.819 
evo shift has some similarities to the
HTC<00:00:38.039> evo<00:00:38.550> 4g<00:00:38.809> like<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.960> four<00:00:40.140> touch<00:00:40.379> sensitive

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
HTC evo 4g like the four touch sensitive

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.250 
HTC evo 4g like the four touch sensitive
buttons<00:00:40.890> below<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.730> display<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.929> it's<00:00:43.079> more

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
buttons below the display but it's more

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.349 
buttons below the display but it's more
compact<00:00:43.769> device<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.429> also<00:00:44.789> has<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:44.999> slide-out

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
compact device and also has a slide-out

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.750 
compact device and also has a slide-out
qwerty<00:00:45.839> keyboard<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.530> know<00:00:47.070> style<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> a

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
qwerty keyboard I know style is a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.250 
qwerty keyboard I know style is a
personal<00:00:48.179> thing<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> happen<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.109> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
personal thing but I happen to like the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.259 
personal thing but I happen to like the
smaller<00:00:49.530> form<00:00:49.859> factor<00:00:49.920> even<00:00:50.519> though<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.089> means

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
smaller form factor even though it means

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.750 
smaller form factor even though it means
you<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.929> smaller<00:00:52.289> display<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you get a smaller display the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
you get a smaller display the
touchscreen<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> still<00:00:54.719> sharp<00:00:54.929> and<00:00:55.170> bright<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
touchscreen is still sharp and bright so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.739 
touchscreen is still sharp and bright so
that<00:00:55.710> fact<00:00:55.980> wasn't<00:00:56.429> a<00:00:56.519> huge<00:00:56.820> issue<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.179> me<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
that fact wasn't a huge issue for me I

00:00:57.749 --> 00:00:59.599 
that fact wasn't a huge issue for me I
also<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> phone<00:00:59.159> has<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.339> very

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
also like that the phone has a very

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.579 
also like that the phone has a very
solid<00:00:59.999> premium<00:01:00.449> feel<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:00.989> unlike<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
solid premium feel to it unlike the

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.070 
solid premium feel to it unlike the
samsung<00:01:01.980> epic<00:01:02.339> 4g<00:01:02.370> which<00:01:03.120> felt<00:01:03.359> plasticky<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
samsung epic 4g which felt plasticky and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
samsung epic 4g which felt plasticky and
slick<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> say<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> epic<00:01:06.149> 4g

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
slick I do have to say that the epic 4g

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
slick I do have to say that the epic 4g
still<00:01:06.810> has<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.079> better<00:01:07.200> keyboard<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
still has the better keyboard but the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
still has the better keyboard but the
evo<00:01:08.369> shift<00:01:08.399> isn't<00:01:08.880> bad<00:01:09.299> either<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.259> buttons

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
evo shift isn't bad either the buttons

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710 
evo shift isn't bad either the buttons
are<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.979> smaller<00:01:11.399> and<00:01:11.670> flattered<00:01:12.060> but

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
are bit smaller and flattered but

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.600 
are bit smaller and flattered but
there's<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.439> decent<00:01:13.649> amount<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.189> space<00:01:14.399> between

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
there's a decent amount of space between

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190 
there's a decent amount of space between
them<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.270> didn't<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.509> too<00:01:15.780> many<00:01:15.899> miss

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
them so I didn't have too many miss

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
them so I didn't have too many miss
presses<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.310> d-pad<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> lower

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
presses the d-pad here on the lower

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
presses the d-pad here on the lower
right<00:01:18.750> side<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.290> also<00:01:19.619> small<00:01:19.680> enough<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
right side is also small enough so that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
right side is also small enough so that
it<00:01:20.790> doesn't<00:01:21.149> make<00:01:21.329> it<00:01:21.390> awkward<00:01:21.719> to<00:01:21.960> use<00:01:22.079> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it doesn't make it awkward to use the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
it doesn't make it awkward to use the
keyboard<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.969> going<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
keyboard so in going back to the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
keyboard so in going back to the
features<00:01:25.290> I'll<00:01:25.590> start<00:01:25.950> with<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.280> you're<00:01:26.460> not
