00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.159
 hello guys ricardo oak again here with a 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.730
 but a video on the connection of scavengers 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.730
 is that they using a bite ring again 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.570
 and the soles be the threads here that are when the patterns nanda being sent 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.119
 every smile mark 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.380
 things and that the bosses 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.110
 and here we go 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.430
 we call next to the world of crime is the taster 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.000
 new moon 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.460
 parallel hees that the connection 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.880
 who has caused 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.420
 in the key here 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.050
 which in the case here is a potentiometer composure 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.910
 I want him to publish the book pucci 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.350
 is the keys to the own key in the actual text of the button itself if 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.410
 positioning it 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.770
 you will activate and deactivate or parallel series coalition 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 can also be used in a separate room 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 in the case here the question is that we are seeing 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 here one 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.030
 a potentiometer 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.340
 already with 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.960
 like cup 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.500
 This is your part. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.660
 so now that it represents the key 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.660
 the potential subway that in this part here 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770
 then accompanying here the reasoning that in the case here damages 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.160
 setting I did not 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.490
 see one 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.930
 and the cpi 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 when the mystery is over to see 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 here we can do the following and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.100
 remembering here north-south to north up only down 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.090
 of the arms 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.050
 As I said the other day. 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.910
 so those who have not seen can take a look at the video before this 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 it lasted little 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.010
 here I will be following the opera that the cable 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.350
 need 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.720
 piquet in fact and it is 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.060
 it's a hardcover cable 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.420
 and he sees soldier here doing all the grounding part are probing the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.489
 carcass of potentiou meters 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.489
 there from the positioning with the pass here to the cable 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.319
 is this black cable 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.099
 which is 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.840
 o okay something going for it 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.469
 the bridge or lever 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 the ground cable enters if you rely on the ropes 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.119
 angry low 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.930
 OK 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.419
 then I continue in the land that moves 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.489
 welded protectionism with another cable that 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:37.829
 we will 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 walk here 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.039
 like the day here 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.339
 so I was here he was hooked aquino 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:50.649
 in day 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.809
 becker was that pomp of the director would do is ol 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:56.579
 ocde land 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.939
 now at the other end I live 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.059
 of the fair 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:02.409
 We will be back 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.409
 here to the middle of the potential subway 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 that visualizing the best positioning 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.939
 we come back through the potential etc. 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.509
 I have decided that this part will now stop. 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.659
 next to 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.419
 the other end 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.669
 Dear 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:25.289
 positioned 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:28.639
 iwaki soldiers he comes 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.040
 it turns on 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.040
 here at the key is not just the tip of the key 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.299
 with the concave 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.829
 brito 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:37.979
 the black that né 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.949
 I foresee that the price of the taster 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.469
 so we have another step 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.469
 now picking up the green cape here 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.269
 it's less we call this disappointed one 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.329
 in the key 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.849
 I'm from here from here, let's found another wire to the earth. 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.069
 the casting of potential 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:00.019
 with that completed 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.330
 the movie was the best 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.629
 the building 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.749
 well to be tip of the key 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.199
 soldier here 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.129
 Finished red here 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.259
 now we go to the air the houaiss in work koné the white flu 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.970
 nor to the middle of the quinas that points soldier here 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.079
 and here is a front not 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.079
 an interconnection here of the other 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.400
 together here with the white 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 for this other part the key fall 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.970
 This part here in white that is nothing has nothing left. 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.809
 connected to it 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.349
 let's go here it was 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.029
 make some conclusions at which the price pointed potentiometer 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.800
 was folded 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.529
 and ex-soldier here in the married house 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:48.939
 who else 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.400
 so not only there 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.970
 So simple, just follow this graphic here. 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.770
 the people 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.249
 got wrong 

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:59.680
 connection and 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.779
 in parallel series is this parallel there that what can be done 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.150
 tinga come in you will change 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.499
 in case 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.689
 the coils will work it's in parallel series they'll go 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:13.559
 account linked 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.360
 the name says everything right 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.930
 volpon in series 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.889
 is a coil and series with the other or an omini parallel with the other 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.289
 this will get you the modal sound will have a different team 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.430
 maybe for some type not only what you're doing 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.659
 in some moments be interesting 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.289
 is to make that change do 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.010
 this is the fourth type of quality 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.669
 which I combined with a single pedals coast using in the stones effect 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.990
 so or even neat, right? 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.809
 can be a characteristic and more 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.809
 interesting larger 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.219
 in which a personality is placed 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.279
 in your solo show sound in the bashir itself 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.090
 so it's a matter of experience and enjoyed the experience 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.350
 Natalie, you have to put 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.419
 do 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.919
 and see what happens if it pleases me to know how to use 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:13.589
 Sometimes they do it sometimes. 

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:14.970
 if you use 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.259
 very brief times what else works 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.860
 you put 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.240
 is one with one of the very large agencies of one of a team that is 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.190
 it's very different then sometimes it's just there it will depend a lot on the person of 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.619
 good taste 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.779
 to know how to use 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.729
 That's it in 12 months. 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.639
 prevails new and used home sales in all my dad tips 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:42.050
 a hug to you business
