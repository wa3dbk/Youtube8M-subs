this<00:01:04.890> board<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.339> 27<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:07.170> got<00:01:07.470> double<00:01:07.950> wedges

so<00:01:08.630> it's<00:01:09.630> really<00:01:09.930> good<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.280> Rails<00:01:11.280> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
so it's really good on Rails and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.010 
so it's really good on Rails and
groomers<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.689> especially<00:01:13.380> good<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.740> carving

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
groomers and especially good for carving

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020 
groomers and especially good for carving
it's<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.590> these<00:01:16.890> edge<00:01:17.220> protect<00:01:17.820> your

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's not like these edge protect your

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.940 
it's not like these edge protect your
metal<00:01:18.619> strips<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.860> there<00:01:20.130> -<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:20.970> cool<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
metal strips right there - really cool I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.820
