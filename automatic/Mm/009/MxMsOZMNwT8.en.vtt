00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
enjoyed it Billy had a green familiar
the<00:01:14.820> whole<00:01:14.970> time<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> current<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> Sam

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the whole time in the current and Sam

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.900 
the whole time in the current and Sam
obviously<00:01:16.950> done<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> lot<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> driving<00:01:17.640> himself

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910

in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.360> past<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:18.930> enjoyed<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.440> well
