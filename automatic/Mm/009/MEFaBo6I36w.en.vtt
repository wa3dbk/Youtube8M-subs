00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.859
 so now we just ordered a domain name and a 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 accommodation at each season open a host we do not hesitate to 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.769
 take another host if you prefer 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.089
 even though we did that we will be able to have by the space book on 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:19.189
 a server turned on 24 hours a day 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.739
 on this server we will be able to send the files of our system 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.939
 so how to create a website 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 if you're not an encoder if you do not know anything about html or php do you 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.099
 do not 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.440
 we will use tools 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.210
 who make us sith quickly 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 so we are going to use 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.690
 this sense of what's called an idea c ms 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.700
 so I will still be discovering 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.640
 a small folder for you to read 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.059
 what I'm saying 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.059
 so here we are going to use what's called 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.830
 c 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.460
 ms 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 reportage more 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.090
 when such acts 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.940
 8:26 p.m. 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.380
 system 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.400
 stuck in a French that means the system 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.980
 to judge content management 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.220
 then the most known cms 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.470
 the newspaper 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.710
 which is historically dr the first finally the most important 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.940
 and why press 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.640
 at the base to precede to a content management system ironing 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.140
 Mass that was reserved 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 blogging 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.250
 but in recent years it has evolved so much and has become so 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830
 improved in quality 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.830
 than to use it to make any kind of site 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630
 so that the newspaper there are a lot of sites or there that turns into 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.040
 this moment but expects to be exceeded the amount to be exceeded by 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.330
 way of press 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.590
 so we understand each other because we're going to do it is that when we talk first to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.609
 start well ciccone the press court and then 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.150
 how can that be but joubert 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.610
 so be able to pass under massa comes in the form of selling it to a 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.020
 pile of files actually in lace files 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.170
 count load between the interest that then one sends me on our space 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.979
 hosting 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.669
 so we'll do all together I'll show you 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.559
 starting with or in press 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:14.810
 So then 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.030
 the convoy start by downloading or up 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.799
 then press download 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.759
 for that we have to go to 

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.639
 our press point 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.439
 today 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.099
 here we must not surrender surepress point com good after this point 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.809
 like these places on which we can have a free blog shepherd% 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.249
 but we do not have the domain name 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.399
 three other people a free money man render 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:43.599
 % 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.579
 your name 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.919
 this point to this point as but you do not own 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.219
 of accommodation that palois but since it is on the if the palois have 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.849
 earned money with the site 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.400
 so that's the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.209
 it's because we did today in this formation 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.209
 we go the evenings after this high point download the cms 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.659
 and install it in Switzerland online on one side I know it but this one is 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.169
 free to ancestors 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.679
 so I'm going on the internet auteuil i'm still here jay running on 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:15.269
 google we will download we see press between the french version 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:21.429
 we will go directly to them the points pcr with this dead point - that one 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.090
 so here we are on fr to prescribe org and we just have to go on this 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.619
 big button download to the press 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:31.579
 we save the files 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.389
 here we go 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.600
 so we will put it 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.409
 here and I have my file 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.059
 scream how to create a system to afp and download is launched see 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.029
 saleh it's over 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:48.329
 So that's it and it's done for the press now we're going too 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.959
 download jounin will not hear that I play my mom we will do so 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.059
 separated 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.999
 so here I have just downloaded the press point 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.999
 so then if I go back to my desk 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:01.549
 he recalled that this one 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.120
 what we are going to do is 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.989
 power 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.869
 it creates a folder structure 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:10.169
 it's the short 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.060
 to store the folder on your computer 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.140
 so why do I 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.180
 or propose to do that before going further 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.680
 because you will see with practice when we fear citizens 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.010
 lead quite often in the process of exchanging more limited tasks 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.009
 so much blaye this design project 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.270
 download eddie fisher here and there 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.120
 so it helps to have a folder structure to know exactly where 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.379
 tidy up what are you going to find each thing 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.009
 so here we have another portrait what still form visit a program 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:38.900
 visit 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.970
 we will start by creating folders and I really advise you to do 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:43.710
 the same thing 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.740
 then the first month folder 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.099
 my name is body it's in there that I have not always press besides I 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.029
 do not go right now 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.330
 the second folder 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.620
 it's the most dignified record 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.010
 So here you are every time and I came back ten more his arrival 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.150
 even in this training 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.900
 a fencing master 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.599
 the third folder 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:04.819
 we will pay her 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.229
 she's trying to elite 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.039
 no forgiveness evidence to support theme 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.539
 use the French word he was the design INSEE actually 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.729
 oppressive thion little exchanged was already caught 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:17.930
 to an agreement 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.349
 we will put them here 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.759
 then we will make a file 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.419
 documentation 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.719
 so all you will learn about the wordpress cms 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:30.529
 all the courses you will take the marine perimeter 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:33.379
 and then we will finish by sawing 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:34.589
 safeguard 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.479
 here in which we will put in its gameplay europe me personally I 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.469
 do a backup about once a week the sites I know in 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.360
 any case 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.150
 and so it serves me a lot of wind but also on weapons because I 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.860
 know where to go right now to find my backups 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.860
 so there you see I went in the body folder 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:52.139
 the heart of 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.729
 the heart of the plane a priest 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.729
 and we will now deliberate 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.729
 so I saw him culture extract 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.029
 the 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.029
 he is communicating 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.310
 so you see here we have our retreat three points a french version where 

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.449
 go 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.349
 and because of filaos press 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.349
 for making them harder to full full for six years after 

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:26.309
 but this folder reminded that that one how to have sent on our space 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.990
 hosting bh 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.080
 we're going to do that not a moment
