00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
painting a wall base

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.640 
painting a wall base
basically<00:01:52.850> I'm<00:01:53.180> basically<00:01:53.960> okay<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:54.350> we're

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
basically I'm basically okay so we're

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.710 
basically I'm basically okay so we're
just<00:01:54.680> going<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.250> like<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.490> so<00:01:56.450> I'm<00:01:56.570> gonna

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
just going around like that so I'm gonna

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.310 
just going around like that so I'm gonna
just<00:01:56.990> do<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.200> quickly<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.800> roughly<00:01:58.840> okay<00:01:59.840> look

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
just do it quickly and roughly okay look

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.930 
just do it quickly and roughly okay look
at<00:02:00.440> that<00:02:00.470> so<00:02:00.710> she<00:02:00.770> sticks<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.220> all<00:02:01.430> around<00:02:01.790> the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
at that so she sticks it all around the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.970 
at that so she sticks it all around the
heel<00:02:02.150> area<00:02:02.330> okay<00:02:02.690> cool<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.110> then<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:03.530> then<00:02:03.770> we

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
heel area okay cool and then so then we

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.210 
heel area okay cool and then so then we
take<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.580> modge<00:02:04.910> podge<00:02:05.350> good<00:02:06.350> let's<00:02:06.830> move<00:02:07.010> that

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
take a modge podge good let's move that

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.270 
take a modge podge good let's move that
all<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.430> way<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:09.010> before<00:02:10.010> we<00:02:10.100> do<00:02:10.250> that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
all the way and before we do that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.980 
all the way and before we do that
because<00:02:10.610> I've<00:02:10.670> actually<00:02:10.820> skipped<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.300> step<00:02:11.570> we

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
because I've actually skipped a step we

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.680 
because I've actually skipped a step we
actually<00:02:12.350> need<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.710> trace<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.400> heel<00:02:13.700> onto<00:02:14.270> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
actually need to trace the heel onto the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.020 
actually need to trace the heel onto the
mass<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.350> one<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> images<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.640> I've<00:02:16.790> done

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
mass of one of the images so I've done

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.450 
mass of one of the images so I've done
that<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.290> cut<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.650> out<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.220> can

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
that and then you cut that out you can

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.730 
that and then you cut that out you can
it<00:02:20.060> looks<00:02:20.240> like<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.630> all<00:02:20.960> right<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.380> guys

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
it looks like that all right so you guys

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.340 
it looks like that all right so you guys
the<00:02:21.920> heel<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.370> cut<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.910> out<00:02:23.090> yeah<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the heel you cut it out yeah and it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.200 
the heel you cut it out yeah and it
looks<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.890> all<00:02:25.100> right<00:02:25.280> okay<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.060> can

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
looks like that all right okay you can

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.120 
looks like that all right okay you can
also<00:02:26.480> alternatively<00:02:27.260> if<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.500> worried<00:02:28.010> that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
also alternatively if you worried that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.800 
also alternatively if you worried that
it's<00:02:28.280> gonna<00:02:28.430> make<00:02:28.670> lines<00:02:29.300> or<00:02:29.510> anything<00:02:29.660> like

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it's gonna make lines or anything like

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.060 
it's gonna make lines or anything like
that<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.140> actually<00:02:30.410> cut<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.830> flowers

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
that you can actually cut the flowers

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.950 
that you can actually cut the flowers
out<00:02:31.250> separately<00:02:31.790> as<00:02:31.910> well<00:02:31.940> all<00:02:32.300> right<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.630> think

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
out separately as well all right I think

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.410 
out separately as well all right I think
we'll<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.320> we'll<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.770> this<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.520> then<00:02:34.760> cuz<00:02:35.300> I've

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
we'll do we'll do this and then cuz I've

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.440 
we'll do we'll do this and then cuz I've
done<00:02:35.630> ones<00:02:35.870> really<00:02:36.200> without<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:37.340> flowers<00:02:37.910> so

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
done ones really without the flowers so

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.670 
done ones really without the flowers so
what<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.720> do<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.140> put<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> little<00:02:39.410> bit<00:02:39.590> of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
what you do is you put a little bit of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.200 
what you do is you put a little bit of
Mod<00:02:39.860> Podge<00:02:40.130> on<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.850> back<00:02:42.520> so<00:02:43.520> this<00:02:43.940> is<00:02:44.060> so

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
Mod Podge on the back so this is so

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.640 
Mod Podge on the back so this is so
interesting<00:02:44.630> I've<00:02:44.840> never<00:02:45.140> thought<00:02:45.320> together

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
interesting I've never thought together

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.740 
interesting I've never thought together
that<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.890> could<00:02:46.160> take<00:02:46.280> my<00:02:46.430> old<00:02:46.580> shoes<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.120> paint

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.070 
that I could take my old shoes and paint
blue<00:02:47.930> on<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.200> I'm<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.100> good<00:02:49.430> man<00:02:49.580> sir<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
blue on it I'm a good man sir so the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.780 
blue on it I'm a good man sir so the
trick<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.380> remember<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.040> you're<00:02:52.190> going<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.640> be

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
trick to remember if you're going to be

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.100 
trick to remember if you're going to be
doing<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.210> if<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.480> want<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.750> wear<00:02:53.960> them

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
doing this if you want to wear them

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.590 
doing this if you want to wear them
afterwards<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.740> put<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> nice<00:02:55.310> thin<00:02:56.090> layer<00:02:56.270> of

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
afterwards just put a nice thin layer of

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.449 
afterwards just put a nice thin layer of
varnish<00:02:56.930> over<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.830> protect<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.370> because

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
varnish over that to protect it because

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.670 
varnish over that to protect it because
obviously<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.150> paper<00:02:59.420> its<00:02:59.900> paper<00:03:00.170> see<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.560> it

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
obviously it's paper its paper see if it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.070 
obviously it's paper its paper see if it
gets<00:03:00.800> wet<00:03:01.160> you're<00:03:01.820> gonna<00:03:01.940> lose<00:03:02.420> your<00:03:02.690> image

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
gets wet you're gonna lose your image

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.280 
gets wet you're gonna lose your image
okay<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:03.950> we're<00:03:04.550> just<00:03:04.580> doing<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.570> think

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
okay so we're just doing that I think

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.780 
okay so we're just doing that I think
we'll<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.560> put<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.830> over<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.640> bit

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
we'll just put it over there it's a bit

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.699 
we'll just put it over there it's a bit
of<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.940> messy<00:03:08.170> messy<00:03:09.170> story

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
of a messy messy story

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.830 
of a messy messy story
well<00:03:10.100> these<00:03:10.250> ways<00:03:10.489> which<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.850> exciting<00:03:11.330> yeah

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
well these ways which is exciting yeah

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.429 
well these ways which is exciting yeah
oh<00:03:12.520> my<00:03:13.520> gosh<00:03:13.820> what<00:03:14.239> Maci<00:03:14.709> okay

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
oh my gosh what Maci okay

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.410 
oh my gosh what Maci okay
and<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:17.099> quite<00:03:17.310> pliable<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:17.999> you<00:03:18.090> can<00:03:18.269> just

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
and it's quite pliable so you can just

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.640 
and it's quite pliable so you can just
bend<00:03:19.409> the<00:03:19.620> paper<00:03:20.689> it<00:03:21.689> already<00:03:21.840> starts<00:03:22.349> looking

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
bend the paper it already starts looking

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.080 
bend the paper it already starts looking
prettier<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.219> the<00:03:23.340> instead<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.760> having<00:03:23.969> a

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
prettier so the instead of having a

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.940 
prettier so the instead of having a
normal<00:03:24.269> heel<00:03:24.749> you've<00:03:25.170> already<00:03:25.349> got<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.650> flower

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
normal heel you've already got a flower

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.589 
normal heel you've already got a flower
in<00:03:26.249> some<00:03:26.430> detail<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:26.939> make<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> little<00:03:27.450> bit

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
in some detail and make it a little bit

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.449 
in some detail and make it a little bit
more<00:03:27.749> exciting<00:03:28.170> I<00:03:28.290> think<00:03:28.769> this<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.010> also<00:03:29.280> good

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
more exciting I think this is also good

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.789 
more exciting I think this is also good
for<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:30.209> lot<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.450> my<00:03:30.689> shoes<00:03:31.049> because<00:03:31.319> there<00:03:31.650> you

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
for a lot of my shoes because there you

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.979 
for a lot of my shoes because there you
wear<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.129> or<00:03:32.249> you<00:03:32.340> drive<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.599> gets<00:03:33.810> a

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
wear it or you drive with it it gets a

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.479 
wear it or you drive with it it gets a
little<00:03:34.109> bit<00:03:34.319> salt<00:03:34.590> if<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.769> can<00:03:34.950> call<00:03:35.159> it

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
little bit salt if you can call it

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.399 
little bit salt if you can call it
yeah<00:03:35.609> I'm<00:03:35.760> stuffed<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.079> probably<00:03:37.319> a

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
yeah I'm stuffed so this is probably a

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.649 
yeah I'm stuffed so this is probably a
really<00:03:37.560> good<00:03:37.769> idea<00:03:37.829> nice<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.579> them<00:03:38.909> we're

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659

over the hole he'll feel empty cuz
that's<00:03:48.030> going<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.329> protect<00:03:48.659> the<00:03:48.840> image<00:03:48.989> from

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
that's going to protect the image from

that's going to protect the image from
coming<00:03:50.370> off<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.969> then<00:03:51.480> you<00:03:51.870> wait<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.079> few

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
minutes for it to dry and then you don't

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.000 
minutes for it to dry and then you don't
know<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.870> lay<00:03:55.049> away<00:03:55.290> two<00:03:55.349> minutes<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:55.919> then

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
know the lay away two minutes and then

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.979 
know the lay away two minutes and then
you<00:03:56.129> do<00:03:56.489> about<00:03:56.669> three<00:03:56.969> layers<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.329> hodge<00:03:57.629> podge
