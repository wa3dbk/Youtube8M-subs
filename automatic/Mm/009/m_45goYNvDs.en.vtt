 independent of 2012 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.619

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.290
 independent games 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 Independent independent games are only 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.610
 those games that do not receive money are 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.930
 made by small business people 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.090
 small at home up as mold daisy 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.350
 tickets to home games 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.750
 that do not receive a financial 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 to be worked out but when people 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.840
 wife and my wife and make 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 they saw fever type everyone wants 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.829
 play everyone who will download a company 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 purchase the rights to the game and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.820
 I call expensive cargo was money 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.769
 money as minecraft a download 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.180
 example that everyone plays to win 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.330
 games per minute but were games 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.850
 eight upset 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 Let's start here for fifth place. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.420
 the fifth place may be better than the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.840
 third second better than the fourth 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 because it does not exist for a better game 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.729
 better than the other for example this game 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.250
 as a shot and football has no way 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.700
 choose which is best which plays the most 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.990
 Which one do you prefer the best? 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 There are ignorant people who do not know 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.799
 example since war is better than feet 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.649
 2013 according to the monster stuff and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.619
 thing in football has no way 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.899
 but then we go here for the games they 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 gained by their characteristics 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.630
 The first game goes through thorn thorn 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.280

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.430

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.380

 another game stayed with the flaps sinepe eu 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.130
 I think the name is a strategy game 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.360
 was elected by the public is a game well 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.570
 Nice to meet you, enjoy a game of 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:37.020
 strategy and non-conforming phases will 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.760
 passing fans are evolving and the game 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.590
 for example, there is no single strategy 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.209
 if you have a better strategy than 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.580
 You machine will win and a third 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.519

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.370
 with name must for years I have never seen band 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.890
 Swedish, but it should be good because 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.360

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.430

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.480
 thriller and the band and urban chaos 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.100
 have a channel I do not know and a game that does not 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.230
 technical quality is anti-timber 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.620
 a game that drug through mazes 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.620
 and etc 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:27.120
 if it falls to the side of giant buildings 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.730
 You lose the game, the game is very cool. 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.820
 You have control you can not explain. 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.060

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.489
 cubes during the game you can choose whether 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.280

 another as I said before does not exist 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:22.009
 one game better than the other 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.350
 different player styles 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.970
