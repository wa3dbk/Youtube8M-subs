 sell your house the neighborhood of course traditionally a broker continent 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.250
 a lot of work off your hands 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.910
 but that costs 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.059
 and it can also be different 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.599

 I think you will find enough help on the internet 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.109
 who finds a sign in the garden a step-by-step plan tips and tricks 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.480
 possibility photos of correct places for example contracts in short everything 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.029
 you need to handle it without a broker 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.489
 the rates differ 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.859
 which range from free to almost 1300 euros but a good buyer of a broker 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.430
 it always 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.570
 after that, the rounds of san thay start the rapporteurs of association own house 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.620
 you can sell your house so by yes very well it happens already very 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.290
 long 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.750
 and must have registered to make up for it 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.930
 so it costs more energy than you make 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.410
 we searched for your skin how much you pay at a regular broker and 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.110
 in addition, we assume an average percentage of color average 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.100
 of a few 6 percent commission 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.030
 and brokerage is with a gun a broker asks take a look but also 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.430
 for example with an Olympic of 149,000 you pay all that making is 23 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.360
 84 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.710
 with 32,000 47 84 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.490
 if your home is considerably more expensive, four 79,000 bees more than seven half 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.609
 lost a thousand euros in approximately 57,000 at 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.119
 yes almost 12,000 euros lost so it does indeed cost money 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.540
 and it can therefore be completely zero without a broker 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.550
 well 0 that you occasionally come across such a free ad site it costs 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.700
 actually always something 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.560
 on most websites with a few questions about those questions 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.380
 one hundred euros it then starts with the securities 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.869
 yes of course know what to ask yes what is my back home that says the 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.110
 ask what can i get for it and how many means are you 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.820
 then you can use it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.360
 most important thing that everyone gets at home is the game set were the municipality 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.549
 he gives everyone 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.300
 lasts for a year and wants to make what it is 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.360
 and a valuation that on which you are taxing 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.090
 paid but that means that you have and the nice indication 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.879
 from what your home has been to market value 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.019
 video fathers are often lower, it is often not too low and that is one of them 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.189
 years ago but that will happen just say the the minimum amount you have for you 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.999
 should get home but as a rule that's a bit more 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.859
 also in the second set were you have more land registry was very bad 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.209
 important source of information and therefore very accessible and anyone could 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.049
 consulting phones but a lot on the internet 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.209
 and then you can check in your zip code area what houses have yielded that 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.969
 and the past that year even five years have been sold they can see exactly 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.799
 which houses have been sold and what have been raised as a good reference for 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:42.190
 Your own 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.350
 this way you can also do such an investigation from a burglar in another way 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.550
 itself very well 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.609
 take a good look and do your own research 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.999
 on websites, for example, the well-known funda whole competition somewhat similar 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:55.399
 houses near you that are asked for that 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:57.279
 and many people do that too 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.249
 it can also ask a valuation broker yes that is 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.329
 of course also a lot of eric chahi if you doubt I will do it myself or 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.670
 gaaikema can switch on 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.370
 never made from which or 2 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.970
 and for the call what do you have to pay but what will they keep in full 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.310
 And it is a good sell as if there are defects making it a problem 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.299
 could be that gives you some guidance and also nothing to pay 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.269
 you do not have to pay anything we do not have an assignment or longer 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.109
 it is of course given 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.769
 without that, however, did not take into account but that of course 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.799
 the broker monitor that many people are going to do this or not 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.429
 then I do not know and I look like a broker his services to the press and he 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.229
 does that well and nobody who says I'm going to be in Sweden this year has a lot 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.840
 customers at 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.929
 Always so that makes that also know that they are never alone the competition the other 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.189
 then I want to bring the king to the attention of potential buyers how to do 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.849
 we like that 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.539
 But the most important thing, of course, is to take photos on a website 

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.160
 make how the pictures and that means 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.840
 when I open the door and old camera to the front and the photo just thumbs up 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.129
 make sure you make a good pass with 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:02.250
 help with nice sunny weather made and not the pictures that actually themselves 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.079
 also not so would prefer to move 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.219
 well on a website you can buy advertising space that is the same 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.659
 if you used to do in the newspaper 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.699
 or who makes a website himself how people do that in those who just give it 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.250
 the name of part of the street for example heemskerklaan 40 and you should 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.620
 then place a sign in the garden 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.609
 you can do it too 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.889
 poster for the window i am of course also helps is tell to 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.600
 as many people as possible on the schoolyard to work on this 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.180
 your friends 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.240
 says van dijk go to come home who knows copper comes from masts 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240
 cheapest and then the viewers arrive in hardenberg 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.720
 yes but yes that depends a bit on is your house in a good state of 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.659
 maintenance it is an attractive house 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.580
 so you know what he can actually always do 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.330
 year and start with the garden your care the first impression people get outside and 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.680
 ensures that the classis made or that things look neat 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.960
 doing minor maintenance that paints them all that stuff needs the 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.610
 first impression that determines 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.460
 and clean up the house and if the house itself is going to sell you have to dodge yourself 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.479
 then you have to be home very often at the obsolete hours probably like 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.849
 a broker redoute give him the key and he does the company further reports that 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.889
 the work if you want it so you have to feel it on thursday morning to get there 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:09.580
 can be over 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.969
 you will receive a little young gin mulled wine 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.259
 nijkerk it's a business reception for your friends do you do that 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.650
 maybe but you shouldn't keep it businesslike they find the tour 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.690
 tell everything about the house that someone needs to know you really have to be told everything 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.640
 and this very honest because if you are not if you are not in your none 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.159
 giving honest information can cause goss problems 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.879
 and then suppose there is a look they are reporting this is well my house 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.120
 dreams and then maybe we get the negotiations to end 

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.949
 a purchase contract 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.939
 yes so then you start negotiating everyone just thinks the price 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.060
 there is also much more to it because it also goes when the transfer takes place 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.289
 of the house what is left behind 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.499
 and those are movable things that the cow must have found such a thing 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:53.460
 picking domestic interior but you do not get it when the house becomes empty 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.159
 delivered unless there are separate agreements about it 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.370
 but the money is of course the most important thing and what does he become 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.229
 ultimately you are responsible for the purchase contract yourself 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.539
