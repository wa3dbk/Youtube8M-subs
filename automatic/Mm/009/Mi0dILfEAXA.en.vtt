00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 what's the plan i'm trying to 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.429
 think 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.929
 I always just wanted to study, of course 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.610
 then has a gigantic said to my 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 at home in ruins 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 there it was with the study first 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.510
 past if my teleport magic here 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.470
 function 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 went that again ene mene 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.890
 dragon hoard take me away from this 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.650
 place stern 6 no I have to know what 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.969
 have confused 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.140
 forget what I said earlier 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.940
 now it will be really scary 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.430
 a dwarf from marzipan past me 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 marches 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.680
 moment this is a white hair 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 I hope that's not a bad omen 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.079
 it is really nice again 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.090
 being outside 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.850
 I feel like I have been for years 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.020
 stuck in a tower 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.129
 I have never understood why 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.289
 magicians of sheep are so fascinated 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.140
 a magician never comes too late as well 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.400
 not too early she arrives then 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.600
 When she intends the streams of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.570
 magic is full of turbulence 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.070
 let yourself be enchanted by mine 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 secret that men bring the power 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.080
 The adventure just laughs that clear 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.590
 is that here are no magic tricks 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 they are illusions magic tricks are that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 what you really do in the chutes 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.979
 Sweets will get grumbled and I will 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.619
 who spreads this again and again 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.430
 disgusting dish everyone knows that me 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 on blue do not stand on green 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.520
 besides, my last two wanted 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.180
 worship the world rule in itself 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.829
 tear 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.420
 As I said, I just want to study 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.939
 I saw that the hordes and the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.520
 alliance can live together in peace 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.850
 a single event could us 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.549
 bring together your permanent ones 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.170
 Find allusions to the Ice Queen 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.869
 I totally unabashed 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.390
 when my brother derrick was killed 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.530
 my father all orks on azeroth 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.020
 wipe out 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.810
 I wonder how I am with one 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.840
 loss 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.989
 I hope I never need to know 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.040
 what is the plan 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.040
 I try to think
