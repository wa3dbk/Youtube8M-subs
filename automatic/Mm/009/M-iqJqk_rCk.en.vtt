00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.230 

inside<00:00:01.500> spaces<00:00:02.190> can<00:00:02.429> be<00:00:02.460> just<00:00:02.820> as<00:00:02.970> challenging

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
inside spaces can be just as challenging

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.240 
inside spaces can be just as challenging
as<00:00:03.899> outside<00:00:04.500> spaces<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.640> start<00:00:06.480> with<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
as outside spaces I start with a

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.459 
as outside spaces I start with a
rectangle<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.370> then<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> add<00:00:09.330> diagonal<00:00:10.230> lines

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
rectangle and then I add diagonal lines

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.240 
rectangle and then I add diagonal lines
that<00:00:11.219> extend<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.240> edges<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:12.809> paper

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
that extend out to the edges of my paper

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.519 
that extend out to the edges of my paper
this<00:00:14.250> defines<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.059> inside<00:00:15.719> space<00:00:16.230> that

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
this defines the inside space that

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.680 
this defines the inside space that
you're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.949> be<00:00:17.039> drawing<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.580> simply<00:00:18.510> add

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
you're going to be drawing on simply add

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.080 
you're going to be drawing on simply add
a<00:00:18.720> rectangle<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> very<00:00:20.010> back<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.000> you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
a rectangle in the very back and you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.570 
a rectangle in the very back and you
have<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> door<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.380> another<00:00:22.710> rectangle<00:00:23.369> going

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
have a door and another rectangle going

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
have a door and another rectangle going
the<00:00:23.670> other<00:00:23.730> direction<00:00:24.260> horizontally<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.410> you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the other direction horizontally and you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
the other direction horizontally and you
have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> window<00:00:26.689> from<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.140> add

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
have a window from here you can add

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.310 
have a window from here you can add
extra<00:00:28.650> details<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.310> there<00:00:29.750> many<00:00:30.750> people<00:00:30.840> find

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
extra details on there many people find

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.549 
extra details on there many people find
windows<00:00:32.099> drawn<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.120> sides<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.350> these

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
windows drawn on the sides of these

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
windows drawn on the sides of these
walls<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.850> quite<00:00:36.059> difficult<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:37.170> just

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
walls to be quite difficult you just

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.229 
walls to be quite difficult you just
have<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.649> remember<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> do<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> trapezoid<00:00:38.940> that

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
have to remember to do a trapezoid that

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.889 
have to remember to do a trapezoid that
is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.230> rectangle<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.879> wider<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.690> end

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
is a rectangle that is wider on one end

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.970 
is a rectangle that is wider on one end
than<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> other<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.149> then<00:00:45.149> you're<00:00:45.480> adding

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
than the other and then you're adding

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.600 
than the other and then you're adding
horizontal<00:00:46.980> lines<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.320> connecting<00:00:49.320> them<00:00:49.610> at

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
horizontal lines and connecting them at

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
horizontal lines and connecting them at
the<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> bottom<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.219> this<00:00:53.930> creates<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the top and bottom and this creates the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.189 
the top and bottom and this creates the
windowsill<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.270> add<00:00:57.539> your

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
windowsill you can then add your

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.520 
windowsill you can then add your
mountains<00:00:58.800> or<00:00:59.129> in<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.510> windows<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.320> add

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
mountains or in the windows you can add

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.170 
mountains or in the windows you can add
your<00:01:02.100> mountains<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.090> other<00:01:03.979> features

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
your mountains or other features

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500 
your mountains or other features
sometimes<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> put<00:01:07.100> roads<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.549> by<00:01:08.760> sometimes

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
sometimes I put roads going by sometimes

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
sometimes I put roads going by sometimes
I<00:01:09.689> draw<00:01:09.869> people<00:01:10.380> outside<00:01:11.310> looking<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
I draw people outside looking into the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.800 
I draw people outside looking into the
windows<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:14.909> other<00:01:15.060> thing<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
windows the other thing you can do is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.380 
windows the other thing you can do is
another<00:01:16.140> doorway<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.880> same<00:01:18.090> thing

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
another doorway and it's the same thing

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.980 
another doorway and it's the same thing
only<00:01:18.630> it's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> more<00:01:19.530> rectangular<00:01:20.990> vertical

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
only it's a more rectangular vertical

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
only it's a more rectangular vertical
and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.070> add<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:24.360> door<00:01:24.780> sill<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.740> then

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and then you add the door sill and then

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.440 
and then you add the door sill and then
you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.939> put<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> another<00:01:28.140> room<00:01:29.180> this<00:01:30.180> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can put in another room this can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.710 
you can put in another room this can
become<00:01:30.600> another<00:01:31.259> room<00:01:31.590> inside<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.909> drawing

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.149 

you<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:36.930> need<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.200> define<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> space

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you just need to define what the space

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370 
you just need to define what the space
is<00:01:38.189> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> look<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:39.119> there

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
is going to look like in there

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
is going to look like in there
tables<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.610> drawn<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.390> as<00:01:42.450> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
tables can also be drawn same way as the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
tables can also be drawn same way as the
windows<00:01:43.020> except<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.770> trapezoid<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.890> at<00:01:46.890> first

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
windows except the trapezoid is at first

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.929 
windows except the trapezoid is at first
going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> look<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.570> way<00:01:48.689> down

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
going to look like it's all the way down

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
going to look like it's all the way down
and<00:01:50.939> then<00:01:51.149> we<00:01:51.299> add<00:01:51.450> straight<00:01:52.439> lines<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and then we add straight lines at the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
and then we add straight lines at the
bottom<00:01:53.220> here

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.760 

you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.119> use<00:02:00.329> ovals<00:02:00.840> again<00:02:01.170> these

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
you know I like to use ovals again these

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.099 
you know I like to use ovals again these
are<00:02:01.950> somewhat<00:02:02.310> vertical<00:02:03.060> or<00:02:03.270> I'm<00:02:03.780> sorry

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
are somewhat vertical or I'm sorry

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.889 
are somewhat vertical or I'm sorry
horizontal<00:02:05.039> ovals<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:06.420> make<00:02:06.689> nice

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
horizontal ovals and these make nice

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.609 
horizontal ovals and these make nice
plates<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.519> can<00:02:08.729> add<00:02:09.629> some<00:02:10.080> forks

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
plates and then you can add some forks

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.759 
plates and then you can add some forks
and<00:02:10.860> spoons<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.670> well<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.330> that'll<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.349> kind

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
and spoons as well and that'll just kind

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.080 
and spoons as well and that'll just kind
of<00:02:13.920> finish<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:16.220> setting<00:02:17.220> your<00:02:17.790> place

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
of finish up you're setting your place

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.640 
of finish up you're setting your place
setting<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.510> your<00:02:19.700> table<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:22.080> then<00:02:22.290> we<00:02:22.440> can

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
setting for your table and then we can

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.479 
setting for your table and then we can
talk<00:02:23.250> about<00:02:23.610> adding<00:02:24.420> people<00:02:24.599> next<00:02:28.400> I'm<00:02:29.400> just

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
talk about adding people next I'm just

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.280 
talk about adding people next I'm just
gonna<00:02:29.730> add<00:02:29.940> one<00:02:30.239> person<00:02:31.670> we're<00:02:32.670> gonna<00:02:32.760> start

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
pretty simply with just couple of lines
