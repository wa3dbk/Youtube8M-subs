00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
of these back will be good I still don't

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.820 
of these back will be good I still don't
know<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> lot<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.939> use<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> though<00:01:18.360> because

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
know if a lot to use it though because

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
know if a lot to use it though because
it's<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.159> convenient<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
it's just more convenient to not use it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.050 
it's just more convenient to not use it
and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.439> finally<00:01:23.009> there's<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.880> really

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
and then finally there's the really

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
and then finally there's the really
exciting<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.200> protective<00:01:26.040> glass<00:01:26.369> lens

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
exciting one the protective glass lens

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.039 
exciting one the protective glass lens
for<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> camera<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.200> not<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.790> case

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
for the camera when it's not in the case

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.580 
for the camera when it's not in the case
this<00:01:31.049> comes<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> great<00:01:31.740> little<00:01:31.770> plastic

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
this comes in a great little plastic

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.690 
this comes in a great little plastic
protective<00:01:34.590> housing<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.490> actually

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
protective housing and I would actually

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.420 
protective housing and I would actually
recommend<00:01:35.880> keeping<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.619> store<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
recommend keeping this to store this in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
recommend keeping this to store this in
when<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.820> using<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.170> there's<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
when you're not using it so there's the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
when you're not using it so there's the
glass<00:01:41.130> lens<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.000> pushes<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
glass lens and it pushes on to the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100 
glass lens and it pushes on to the
camera<00:01:43.439> just<00:01:44.149> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.659> provides

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
camera just like that and provides

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
camera just like that and provides
protection<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.040> your<00:01:47.159> camera's<00:01:47.700> lens<00:01:47.960> when

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
protection for your camera's lens when

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.649 
protection for your camera's lens when
it's<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.649> frame

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
it's in the frame

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.630 
it's in the frame
this<00:01:51.659> makes<00:01:52.079> frame<00:01:52.500> mounting<00:01:53.009> far<00:01:53.729> far<00:01:54.689> more

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
this makes frame mounting far far more

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
this makes frame mounting far far more
versatile<00:01:56.640> because<00:01:57.000> now<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.600> frame<00:01:57.930> out

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
versatile because now you can frame out

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.410 
versatile because now you can frame out
at<00:01:58.590> times<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.579> there's<00:01:59.729> still<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> chance

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
at times when there's still a chance

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
at times when there's still a chance
that<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.780> camera<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.680> damaged

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
that your camera is going to get damaged

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.370 
that your camera is going to get damaged
so<00:02:02.180> even

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
so even

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.590 
so even
