00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
he's a small dog I use the small pattern

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.820 
he's a small dog I use the small pattern
for<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.220> coat<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.790> I<00:02:57.720> traced<00:02:58.020> it<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.470> here

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
for the coat and I traced it on here

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.360 
for the coat and I traced it on here
because<00:03:00.020> this<00:03:01.020> paper<00:03:01.380> here<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.980> lot<00:03:02.190> more

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
because this paper here is a lot more

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.960 
because this paper here is a lot more
durable<00:03:02.790> than<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.090> tissue<00:03:03.420> paper<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:04.970> comes

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
durable than the tissue paper that comes

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.140 
durable than the tissue paper that comes
with<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.810> pattern<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.880> thought<00:03:09.030> it

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
with the pattern and I just thought it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.820 
with the pattern and I just thought it
would<00:03:09.239> be<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.450> better<00:03:09.720> idea<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.530> on<00:03:10.680> that

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
would be a better idea to do it on that

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.470 
would be a better idea to do it on that
and<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.070> worked<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.459> well<00:03:11.520> you<00:03:11.940> don't<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.300> to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and it worked out well you don't have to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.090 
and it worked out well you don't have to
do<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.900> could<00:03:13.080> cut<00:03:13.290> your<00:03:13.470> pattern<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
do that you could cut your pattern and

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.250 
do that you could cut your pattern and
pin<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.700> like<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:15.030> do<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> normal<00:03:16.080> pattern

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
pin it just like you do a normal pattern

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.850 
pin it just like you do a normal pattern
but<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.030> this<00:03:18.180> way<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.799> this<00:03:19.799> is

I decided that the material should be a
little<00:04:04.890> bit<00:04:05.010> stretchy<00:04:05.340> so<00:04:05.940> she<00:04:06.030> should<00:04:06.690> he
