00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello again welcome to another video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.760
 this time I bring you a fight vgc this 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.880
 once against good good friend of mine what 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.830
 you know about the channel like this fight what 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.160
 I will surely climb the weekend and the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.410
 Saturday are the tournaments of Milan the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 tournament wgc to milan there will be no 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 problem because when you see this the 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.820
 tournament will have already been or will be 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.820
 celebrating so there will be no problem 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.920
 some does not stop is the same team or almost 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.570
 the same thing that Milan would use is to say that 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.610
 is the fight to the best of three 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.170
 this was the third match worth the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.750
 first I had won it the second what 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.239
 I had won him and I say it because many 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.220
 things we already know because we had 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.230
 struggled and we already had an idea of ​​the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.450
 attacks the objects that the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.910
 pokemon rivals I started with growing up and 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.769
 there is crafty and he started with escartí 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.720
 playful what your script and do not have 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.760
 completion and mine yes which I was 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.430
 very good because it is craft and look for you and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 it is physically logically not so I lower it 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.449
 the attack he made me surprise criticized 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.070
 grow up I already thought it would be more 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.570
 fast that speed time and I played it and 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.149
 surprise criticized him too but good 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.470
 it did not work for me the only one did the lightning and 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.810
 ice instead of a water-type attack 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.750
 to freeze me very creepy I wanted to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.310
 freeze less here I predicted that the two 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.750
 goal that they would do is this one only 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.869
 playful attacked him with ice skate 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.369
 paralyze the ludic which very useful 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.869
 because the vehicle is quite fast and 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.660
 more if the rain is activated but not 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.850
 it was but it is craft and attacked with gemma 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 acres he is already saying that as they had 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.370
 attack has gone down it did not take away as much 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.440
 and I also had 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.090
 he also expresses that even if he does not have birds 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.250
 of defense has a defense 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.900
 considerable to grow already here there was no 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.090
 predicted a change had predicted everything 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.860
 another attack so directly what 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.870
 did was exchange with grow already for 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.490
 re-activate exchange which 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 this is a very good strategy the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.270
 true 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.740
 use in exchanges about myself to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.870
 re- intimidating but not 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.750
 it worked because change is kraft and not 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.820
 because it only works with physical Pokémon 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.170
 there are not these are special with a can 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.330
 it was to remove more than half of the 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.250
 playful life logo and he made me watch for 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.290
 try to freeze me like I said before 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.720
 was it true towards that just for 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.440
 freeze my taste is a bit creepy 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.250
 we both protected ourselves and with growing up 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.700
 I could attack because he resisted the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.440
 shadow even for this api would grow 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.380
 has max pcs and macs special defense 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.030
 so it could withstand a clear yes me 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.970
 I take away a lot because it's super effective and 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.640
 all that here I made a very good change 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.460
 prediction pulled a es craft and the chandé 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.710
 Monday the ladder knew it for the others 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.960
 combats so I preached that I would change 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.180
 intimacy and exchange with scrap and 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.770
 re-attack and re-activate e 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.960
 intimidation to lower the attack to 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.480
 script and that went in and kill with a fist 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.100
 draw avalanche and colo so that I do not 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.170
 they try to be more 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.280
 ice beam that I already saw myself 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.330
 frozen and did not kill him like that 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.190
 for security here saco advisor I changed 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.610
 a is crafting because with a bullet fist 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 I would grow up dying so I could not do 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.269
 intimidation 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.150
 shaka shaka scrap and I put it back in 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.840
 the field to be able to trigger intimidation 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.299
 again 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.280
 scrat and the opponent made the fist of energy 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.629
 a terráqueo not which can resist 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.430
 because he had lowered the attack with 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.519
 inclination but equally wearing 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.349
 facuse side so it was like you see 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.540
 here is what I told you is kraft and it comes out 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.569
 and I can lower the attack again on the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.329
 two scratch has less 2 attack and 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.459
 scissor minus 1 but if you only had 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.769
 stabbed for that I did surprise and I could 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.329
 attack without problems against action already 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.590
 I knew that the fence to pommel was not bad 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.569
 or so I killed him from just one 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.700
 point and commit actions faster 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.310
 which is kraft and I can not kill and scissor 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.159
 as it is backed by surprise because 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.200
 I had no chance to try 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.989
 make a bullet fist to earth because 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.459
 Even though he was on the attack, he killed him 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.019
 here they take out of the USSR 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.340
 I protect myself with a predicting earth 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:12.390
 logically the fist to which 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:14.940
 logically it occurs and writes and makes 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.769
 shred to kill ram like no 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.299
 I had band focus because I knew it kills him 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.139
 in one fell swoop because I already knew that it is 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.440
 kart and he is alone is scissor here and 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.910
 I let myself be sacrificed because you can bullet 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.190
 it's always a priority so even though 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.479
 change would be the same and says fist 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.820
 kitchen with 6 now which was a 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.260
 bitch because it was critical but good if 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.810
 well only if it could only resist 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.840
 pretty good that fist to draw but 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.460
 good only scissor was left I had 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.400
 beats who by the way changes the 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.930
 mote and I put blue white because this one the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.220
 He left me his lips and his name was 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.850
 Uruguay does not directly change the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.500
 mote and lightning if he dies was a 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.330
 intense combat but also we already knew 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.850
 many things that the rival was carrying 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.080
 that also because logically changed 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.630
 the things I knew that chandeleur 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.120
 had chosen solution so the first thing 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.520
 what I did was to paralyze him but hey 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.229
 a great combat worthy of him does not 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.370
 I expected less I put things 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.260
 difficult especially in the second 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.420
 combat that I lost 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.950
