thumbnails isn't super quick on Wi-Fi so

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.190 
thumbnails isn't super quick on Wi-Fi so
it<00:01:42.119> should<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.540> faster<00:01:42.899> but<00:01:42.990> isn't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it should be a little faster but isn't
