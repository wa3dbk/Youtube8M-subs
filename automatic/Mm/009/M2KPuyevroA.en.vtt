this video tutorial is going to go

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.160 
this video tutorial is going to go
through<00:00:05.009> the<00:00:05.370> fingering<00:00:05.910> system<00:00:06.150> used<00:00:06.660> in<00:00:06.899> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
through the fingering system used in the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.459 
through the fingering system used in the
fingerboard<00:00:07.529> workbook<00:00:08.309> series<00:00:09.349> we<00:00:10.349> are

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
fingerboard workbook series we are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.459 
fingerboard workbook series we are
looking<00:00:10.830> at<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.610> violin<00:00:12.179> first<00:00:12.840> position

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
looking at the violin first position

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.960 
looking at the violin first position
chart<00:00:15.529> what<00:00:16.529> we're<00:00:16.680> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.310> start

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
chart what we're going to do is start

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.160 
chart what we're going to do is start
with<00:00:18.210> ignoring<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.320> numbers<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.010> there

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
with ignoring the numbers that are there

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.429 
with ignoring the numbers that are there
we<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.590> open<00:00:22.920> strings<00:00:23.300> indicated<00:00:24.300> G<00:00:24.779> D<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
we have the open strings indicated G D a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.140 
we have the open strings indicated G D a
and<00:00:25.859> E<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.400> then<00:00:27.800> we'll<00:00:28.800> assign<00:00:29.550> fingers

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and E and then we'll assign fingers

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.670 
and E and then we'll assign fingers
going<00:00:30.869> up<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.460> open<00:00:33.270> G<00:00:33.620> well<00:00:34.620> I'm

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
going up so we have open G well I'm

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410 
going up so we have open G well I'm
going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.010> first<00:00:35.280> finger<00:00:35.640> second<00:00:36.270> finger

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and fourth finger that's the best place

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.830 
and fourth finger that's the best place
to<00:00:51.329> start

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
to start

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.209 
to start
same<00:00:54.840> letter<00:00:55.579> same<00:00:56.840> finger<00:00:58.039> we're<00:00:59.039> going<00:00:59.160> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
same letter same finger we're going to

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.889 
same letter same finger we're going to
now<00:00:59.399> get<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.000> sharps<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.510> flats<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:02.070> any

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
now get into the sharps and flats so any

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
now get into the sharps and flats so any
letter<00:01:03.979> for<00:01:04.979> example<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.519> going<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> start

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
letter for example we're going to start

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.390 
letter for example we're going to start
with<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.600> flat<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.820> sharp<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.860> finger

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
with a a flat a a sharp the same finger

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.969 
with a a flat a a sharp the same finger
because<00:01:11.939> there's<00:01:12.210> an<00:01:12.390> A<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.720> each<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.920> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because there's an A in each one of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
because there's an A in each one of
those<00:01:14.220> examples<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:16.850> first<00:01:17.850> finger<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.509> flat<00:01:19.320> a

those examples a first finger a flat a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.179 
those examples a first finger a flat a
little<00:01:19.740> lower

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
little lower

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
little higher first finger high a flat a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:37.760 
little higher first finger high a flat a

a sharp one low one one high B is not
third<00:01:38.250> finger<00:01:38.640> low<00:01:38.820> B<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.450> second<00:01:39.840> finger<00:01:40.140> zero

third finger low B is second finger zero

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.940 
third finger low B is second finger zero
one<00:01:41.040> two<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.630> therefore<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.500> second

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
one two so therefore it's in this second

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
one two so therefore it's in this second
finger<00:01:44.159> higher<00:01:44.549> position<00:01:46.130> B<00:01:47.130> flat<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.850> not

going to be one lot high it is going to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
going to be one lot high it is going to
be<00:01:51.119> 2nd<00:01:51.689> finger<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.680> lower<00:01:52.920> position<00:01:53.520> B

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
be 2nd finger and it's lower position B
