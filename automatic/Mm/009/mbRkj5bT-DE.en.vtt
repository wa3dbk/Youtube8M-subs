I<00:05:38.930> know<00:05:39.930> right<00:05:40.380> here<00:05:41.190> this<00:05:41.340> is<00:05:41.400> a<00:05:41.550> group<00:05:41.820> that

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
I know right here this is a group that

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.690 
I know right here this is a group that
you<00:05:42.120> cannot<00:05:42.630> do<00:05:43.080> this<00:05:43.110> with<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.370> reason

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
you cannot do this with and the reason

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.840 
you cannot do this with and the reason
for<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:44.910> is<00:05:45.240> because<00:05:46.490> they<00:05:47.490> don't<00:05:47.610> really

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
for that is because they don't really

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.450 
for that is because they don't really
die<00:05:48.090> when<00:05:48.570> we<00:05:48.660> kill<00:05:48.900> them<00:05:49.050> maybe<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.590> sort<00:05:50.400> of

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
die when we kill them maybe that sort of

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.940 
die when we kill them maybe that sort of
corpse<00:05:50.880> explosion<00:05:51.030> thing<00:05:53.420> so<00:05:54.560> when<00:05:55.560> you<00:05:55.710> do

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
corpse explosion thing so when you do

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.420 
corpse explosion thing so when you do
kill<00:05:56.370> them<00:05:56.610> with<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.120> exploding<00:05:57.660> palm<00:05:58.430> as

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.410

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
so all of them got at the same time but

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.620

you can see you can see that they just

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.260 
you can see you can see that they just
picked<00:06:19.840> out<00:06:20.020> the<00:06:20.350> same<00:06:20.530> amount<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:20.920> loop<00:06:21.270> that

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
picked out the same amount of loop that

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.490 
picked out the same amount of loop that
you'd<00:06:22.390> normally<00:06:22.510> get<00:06:22.810> so<00:06:22.960> don't<00:06:23.140> even<00:06:23.230> try<00:06:23.470> it

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
you'd normally get so don't even try it
