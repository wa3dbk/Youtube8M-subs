when twisting your hair you want to try

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.580 
when twisting your hair you want to try
and<00:01:00.860> twist<00:01:01.070> it<00:01:01.310> somewhat<00:01:01.760> tightly<00:01:02.590> because

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
and twist it somewhat tightly because

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.530 
and twist it somewhat tightly because
this<00:01:03.920> helps<00:01:04.129> your<00:01:04.460> twist<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.850> come<00:01:05.059> out<00:01:05.210> a<00:01:05.239> bit

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
this helps your twist to come out a bit

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.040 
this helps your twist to come out a bit
neater<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.910> also<00:01:07.910> you<00:01:08.060> want<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.330> try<00:01:08.540> not<00:01:08.810> to

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
borrow hair while twisting because that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.750 
borrow hair while twisting because that
will<00:01:12.290> become<00:01:12.470> a<00:01:12.620> problem<00:01:13.160> when<00:01:13.310> it's<00:01:13.430> time<00:01:13.640> to
