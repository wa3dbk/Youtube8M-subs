00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the first lady of france brought the attack 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.240
 spouse president of the country 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.340
 this data today provides links to 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.780
 intelligence country survived shock from 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 adultery leader 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.460
 does not know whether to scold or support 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 the culprit of this sex scandal 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 because on the one hand francois Holland 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.380
 kind of turned out to be honest with his 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.300
 common-law wife 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 although apparently his confession seemed 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.710
 so awkward that soon as 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.369
 say they had to call after the first 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.800
 same phrases 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.759
 Holland Dmitri Tarkhov about the history of treason 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 which put all France on the ears 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.969
 so who is the last one after that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
 the musketeer is rumored to be honest 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.680
 whose wife or unfaithful husband was taken from 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.129
 in-person journalists are real Parisian 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.620
 secrets 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.039
 he and they mean the president and his 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.809
 women government wants 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.219
 control information which 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.379
 appears on the covers of the boulevard 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 publications someone thinks it's hypocrisy 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.219
 but this criticism is normal 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.050
 presidential romances in paris started 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.359
 discuss the end of last week magazine 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 closer published photos on which 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.549
 a man like Francois Hollande 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 seems to go to a mistress very similar to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.930
 actress julie gaye 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.330
 so taste subsided it very low with 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 side of the magazine so do the president 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.229
 has the right to privacy paparazzi 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.030
 got a lot especially when it became 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.430
 known to the first lady of france valeri 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.890
 trierveyler could not stand fell down in 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 the hospital and it turned out the cook makes sick 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.270
 right after talking to the president in 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.040
 which Alan himself confessed to treason and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.000
 This was even before the scandal of the newspaper and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.220
 apparently this news was 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 too heavy for the first lady though 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.290
 Were villa retriggers formally needed 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.509
 call not the first lady but 1 girlfriend so 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 how are they not married only the first or 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.220
 Francois Holland was never married 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.240
 already loudly cheated like your first 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.040
 Great love 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 former presidential candidates france 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.659
 Segolen Royal left her in time for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.119
 current civil spouse journalist 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.890
 Valerie Trierweiler they worked together 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.409
 in the elections when the presidency was royal 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 and now a new twist by the way Jules 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.930
 Gaye Francois Holland also met in 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.240
 the pre-election cycle time is already its 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.920
 heidi the first time I met up with francois 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.410
 near the house of french radio 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 to have dinner together just because 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.050
 it was interesting he hit me up 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.090
 the depths of the soul 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.860
 show france wonders whether say 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.810
 anything president country or not 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 to understand for myself who is all the same 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.360
 such francois holland the last musketeer 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.350
 or simply wrong husband Dmitry Tarkov
