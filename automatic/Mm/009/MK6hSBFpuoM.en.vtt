00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.439
 Cialis the father I think you can congratulate him also one on one or are 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.810
 she dissatisfied with a point 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.730
 I'm not dissatisfied. "If you lead that, that's a pity 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.929
 Herbert Knaup 90 minutes I have to say that this is correct ads 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.070
 after the 1 0 in Munich after the surprise victory they have the feeling 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.119
 that her team today 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.119
 was light-footed or rather the opposite 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.039
 clearly that hard to say 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.299
 but we did not defend so well in Munich that is after 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.370
 women 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.970
 and playful 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.090
 that at Orhan 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 and a few good phases 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.090
 Percent with a lot of intelligence played too much complicated 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 So there were ten celebrities were also for that was unnecessary and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.550
 which we were too many ball losses 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.490
 Nevertheless, her team has then taken the lead 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.190
 Bender the 1 0 went then this Wendel some before failures again sets 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.070
 see the Christ and Marco Reus 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.480
 which penalty 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 it will surely first time now comes the outgoing 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.160
 SGS Kita there is something clear that is the interpretation but percent 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.300
 I have also seen McNamara scene today for example sounding Schalke 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.330
 Percent to 49 5 percent 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.860
 we also got a penalty two months ago we did not say 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 be under that is so 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.590
 1 0 Philipp Dahm Sammer her handwriting at Gladbach is this strong one 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 Defensive 14 conceded interlock coworkers work out how annoying 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.420
 is it then 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.720
 that she just received the goals then 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.540
 four minutes later then got as their crew were 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.930
 Delitzsch good there but that's the football fans he can happen too 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.430
 continue 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.020
 since that is clear therefore unnecessary ball losses he must the Basler 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.080
 or shoot forward with left 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.080
 unclear and Dr 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.479
 yes Cacau made the adviser as we are surprised it was a little hard 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.379
 Not 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.239
 No big threat threatened because we were in danger if they say he did 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.259
 linger in the beginning 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.170
 Jung introduces Uni Jantke true percent 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.340
 very many things next to outnumber 1 versus two of the former 1 against more 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.819
 the two areas at 11 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.629
 How sad he is in the end 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.249
 this social event took place 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.109
 we did not say that so well we're not happy with him 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.199
 the one point changes this good start for MÃ¶nchengladbach now 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.809
 something in the ambitions or are they already 0 4 points they against the 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:44.680
 Relegation has collected 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.769
 No percent 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.649
 It's going to be an enormously tough season for us, we want to percent 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.029
 Table rank six cents we have 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.359
 You once had 0 93 points against Bochum 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.239
 1 1 is sitting there 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.049
 and 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.810
 That's why I say we have to fight for every point right from the beginning 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.559
 We did so in Munich and today 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.639
 maybe the driver is compared to a 7
