come in retail packaging but from the

size of this box the weight and the
sound<00:01:43.079> I'm<00:01:44.390> guessing<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.930> gonna

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
sound I'm guessing that it's just gonna

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.410 
sound I'm guessing that it's just gonna
be<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.530> gold<00:01:46.860> nunchuck<00:01:47.520> wrapped<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.060> some

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
be a gold nunchuck wrapped in some

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
be a gold nunchuck wrapped in some
styrofoam<00:01:48.869> bubble<00:01:49.619> wrap<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.880> of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
styrofoam bubble wrap so that's kind of

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
styrofoam bubble wrap so that's kind of
disappointing<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.320> nice<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> get

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
I predicted the gold nunchuck controller

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.890 
I predicted the gold nunchuck controller
in<00:02:45.330> some<00:02:45.720> styrofoam<00:02:46.319> wrap<00:02:49.280> certainly<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.430> gold

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
in some styrofoam wrap certainly is gold

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.509 
in some styrofoam wrap certainly is gold
maybe<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.319> most<00:02:52.350> attractive<00:02:52.680> controller

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
maybe not the most attractive controller

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.870 
maybe not the most attractive controller
ever<00:02:53.790> but<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.690> does<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:55.140> nicely<00:02:55.380> with<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:56.160> gold

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
ever but it does go nicely with the gold

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.940 
ever but it does go nicely with the gold

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
apparently which is a little bit

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.599 
apparently which is a little bit
different<00:03:12.450> than<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.989> gold<00:03:13.709> classic
