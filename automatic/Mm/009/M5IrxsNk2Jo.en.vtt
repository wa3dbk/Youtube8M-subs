00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:03.850
 as he and then comes a bundesliga team 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.860
 the beginning of the matchday 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.949
 and the opening game is between 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:12.259
 Advantage Wolfsburg and Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.839
 and the top game 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.199
 celebrate Otto 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.779
 only for use 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.390
 for the opening game 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 between Wolfsburg and Gladbach 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.469
 I guess that Gladbach now in November they had a 2 12 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 Wolfsburg defeated 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.490
 that's the duel 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.640
 two a new coach and 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.220
 Gladbach's Bavarian coach 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.750
 Color has 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.750
 To decide June 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 Wolfsburg 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 the next encounter between FC Schalke 04 ahead the place FC 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.590
 Nuremberg and the jobs just 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.220
 DFB Cup 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 they play 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.910
 this game went into extra time this time 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.910
 can not give an extension but only win with Berg 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.690
 2 to 1 victory 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.829
 first it came between the TSG Hoffenheim roles 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.810
 the FSV Mainz 05 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.189
 Dollar, I tended the Hoffenheim with three to one wins Â» 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.670
 the next game 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.250
 the FC Cologne against 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.250
 Sc freiburg 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.020
 Cologne had against Hoffenheim 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.640
 Played a draw 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.350
 and Freiburg won against Wolfsburg but I think they can 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 the members 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.819
 since they play at home against Freiburg 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 to name two 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:21.239
 the next opponent is 12 between Kaiserslautern and Hamburger SV 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.999
 and 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.999
 Dallas fort four against Bremen won 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.769
 the Lower than at 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.409
 Lost 3 0 against Hannover 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.529
 but I think that the team does not win on Appelt but unfortunately 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 Abruptly win with a 3 2 victory 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:54.719
 the next match between FC St Pauli vacated 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.459
 Hannover 96 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.649
 yes also policeman Toprak was team Basler and Hannover 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.579
 the 1 Brooklyn 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.429
 can be better but they stand up 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:14.569
 the broadcaster did not expect that 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.779
 I tend to draw in this game 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.779
 whether a hard-fought use 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.989
 the next game is the goal for this game day namely between 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.969
 FC Bayern Munich 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:32.839
 Worms 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:35.889
 Borussia Dortmund are both first 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.629
 Bavaria at home 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.979
 Dortmund away 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:43.039
 therefore 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.039
 Unfortunately it will be a draw 2 2 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.369
 the first encounter is twelfth between 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:56.700
 Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.399
 and the VfB Stuttgart 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.759
 to Frankfurt still has not met 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.759
 I do not know what's going on with that 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.799
 and Stuttgart has 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.799
 lost two to 4 against Bayer Leverkusen 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.719
 I guess a draw, which is a goalless draw 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.490
 According to the match between Werder Bremen and Bayer Leverkusen and Sastre 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:35.969
 there were bizarre results 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
 two to six or one five to one 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.520
 but 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520
 Bremen is currently not in this mood 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.740
 so many goals 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.409
 Olav invade 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.860
 Maybe to get over 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.340
 Oliver GrÃ¼n will be one 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.340
 2 1 0 victory 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.249
 so also a signal 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.249
 that is collapsed 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:11.029
 later she can not be able to finish him again 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.629
 Comment RP 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:14.669
 and 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.879
 See you then 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:18.879
 "We are bitter again
