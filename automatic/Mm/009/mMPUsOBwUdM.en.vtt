well we're pretty excited about the
California<00:00:03.210> high<00:00:03.360> impact<00:00:03.780> tech<00:00:04.049> center

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
California high impact tech center

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.800 
California high impact tech center
because<00:00:05.609> what<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.910> does<00:00:06.060> it<00:00:06.299> gives<00:00:06.420> us<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
because what it does it gives us a

are very very excited and we really

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.630 
are very very excited and we really
think<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> customers<00:00:38.309> are<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
think of the customers are going to

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.790 
think of the customers are going to
benefit<00:00:39.059> from<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.480> from<00:00:39.750> both<00:00:39.960> spare<00:00:40.440> parts

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
benefit from this from both spare parts

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
benefit from this from both spare parts
standpoint<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.760> training<00:00:42.329> will<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.020> able<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
standpoint the training will be able to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.200 
standpoint the training will be able to
run<00:00:43.379> customer<00:00:43.950> demonstrations<00:00:44.760> hold

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
run customer demonstrations hold

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.959 
run customer demonstrations hold
seminars<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.980> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.730> much

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
seminars so we want to use this as much

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.510 
seminars so we want to use this as much
as<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.840> support<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.920> customer<00:00:50.340> base

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
as we can to support the customer base

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.350 
as we can to support the customer base
here<00:00:50.789> in<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.969> West

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.660 

milik<00:00:54.080> cron<00:00:54.290> isn't<00:00:54.680> one<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.130> best<00:00:55.340> at<00:00:55.550> what

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
milik cron isn't one of the best at what

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.230 
milik cron isn't one of the best at what
they<00:00:55.820> do<00:00:55.880> so<00:00:56.390> they<00:00:56.690> focus<00:00:57.440> on<00:00:57.590> technology<00:00:58.240> they

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
they do so they focus on technology they

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.450 
they do so they focus on technology they
focus<00:00:59.630> on<00:00:59.780> applying<00:01:00.200> that<00:01:00.560> technology<00:01:01.310> to

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
focus on applying that technology to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.160 
focus on applying that technology to
actually<00:01:01.610> do<00:01:02.000> something<00:01:02.330> rather<00:01:02.720> than<00:01:02.870> just

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
actually do something rather than just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.100 
actually do something rather than just
look<00:01:03.380> cool<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.950> and<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:05.080> operationalize<00:01:06.080> it

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
look cool and and they operationalize it

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.350 
look cool and and they operationalize it
by<00:01:06.500> building<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.160> facilities<00:01:07.760> and<00:01:08.000> building

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
by building the facilities and building

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.940 
by building the facilities and building
the<00:01:08.480> infrastructure<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.290> putting<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.680> tools

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
the infrastructure and putting the tools

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.400 
the infrastructure and putting the tools
together<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:11.090> help<00:01:11.360> us<00:01:11.540> achieve<00:01:11.690> what<00:01:12.260> it<00:01:12.380> is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
together that help us achieve what it is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.860 
together that help us achieve what it is
we're<00:01:12.680> trying<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.979> do<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:14.330> we're<00:01:14.510> we're<00:01:14.660> able

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
we're trying to do so we're we're able

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.150 
we're trying to do so we're we're able
to<00:01:14.930> support<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.350> machine<00:01:15.800> at<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.010> very

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
to support a machine at the very

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.920 
to support a machine at the very
beginning<00:01:16.490> all<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.700> way<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:16.940> the<00:01:17.120> end<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.540> all

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
fitting level in the screw level so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.790 
fitting level in the screw level so
you've<00:01:50.000> got<00:01:50.149> real<00:01:50.479> little<00:01:50.930> small<00:01:51.259> components

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
you've got real little small components

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.560 
you've got real little small components
along<00:01:52.490> with<00:01:52.700> some<00:01:52.910> of<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.090> major<00:01:53.210> components

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
along with some of the major components

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.780 
along with some of the major components
of<00:01:53.810> your<00:01:53.899> machine<00:01:54.170> as<00:01:54.290> well<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.610> really

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
of your machine as well so it really

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.000 
of your machine as well so it really
improves<00:01:56.119> your<00:01:56.270> ability<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.890> understand<00:01:57.890> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
improves your ability to understand the
