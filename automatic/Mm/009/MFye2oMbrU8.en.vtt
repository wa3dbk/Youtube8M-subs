00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.540
 after the death of bassinet 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.240
 many people rebelled against the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.940
 captain but nobody succeeded in 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.610
 change his opinion because he did not have 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.020
 choice other than to comply with the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.760
 your child a few weeks ago and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 the people eventually forgot all that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.890
 had happened the captain came back to his 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.390
 post and everything went back to normal 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.730
 for while Moses woman and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 regularly to the doctor examining the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.460
 baby to see if everything was okay with 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 he 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.360
 how it was at the beginning of its 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:01:04.350
 gestation it was impossible to verify this 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:06.750
 baby was or not infected years was in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 last month of gestation and began to 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.560
 feel strong pains 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.330
 she stopped going to the doctor for a while 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.110
 fearing that his son might be 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.240
 infected and try to kill the two 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.640
 but the pain only increased and she did not 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.390
 choose to go to the infirmary of the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.939
 ark 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.159
 the pieces the doctor went to meet him and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.890
 made all the diagnoses to see what 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.570
 was happening 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.799
 Ana realizes that something is bothering her 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.840
 He asks what happened. 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.159
 he bows his head and says that shortly before 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.329
 her, someone had just left 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.369
 then the following I checked that the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.740
 Your exams are okay with you. 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.020
 You 're in good health, it 's only you. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.030
 a little something because of his cold and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.429
 You'll be fine, so you can. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.229
 back there for the captain can make his 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.359
 things usually that nothing goes 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:03.119
 Happen, everything is good. Give me a hug. 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:05.369
 and bye, bye, was the woman from 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.190
 Captain she had gone wrong and was 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.530
 examinations to find out the cause and 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 worse happened 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.700
 the captain's wife was infected with 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 doctor was afraid to tell the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
 captain in fear of his reaction because 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.410
 when he killed his son Moses locked 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.470
 for weeks in her living room and cried all 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.360
 the days 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.430
 but the doctor had no choice and after 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.890
 to be convinced that it was obligation 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.400
 to do this he went to meet the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.400
 captain 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.150
 poor captain 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:57.660
 good afternoon is the captain I have a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:02.100
 horrible news to give you about your 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.780
 Wife, she was my office now. 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.600
 little and well I did all the exams more 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.810
 I ended up not really doing what 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.810

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:20.220

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:26.610

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.350
 wife is infected 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:37.860
 I've tried or verified I've refactored 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:41.430
 exams but she really has a 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:46.380
 infection rate so I'm sorry 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.830
 for the news this way but it's my 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.019
 I had to have done the 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.570
 Captain was devastated the first killed 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:04:00.000
 his son who loved very much and now 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:02.250
 who killed his wife when she knew 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.340
 the news did not do anything because I knew that 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.569
 had to be done 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.540

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.919
