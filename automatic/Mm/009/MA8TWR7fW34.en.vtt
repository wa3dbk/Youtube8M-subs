there's<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.540> problem<00:01:16.840> here<00:01:18.390> therefore<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.600> is

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
there's a problem here therefore it is

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.720 
there's a problem here therefore it is
not<00:01:19.870> surprising<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.190> program<00:01:21.550> won't

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
not surprising that the program won't

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.230 
not surprising that the program won't
allow<00:01:22.090> women<00:01:22.920> homosexuals<00:01:23.920> Jews<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.970> maybe

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
allow women homosexuals Jews and maybe

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.590 
allow women homosexuals Jews and maybe
even<00:01:25.420> Christians<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.140> participate<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:27.600> last

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
even Christians to participate and last

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.580 
even Christians to participate and last
time<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.840> checked<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.260> like<00:01:29.380> eighty

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
time I checked that was like eighty

time I checked that was like eighty
percent<00:01:29.800> of<00:01:30.100> our<00:01:30.220> campus<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.750> I'm<00:01:32.140> not<00:01:32.350> sure

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
percent of our campus so I'm not sure

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.220 
percent of our campus so I'm not sure
what's<00:01:32.860> gonna<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.610> mean<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.510> I<00:01:34.720> would<00:01:34.870> even<00:01:34.900> be

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
what's gonna I mean if I would even be

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.760 
what's gonna I mean if I would even be
reasonable<00:01:36.060> also<00:01:37.060> when<00:01:37.540> students<00:01:38.350> showed<00:01:38.590> up
