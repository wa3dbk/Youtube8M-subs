BM 20 so I think in the next couple of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.210 
BM 20 so I think in the next couple of
episodes<00:02:35.900> we've<00:02:36.350> got<00:02:36.470> five<00:02:36.620> episodes<00:02:37.010> left

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
we're gonna you know that will happen

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.949 
we're gonna you know that will happen
next<00:02:43.310> year<00:02:43.580> is<00:02:44.090> going<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.450> breaks<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.840> can

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
next year is going on breaks that can

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.210 
next year is going on breaks that can
maintain<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.320> quality<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.740> animation<00:02:45.830> so

maintain the quality of the animation so

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.260 
maintain the quality of the animation so
I<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.520> means<00:02:46.610> we've<00:02:46.790> only<00:02:46.850> got<00:02:46.970> five

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
I think that means we've only got five

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.110 
I think that means we've only got five
episodes<00:02:47.660> left<00:02:47.810> twenty<00:02:48.190> 20<00:02:49.190> through<00:02:49.340> 24<00:02:49.760> so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
episodes left twenty 20 through 24 so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.240 
episodes left twenty 20 through 24 so
twenty<00:02:50.330> twenty<00:02:50.510> one<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.780> two<00:02:50.959> or<00:02:51.170> three<00:02:51.200> 24<00:02:51.740> so

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
twenty twenty one to two or three 24 so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
twenty twenty one to two or three 24 so
we<00:02:52.340> got<00:02:52.459> five<00:02:52.760> episodes<00:02:53.090> left<00:02:53.300> after<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:54.050> one

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260

thirteen and I'm guessing will only be a
two<00:03:02.240> parts<00:03:02.570> like<00:03:02.720> they're<00:03:02.840> eight<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.080> other
