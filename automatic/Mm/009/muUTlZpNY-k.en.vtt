new<00:03:28.460> lip<00:03:28.670> readers<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.270> might<00:03:29.510> not<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:30.260> to

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
new lip readers you might not have to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.160 
new lip readers you might not have to
deal<00:03:30.650> with<00:03:30.800> so<00:03:30.980> much<00:03:31.130> backstory<00:03:31.850> or

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
deal with so much backstory or

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.660 
deal with so much backstory or
oversaturation<00:03:33.170> of<00:03:33.380> characters<00:03:33.830> I<00:03:34.010> think

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
oversaturation of characters I think

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.970 
oversaturation of characters I think
some<00:03:34.880> folks<00:03:35.090> are<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.480> little<00:03:36.020> discouraged<00:03:36.650> by

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
the history and the complications of the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.650 
the history and the complications of the
book<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:42.980> we<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:44.000> so<00:03:44.270> many<00:03:44.420> new<00:03:44.630> people

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
book so we have so many new people

book so we have so many new people
coming<00:03:45.110> on<00:03:45.350> from<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.710> crossover<00:03:46.340> who<00:03:47.150> were
