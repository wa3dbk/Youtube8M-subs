00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you are going to be able to see more how

what it actually does while you're

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.920 
what it actually does while you're
running<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> still<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.570> pretty<00:00:42.809> good

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
running but this is still a pretty good

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
running but this is still a pretty good
indicator<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.950> type<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> shoe<00:00:44.550> you'll

need<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.570> long<00:00:45.809> run<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.610> ideally

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
need to be in in the long run so ideally

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.190 
need to be in in the long run so ideally
the<00:00:48.059> wear<00:00:48.210> pattern<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.750> bottom<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> your

shoe biomechanically the most efficient

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
shoe biomechanically the most efficient
way<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.110> you're<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.860> slightly<00:00:53.309> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
way is if you're going to be slightly on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
way is if you're going to be slightly on
the<00:00:53.550> heel<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.570> you'll<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.530> roll

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the heel and then you'll want to roll

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.529 
the heel and then you'll want to roll
through<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> toe<00:00:56.430> off<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.879> big<00:00:57.090> toe<00:00:57.300> so

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
through and toe off on your big toe so

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.760 
through and toe off on your big toe so
most<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> wear<00:00:58.170> should<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.530> right<00:00:58.739> through

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
most of the wear should be right through

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430 
most of the wear should be right through
the<00:00:59.010> middle<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> forefoot<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.109> happen

to be an over pronator you're going to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.640 
to be an over pronator you're going to
see<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.449> more<00:01:03.480> wear<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> inside<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you would definitely want to go with

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.359 
you would definitely want to go with
more<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.510> stability<00:01:13.020> shoe<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.130> if

more of a stability shoe and then if

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.310 
more of a stability shoe and then if

the wear on the outside of the heel and

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.640 
the wear on the outside of the heel and
then<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> continue<00:01:18.810> along<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
then it's going to continue along the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.950 
then it's going to continue along the
outside<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.280> forefoot<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:21.659> as<00:01:21.780> if

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
exacerbate the problem another way you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.450 
exacerbate the problem another way you
can<00:01:36.720> find<00:01:36.960> out<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.380> home<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.920> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.280> shoe

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
can find out at home what kind of shoe
you're<00:01:38.640> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.850> need<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.270> called<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> wet

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
use a brown paper bag that works very

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
use a brown paper bag that works very
well<00:01:47.119> basically<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.659> need<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> is

well basically all you need to do is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
well basically all you need to do is
spray<00:01:50.009> down<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> bottom<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.759> foot<00:01:51.000> get

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
spray down the bottom of your foot get

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.810 
spray down the bottom of your foot get
it<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.079> wet<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.710> stand<00:01:53.549> on

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it a little bit wet and then stand on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.940 
it a little bit wet and then stand on
one<00:01:54.450> foot<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.110> weight<00:01:55.290> entirely<00:01:55.710> on

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
one foot with your weight entirely on

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.280 
one foot with your weight entirely on
that<00:01:56.100> foot<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.579> top<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> cardboard<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
that foot on top of the cardboard and

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.840 
that foot on top of the cardboard and
then<00:01:58.560> when<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:58.979> step<00:01:59.159> off<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.640> able<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
then when you step off and be able to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.480 
then when you step off and be able to
see<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> pattern<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.869> your<00:02:01.409> foot<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
see the pattern of your your foot so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.370 
see the pattern of your your foot so
there<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.909> three<00:02:03.299> basic<00:02:03.659> outcomes<00:02:04.110> for

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
there will be three basic outcomes for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.440 
there will be three basic outcomes for
the<00:02:04.469> wet<00:02:04.649> foot<00:02:04.920> test<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.360> you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the wet foot test one would be if you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.680 
the wet foot test one would be if you
see<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.990> large<00:02:07.829> wide<00:02:08.190> pattern<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
see a large wide pattern on the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.949 
see a large wide pattern on the
cardboard<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:11.250> arch<00:02:11.700> area<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.390> completely

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
cardboard the arch area is completely

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.920 
cardboard the arch area is completely
filled<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
filled in

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.750 
filled in
then<00:02:14.079> you're<00:02:14.260> most<00:02:15.010> likely<00:02:15.250> going<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.579> need<00:02:15.730> a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
then you're most likely going to need a

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.699 
then you're most likely going to need a
stability<00:02:16.000> shoe<00:02:16.480> because<00:02:16.659> obviously<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
stability shoe because obviously you

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.410 
stability shoe because obviously you
have<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:17.920> lower<00:02:18.370> arch<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.909> you're<00:02:19.000> going<00:02:19.329> to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
have a lower arch and you're going to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.800 
have a lower arch and you're going to
see<00:02:19.569> that<00:02:19.750> pressed<00:02:20.140> into<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:21.159> cardboard<00:02:21.459> on

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
see that pressed into the cardboard on

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.530 
see that pressed into the cardboard on
with<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.959> water<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.519> have<00:02:24.549> a<00:02:25.000> higher<00:02:25.510> arch

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
with the water if you have a higher arch

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.809 
with the water if you have a higher arch
you're<00:02:26.079> going<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.290> see<00:02:26.500> basically<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:27.579> a

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
you're going to see basically just a

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.119 
you're going to see basically just a
thin<00:02:28.359> outline<00:02:28.599> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.349> outer<00:02:29.620> edge<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:30.069> your

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
thin outline on the outer edge of your

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.770 
thin outline on the outer edge of your
foot<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.730> that's<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.359> indicate<00:02:31.719> that

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
foot and that's going to indicate that

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.599 
foot and that's going to indicate that
your<00:02:32.049> arch<00:02:32.230> isn't<00:02:32.650> touching<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:33.099> ground<00:02:33.219> and

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
your arch isn't touching the ground and

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.000 
your arch isn't touching the ground and
you're<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.329> to<00:02:34.359> most<00:02:34.840> likely<00:02:35.019> need<00:02:35.469> more<00:02:35.859> of

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
you're going to most likely need more of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.179 
you're going to most likely need more of
a<00:02:36.159> neutral<00:02:36.969> shoe<00:02:37.269> if<00:02:38.079> you<00:02:38.290> end<00:02:38.590> up<00:02:38.739> falling

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
a neutral shoe if you end up falling

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.970 
a neutral shoe if you end up falling
somewhere<00:02:39.579> in<00:02:39.819> between<00:02:39.939> that<00:02:40.480> it's<00:02:41.260> probably

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
somewhere in between that it's probably

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.890 
somewhere in between that it's probably
best<00:02:42.189> then<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.639> look<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.299> wear<00:02:43.450> pattern<00:02:43.780> on

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
best then to look at the wear pattern on

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.879 
best then to look at the wear pattern on
the<00:02:43.989> bottom<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.349> your<00:02:44.409> shoe

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
the bottom of your shoe

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.649 
the bottom of your shoe
to<00:02:45.219> kind<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.459> help<00:02:45.639> assess<00:02:46.030> whether<00:02:46.329> or<00:02:46.450> not

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
to kind of help assess whether or not

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.030 
to kind of help assess whether or not
you're<00:02:46.840> going<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.019> need<00:02:47.200> more<00:02:47.620> of<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.829> stability

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you're going to need more of a stability

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.629 
you're going to need more of a stability
shoe<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.730> more<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> neutral<00:02:49.419> shoe
