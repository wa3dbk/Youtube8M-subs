00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:37.380
 Unpack it because we have that first 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:43.910
 device itself packs the device well 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:59.340

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:52.210
 electricity then listen for speakers 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:58.040
 wherein the car holder, the device also 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:05.930
 he can always use the vehicle 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:07.430
 Man in car with connection cable and one 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:26.959
 ground plate then you can open it up 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:35.239
 Dashboard stick in and out 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.890
 To connect europe and then you have to 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:41.019
 the three pin plug you can 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.019
 then discover it on the front 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:57.069
 this is kalle galiplan his motorcycle 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.069
 clock with base camp but he was annoyed 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.310
 his gps always took him somewhere else 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.159
 the routes led through cities yes 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.890
 wanted to drive around on freeways city 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.440
 only roads do not cross the roads 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:18.739
 you want to ride it so far 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:21.920
 discovered the basecamp handbook 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.590
 Good concept for planning better 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.829
 planning with waypoints good options 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:33.470
 for motorcyclists easy motorcycle 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:36.440
 Plan routes now kalle happy is like that 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.950
 as he does not want unnecessary stopps 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.140
 more 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.370
 the gps takes him where he wants to go 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.370
 click here to the base camp 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:06.220
 I still have a little bit more 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:10.530
 further unpacked so that's the ball 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.060
 bracket the here on the motorcycle 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.060
 holder and connector is screwed 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:25.860
 because then the device is used and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.630
 keeps super stable 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.130
 here is then lateral release button 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:36.100
 that you can get the device out 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:42.810
 of course I can do that too 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:49.990
 protective cap attaching the holder 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:57.760
 heard here the intermediate piece found it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:05:02.520
 very robust and stable medium for 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:09.580
 tighten or you can also with 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 eyes directly on the surface or up 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:17.440
 an area or disguise 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:20.790
 screws and can be developed by gps 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.850
 then stop 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.169
 this is the car holder with suction cup 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:31.800
 can stick to the disc as well 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.030
 insert device 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:39.340

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:41.820

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:59.010
 with waterproof rubber seal in the device 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:07.860
 is already a 4 gb micro sd and styleless 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:10.760
 Do not drive that way anymore 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.760
 cards are preinstalled 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.570
 Maps are pre-installed from Europe 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.960

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.720
