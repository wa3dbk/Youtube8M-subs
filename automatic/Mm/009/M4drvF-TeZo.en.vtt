00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
put in there that it's super complicated

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.140 
put in there that it's super complicated
but<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> few<00:01:17.430> more<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.729> speed<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
but i will do a few more time speed is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.690 
but i will do a few more time speed is
slower<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:19.020> pause<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> video<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.549> want

slower so do pause the video if you want

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
slower so do pause the video if you want
to<00:01:20.880> them<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> see<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.409> all<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
to them so you can see how I do all the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
way so swing cup vomit another swing car

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.749 
way so swing cup vomit another swing car
slide<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.060> all<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.900> way<00:01:30.990> through<00:01:31.759> ring

slide it in all the way through ring

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.060 
slide it in all the way through ring
finger<00:01:33.150> grab<00:01:34.250> index<00:01:35.250> from<00:01:35.610> there<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.240> they're

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
finger grab index from there so they're

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
finger grab index from there so they're
over<00:01:39.530> spin<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.650> your<00:01:40.770> finger<00:01:41.299> drop<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.899> put<00:01:43.079> on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
over spin on your finger drop and put on

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.950 
over spin on your finger drop and put on
top<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> good<00:01:45.180> faster<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.600> time

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.990 

whoops<00:01:51.910> will<00:01:52.910> slip<00:01:53.180> there<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:55.520> might<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> bit

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
whoops will slip there it might be a bit

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.220 
whoops will slip there it might be a bit
more<00:01:56.060> complicated<00:01:56.390> for<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:56.780> guys<00:01:56.960> as<00:01:57.110> well

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
more complicated for you guys as well

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.590 
more complicated for you guys as well
because<00:01:57.590> I<00:01:58.310> am<00:01:58.730> doing<00:01:58.940> this<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.180> my<00:01:59.270> left<00:01:59.420> hand

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
because I am doing this in my left hand

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.470 
because I am doing this in my left hand
so<00:01:59.900> you<00:02:00.140> might<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.500> doing<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.980> in<00:02:01.130> your<00:02:01.940> right

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
so you might be doing it in your right

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.380 
so you might be doing it in your right
hand<00:02:02.510> like<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.670> which<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:05.030> can't<00:02:05.270> really

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
hand like that so which I can't really

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.830 
hand like that so which I can't really
do<00:02:06.010> but<00:02:07.010> I'll<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.000> more<00:02:08.030> time<00:02:08.180> just<00:02:08.720> to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
do but I'll do it one more time just to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.330 
do but I'll do it one more time just to
