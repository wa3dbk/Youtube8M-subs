00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.090 
eyeliner and for today I'll be using the
cicchitto<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:25.630> this<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.020> usually<00:03:26.200> how<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.709> start

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
cicchitto so this is usually how I start

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.130 
cicchitto so this is usually how I start
I<00:03:27.310> start<00:03:27.790> from<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.300> outer<00:03:28.450> corner<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.959> my<00:03:29.110> eye

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
I start from the outer corner of my eye

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.290 
I start from the outer corner of my eye
instead<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.950> away<00:03:30.160> color<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.580> my<00:03:30.790> arm<00:03:30.970> I

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
instead of the away color of my arm I

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.150 
instead of the away color of my arm I
don't<00:03:31.900> prefer<00:03:32.200> thick<00:03:32.470> eyeliner<00:03:32.830> because<00:03:33.130> I

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
don't prefer thick eyeliner because I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.580 
don't prefer thick eyeliner because I
want<00:03:33.520> it<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.670> be<00:03:33.910> as<00:03:34.060> natural<00:03:34.090> as<00:03:34.630> possible
