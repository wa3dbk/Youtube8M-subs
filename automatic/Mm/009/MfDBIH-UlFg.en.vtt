00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 Y 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.970
 I have not seen creative ideas back 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.029
 here with double hand ties from the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.369
 teacher are we no longer have to do 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.169
 actions to finish then in the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.259
 let's bend the little tips of this 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.119
 way we cut so that the friends in 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.450
 the houses learn to do the most 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.989
 leaning age and finally we're going to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.390
 hit the provokes epoxy funds to the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 veneer I really love decorating with this 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.789
 we can also do it with mass 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.739
 flexible people place the upl and the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.769
 detail that you like but as 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.289
 we have the image of the same tape 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.730
 I love decorating them like this and finally 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.480
 but we will place it to decorate 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.750
 a simple braid with three ribbons that 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.780
 has the colors in harmony harmony in 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.140
 combination with him 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:14.650
 or where we have the ankle here 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 braided 300 with double loop that 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.360
 do for here 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.100
 so that it is getting closer we are going to 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.799
 perform now the second ones are the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.509
 objects that go to do this we go 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.570
 to analysis and also what are the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.270
 material organists will need two 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.770
 grosgrain ribbons number five stamped from 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:42.789
 25 centimeters 4 gross ribbons number 5 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.640
 one and 25 centimeters colors 5 ribbons 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.579
 gross number 51 and color but of 13 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.399
 centimeters a gross tape number 2 of 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.819
 50 centimeters a gross tape number 2 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.310
 40 centimeters another ribbon two ribbons 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.610
 gross number 2 of 30 centimeters a 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.689
 apply a hook and of course our 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.630
 5 ok then let's start by placing 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.910
 one of the colored ribbons on the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.710
 stamped stick 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.420
 extreme and extreme extreme and a little bit 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.970
 of silicon also in the center so that 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.970
 the tape will not be released 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.270
 and then let back to unite 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.360
 the center sorry at the end 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.630
 and we take it to the center what 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 we call 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.650
 a double loop because it has two sides 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.930
 thanks to the internal contrast if with 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.680
 the tape we repeat the same 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.950
 procedure with the patterned tape and 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520
 uni color all the tapes we're going to 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.630
 Bend 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.660
 in this way 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:00.990
 to make the concrete tie even though you 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.430
 telephone number 0424 96 17 361 the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.930
 phone number in our workshop 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.320
 information about our courses and also 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.930
 of the courses the teachers are that

 has a spectacular display of everything 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.070
 what she has here with the least we are going 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.530
 to have what are the spots and the guides 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.970
 Loop sale if they wish and also 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.090
 samples then of the different courses 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.220
 that give advanced basic loops 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.690
 intermediate also the different types 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.550
 of braid to the headbands something good 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.950
 well a well detailed well several times 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.170
 giving in a variety of things for 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.730
 you pay for the house then we go to 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.750
 assemble the loop as follows 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.610
 we are going to place silicone in the center and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.970
 we are going to do to paste it in the form of 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 X 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.680
 now let's make the base of the loop 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.930
 then we are going to paste in the center the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.590
 tapes also in the form of x are 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.380
 decorated with the steep ribbon too 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.140
 We have sale of tapes of all 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.150
 disney princesses of many motives 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.520
 that are that last and very moved 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.850
 when we saw it the first cut what 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.190
 is the wide range that has variety 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.530
 and spectacular views of barbie the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.900
 we are seeing that we and good 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.790
 being allies that these also the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.650
 tulas bndes to the back if it is now 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.310
 we sell to be of such a part 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:30.040
 per month per meter and per roll then 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.129
 we continue loop decoration let's go 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.369
 to hit a type 8 bow 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.949
 in the center of the tie with which we have 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:43.179
 made with the tape of 50 centimeters 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:46.689
 with the 40-centimeter tape we place 

00:04:43.179 --> 00:04:51.050
 we do the same procedure 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:54.499
 and finally I wanted to show you here wings 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.119
 as we are going to do the friends went down a 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:58.969
 little bit more the hand we separate for the 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:00.860
 appreciate we are going to make the bow 8 of 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:04.560
 these and in these ways we double those of 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.270
 the 18 we have to go for a break 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.820
 finished here to go to the break 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.220
 commercial 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.590
 know how they're going to do it, always 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.560
 they ask how you do that there you have to 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.870
 make the 18 super easy and practical but 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.330
 a small commercial break back to 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.370
 our last segment and this program 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.150
 super colorful with the sun teacher 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.150
 sun creation called
