overnight in the freezer and I'm going

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.840 
overnight in the freezer and I'm going
to<00:00:41.520> grade<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.540> box<00:00:42.989> grater<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

get<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.020> thinking<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.829> may<00:00:50.070> be

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
get so what I'm thinking is this may be

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
get so what I'm thinking is this may be
a<00:00:50.250> good<00:00:50.550> technique<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> help<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.899> butter<00:00:52.230> get

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
a good technique to help that butter get

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979

i'm going to put that in with my flour

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.180 
i'm going to put that in with my flour

and then i'm going to very quickly with
my<00:02:14.400> fingertips<00:02:14.940> i'm<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.630> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.840> kind<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
my fingertips i'm just going to kind of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920 
my fingertips i'm just going to kind of
incorporate<00:02:16.790> those<00:02:17.790> bits<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.390> butter<00:02:18.600> all

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
incorporate those bits of butter all

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.250 
incorporate those bits of butter all
through<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.890> flour<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.209> can<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.450> it

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
through the flour and as you can see it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.949 
through the flour and as you can see it
really<00:02:23.030> makes<00:02:24.030> these<00:02:24.269> fine<00:02:24.600> little

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
really makes these fine little

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.600 
really makes these fine little
Butterball's<00:02:25.530> all<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.100> way<00:02:26.220> through<00:02:26.519> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
Butterball's all the way through the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280 
Butterball's all the way through the
flour<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.269> think<00:02:27.540> that's<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:27.810> going<00:02:28.230> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
flour and I think that's really going to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.520 
flour and I think that's really going to
make<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.890> nice<00:02:29.190> scone<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.600> quickly<00:02:31.170> get<00:02:31.380> all

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
make for a nice scone so quickly get all

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.860 
make for a nice scone so quickly get all
that<00:02:31.739> butter<00:02:32.100> through<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.610> flour<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.360> then

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that butter through the flour and then

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.590 
that butter through the flour and then
go<00:02:34.170> ahead<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.620> dump<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.580> sour<00:02:35.910> cream<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
go ahead and dump the sour cream and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.340 
go ahead and dump the sour cream and

rolling pin but then I'm going to take

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.530 
rolling pin but then I'm going to take
this<00:03:37.920> i'm<00:03:38.190> going<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.519> fold<00:03:38.820> it<00:03:39.060> into<00:03:39.299> thirds

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
this i'm going to fold it into thirds

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.340 
this i'm going to fold it into thirds
one<00:03:40.500> end<00:03:40.799> over<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:41.910> another<00:03:42.239> end<00:03:42.630> over

one end over and then another end over
and<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.069> again<00:03:44.549> in<00:03:44.579> thirds<00:03:45.299> this<00:03:46.140> way<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.560> i

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
and then again in thirds this way so i

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.460 
and then again in thirds this way so i
end<00:03:47.100> up<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.760> really<00:03:48.120> tall<00:03:48.630> kind<00:03:49.230> of

end up with this really tall kind of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890 
end up with this really tall kind of
square<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.579> then<00:03:51.180> what<00:03:51.390> i'm<00:03:51.510> going<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.720> do<00:03:51.870> is

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
square and then what i'm going to do is

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.259 
square and then what i'm going to do is
