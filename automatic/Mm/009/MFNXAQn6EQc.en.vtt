put<00:04:55.720> them<00:04:55.810> in<00:04:55.900> paper<00:04:56.170> I<00:04:56.530> usually<00:04:56.980> do<00:04:57.130> just<00:04:57.340> to

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
put them in paper I usually do just to

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.730 
put them in paper I usually do just to
secure<00:04:57.670> them<00:04:57.820> together<00:04:57.910> but<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.990> best<00:04:59.200> option

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
secure them together but the best option

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.710 
secure them together but the best option
is<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.400> go<00:05:00.670> with<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.880> small<00:05:01.150> box<00:05:01.360> when<00:05:01.660> you're

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
is to go with a small box when you're

is to go with a small box when you're
sending<00:05:02.080> probably<00:05:02.410> three<00:05:02.830> sometimes<00:05:03.730> two<00:05:04.000> I

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
sending probably three sometimes two I

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.600 
sending probably three sometimes two I
sent<00:05:04.420> to<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.680> package<00:05:05.680> like<00:05:05.860> his<00:05:06.040> before<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:06.580> I

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
sent to a package like his before but I

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.920 
sent to a package like his before but I
really<00:05:07.060> put<00:05:07.180> a<00:05:07.210> lot<00:05:07.270> of<00:05:07.480> cardboard<00:05:07.690> and

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
really put a lot of cardboard and

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.080 
really put a lot of cardboard and
they're<00:05:08.050> just<00:05:08.230> secure<00:05:08.950> it<00:05:08.980> but<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.490> box<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.030> of

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
they're just secure it but a box and of

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.420 
course inside that box you want to have
I<00:05:13.180> put<00:05:13.360> some<00:05:13.480> example<00:05:13.900> stuff<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.170> here<00:05:14.350> added<00:05:15.280> a

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
I put some example stuff in here added a

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.960 
I put some example stuff in here added a
bubble<00:05:15.970> wrap<00:05:16.150> which<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.630> guys<00:05:17.160> can<00:05:18.160> hear<00:05:18.490> or

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
bubble wrap which you guys can hear or

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
the other option to the example would be

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.270 
the other option to the example would be
peanuts

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
peanuts

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.460 
peanuts

to really pull it hard and pull kids get

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.060 
to really pull it hard and pull kids get
a<00:05:47.920> lot<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.160> money<00:05:48.310> out<00:05:48.520> of<00:05:48.550> your<00:05:48.730> port<00:05:49.030> for

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
a lot of money out of your port for

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.880 
a lot of money out of your port for
shipping<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.670> list<00:05:52.240> things<00:05:52.540> and<00:05:52.960> fees<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.740> so

shipping to list things and fees and so

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.830 
shipping to list things and fees and so
you<00:05:54.010> know<00:05:54.130> $3<00:05:54.760> for<00:05:55.000> an<00:05:55.060> envelope<00:05:55.300> like<00:05:55.420> this

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
you know $3 for an envelope like this

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480 
you know $3 for an envelope like this
that's<00:05:56.530> probably<00:05:56.830> about<00:05:56.980> right<00:05:57.220> if<00:05:57.400> you're

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
that's probably about right if you're

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.570 
that's probably about right if you're
asking<00:05:57.730> for<00:05:57.760> shipping<00:05:58.180> fees<00:05:59.220> if<00:06:00.220> you're<00:06:00.430> a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
asking for shipping fees if you're a

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.700 
asking for shipping fees if you're a
little<00:06:01.120> bit<00:06:01.210> bigger<00:06:01.360> like<00:06:01.510> a<00:06:01.570> box<00:06:01.840> you<00:06:02.080> may<00:06:02.230> ask

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
little bit bigger like a box you may ask

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.340 
little bit bigger like a box you may ask
for<00:06:03.100> more<00:06:03.340> I<00:06:03.730> usually<00:06:04.420> ask<00:06:04.510> $3<00:06:04.990> shipping<00:06:05.020> and

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
for more I usually ask $3 shipping and

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.160 
for more I usually ask $3 shipping and
handling<00:06:05.800> for<00:06:06.370> one<00:06:06.670> graded<00:06:07.090> card<00:06:07.360> and<00:06:07.630> then

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
handling for one graded card and then

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.750 
handling for one graded card and then
every<00:06:08.410> graded<00:06:08.770> card<00:06:08.920> after<00:06:09.190> that's<00:06:09.310> a<00:06:09.490> dollar

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
every graded card after that's a dollar

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.120 
every graded card after that's a dollar
so<00:06:10.690> you<00:06:10.990> know<00:06:11.140> four<00:06:11.410> dollars<00:06:11.740> I<00:06:11.830> can<00:06:11.980> probably

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
so you know four dollars I can probably

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.760 
so you know four dollars I can probably
ship<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.900> and<00:06:13.900> be<00:06:13.990> pretty<00:06:14.230> close<00:06:14.440> to<00:06:14.620> be<00:06:14.710> able

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
ship to and be pretty close to be able

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.900 
ship to and be pretty close to be able
to<00:06:14.890> be<00:06:15.010> safe<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.430> have<00:06:15.550> delivery

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
to be safe and have delivery

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.790 
to be safe and have delivery
confirmation<00:06:16.090> etc<00:06:16.840> if<00:06:17.170> I<00:06:17.260> get<00:06:17.410> to<00:06:17.500> three<00:06:17.680> or

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
confirmation etc if I get to three or

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.010 
confirmation etc if I get to three or
four<00:06:18.040> I<00:06:18.280> probably<00:06:18.820> want<00:06:19.120> to<00:06:19.180> go<00:06:19.270> to<00:06:19.330> a<00:06:19.450> box<00:06:19.750> and

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
four I probably want to go to a box and

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.960 
four I probably want to go to a box and
so<00:06:20.170> in<00:06:20.260> five<00:06:20.590> dollars<00:06:21.040> I<00:06:21.280> could<00:06:21.550> probably<00:06:21.790> get

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:21.970 
so in five dollars I could probably get

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.700 
so in five dollars I could probably get
one<00:06:22.120> of<00:06:22.210> these<00:06:22.330> probably<00:06:22.780> for<00:06:22.990> less<00:06:23.110> than<00:06:23.260> $1

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
one of these probably for less than $1

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:24.990 
one of these probably for less than $1
sending<00:06:24.070> it<00:06:24.160> off<00:06:24.280> is<00:06:24.370> probably<00:06:24.460> too<00:06:24.730> costly

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
sending it off is probably too costly

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.720 
sending it off is probably too costly
two<00:06:25.210> dollars<00:06:25.600> if<00:06:26.170> that<00:06:26.230> may<00:06:26.830> be<00:06:26.890> too<00:06:27.160> little

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
two dollars if that may be too little

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.670 
two dollars if that may be too little
over<00:06:27.940> to<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.180> the<00:06:28.270> most<00:06:28.510> and<00:06:28.630> so<00:06:28.720> you<00:06:29.350> will<00:06:29.530> get
