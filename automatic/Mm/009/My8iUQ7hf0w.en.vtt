00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.260 

and<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.400> guess<00:02:42.580> at<00:02:42.760> some<00:02:42.790> point<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.240> time

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
and I guess at some point in time

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.920 
and I guess at some point in time
there's<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.010> psychological<00:02:45.010> barrier<00:02:45.930> well

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
there's the psychological barrier well

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.450 
there's the psychological barrier well
there<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.380> more<00:02:47.560> time<00:02:47.770> she<00:02:48.010> lose<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
there is the more time she lose to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.630 
there is the more time she lose to
somebody<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.290> harder<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.440> gets<00:02:50.740> to<00:02:51.100> break

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
somebody the harder it gets to break

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.750 
somebody the harder it gets to break
that

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.100 

you're<00:03:01.760> thinking<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.120> maybe<00:03:02.420> after<00:03:02.600> the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
you're thinking that maybe after the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.900 
you're thinking that maybe after the
Italian<00:03:03.680> where<00:03:03.860> she<00:03:04.010> beat<00:03:04.220> Martina<00:03:04.730> in<00:03:04.820> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
Italian where she beat Martina in the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.120 
Italian where she beat Martina in the
semis<00:03:05.330> then<00:03:05.630> faced<00:03:05.930> Fe<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.470> finals<00:03:06.860> maybe

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
semis then faced Fe in the finals maybe

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.610 
semis then faced Fe in the finals maybe
that<00:03:07.460> would<00:03:07.640> have<00:03:07.730> been<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.060> week<00:03:08.440> she<00:03:09.440> did

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that would have been the week she did

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.560 
that would have been the week she did
that<00:03:09.740> five<00:03:10.070> four<00:03:10.310> six<00:03:10.460> six<00:03:10.700> love<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.240> final

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
that five four six six love in the final

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.560 
that five four six six love in the final
there<00:03:11.720> I<00:03:12.370> think<00:03:13.370> she'd<00:03:13.700> spend<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.180> much<00:03:14.300> more

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
there I think she'd spend so much more

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:44.390 
there I think she'd spend so much more
energy

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.979 

I<00:03:47.870> think<00:03:48.870> just<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.409> way<00:03:49.439> she<00:03:49.739> produces<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.840> we

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
I think just the way she produces as we

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.750 
I think just the way she produces as we
just<00:03:52.200> watch<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:52.560> magnificent<00:03:53.310> full<00:03:53.519> hand

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
just watch this magnificent full hand

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.580 
just watch this magnificent full hand
down<00:03:53.909> the<00:03:54.060> line<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.569> think<00:03:55.459> production<00:04:00.590> a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
down the line I think production a

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.130 
down the line I think production a
triple<00:04:02.579> match<00:04:02.760> point<00:04:03.209> once<00:04:03.480> again<00:04:03.629> they're

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
triple match point once again they're

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:19.219 
triple match point once again they're
asking<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.099> crowd<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.519> please<00:04:05.790> be<00:04:06.000> quiet<00:04:18.229> just

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
asking the crowd to please be quiet just

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.469 
asking the crowd to please be quiet just
the<00:04:19.350> way<00:04:19.500> she<00:04:19.739> goes<00:04:19.949> about<00:04:20.280> things<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.940> trying

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
the way she goes about things the trying

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.340 
the way she goes about things the trying
to<00:04:21.600> get<00:04:21.690> that<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.109> first<00:04:22.350> serve<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:24.350> stephy

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
to get that big first serve and stephy

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.960 
to get that big first serve and stephy
it<00:04:25.410> seems<00:04:25.650> so<00:04:25.800> easy<00:04:25.830> now<00:04:26.400> when<00:04:26.550> she's<00:04:26.760> after

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
it seems so easy now when she's after

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.370 
it seems so easy now when she's after
the<00:04:27.090> way<00:04:27.270> she<00:04:27.419> hits<00:04:27.630> her<00:04:27.750> shots<00:04:28.020> even<00:04:28.199> though

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the way she hits her shots even though

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
she hits him with excellent pace which

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.379 
she hits him with excellent pace which
is<00:04:30.240> always<00:04:30.600> inside<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.979> baseline<00:04:32.669> when<00:04:33.240> she

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
is always inside the baseline when she

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.710
