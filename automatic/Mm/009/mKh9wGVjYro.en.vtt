bar<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> slider<00:01:03.210> bar<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.350> sorry<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
bar and the slider bar and sorry it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.230 
bar and the slider bar and sorry it's
attached<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.780> slider<00:01:07.409> bar<00:01:08.299> as<00:01:09.299> shown

attached to the slider bar as shown
usually<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:13.110> happens<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:14.100> start<00:01:14.130> off

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
usually what happens is you start off

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
usually what happens is you start off
with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.830> sliding<00:01:17.240> saddle<00:01:18.470> close<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> end

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
with the sliding saddle close to the end

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.640 
with the sliding saddle close to the end
and<00:01:21.830> as<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.979> move<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.840> closer<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> central

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and as you move it closer to the central

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.780 
and as you move it closer to the central
bar<00:01:26.240> they<00:01:27.560> saw<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> Central<00:01:29.070> Coast<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.520> slider

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bar they saw in Central Coast to slider

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.249 
bar they saw in Central Coast to slider
bar<00:01:30.320> drops<00:01:31.320> down<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:32.070> their<00:01:33.060> distance<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
bar drops down and their distance it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.200 
bar drops down and their distance it
drops<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.979> covered<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> stringline

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
drops down is covered by the stringline

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
drops down is covered by the stringline
the<00:01:36.479> stringline<00:01:36.720> gets<00:01:37.259> hot<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.850> drops<00:01:39.060> down

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the stringline gets hot as it drops down

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
the stringline gets hot as it drops down
and<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> tip<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.899> slider<00:01:43.860> bar<00:01:46.009> describes

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and the tip of the slider bar describes

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.649 
and the tip of the slider bar describes
parabola<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:50.540> because<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.290> central<00:01:53.189> post

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
parabola and because the central post

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.120 
parabola and because the central post
can<00:01:54.659> swivel<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.159> do<00:01:56.479> a<00:02:00.740> parabolic<00:02:01.740> bowl

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
can swivel you can do a parabolic bowl

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.050 
can swivel you can do a parabolic bowl
with<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.939> device<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.719> describe

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
with this device you can describe

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.419 
with this device you can describe
parabolic<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.259> the<00:02:07.259> importance<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
parabolic or the importance of that is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.880 
parabolic or the importance of that is
the<00:02:08.970> sand

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
the sand

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.860 
the sand
parabolic<00:02:10.759> bowls<00:02:11.120> are<00:02:11.600> ideal<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:13.870> solar

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
parabolic bowls are ideal for solar

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.559 
parabolic bowls are ideal for solar

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
cookers for the reflectors for solar

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.120 
cookers for the reflectors for solar
cookers<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.520> a<00:02:19.550> very<00:02:20.150> simple<00:02:20.860> way<00:02:21.860> of

cookers and this is a very simple way of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.199 
cookers and this is a very simple way of
making<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:22.880> if<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:23.690> use<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:24.080> device<00:02:25.209> you

making one if you use this device you

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.500 
making one if you use this device you
can<00:02:26.920> accurately<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.520> your<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> parabolic<00:02:29.150> ball

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
can accurately do your a parabolic ball

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:37.090 
can accurately do your a parabolic ball
without<00:02:30.500> any<00:02:33.700> anything<00:02:34.700> really<00:02:35.300> really<00:02:36.100> fancy
