00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.719
 new tutorial from lockerbie xd today 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.230
 I will show we build a bell 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.480
 in minecraft house and we one 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.400
 Door opener makes if you just in one 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.150
 completely different space since the very far away 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.279
 is not coming quickly turks 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.930
 then start a makeshift house 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 built 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 yes does not look nice here is one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:41.040
 button so well heard the then ton 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:52.649
 You can also tune 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:55.590
 Let's just go in here for a moment 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.309
 Above here is this is behind here 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.809
 the button behind this blog is the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.519
 button then just occupy one here 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.000
 legal form and then she sets now 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.400
 admittedly, note blocks 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.409
 that what I just handled so 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.549
 now then you can set it like that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.549
 by not clicking on it click 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.990
 that is so bad 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:45.659
 washington now has that for you 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.549
 someone comes and you have no desire 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.179
 now run all this way to this 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.670
 to be over the door so you are 2 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.060
 playing in the coastal area or bringing 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.459
 yes, I just now what to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.189
 example this stadium 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:10.519
 what does that open both doors 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:13.079
 automatically at the same time have built 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:25.250
 so they closed again 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:30.390
 Although I have had a blog here 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 So, you have to look at the first one 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.370
 last amplifier put down where the door 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.109
 then you have to put redstone like that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.349
 now made back here to the 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.349
 switch that should be the second door 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:48.239
 I just prolonged that and went 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:50.310
 it does not settle here then 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.720
 I have strengthened here because it 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.889
 worked 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.889
 I do not know why either 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.760
 then it goes here and comes to the 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.440
 amplifier to the door must go 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.070
 take care that you do not go here 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.390
 starts because we disconnect the line 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.920
 so be careful that firstly 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.920
 Second, continue 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.689
 depends on it 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.370
 Well done that here no monster 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.510
 that was it relegation 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.980
 you can sometimes the comments 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.430
 write 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.440
 I can do that and show you this up 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.440
 next time a blogger boy
