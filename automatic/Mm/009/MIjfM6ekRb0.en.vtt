00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
once or twice but this game I managed

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.910 
once or twice but this game I managed
still<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> entire<00:01:35.220> time<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.960> went<00:01:37.200> 23

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.960 
well it was good that it was a Follis
and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.299> did<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.790> gun

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
and I did it with the and it's a gun

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.210 
and I did it with the and it's a gun
that<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.149> haven't<00:01:48.329> used<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.009> shown<00:01:50.009> yet

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.300 
second one follows luckily that was a
little<00:03:53.870> late<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:56.480> didn't<00:03:57.260> have<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.949> was

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
little late so I didn't have to I was

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.210 
little late so I didn't have to I was
able<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.669> stay<00:03:58.849> in<00:03:58.879> at<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.209> entire<00:03:59.480> time<00:03:59.750> in

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
able to stay in at the entire time in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.920 
able to stay in at the entire time in
this<00:04:01.220> game<00:04:01.310> it's<00:04:01.639> getting<00:04:01.940> pretty<00:04:02.449> close<00:04:02.690> to

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
this game it's getting pretty close to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.440 
this game it's getting pretty close to
the<00:04:03.049> end<00:04:03.340> these<00:04:04.340> guys<00:04:04.519> weren't<00:04:04.940> too<00:04:05.209> good

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
the end these guys weren't too good

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.540 
the end these guys weren't too good
which<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.890> lot<00:04:08.069> in<00:04:08.250> team<00:04:08.400> deathmatch

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
which I see a lot in team deathmatch

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.660 
which I see a lot in team deathmatch
like<00:04:09.180> rarely<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.319> game<00:04:10.530> actually<00:04:10.769> close

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
like rarely is the game actually close

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.190 
like rarely is the game actually close
at<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.110> people<00:04:13.110> just<00:04:13.370> can't<00:04:14.370> seem<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.760> like

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
at all people just can't seem to like

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.430 
at all people just can't seem to like
that<00:04:16.200> or<00:04:16.380> not<00:04:16.500> do<00:04:16.680> good<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:17.160> guess<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:19.109> blow

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
that or not do good I guess like we blow

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.909 
that or not do good I guess like we blow
out<00:04:19.680> too<00:04:20.010> many<00:04:20.220> teams<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:21.930> too<00:04:22.169> fast<00:04:22.470> and

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
out too many teams and it's too fast and

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.100 
out too many teams and it's too fast and
we<00:04:23.040> fight<00:04:23.220> over<00:04:23.370> kills<00:04:23.669> too<00:04:23.880> much<00:04:24.080> which<00:04:25.080> is

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
we fight over kills too much which is

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.159 
we fight over kills too much which is
why<00:04:25.290> we<00:04:25.620> kind<00:04:25.860> of<00:04:25.919> stopped<00:04:26.160> playing<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:27.169> game

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
why we kind of stopped playing this game

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:34.310 
why we kind of stopped playing this game
