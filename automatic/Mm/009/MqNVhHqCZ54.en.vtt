00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
so when you think of Tambor you can at

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:40.150 
so when you think of Tambor you can at
least<00:00:28.949> start<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:29.519> thinking<00:00:30.119> dark<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.810> bright

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.640

yeah what I'm what I'm trying to find a
dark<00:00:47.220> tone<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:48.390> try<00:00:49.290> to<00:00:49.320> feel<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
dark tone I I try to feel the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.100 
dark tone I I try to feel the
fundamental<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> note<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.329> lives<00:00:51.720> in<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
fundamental of the note it lives in the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.890 
fundamental of the note it lives in the
horn<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.680> not<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.160> sound<00:00:53.579> that's

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
horn it's not so much a sound that's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.710 
horn it's not so much a sound that's
thrown<00:00:54.900> out<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:57.030> feels<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> me<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
thrown out as it feels like to me that

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:07.900 
thrown out as it feels like to me that
it's<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.650> horn<00:00:58.860> itself<00:00:59.220> vibrating

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.090 

anyway<00:01:08.910> so<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:11.070> point<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> make<00:01:13.100> then

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
anyway so the point I want to make then

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.340 
anyway so the point I want to make then
the<00:01:14.430> challenge<00:01:15.120> is<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:17.690> when<00:01:18.690> doing<00:01:18.900> long<00:01:19.080> tons

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
yeah and I try not to think too much
