this<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.539> how<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.309> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
this is how I do it it is kind of this

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
this is how I do it it is kind of this
blue<00:01:02.969> net<00:01:05.630> interior<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.170> only<00:01:07.380> thing<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
blue net interior the only thing is a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.230 
blue net interior the only thing is a
lot<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.189> space<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.850> here

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
lot of space in here

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690 
lot of space in here
which<00:01:10.170> there<00:01:10.470> too<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.710> -<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.159> one

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
which there too is - look at that one

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
which there too is - look at that one
it's<00:01:11.909> nice<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.360> guess<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> room<00:01:13.080> but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
it's nice I guess to have the room but

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
it's nice I guess to have the room but
it's<00:01:13.770> also<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.159> super<00:01:14.369> snug<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.090> your

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
it's also not super snug so your

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
it's also not super snug so your
computer<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> move<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.350> easily

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
computer can move around pretty easily

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.880 
computer can move around pretty easily
so<00:01:17.299> as<00:01:18.299> long<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.840> mind<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.350> then<00:01:19.860> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
so as long as you don't mind that then I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.910 
so as long as you don't mind that then I
guess<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.490> bag<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.970> okay<00:01:21.740> then<00:01:22.740> there's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
guess this bag is okay then there's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
guess this bag is okay then there's
another<00:01:23.009> slot<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> game

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
another slot in here so to put a game

December<00:03:26.810> after<00:03:27.810> just<00:03:28.019> six<00:03:28.290> months<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:29.120> think

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
December after just six months I think

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.970 
December after just six months I think
that's<00:03:30.300> really<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:31.260> sign<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.280> poor<00:03:32.730> quality<00:03:33.090> and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
that's really a sign of poor quality and

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.620 
that's really a sign of poor quality and
it's<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.250> worth<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.580> money<00:03:35.730> so<00:03:36.239> if<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.540> were

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
it's not worth the money so if I were

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.160 
it's not worth the money so if I were
