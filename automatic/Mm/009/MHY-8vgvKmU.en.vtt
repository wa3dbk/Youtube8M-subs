00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.240
 that a form of scholarships on the map and 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.400
 with many other characters a 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.660
 peasants things like that the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.189
 approach years to know that they can 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.230
 give you a map when you 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.340
 earn consoling you can win 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.140
 many times you will win 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.120
 wishes of the items after the purpose of which 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.640
 you choose between 4 dec according to the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.140
 faction decided the monsters at each 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.140
 so to know also that each faction 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.579
 at a bonus one here paf card unit which 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.780
 sit boat at the end of the run 6 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.789
 and a very powerful pillow behind the scenes 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.019
 and shit too bad for you there 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.429
 so what's interesting is that 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.170
 this moment where you can win a 

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.510
 only if you have more points 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.559
 wholesale damage one more points of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.899
 force your opponent the end of the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.850
 sleeve except with the empire denis and you 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.229
 keep in the conditions of a tie 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.239
 you win the round anyway 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.530
 viren an hour allow you to 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.239
 draw a card at each round 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.100
 won and it will be very convenient 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.930
 will see it in detail after at the level of 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.520
 squats one decides who starts at the beginning 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.320
 it may be convenient or not alone or 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.400
 others with calm so I did not 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.110
 carnec for the moment the realm of a 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.270
 time in you start with that and you 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.920
 improve it little by little at the level of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.970
 cards we go directly the old party 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 to try to better understand how 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.200
 it works you need at least 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 22.4 to play if you have more there 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.020
 be aware that you will have less 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.810
 chance to fall on the chosen cards 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.390
 or say desired at least at the beginning of the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.920
 game you have a hand of 10 cards in 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.900
 which you can remove two 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.880
 neighborhoods do not please you to know 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.340
 that weather charts like these two 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.110
 there are four different altogether 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.240
 that I know in any case you cold 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.980
 biting the snow that will reduce the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.830
 damage from your melee units and 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.300
 opposing units at 1 the cleared time which 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.550
 will remove all weather conditions 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.990
 you will also have maps of the 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.500
 same kind as cold biting for them 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.050
 archers and the same thing for the units 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.550
 of sawn timber here so we will fired him who has 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.350
 just two points of damage to the body at 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.720
 body it is not super interesting 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.040
 hop it brings me nothing that's a map 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.929
 who forcibly assist I'm going to keep 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.319
 a kia 4 this is always 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.480
 interesting 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.709
 this one to 4 and she has the little bonus 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.159
 here close link 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.930
 which means that when you tone 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.640
 you admit next to another card 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.990
 identical it changes in aid to the guys 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.110
 you have to go up to four cards 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 identical 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.890
 these cards double their damage so 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.040
 if I put this one and his fellow 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.950
 I will not have 4 + 4 or 8 16 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.290
 damage is interesting 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.800
 nothing special here good no others 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.090
 cards 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.640
 I will keep like these two who 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.890
 are rather interesting and we're going 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.560
 start playing the first round get 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.640
 simply pass with a g 2 pieces a 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 just there it's me who 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 very well to know that the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.920
 mix mouse + keyboard does not work 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.430
 not very good the game so you start 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.420
 with dick hardt to know yes you do not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.800
 can never draw cards 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.270
 directly it's not every turn 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.400
 drawn you touch cards 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.660
 only when you use the 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.520
 cards that allow you this are 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.890
 so units generally except that at 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.459
 place of insim close links in white to 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.110
 verneuil 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.760
 it means that this unit is going to go 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.290
 in the opposing side so increase the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.670
 gags points verses but you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.620
 will draw cards and there we 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.790
 says to himself but what's the point? 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.320
 not what will measure eats bubbles 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.489
 are not going to draw a low card 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.760
 must still hold on 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.100
 sleeves 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.330
 he will have this 18 40 cases the other way 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.940
 to touch neighborhoods that the worse the 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.709
 nil keeps forgiveness pardon the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.630
 kingdoms of the north which allows me to 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.180
 draw a card for each winning round 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.730
 we will start with a basic map a 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.230
 very simple a little character to the body 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.450
 to body I have here on the left there 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.459
 sends five power and I have left 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.830
 nine cards in hand this here it's just 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.510
 small small bonus eat 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.940
 they win or not at this time we have we have 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.100
 both here here his little card that 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.239
 has eight power to know there is no 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.370
 of stone system sheet scissors in 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.560
 a kind the seats you stuff them nothing 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.600
 all that does not exist in there is 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.590
 just three different levels on the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.660
 left you have places where you 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.890
 can place the cards that boost the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.920
 damage of your units knowing that I do not 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.709
 do not have your character card here 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.989
 which allows you to have a bonus plus or 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.549
 less important here in this case this 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.799
 card there is the same effect as this one 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.200
 who I remember removes all the effects 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.730
 of weather so he just played that is 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.720
 what are we going to play now at 8.2 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.459
 you guys can go up to 9 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.950
 so so interesting so you have you 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.090
 take guys to manage but you have 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.610
 also something very important is 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.600
 the number of cards you have left 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.850
 because the same name I give up 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 now concretely I would lose this 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.409
 this sleeve there I would have a 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.969
 map also he remains eight 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.379
 next round so he will start 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:38.759
 but with nine cards because he's going 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:41.069
 pock a villa the northern kingdoms 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.089
 and if after months among the eight cards 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.830
 I can not see so many 

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:45.179
 power that it will become embarrassing 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.559
 there is a strategic side at the level of 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:48.389
 number of cards who are older too 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:50.099
 so we will not pass here that I 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.809
 beast oh I'm stupid I wanted to put 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.339
 a career market at 7 pm week 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.759
 where I was wrong 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:05:00.239
 so we'll go to 11.2 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.889
 force now and I can very well 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:03.749
 here play strategy is to make believe 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:08.789
 that for the moment they are winning and 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:11.789
 then all at once remove tech on 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.739
 can use that are cared to imitate 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.329
 in quotation marks and the iron power 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:16.050
 above without having used any 

00:05:15.329 --> 00:05:18.239
 my dec cards 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.129
 which is very interesting he will also 

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:22.679
 boost its army there is nineteen all 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.059
 the two we can go up a little 

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:25.229
 more I do not use this card sis a 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:25.800
 since I know that I have a second 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.409
 in my dec 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.279
 it's more interesting for me if I 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.139
 park a little longer anyway 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.300
 because I have a chance on the turn 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.159
 next to have his girlfriend and in these 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:41.099
 conditions there to be able to better manage 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:43.079
 good it gets a little bit boring the 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.449
 concretely if I put this card if 

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:46.559
 that's not going the bonus scope because 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.050
 that my two hand -to-hand cards 

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:50.399
 will go from 5 5 to 1 1 which will me 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.619
 give two level damage 

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:53.929
 of melee here he however he 

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:55.860
 will have three quarters he has three cards 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:58.199
 it's not interesting for me if he 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.019
 had maybe another map 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.729
 powerful on the front line I would have 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:04.709
 in this case the m it would have been 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.209
 really interesting after the fact that's 

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:09.779
 new is that he played with the 

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:12.779
 cdc mouse pretty much not that so we 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:14.550
 here 30 of power he has 24 or even 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.739
 try to boost yourself is there 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.309
 concretely I do not really want 

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:21.899
 in the idea of ​​using cards 

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.050
 because they will be able to use more 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.969
 late 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.499
 so I will pass my turn if he wants 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.789
 to pass me in front of it will have to move to 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:28.679
 two quarter-times reuse at least 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.539
 one and then draw a twist on 

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:33.839
 there will remain three so I will have more 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.219
 cards that he or maybe not even ok 

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.869
 he has more water card to increase his 

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:39.830
 power not concretely the poor 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:42.260
 guy will lose his turn 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.720
 oh no he will win well played from him 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.020
 the little final bonus they win seven 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.610
 sleeves 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.320
 except that he wants he concretely 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.050
 now twelve cards only in 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.820
 the hand here we see it here one on the 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.780
 left he had a map and gardens 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:55.160
 pick and because he won at sleeves 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.160
 but I still have four cards left 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.830
 finish the game 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.420
 It's not going to be complicated. 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.160
 play this card there I already have more than 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.400
 power that he is obliged to 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.950
 to play something under penalty of losing 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.570
 a drop but guys in the idea that 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.670
 could have been good except that there I 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.710
 can heal this damage reduction 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.880
 in quotation marks this round so and 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.280
 automatically win by month it does not 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.490
 can no longer play ten passes his turn I 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.660
 so wins this round 6 and the sleeve 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.340
 next as I'm going to draw a card 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.780
 and he still does not have it I'm going 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.250
 automatically win also the poor 

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.680
 automatically switches to pause 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.430
 a map and I pass so I won 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.530
 this part 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.390
 why because it was not there 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.250
 played only on the power or 

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.360
 also on the number of cards he is 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.360
 sometimes interesting as I was so 

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.460
 you see that a round is going to be lost 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.260
 you make your comments your cards 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.310
 which gives power points to 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.050
 the opponent but that allow you to 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.180
 touch several 4 send you full 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.350
 like that you draw lots of cards and 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.310
 the opponent anyway the power 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.810
 increases but we do not care because he has 

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.370
 already won the round you draw 

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.750
 sign and you have cards in rab 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.970
 for the next rounds 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.760
 I will make other videos on 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.840
 other matches in this grint game if 

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.040
 you have questions do not hesitate to 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.490
 ask them I would be happy to 

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.230
 reply 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.420
