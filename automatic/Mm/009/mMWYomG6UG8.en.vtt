00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:03.530 

this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.530> the<00:00:01.650> four-to-one<00:00:02.280> gearboxes<00:00:03.270> I'm

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
this is the four-to-one gearboxes I'm

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.650 
this is the four-to-one gearboxes I'm
just<00:00:04.020> setting<00:00:04.500> up<00:00:04.680> on<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.420> poppet<00:00:06.420> valve

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
just setting up on this poppet valve

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.910 
just setting up on this poppet valve
engine<00:00:07.460> I'm<00:00:08.460> taking<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.030> video<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.660> now

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
engine I'm taking a video of it now

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.680 
engine I'm taking a video of it now
because<00:00:10.920> later<00:00:11.580> on<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.969> won't<00:00:12.210> be<00:00:12.420> able<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
because later on you won't be able to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.829 
because later on you won't be able to
see<00:00:12.870> how<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.320> operates<00:00:14.360> justify<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.420> be<00:00:15.599> going

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
see how it operates justify to be going

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.310 
see how it operates justify to be going
too<00:00:16.049> fast<00:00:16.699> so<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.119> I'm<00:00:18.270> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.050> just

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
too fast so what I'm going to do is just

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.230 
too fast so what I'm going to do is just
start<00:00:20.330> with<00:00:21.710> an<00:00:22.710> electric<00:00:23.250> screwdriver

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.729 

and<00:00:29.779> if<00:00:29.869> you<00:00:30.140> see<00:00:30.820> every<00:00:31.820> fourth<00:00:32.090> rotation<00:00:32.989> if

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
and if you see every fourth rotation if

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:45.099 
and if you see every fourth rotation if
fires<00:00:35.020> do<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.170> will<00:00:37.000> come<00:00:38.000> fall<00:00:38.329> over<00:00:38.600> there

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.540 

now<00:00:45.710> that's<00:00:46.399> adjustable<00:00:47.120> by<00:00:47.510> grub<00:00:47.899> screw<00:00:48.550> you

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
now that's adjustable by grub screw you

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.899 
now that's adjustable by grub screw you
see<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.789> small<00:00:50.149> piece<00:00:50.510> sticking<00:00:50.809> out<00:00:51.140> here<00:00:51.699> if<00:00:52.699> I

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:52.909 
see a small piece sticking out here if I

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:56.500 
see a small piece sticking out here if I
move<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:54.019> plate<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:54.710> way<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:55.940> will<00:00:56.089> give<00:00:56.329> me

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
move that plate this way it will give me

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.509 
move that plate this way it will give me
more<00:00:56.690> throw<00:00:57.429> so<00:00:58.570> that<00:00:59.570> will<00:00:59.750> allow<00:00:59.929> me<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.199> have

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
more throw so that will allow me to have

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.969 
more throw so that will allow me to have
the<00:01:01.519> air<00:01:01.699> going<00:01:02.119> into<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> engine<00:01:02.739> for<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.829> lot

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
the air going into the engine for a lot

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.420 
the air going into the engine for a lot
longer<00:01:04.810> you<00:01:05.810> know<00:01:05.899> if<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.200> was<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.590> just<00:01:06.830> pull

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
longer you know if I was to just pull

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.480 
longer you know if I was to just pull
this<00:01:07.610> off<00:01:07.820> slightly<00:01:08.979> imagine<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.130> all<00:01:10.280> just

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
this off slightly imagine it's all just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.789 
this off slightly imagine it's all just
going<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.700> be<00:01:10.759> touching<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.320> I'll<00:01:12.470> get<00:01:12.710> it

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
going to be touching and so I'll get it

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.969 
going to be touching and so I'll get it
very<00:01:12.979> very<00:01:13.159> fast<00:01:13.280> for<00:01:13.880> ya<00:01:14.289> if<00:01:15.289> I<00:01:15.470> move<00:01:15.740> that

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
very very fast for ya if I move that

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.010 
very very fast for ya if I move that
forward<00:01:16.399> I<00:01:17.000> will<00:01:17.420> get<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:17.780> slow<00:01:18.049> fire<00:01:19.330> so<00:01:20.330> I'll

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
forward I will get the slow fire so I'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.800 
forward I will get the slow fire so I'll
just<00:01:21.259> try<00:01:21.440> to<00:01:21.530> speed<00:01:21.860> it<00:01:21.890> up<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.460> show<00:01:22.640> you

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
just try to speed it up and show you

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.980 
just try to speed it up and show you
roughly<00:01:23.810> what<00:01:25.060> speed<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.330> engine<00:01:26.420> will<00:01:26.959> be

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
roughly what speed the engine will be

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.690 
roughly what speed the engine will be
going<00:01:27.319> at<00:01:31.780> sorry<00:01:32.780> about<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.200> shakes<00:01:33.530> is<00:01:33.890> it's

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
going at sorry about the shakes is it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.969 
going at sorry about the shakes is it's
the<00:01:34.909> Chuck<00:01:35.209> of<00:01:35.390> my<00:01:37.539> pan<00:01:38.539> drill<00:01:38.990> isn't<00:01:39.530> very

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
the Chuck of my pan drill isn't very

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.940 
the Chuck of my pan drill isn't very
accurate<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.630> this<00:01:41.899> is<00:01:42.080> about<00:01:42.289> the<00:01:42.440> speed<00:01:42.740> it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
accurate so this is about the speed it

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.460 
accurate so this is about the speed it
should<00:01:43.189> be<00:01:43.369> running<00:01:43.610> so<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:44.659> can<00:01:44.899> see<00:01:45.080> every

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
should be running so you can see every

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.609 
should be running so you can see every
four<00:01:45.740> revolutions<00:01:46.280> if<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:46.819> can<00:01:47.000> count<00:01:47.299> them

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
four revolutions if you can count them

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.309 
four revolutions if you can count them
it's<00:01:48.619> firing<00:01:49.690> beautiful<00:01:50.690> count<00:01:50.959> follower

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
it's firing beautiful count follower

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.330 
it's firing beautiful count follower
here

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.330 

and<00:01:59.340> now<00:01:59.520> we're<00:01:59.700> back<00:01:59.850> down<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.010> it<00:02:02.160> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and now we're back down to and all it is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
and now we're back down to and all it is
basically<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.120> a<00:02:03.180> load<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.540> gears<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
basically it's a load of gears I've just

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.600 
basically it's a load of gears I've just
machined<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.950> from<00:02:05.100> scrap<00:02:05.460> ones<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:08.250> make<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
machined up from scrap ones to make up a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
machined up from scrap ones to make up a
gearbox<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:10.020> very<00:02:10.200> free<00:02:13.250> so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
gearbox and it is very very free so

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.140 
gearbox and it is very very free so
hopefully<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.270> explains<00:02:15.450> it
