Olympic squad mainly because you can

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.100 
Olympic squad mainly because you can
boss<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.670> game<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.150> know<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.630> could<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.930> losing

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
boss a game you know we could be losing

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.810 
boss a game you know we could be losing
and<00:02:31.380> he'll<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:31.620> pin<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:32.010> ball<00:02:32.250> across<00:02:32.490> and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and he'll just pin that ball across and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.090 
and he'll just pin that ball across and
and<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.810> maybe<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.200> storage<00:02:34.620> or<00:02:34.800> whoever

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
and you know maybe to storage or whoever

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.040 
and you know maybe to storage or whoever
and<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.240> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.390> be<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> loss<00:02:36.840> not

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and I think it's going to be a loss not

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.990 
and I think it's going to be a loss not
having<00:02:37.350> him<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.500> 17<00:02:38.370> pace<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.730> obviously

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
having him there 17 pace is obviously

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.440 
having him there 17 pace is obviously
quite<00:02:39.120> bad<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.690> are<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> 6<00:02:40.080> shooting<00:02:40.550> 7070<00:02:41.550> 93

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
going to be in too many teams because

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.050 
going to be in too many teams because
he's<00:03:31.650> not<00:03:31.769> American<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.550> although<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> lot<00:03:33.000> of

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
he's not American and although a lot of

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.640 
he's not American and although a lot of
people<00:03:33.180> build<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.630> American<00:03:34.050> teams<00:03:34.260> with<00:03:34.440> win

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
people build the American teams with win

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.830

and<00:03:34.800> people<00:03:35.010> like<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.810> although<00:03:36.810> I

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and people like that and although I

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.090 
and people like that and although I
think<00:03:36.959> you<00:03:37.170> probably<00:03:37.290> would<00:03:37.560> still<00:03:37.620> get<00:03:37.830> links

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
think you probably would still get links

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.130 
think you probably would still get links
you<00:03:38.220> know<00:03:38.310> that's<00:03:38.489> that's<00:03:38.690> will<00:03:39.690> get<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:39.989> full

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
you know that's that's will get the full

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.590 
you know that's that's will get the full
green<00:03:40.380> links<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:40.890> being<00:03:41.430> Canadian<00:03:41.820> but<00:03:42.540> you

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
green links but being Canadian but you

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.180 
green links but being Canadian but you
know<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:43.080> still<00:03:43.350> a<00:03:43.410> good<00:03:43.560> little<00:03:43.860> player

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
know it's still a good little player

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.550 
know it's still a good little player
like<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.850> see<00:03:45.330> different<00:03:45.570> ones<00:03:45.930> in<00:03:46.230> team<00:03:46.440> of

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
like to see different ones in team of

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.009 
like to see different ones in team of
the<00:03:46.620> week<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.730> suppose<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.540> kind<00:03:48.810> of

the week and I suppose this is a kind of

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.690 
the week and I suppose this is a kind of
team<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.410> week<00:03:49.500> but<00:03:49.709> I<00:03:49.980> wonder<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:50.610> they're

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
team of the week but I wonder if they're

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.979 
team of the week but I wonder if they're
going<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.880> bring<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.120> each<00:03:51.239> week<00:03:51.450> now<00:03:51.630> having
