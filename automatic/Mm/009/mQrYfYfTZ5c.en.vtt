00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.780
 on the highway the maximum speed 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.380
 allowed is 120 km time 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.990
 except when traffic signs 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.360
 impose another maximum speed 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.220
 another maximum speed can also 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.570
 to be imposed through panels to 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.910
 variable messages 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.520
 installed above the bands of 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.070
 traffic 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.460
 under normal circumstances you must there 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.100
 drive at a minimum speed of 70 km 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 time except when 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.329
 signaling imposes another speed 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.370
 maximum 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.129
 near the exits you will meet 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.379
 sometimes this combination of panels the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.320
 speed limit is only valid 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.329
 for the exit 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.100
 if you want to leave the highway there 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.440
 is better not to start 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.640
 brake before being on the band 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.100
 exit 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.129
 if you notice a broken down car 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.650
 you can only drive at 25 km 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.159
 and you have to leave the highway as soon as you 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.159
 first exit 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.230
 on a road for automobiles there is 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.570
 no minimum speed however 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.400
 do not forget that rolling abnormally 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.740
 slowly is also an offense 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.540
 the maximum speed depends on 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.520
 characteristics of the road on 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.439
 automobile on which you ride 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.799
 if there are at least two 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.619
 of traffic / a central berm 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.320
 then you can go to 120 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.899
 km / hour except when 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.360
 signaling imposes another speed 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.390
 maximum 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.650
 if you drive in your conurbation 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.140
 speed can not exceed 50 km time 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.020
 if the car route is divided 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.690
 in two three or more bands of 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.360
 circulation and those are separated 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.390
 by road marks then the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.670
 maximum speed allowed is 90 km 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.310
 time except when the panels of 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.910
 signaling imposes another speed 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.910
 maximum 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.550
 the maximum speed on a road 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.400
 ordinary is 90 km hour 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.250
 but it can be modified here too 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.980
 by panels sometimes a panel 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.740
 additional blue indicates where 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.560
 the speed limit starts in 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.690
 this example the limitation starts 200 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.670
 meters further and is applicable 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.980
 to the next intersection 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.640
 know that national roads are 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.640
 ordinary roads 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.769
 in a residential area 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.079
 pedestrians can walk on the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.569
 floor and children can play it 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.090
 that's why we can not go there 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.129
 only at 20 km 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.010
 in agglomeration the speed is limited 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.780
 at 50 km 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.120
 but as you know the signs 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 can impose a maximum speed 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 higher have reduced 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.349
 in an area you can not exceed 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.380
 the speed indicated at the access of the zone 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:16.110
 day nor night duties 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.819
 electronic zone panels do not 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.360
 are applicable only when the panel 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.360
 is on 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.840
 the device elevated and usually 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.760
 announced by this danger signal 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.640
 this signal of indications is at 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.680
 proximity of the device 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.910
 the maximum speed allowed on a 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.740
 raised device and 30 km / hour 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.980
 for the exam you must know well 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.440
 the difference between these three panels 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.599
 the first danger sign indicates that 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.569
 150 meters further there is a 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:53.659
 raised device in the second 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.480
 image the additional panel indicates that 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.060
 the raised device are two 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.049
 hundred meters away in the last 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.780
 picture 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.730
 the additional sign indicates that 150 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.280
 meters further on there are several 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.420
 devices raised on a distance 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.420
 500 meters 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.690
 the speeding is obviously a 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.120
 offense but what some forget 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.700
 during the practical exam is that 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.329
 moving too slowly is also a 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.490
 offense 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.130
 you must always adapt your 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.400
 speed to circumstances like the weather 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.610
 the condition of the roadway and the intensity of 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.610
 traffic
