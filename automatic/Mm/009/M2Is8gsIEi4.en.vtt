can<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.800> is<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.010> can<00:03:16.040> cast<00:03:16.280> your<00:03:16.430> own<00:03:16.550> spell

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
can do is you can cast your own spell

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.150 
can do is you can cast your own spell
and<00:03:17.180> respond<00:03:18.020> to<00:03:18.110> your<00:03:18.230> own<00:03:18.380> spell<00:03:18.860> before

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
and respond to your own spell before

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.770 
and respond to your own spell before
your<00:03:19.460> opponent<00:03:19.640> can<00:03:19.940> respond<00:03:20.270> your<00:03:20.390> own<00:03:20.510> spell

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
your opponent can respond your own spell

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.840 
your opponent can respond your own spell
because<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.500> have<00:03:21.620> priority<00:03:22.100> first<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.610> on

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
because you have priority first on on

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.510 
because you have priority first on on
your<00:03:23.240> spell<00:03:23.450> casts<00:03:23.930> so<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:25.010> can<00:03:25.160> cast<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.490> think

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
your spell casts so you can cast a think

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.730 
your spell casts so you can cast a think
twice<00:03:25.940> Cass<00:03:26.690> all<00:03:26.930> over<00:03:27.080> extort<00:03:27.470> sugars

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
twice Cass all over extort sugars

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.020 
twice Cass all over extort sugars
because<00:03:28.040> they<00:03:28.160> are<00:03:28.220> not<00:03:28.280> relying<00:03:28.760> on<00:03:28.940> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
because they are not relying on the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.150 
because they are not relying on the
spell<00:03:29.270> resolving<00:03:29.780> do<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> ton<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.620> damage<00:03:30.860> and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
spell resolving do a ton of damage and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.910 
spell resolving do a ton of damage and
then<00:03:31.370> rewind<00:03:31.790> our<00:03:32.120> own<00:03:32.300> think<00:03:32.660> twice<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.200> untap

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
then rewind our own think twice to untap

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.740 
then rewind our own think twice to untap
four<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.220> our<00:03:34.310> lands<00:03:34.520> and<00:03:34.730> generate<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.480> 20

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
four of our lands and generate like 20

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.830 
four of our lands and generate like 20
mana<00:03:36.130> so<00:03:37.130> like<00:03:37.370> this<00:03:37.490> is<00:03:37.550> to<00:03:37.850> call<00:03:38.000> a<00:03:38.150> mana

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
mana so like this is to call a mana

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.480 
mana so like this is to call a mana
generator<00:03:39.320> as<00:03:39.620> well<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.100> counter<00:03:40.340> stuff

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
generator as well as the counter stuff

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.830 
generator as well as the counter stuff
you<00:03:40.640> actually<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.030> to<00:03:41.150> counter<00:03:41.450> something

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
you actually have to counter something

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.770 
you actually have to counter something
it<00:03:42.020> just<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.800> does<00:03:43.490> a<00:03:43.730> ridiculous<00:03:44.480> amount<00:03:44.510> of

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it just it does a ridiculous amount of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.380 
it just it does a ridiculous amount of
work<00:03:44.900> in<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:45.170> deck<00:03:45.640> then<00:03:46.640> we<00:03:46.760> have<00:03:46.910> chromatic

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
work in this deck then we have chromatic

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.030 
work in this deck then we have chromatic
lanterns<00:03:47.840> for<00:03:47.960> mana<00:03:48.140> fixing<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.680> I'll<00:03:48.740> get<00:03:48.890> to

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
lanterns for mana fixing and I'll get to

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.610 
lanterns for mana fixing and I'll get to
what<00:03:49.520> waimea<00:03:49.880> fixing<00:03:50.210> is<00:03:50.300> important<00:03:50.750> but

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
what waimea fixing is important but

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.080 
what waimea fixing is important but
chromatic<00:03:52.340> lanterns<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.790> little<00:03:52.880> bit<00:03:53.000> of

easy to get with your think twice as

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.880 
easy to get with your think twice as
your<00:04:08.630> elf<00:04:08.780> mazing<00:04:09.110> grizzle<00:04:09.470> brand<00:04:09.680> if<00:04:09.800> you

don't<00:04:30.740> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
don't it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.980 
don't it
like<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.409> back-up<00:04:31.740> plan<00:04:32.360> some<00:04:33.360> games<00:04:33.569> it's

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
like the back-up plan some games it's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.170 
like the back-up plan some games it's
the<00:04:34.050> front<00:04:34.319> of<00:04:34.379> the<00:04:34.470> plan<00:04:34.789> now<00:04:35.789> we're<00:04:36.000> playing

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
the front of the plan now we're playing

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.640 
the front of the plan now we're playing
plenty<00:04:36.479> of<00:04:36.569> songs<00:04:36.780> to<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.020> for<00:04:37.199> water<00:04:37.379> graves

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
plenty of songs to the for water graves

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.589 
plenty of songs to the for water graves
and<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.889> bunch<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.430> swamps<00:04:38.789> we're<00:04:39.360> playing<00:04:39.539> the

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
and a bunch of swamps we're playing the

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:40.939 
and a bunch of swamps we're playing the
one<00:04:39.720> Allen<00:04:40.080> just<00:04:40.229> to<00:04:40.379> make<00:04:40.500> am<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.740> little

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
one Allen just to make am a little

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.070 
one Allen just to make am a little
better<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.490> we<00:04:42.120> are<00:04:42.240> playing<00:04:42.449> John<00:04:42.599> catacombs

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
better and we are playing John catacombs

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.390 
better and we are playing John catacombs
because<00:04:43.319> it's<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.560> dual<00:04:43.710> lane<00:04:43.889> and<00:04:44.039> our<00:04:44.099> colors

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
because it's a dual lane and our colors

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.110 
because it's a dual lane and our colors
so<00:04:44.819> we<00:04:44.940> kind<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.180> not<00:04:45.900> forced<00:04:46.319> to<00:04:46.409> play<00:04:46.530> applied

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
so we kind of not forced to play applied

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.279 
so we kind of not forced to play applied
