00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.410
 and it is less as they were I hope that 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.450
 they are doing very, very well here 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.070
 with you clear that I saw and well this 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.100
 which are how we can see in the video 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.950
 this time it's about the big gameplay 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.930
 photo 5 on playstation vita and well 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.930
 I'm doing this with the function 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.449
 with the remote function like for me 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.059
 the truth is that it looks pretty good 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:52.579
 game 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.579
 you can very well be playing talking 4 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 ah 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:31.110
 and we can also grab people 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.110
 if we do your we press this part of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 this 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.270
 diffuse 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.659
 for this the future without future 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.659
 you 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.640
 police 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.450
 sometimes 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:43.069
 in our project 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.999
 although you can insert within 1 minute 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.999
 uses 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.049
 It is tough 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.799
 let's see you can see a trailer 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.799
 I want to see I did not try 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.730
 and if you can very well 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.730
 a post starts 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.959
 tonight 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.830
 Y 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.830
 does not mention any sequel 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.020
 like time 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.710
 this 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.860
 as here showing unhappiness 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.560
 and showing it we show everything that is 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 can do and environment 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.540
 I hope the series 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 5 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.140
 at will 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.520
 between them is very very slow only in a 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.130
 wrong movement 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 we do not have left 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.100
 our super super resistant friend and 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.740
 Hold on to your 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.360
 hits 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.360
 well let's continue here 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.290
 and as you will see then here I am with x 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.940
 run with square jump with triangle 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.940
 submit to the car for example here 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.670
 I get hit by the clock 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.030
 Y 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.160
 then a cycle then all the last 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.449
 in a circle we change the view of the car 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.930
 already more cornets 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.259
 as fair as everything 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.020
 with the button up we put what 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:17.660
 It's the phone we call 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:22.600
 everything with circles we hang and 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.600
 because as I think that's because all 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.169
 and the other function would be with this part 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.199
 which is more or less the screen that has 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.250
 the command of playstation 4 and already with 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:38.960
 this we can put different angles of 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.410
 the camera we can not put in first 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.410
 person 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.420
 that really is one of the things that 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.570
 got so much attention here for these 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.970
 consoles that we could see big picture 5 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.200
 in the first person and the truth is that yes 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.200
 and the truth is that it is very cool 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.290
 we are not going to talk about this 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.599
 as they were carriers that systems 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.599
 complicated 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:22.890
 the person to person 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.460
 this sign young children so the best 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:29.520
 is that you really liked this game 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:33.740
 of these edits and then well nothing if you 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.740
 liked dgt like comments 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.810
 I am the Kyrie and we will see each other 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.810
 video 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.370
 uy
