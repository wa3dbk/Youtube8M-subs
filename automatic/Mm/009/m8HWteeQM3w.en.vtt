00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.130
 there are very good youtube here that 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.410
 commenting on a kalou video of advance 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 warfare and we have here the rifles high 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.830
 of royalty I've already gotten them but 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.840
 well it has not been achieved in a way 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.370
 I would have liked me too you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.780
 I'm going to tell you why it's good you have 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.609
 in order is worth the six assault rifles 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.070
 the vall here 12 the x the h wta then 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.359
 you have the and m &amp; r and finally the m 14 in 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.410
 third person and in first person and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
 being a little bit so that life 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 digital to watch for that as 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.539
 they see everything in the third person as 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.489
 when you wear them in the first person 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.569
 not so good as I said I have not 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.979
 achieved in a way that would have 

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:36.510
 liked because well I was 

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.940
 I understand making my assault rifles 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.429
 diamond as always as they say 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 whites also with the blog and suddenly 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.739
 I found the surprise that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 Yesterday afternoon he was already taking 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.109
 the zebra had the naval the rx and the lacquer 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.309
 12 and well he was taking the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:52.049
 bankruptcy they had published that face of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.909
 diamond suddenly in this in the afternoon 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:55.440
 and I see that I have royal camouflage 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.719
 so for the face saying I'll see how 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.339
 me how do I have zebra challenges for 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.629
 see what I have to do I do not know what and from 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.429
 suddenly like and I have some price of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 real to awesome kids that is the 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.440
 vega 14 which is a rule that I have not used 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.970
 nothing for that I taught it to 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.310
 not only to teach the model of the 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.570
 light is that I do not have any camouflage 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.950
 with the average 14 and suddenly I have the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.330
 realistic is something super weird has it 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.070
 created the game also the other one happened to me 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.180
 day with the series of raf bayamÃ³n and emery 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
 which by the way I'll continue although 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.050
 he had royalty because the diamond 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.120
 obviously I do not have it so good 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.440
 personally now it would be you will see how 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.820
 the game happened to me very much also the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.610
 another day I dropped the connection and it 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.810
 moved the air drops and everything I do not know the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.700
 game is pretty broken with the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.380
 practicing tucked up to see only and I do not know what 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.540
 Well, now I'm going to go for the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.640
 props or rifles obviously I already have the 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.080
 mpc to teach and now I'm going for the one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.370
 five years ago I will go in order and if I have 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.900
 Once the immediate fate performed by the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.460
 face what I will do when I can before 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.750
 there is some simply this video 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.340
 this one comes from very short so with 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.900
 gameplay simply being gameplays 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.070
 with each weapon so you can see them here 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.890
 you have a little bit all the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.660
 functions high simply for the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.400
 that you have not seen maybe a video 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.380
 of them because you do not see each other and good 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.240
 also repeat that the good video 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.920
 tell you that yesterday's video was a 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.790
 guide with brad 3 that was very good 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.200
 that you liked a lot so 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.120
 I recommend that you spend because it is super 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.310
 useful for those who do not know what models 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.350
 are all cited so I hope that 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.789
 you liked this video sure I do not 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:15.069
 like favorites and their separated 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.069
 several months
