but<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:10.970> diet<00:02:11.270> is<00:02:11.450> driven<00:02:11.780> by<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.080> wind<00:02:12.290> the

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
but this diet is driven by the wind the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.040 
but this diet is driven by the wind the
wind<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.400> blows<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.060> water<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:14.510> like<00:02:14.810> so

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
wind actually blows the water in like so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.900 
wind actually blows the water in like so
it's<00:02:15.260> an<00:02:15.350> onshore<00:02:15.500> wind<00:02:16.100> versus<00:02:16.490> an<00:02:16.580> offshore

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
it's an onshore wind versus an offshore

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
it's an onshore wind versus an offshore
when<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.360> water<00:02:17.570> gets<00:02:17.690> blown<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.170> if<00:02:18.830> you're

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
when the water gets blown out if you're

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.130 
when the water gets blown out if you're
an<00:02:19.160> advanced<00:02:19.610> rider<00:02:19.820> you'll<00:02:20.510> have<00:02:20.720> lots<00:02:20.930> of

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
an advanced rider you'll have lots of

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.080 
an advanced rider you'll have lots of
options<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:21.650> gut<00:02:22.250> sounds<00:02:22.550> which<00:02:22.880> at<00:02:23.060> its

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
options here gut sounds which at its

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.630 
options here gut sounds which at its
widest<00:02:23.510> points<00:02:23.840> 28<00:02:24.140> miles<00:02:24.410> wide<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.490> got<00:02:25.610> a

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
widest points 28 miles wide so we got a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:37.309 
widest points 28 miles wide so we got a
large<00:02:26.090> body<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.510> water<00:02:26.570> it's<00:02:26.959> very<00:02:27.140> shallow

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.110 

so<00:02:38.319> that's<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.830> real<00:02:39.370> nice<00:02:39.520> playground<00:02:40.000> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so that's a real nice playground and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:52.940 
so that's a real nice playground and
then<00:02:40.239> we<00:02:40.330> also<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.599> the<00:02:40.780> ocean

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.770 

the<00:02:53.950> ocean<00:02:54.549> or<00:02:54.700> can't<00:02:55.180> be<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.269> lot<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> currents

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
the ocean or can't be a lot of currents

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
the ocean or can't be a lot of currents
depending<00:02:56.080> on<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> wind<00:02:56.409> speed<00:02:56.970> today<00:02:57.970> we

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
depending on the wind speed today we

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.080 
depending on the wind speed today we
have<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> real<00:02:58.959> strong<00:02:59.110> north<00:02:59.470> wind<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
have a real strong north wind the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.699 
have a real strong north wind the
current<00:03:01.780> will<00:03:01.930> be<00:03:01.959> running<00:03:02.290> probably

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
current will be running probably

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:09.020 
current will be running probably

out<00:03:39.920> our<00:03:40.250> typical<00:03:40.490> win<00:03:40.760> is<00:03:40.880> south<00:03:41.090> west<00:03:41.360> or

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570

again<00:03:44.120> it's<00:03:44.780> very<00:03:45.080> very<00:03:45.290> shallow<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.950> can<00:03:46.070> go

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
again it's very very shallow you can go

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.650 
again it's very very shallow you can go
