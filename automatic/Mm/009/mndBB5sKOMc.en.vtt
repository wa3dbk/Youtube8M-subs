00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.309
 good afternoon we are in the favor and one 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.600
 of the great favorites of the fans 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.910
 in the tournament ians 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.760
 Oscar Perez informs yesterday the eve of 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.230
 the third adventure search if there are good 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.540
 well then we are here again 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.150
 the truth that yes the third year and 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.650
 every year we finish tenth that will be 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.779
 the last time but the repeatable torque 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.700
 It has a hitch that is as posed no 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.250
 the extent that they go through the days and 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.579
 the months then it makes you come back to us 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.340
 an edition of the web plus probably 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.070
 the pair oscar pérez héctor de ians 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.050
 have been found then let's say two 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.090
 soulmates in a certain sense because 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.470
 the kind of career that you like 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.470
 that fills you with mountains 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.750
 mountain mountain solitude to adventure 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.220
 clear few more sites than the bull you the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.140
 can provide in this way that is 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.670
 special study in the bull good I think 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.100
 that the lathe as you say you do not 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.509
 offers all that and apart that you value 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.340
 not just a career that can win the 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.970
 faster but they intervene a lot 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.680
 more factor of new sleep management 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.940
 a bit of strategy at the time when 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 all the races but especially the 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.360
 soil management and assess the torque 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.190
 value is I think you can try to go 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 very fast and what it looks like last year 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.180
 at the end then the most comment 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.650
 bayern that double you can not tell us 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.600
 something about the end of last year 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 because I think it's probably the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.140
 most exciting end of all the tor 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.700
 because the two both iker like that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.230
 there is a fabulous career I think 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 that you both knew because the 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.550
 moment of goal if you discount a little to 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.000
 the people how you lived it your not good the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.530
 true that 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 now agree very well I think what to do 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.150
 when there were thirty or forty 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.340
 miles out there then it's a 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.110
 little special was perhaps the key point 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.910
 where I was very well and decided 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.550
 do not do not squeeze maybe everything that could 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.070
 have squeezed in that moment but then 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.060
 I think it's good and that the budget 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.070
 dose very well the forces in the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.510
 last in the last kilometers I have 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.540
 arrived then very well but that was 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.810
 in the race there were many moments 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.500
 classic with cole not with me I left them 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 a little bit in that battle and I stayed apart 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.510
 and then as it says on the second night 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.340
 came the wolf began to eat hours and the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.690
 thing was even in ten minutes I 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.790
 I think at one point in the end they were 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.020
 20 meters remember will give records and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.710
 reviewing the times with a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.390
 twenty twenty minutes yes but 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.010
 to the stowage head posts three 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.500
 forty hours I'm looking at the year 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.890
 past the times I do not know the truth that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.840
 I think it starts from a 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.550
 kilometer 200 and peak told that it is a 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.320
 dog the second night you know that you 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.060
 be a third if you go well but it is 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.180
 as if it were a skull of our if 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.640
 result what would be the barrier of 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.740
 kilometer 40 50 good so here it is 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.420
 much much later I do not get it right 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.830
 At that point, the truth is that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.780
 important not to find you 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.000
 environment because you know that you still have 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.710
 many kilometers and a lot of time to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.440
 to be able to advance in cutting time 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.760
 for the popular runners who dream 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.350
 with running here every time is more 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.020
 Spanish people 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.490
 you who go to the popular common mountain the 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.020
 people 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.210
 oscar wants to run here like a popular 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.850
 more without external support some will not 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.860
 to say already I say it is like one more than 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.600
 material you will carry more to be able 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.400
 be covered here you have eaten 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.840
 up to 17 under doing evil until a 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.540
 couple of years 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.910
 how he organizes his backpack to be 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.650
 sure and at the same time light clear good is 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.970
 material or do you have to both 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980
 material like you have 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.710
 before I did not prove it had lived that 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.120
 situation in the mountains and I the backpack 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.610
 well we need a good gore and a 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.070
 pants I've seen out there pants that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.720
 some carry you look like covers paints 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.640
 this when you're painting to cover 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.110
 It has stain but the truth is that 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.270
 It is good that the forecasts will 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.680
 be a little bit better 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.870
 benevolent until Wednesday so 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.430
 less but the warm clothes do not 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.230
 lack I prefer to take a little more 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.850
 weight and do not skimp you never know that you 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.140
 I will pass not always yes of those who 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.030
 they think the organization is there 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 but you can not consider 100% for it 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.050
 you do not have to stop you have to be 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.940
 one night out there lost but so 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 unless you have something something warm and 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.640
 good that I can always carry 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.070
 when I go to mountain or not so heavy 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.720
 but I always say that when that 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.910
 Mountain Nobody comes to your house to check 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.290
 to check that a backpack is true 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.549
 this kind of evidence you also do not have 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.460
 to be convinced of what you wear 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.620
 what can you get 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.060
 some idea so that people can 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 the weight that a backpack can have and 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.180
 we are talking about a person who has 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.069
 burst the record here 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.050
 and I need backpack what weight 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:35.460
 we can be talking good if you count 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:40.229
 in the liter and a half of normal change in 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.300
 that you go out then the polar the 19 test only 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.789
 he is wearing, he discovers trousers he has 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.590
 all indications of kilos the gps more 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.259
 the batteries plus the two front plus the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.509
 batteries is quietly in the 7x 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.979
 estates the canes that also that 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.539
 take them because they and the 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.430
 estates that I go out with them until the 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.930
 final 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.900
 return hand injuries if the 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.910
 Current positions added weight super 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.310
 thank you very much to download and 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:11.000
