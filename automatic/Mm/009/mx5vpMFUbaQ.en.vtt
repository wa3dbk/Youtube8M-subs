00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.279
 the assembly collective of the jura was born 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.630
 exactly March 10, 2003 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.570
 it was an extremely program 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.360
 innovative for the time since three 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 departmental committees of the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 doubs of jura and ain and the committee 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.879
 regional tourism franche county 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.180
 have decided to unite to be able to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.010
 together the tourist destination 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.300
 Jura mountains and innovative I will go 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.039
 for the peoples in the sense that the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 will of three departments the doubs 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.879
 the jura the ain as well as the two regions 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.829
 rhÃ´ne-alpes and franche-comtÃ© with the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.850
 massive police station really did 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 that this grouping is put forward 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 our reputation on all 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 destinations 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.090
 so in 2003 had to dare to think about it and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.559
 it's true that for us it's when 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 even a positive point even compared 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.309
 to the other massifs ie in this 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 kind of operation if we want that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.740
 it must be put in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.299
 putting his means first the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 massive police station keep a 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.970
 some hand on the operation he could 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.759
 so a little given enough instructions 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.960
 strong to be sure that this connection is 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.770
 do well between different 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.210
 agencies 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 which was not won at all at 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.470
 departure then the program in fact it is 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.510
 born of a statement at the time 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.680
 the level of notoriety of the mountains of 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.000
 Jura was very weak 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.340
 36% spontaneous awareness we were the 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.380
 last massive known French 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.270
 spontaneously behind the halls 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.070
 behind the Pyrenees but also 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.500
 behind the Vosges and the central massif 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.190
 and this awareness of this 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.390
 diagnosis actually allowed elected officials to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.350
 our territory since it is necessary 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.040
 remember that this is a program 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.440
 political and the basis of pooling 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 the means necessary to make 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.550
 evolve this notoriety 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.310
 the big issue from the mountains 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.190
 swore was to present on the market 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.320
 of tourism another mountain another 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.770
 mountain destination completely 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.890
 uninhibited it was not about doing the 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.010
 pale copy of alpine destinations 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.240
 it is definitely an asset in what it is 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220
 an asset because it's a 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.560
 multiplicity of wealth and 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.660
 skills of each and we have more 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.880
 of things that brings us together 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.680
 that of things that separate us and so 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.030
 it is in this sense where stronger and more 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.150
 many we are necessarily more 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.150
 effective 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.160
 event that struck me the most 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
 always remember the first time and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.300
 the first time it was a big 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.000
 poster campaign that has had in the 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.830
 seven Parisian stations with more than 2 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.830
 millions of contacts and who was putting in 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.990
 scene the Jura mountains under 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.590
 the universe of magic over 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.630
 periods there have been people said there had 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.210
 surprise so these are these are 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.060
 slogans at the start but who brought 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.830
 a little bit a color and try to 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.750
 pass on values on this 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.850
 destination to point it out of 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.730
 His public 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.470
 a slogan that's not enough today 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.900
 we must go further and go beyond 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.820
 purely advertising speech 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.050
 because people want us 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.180
 is interested in them 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.920
 they want content we want they 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.160
 want to be given 10 things 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.120
 interesting and who talks to them 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.350
 the goal for all no is to arrive 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.180
 maximum notoriety are at 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.440
 territory is in fact it is necessary that one 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.030
 be in harmony between our plans 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.650
 departmental action and then the 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.820
 Jura Mountains action plans and everything 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.890
 the world will meet there both 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.750
 strategies that of jura mountains 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.540
 is the one for us concerning the 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.000
 department of the doubs do not come 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.280
 telescope what are these are finally 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.989
 the same with the same goals 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.760
 they simply come in 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.470
 complementarity and that's it all 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.790
 the interest of this collective and the work 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.260
 that we realize together is 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.420
 to go one step further more 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.560
 strong and all together the mark 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.910
 Collective montaigne jura is 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.440
 essential for the road program 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.300
 County for this valuation 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.489
 County tourist because she 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.040
 brings a coherence of which we speech 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.049
 respective Jura mountains 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.019
 legitimately claims as the country of 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.940
 county among other assets and also 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.850
 the county can claim itself as 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.440
 located is located in the mountains of 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.760
 swore and for our targets that are 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.200
 almost the same 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.970
 it's essential to have this consistency 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.330
 to his days in the Jura Mountains 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.550
 is always magic to discover them 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.300
 go to the mountains of the 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.540
 swear points like unity is strength 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.040
 so obviously the fact of 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.430
 pooling the means allows us 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.080
 to invest powerful media we could 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.780
 from time to time make campaigns 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.710
 tv on france 2 france 3 france 5 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.860
 we could invest radio with rtl on 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.550
 also does the rtbf for example in 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.230
 Belgium 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.210
 the amount of the jura that allows to do 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.370
 together what we could not do 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.680
 alone so that allows us to put in 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.200
 implement communication campaigns 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.420
 advertising media to be investing 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.880
 social networks to make 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.220
 editions of making salons of 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.260
 participate in promotional operations 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.240
 in cities a lot of things in 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.110
 France and abroad that we could not 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.110
 not achieve alone 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.080
 surprise you're skating on a key axis in 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.860
 admiring the landscapes tell them let them 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.780
 take you away 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.440
 experience the Jura Mountains 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.440
 point fr 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.930
 the campaigns we have been 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.370
 now ten years we start to 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.020
 produce their effects begin since 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.360
 a while but produce their 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.740
 effects since the reputation is growing and 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.120
 and we are recognized when we 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.370
 let's go outside like the mountains 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.200
 Jura when I'm sailing a little bit 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.820
 outside that I report on 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.500
 departmental committees of tourism 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.010
 regional tourism committees and even 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.130
 the state 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.320
 we are very appreciative of the approach 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.510
 which has been running for ten years 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.560
 within Jura mountains even 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.560
 sometimes a little jealous 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.210
 43 minutes 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.919
 fan counted at the level of 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:34.220
 Jura mountains that's a real 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:37.250
 indicator of a sufferer who proves a 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.270
 little bit this this attachment for a 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.830
 territory 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.629
 as regards a rate of the 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.430
 notoriety is 10 points more 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.650
 the space of ten years so that we have 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.120
 earned on the mountain destination of 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.639
 day it is important to claim 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.780
 Jura mountains on the living rooms especially 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.310
 we're not in quotation marks 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.560
 only one is especially with the partners 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.599
 there really is a spirit a mark for 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.819
 all I would say Jura mountains on 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.169
 federates the actors around us when 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.599
 they say federate know as well 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.770
 ski resorts the county roads for 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.180
 a manufacture to rely on a 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.310
 micromarket operation in the heart of town 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.169
 or otherwise a toboggan run with the 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.270
 Jura Mountains ski schools 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.460
 collaboration is not all 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:14.630
 easy days it's obvious but 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.780
 she is progressing well 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.840
 it is progressing well and I think we 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.870
 is now on a path that will be 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.190
 inescapable and it will not be 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.960
 question now to make it work 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.060
 back on this mark whatever it 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.880
 happens financially and others she 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.560
 will have to continue 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.009
 the number one goal is to improve 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.370
 the notoriety and the image of the massif of 

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:39.650
 swore 

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:42.190
 and if it contributes to competitiveness 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:45.469
 tourism actors also 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:48.330
 contributed to the water keeping jobs 

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:50.330
 in the Jura Mountains 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.330
