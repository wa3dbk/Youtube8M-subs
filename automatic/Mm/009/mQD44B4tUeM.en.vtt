evolution<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.930> wall<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.199> could

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
evolution is going to be my wall I could

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.230 
evolution is going to be my wall I could
potentially<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:23.010> scissor<00:00:23.369> but<00:00:23.670> since<00:00:24.119> he's

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
potentially be scissor but since he's

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.550 
potentially be scissor but since he's
running<00:00:24.510> Malo<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.810> assuming<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.380> be

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
running Malo I'm assuming it's gonna be

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.769 
running Malo I'm assuming it's gonna be
his<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:26.039> other<00:00:26.939> than<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.359> stuff<00:00:27.689> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
his make up other than that stuff I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:28.490 
his make up other than that stuff I
gotta<00:00:27.960> worry<00:00:28.199> about

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
gotta worry about

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
gotta worry about
um<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.279> guess<00:00:29.519> gliscor<00:00:30.300> because<00:00:30.539> he<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.750> pretty

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
um I guess gliscor because he can pretty

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.540 
um I guess gliscor because he can pretty
much<00:00:30.990> wall<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.439> team<00:00:31.679> except<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
anyways I'm gonna lead off with my jewel
T<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.210> he<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.510> actually<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> lead<00:00:40.469> off

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
T on he is actually going to lead off

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
T on he is actually going to lead off
with<00:00:40.770> his<00:00:41.309> scissor<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.809> decided<00:00:43.079> for

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
with his scissor and I just decided for

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.990 
with his scissor and I just decided for
the<00:00:43.469> volt<00:00:43.620> switch<00:00:43.739> right<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> bat<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> felt

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the volt switch right off the bat I felt

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.220 
the volt switch right off the bat I felt
like<00:00:45.090> that's<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.660> best<00:00:45.780> option<00:00:46.020> for

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
like that's gonna be the best option for

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
like that's gonna be the best option for
me<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:47.039> gonna<00:00:47.160> go<00:00:47.340> straight<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:47.730> my

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
me and I'm gonna go straight into my

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
me and I'm gonna go straight into my
Zapdos<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.079> defensive

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
Zapdos because this thing is defensive

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
Zapdos because this thing is defensive
and<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.309> like<00:00:50.430> okay<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:51.210> you're

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
very surprised that he did not switch

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.499 
very surprised that he did not switch
out<00:01:15.810> there<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.200> because<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.430> takes<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.939> lot<00:01:18.330> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
out there and because he takes a lot of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.820 
out there and because he takes a lot of
damage<00:01:18.689> from<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> now<00:01:19.439> he's<00:01:19.590> gonna<00:01:19.650> go

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
damage from that and now he's gonna go

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.640 
damage from that and now he's gonna go
for<00:01:20.009> another<00:01:20.159> protect<00:01:20.689> unfortunately<00:01:21.689> it's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
for another protect unfortunately it's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.990 
for another protect unfortunately it's
just<00:01:22.830> not<00:01:22.979> gonna<00:01:23.130> work<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.430> very<00:01:23.640> well<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.850> me

just not gonna work out very well for me

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.249 
just not gonna work out very well for me
because<00:01:24.180> he's<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.600> gonna<00:01:24.750> save<00:01:24.990> her<00:01:25.049> for

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
because he's not gonna save her for

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
because he's not gonna save her for
later<00:01:25.320> as<00:01:25.650> he<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.189> ends<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.670> into<00:01:26.880> his

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.240 
out which is why I went for the volt
switch<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.960> still<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.770> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
switch but still I would have really

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.560 
switch but still I would have really
liked<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.610> rid<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.939> Gliscor<00:01:33.420> there

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
liked to get rid of that Gliscor there

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.539 
liked to get rid of that Gliscor there
just<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.079> work<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:34.890> what<00:01:35.430> he's

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
just didn't work out so now what he's

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
just didn't work out so now what he's
gonna<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.299> end<00:01:36.540> up<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.900> into<00:01:37.049> his

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gonna do is gonna end up going into his

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200 
gonna do is gonna end up going into his
Heatran<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.040> ended<00:01:38.430> up<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> Shadow

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
Heatran as I ended up going for a Shadow

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
Heatran as I ended up going for a Shadow
Ball<00:01:39.450> because<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:40.079> want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> risk

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
Ball because I don't want to risk

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.359 
Ball because I don't want to risk
anything<00:01:41.000> and<00:01:42.000> that's<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.780> guess<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
anything and that's I guess okay so I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
anything and that's I guess okay so I
can't<00:01:44.670> really<00:01:44.790> do<00:01:45.180> anything<00:01:45.210> else<00:01:45.659> though<00:01:45.869> so

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
can't really do anything else though so

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
can't really do anything else though so
I<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.409> switch<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.610> go<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> my

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I have to switch out I'm gonna go to my

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.370 
I have to switch out I'm gonna go to my
Rotom<00:01:48.329> which<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.600> probably<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.229> thing

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
Rotom which is probably the one thing

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.510 
Rotom which is probably the one thing
that<00:01:49.560> can<00:01:49.680> hit<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.950> thing<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.220> hardest

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
that can hit this thing the hardest

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
that can hit this thing the hardest
except<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.210> electivire<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.079> then

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
except for like electivire and then

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.609 
except for like electivire and then
earthquake<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.590> I

earthquake but I just I don't know I
don't<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.159> risk<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
don't want to risk that because you

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
don't want to risk that because you
could<00:01:57.479> still<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.110> amount<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.409> damage

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.490 
from that and that's honestly not too
bad<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:52.540> what<00:02:52.780> he<00:02:52.870> does<00:02:52.989> he<00:02:53.200> actually

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
bad because what he does he actually

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.930 
bad because what he does he actually
ends<00:02:53.709> up<00:02:53.769> going<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.129> gliscor<00:02:54.579> and<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.760> means

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
ends up going in gliscor and that means

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.449 
ends up going in gliscor and that means
he's<00:02:55.060> gonna<00:02:55.209> give<00:02:55.450> me<00:02:55.569> a<00:02:55.599> chance<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.530> get<00:02:57.069> rid

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
not gonna go for a roost because I know

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.569 
not gonna go for a roost because I know
this<00:03:17.440> thing<00:03:17.590> really<00:03:17.769> can't<00:03:18.040> do<00:03:18.160> anything<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
this thing really can't do anything to

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.610 
this thing really can't do anything to
me<00:03:18.699> but<00:03:19.389> he's<00:03:19.510> actually<00:03:19.690> gonna<00:03:19.870> predict<00:03:20.349> me<00:03:20.530> to

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
me but he's actually gonna predict me to

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.839 
me but he's actually gonna predict me to
go<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:20.919> roost<00:03:21.069> there<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.370> he<00:03:21.459> goes<00:03:21.609> for<00:03:21.760> an

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
go for roost there and he goes for an

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:23.099 
go for roost there and he goes for an
earthquake<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.389> it<00:03:22.480> does<00:03:22.599> a<00:03:22.629> pretty<00:03:23.019> good

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
earthquake and it does a pretty good

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.199 
earthquake and it does a pretty good
amount<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.410> damage<00:03:23.560> I'm<00:03:23.859> like<00:03:24.040> okay<00:03:24.699> I<00:03:24.879> do<00:03:25.030> not

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
amount of damage I'm like okay I do not

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.000 
amount of damage I'm like okay I do not
want<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.449> stay<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.569> again<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.379> I'm<00:03:26.799> gonna

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
want to stay in again so I'm gonna

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.580 
want to stay in again so I'm gonna
switch<00:03:27.220> out<00:03:27.609> because<00:03:28.329> obviously<00:03:28.750> he's<00:03:29.319> just

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
switch out because obviously he's just

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.319 
switch out because obviously he's just
gonna<00:03:29.739> go<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.549> another<00:03:30.639> earthquake<00:03:31.180> and

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
gonna go for another earthquake and

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.610 
gonna go for another earthquake and
there's<00:03:31.449> nothing<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.780> can<00:03:31.930> really<00:03:31.959> do<00:03:32.260> about<00:03:32.349> it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
there's nothing I can really do about it

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.750 
there's nothing I can really do about it
so<00:03:32.680> I'm<00:03:32.739> gonna<00:03:32.829> go<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.069> my<00:03:33.129> thunderous<00:03:33.579> I'm

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
so I'm gonna go to my thunderous I'm

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.430 
so I'm gonna go to my thunderous I'm
hoping<00:03:34.599> that<00:03:34.750> he<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:35.019> goes<00:03:35.169> for<00:03:35.319> another

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
hoping that he just goes for another

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
hoping that he just goes for another
earthquake<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.099> that<00:03:36.340> he<00:03:36.699> does<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.359> that's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
earthquake and that he does so that's

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.559 
earthquake and that he does so that's
completely<00:03:38.169> okay<00:03:38.859> with<00:03:38.889> me<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.879> now<00:03:40.000> he's

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
completely okay with me so now he's

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.420 
completely okay with me so now he's
gonna<00:03:40.750> end<00:03:40.930> up<00:03:41.049> going<00:03:41.199> into<00:03:41.500> Latios<00:03:42.129> I'm<00:03:42.280> gonna

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
gonna end up going into Latios I'm gonna

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.729 
gonna end up going into Latios I'm gonna
go<00:03:42.489> for<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.699> sub<00:03:43.060> just<00:03:43.959> because<00:03:44.079> I<00:03:44.410> didn't<00:03:44.650> know

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
go for a sub just because I didn't know

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.199 
go for a sub just because I didn't know
necessarily<00:03:45.069> he's<00:03:45.519> gonna<00:03:45.639> stay<00:03:45.879> in<00:03:45.940> or<00:03:46.090> not

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
necessarily he's gonna stay in or not

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.670 
necessarily he's gonna stay in or not
and<00:03:46.359> like<00:03:46.510> going<00:03:46.750> for<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:46.989> sub<00:03:47.199> really<00:03:47.470> can't

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
and like going for a sub really can't

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.460 
and like going for a sub really can't
hurt<00:03:47.970> HP<00:03:48.970> ice<00:03:49.120> does<00:03:49.359> not<00:03:49.540> kill<00:03:49.810> but<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.290> looks

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
hurt HP ice does not kill but it looks

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.860 
hurt HP ice does not kill but it looks
like<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.769> know<00:03:50.889> maybe<00:03:51.099> just<00:03:51.519> one<00:03:52.359> more<00:03:52.389> would

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
be able to knock him out so I don't

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.920

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
now and I'm gonna go for the Shadow Ball

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.390 
now and I'm gonna go for the Shadow Ball
I<00:05:19.360> I<00:05:19.600> realized<00:05:20.500> that<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.919> know<00:05:21.040> he<00:05:21.280> was<00:05:21.370> a

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
I I realized that you know he was a

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.980 
I I realized that you know he was a
different<00:05:21.790> typing<00:05:22.060> now<00:05:22.150> because<00:05:22.419> of<00:05:22.570> ice<00:05:22.750> beam

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
different typing now because of ice beam

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.350 
different typing now because of ice beam
so<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:23.860> was<00:05:23.950> like<00:05:24.070> okay<00:05:24.430> maybe<00:05:24.639> Shadow<00:05:25.000> Ball<00:05:25.180> can

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
so I was like okay maybe Shadow Ball can

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.879 
so I was like okay maybe Shadow Ball can
kill<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.870> just<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.139> case<00:05:26.260> he<00:05:26.440> were<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.740> like

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
kill and just in case he were to like

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.460 
kill and just in case he were to like
you<00:05:27.130> know<00:05:27.280> bring<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.360> Gliscor<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.320> mean

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
you know bring in Gliscor I mean

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.960 
you know bring in Gliscor I mean
obviously<00:05:29.830> an<00:05:29.919> HP<00:05:30.190> ice<00:05:30.280> isn't<00:05:30.520> gonna<00:05:30.640> do<00:05:30.820> much

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
obviously an HP ice isn't gonna do much

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.310 
obviously an HP ice isn't gonna do much
I<00:05:31.240> didn't<00:05:31.390> want<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.570> risk<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:32.050> far

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
I didn't want to risk it that far

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.900 
I didn't want to risk it that far
especially<00:05:33.100> since<00:05:33.490> he<00:05:33.550> could<00:05:33.669> have<00:05:33.760> easily

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
especially since he could have easily

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.180 
especially since he could have easily
brought<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:34.300> scizor<00:05:34.600> but<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:35.710> was<00:05:35.890> kind<00:05:36.160> of

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
brought in scizor but that was kind of

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.770 
brought in scizor but that was kind of
what<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.370> was<00:05:36.550> thinking<00:05:36.580> and<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.210> was<00:05:37.300> like<00:05:37.419> okay

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
what I was thinking and I was like okay

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.420 
what I was thinking and I was like okay
well<00:05:38.020> electivire<00:05:38.620> isn't<00:05:38.950> really<00:05:39.130> gonna<00:05:39.250> do

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
well electivire isn't really gonna do

if I'm able to get rid of Gliscor it is

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.020 
if I'm able to get rid of Gliscor it is
a<00:05:52.810> gg<00:05:53.380> because<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:54.039> means<00:05:54.160> greninja<00:05:54.580> really

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
a gg because that means greninja really

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.700 
a gg because that means greninja really
can't<00:05:55.210> do<00:05:55.360> anything<00:05:55.539> to<00:05:55.750> me<00:05:55.870> at<00:05:55.960> all<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:56.590> now

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.200 
can't do anything to me at all so now
he's<00:05:56.830> gonna<00:05:56.919> end<00:05:57.100> up<00:05:57.190> bringing<00:05:57.370> greninja<00:05:57.820> he's

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
he's gonna end up bringing greninja he's

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.719 
he's gonna end up bringing greninja he's
going<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.720> go<00:05:58.840> for<00:05:59.080> that<00:05:59.169> ice<00:05:59.380> beam<00:05:59.650> and<00:05:59.860> it<00:06:00.490> is

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
going to go for that ice beam and it is

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.760 
going to go for that ice beam and it is
going<00:06:01.030> to<00:06:01.180> do<00:06:01.360> a<00:06:01.390> pretty<00:06:01.960> good<00:06:02.410> amount<00:06:02.710> of

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
going to do a pretty good amount of

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.190 
going to do a pretty good amount of
damage<00:06:02.950> but<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.400> live<00:06:03.820> able<00:06:04.479> to<00:06:04.539> retaliate<00:06:04.870> with

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
damage but I live able to retaliate with

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.260 
damage but I live able to retaliate with
the<00:06:05.289> Thunderbolt<00:06:05.800> even<00:06:06.400> if<00:06:06.490> I<00:06:06.669> didn't<00:06:07.060> live

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
the Thunderbolt even if I didn't live

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.610 
the Thunderbolt even if I didn't live
pretty<00:06:07.720> sure<00:06:07.870> I<00:06:07.900> could<00:06:08.050> have<00:06:08.260> just<00:06:08.380> gone<00:06:08.470> in

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:08.620 
pretty sure I could have just gone in

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.150 
pretty sure I could have just gone in
Jolteon<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:09.520> gone<00:06:09.729> for<00:06:10.090> a<00:06:10.120> thunderbolt<00:06:11.160> most

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
Jolteon and gone for a thunderbolt most

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.950 
Jolteon and gone for a thunderbolt most
likely<00:06:12.700> would<00:06:12.880> have<00:06:12.910> killed<00:06:13.270> I<00:06:13.450> don't<00:06:13.600> see<00:06:13.750> why

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
likely would have killed I don't see why

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.190 
likely would have killed I don't see why
it<00:06:14.020> wouldn't<00:06:14.320> have<00:06:14.560> so<00:06:14.890> there<00:06:15.640> we<00:06:15.729> go<00:06:15.760> anyways

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
it wouldn't have so there we go anyways
