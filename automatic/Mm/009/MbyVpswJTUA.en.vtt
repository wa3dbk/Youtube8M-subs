 Wig Odin Station Splash 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.300
 teraterm Express love the latest model of weekly attention corner of Burudu today 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.609
 Is it 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:30.490
 I would like to introduce the effects of the stick with oo 9's president Yoko Sekine, 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:36.910
 There are a lot of effects companies of Los Maa . 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:40.270
 What kind of feeling would it be like to explain the brand called Sticky Island ? 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 Do Tteyuu direction I'm aiming is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.680
 a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.630
 Player 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.160
 Oh dear 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:53.320
 I want to spread those Ja ne freedom if as much as possible of that is used 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:58.990
 Even though it seems to Tteyuu width of the play or the one like attitude toward the enthusiast 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:03.620
 Basically, always head smell something like this gives a degree of freedom, including to such things 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:07.850
 That in with the aim of those say good easy to use Te 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:12.560
 I think you are aiming ordinary 's not something contents Takeda future but 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:18.409
 Well the effects are really good too recently that so-called multi-effects various companies 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.649
 I want to put out, but I 'm looking for a variety of things that are quite responsive as well . 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.210
 After all I like the answer 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.840
 That's a bit of a shame The dual game this and the fight against today 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:33.810
 It is a product that I received 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:41.219
 Yes There are also various Well second prize, but it is characterized by little a 8 of parody strike's 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.000
 Usually I do it in the cause 1 stage, but when it is delusional, it is distorted from the direction of the bass string first 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.500
 Let's go 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.410
 The feeling that four coffees were completely crushed is also in the first stage 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.770
 As a characteristic of the distortion circuit itself, it produces a huge amount of overtones 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:01.390
 An adult who seems to be silent without having a bass 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.990
 Basically it's easy to use as a structure, but let's use it as a filter or use a tone 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.990
 Various patients 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 Though we devise various ideas while devising 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:15.890
 In my case, I have two cause stages. 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:23.010
 Lightly distorted in the first stage cause stage The overtone component that has been completed with your name and full 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.760
 It is raised by scraping in this high-cut in the second stage of the stage Tteyuu distort Got 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:31.829
 Little wonder if their own ideas out that say the two-stage 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.189
 It's a distortion of about Cody Situation after it is distorted ? 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:39.269
 Nee The celebration filter is about to enter 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:43.000
 Well cone way I'd have been cut or this is packed that day 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:47.100
 First of all, it's a little distorted and then that filter weater 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.740
 We entered that Sousu after them and this man together entered contains 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.610
 In two steps 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.510
 Do we Well it is going to visit than this will be discussed a little longer 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.189
 I wonder if you ask 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.500
 j First of all, it seems to be good from the clean note 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.500
 It is the state of the line Yes 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.000
 Even such a basic note like this 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.530
 Well then 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.840
 The first stage, which was said First earlier in was the distortion sound 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.150
 Delivery Then we will raise only here 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.150
 [musics] 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.280
 A little up I guess 2 of b station like this 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:42.989
 Voice is still bent Well a little time useless while distorted in that the first of the first-stage Mothers Never to 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.950
 Therefore still is I Ah such'm sorry now I even got cut does not collapse so much 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.620
 It was 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:54.310
 It is no good if not up a little only but I was a child say this 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.310
 Yes, about ze timer half grapher filter is in how much 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.090
 Yes now 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.090
 Sai Ikima the second stage raised pounding 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.950
 [musics] 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.389
 I 'm coming, I 'm coming from above 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:24.430
 A little off the figures in this with you some want to with a little more love 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.430
 I think that's what it looks like 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:35.100
 I thought of the filter so-called the 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:40.440
 About that one thing is a filter and that flag a little different again 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.730
 Yes I'm doing a cut only, I'm in a state that people will not enter at all anymore 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.939
 Ne 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.939
 [applause] 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:53.320
 It seems to go like this as a basic setting in general, I like something 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:58.339
 Chinese-style first stage of the said to the floor reverse Ha lower hard to second-stage and split 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.339
 [applause] 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.890
 You had already come in now 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:07.090
 Follow 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.030
 [musics] 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.180
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.169
 This Gajuaru up Inti strike employees 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.490
 This is 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:20.419
 Today is the line, so it's all about tube amps 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:27.349
 You're not going to get rid of feedback something like this 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:29.670
 Also I heard that I Kita still in place each want to say Koizumi per bass that 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:32.580
 From the mass 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.750
 Dual cause distortion a bit strange 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.750
 It is not a problem of the mechanism
