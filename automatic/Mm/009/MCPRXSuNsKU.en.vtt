out<00:01:54.860> initially<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:55.979> thought<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.520> maybe

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
out initially people thought that maybe

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
out initially people thought that maybe
it<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.060> become<00:01:57.570> tied<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> American

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
