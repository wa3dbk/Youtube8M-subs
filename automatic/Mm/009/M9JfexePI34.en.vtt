a file guide now a couple of brands make
these<00:00:51.340> I'm<00:00:51.670> using<00:00:51.879> a<00:00:52.000> daemon<00:00:52.359> one<00:00:52.480> today<00:00:52.809> but

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
they're really useful so what I'm going

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.599 
they're really useful so what I'm going
to<00:00:58.269> do<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.570> start<00:00:58.809> off<00:00:58.960> with<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.289> just<00:00:59.609> inspect

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
to do to start off with is just inspect

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.639 
to do to start off with is just inspect
the<00:01:00.760> edge<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.089> really<00:01:01.239> look<00:01:01.480> for<00:01:01.750> bears<00:01:02.109> so

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the edge and really look for bears so

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.619 
the edge and really look for bears so
these<00:01:03.460> would<00:01:03.609> be<00:01:03.670> parts<00:01:04.030> on<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.269> edge<00:01:04.390> where

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
these would be parts on the edge where

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.270 
these would be parts on the edge where
you<00:01:04.720> may<00:01:04.839> have<00:01:04.960> hit<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.199> rock<00:01:05.530> or<00:01:05.800> a<00:01:06.040> railer

you may have hit a rock or a railer
score<00:01:06.610> some<00:01:06.790> edge<00:01:06.940> damaged<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.420> we're<00:01:07.510> just

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
score some edge damaged and we're just

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.360 
score some edge damaged and we're just
going<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.840> be<00:01:07.930> trying<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.680> find<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.070> major

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
going to be trying to find that major

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.090 
going to be trying to find that major
damage<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:09.880> reducing<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.480> before<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:10.990> set<00:01:11.980> the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
damage and reducing it before we set the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.340 
damage and reducing it before we set the
new<00:01:12.220> edge<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:13.210> I'm<00:01:13.600> going<00:01:13.750> to<00:01:13.810> do<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.049> just<00:01:14.200> by

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
new edge so I'm going to do this just by

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.380 
new edge so I'm going to do this just by
running<00:01:14.619> my<00:01:14.710> finger<00:01:15.159> along<00:01:15.430> along<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.270> edge

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
running my finger along along the edge

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.569 
running my finger along along the edge
very<00:01:17.259> very<00:01:17.590> lightly<00:01:17.799> and<00:01:18.009> carefully<00:01:18.220> because

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
very very lightly and carefully because

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.819 
very very lightly and carefully because
these<00:01:18.759> can<00:01:18.939> be<00:01:19.090> quite<00:01:19.210> sharp<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:19.990> we're<00:01:20.710> just

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
these can be quite sharp and we're just

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.300 
these can be quite sharp and we're just
looking<00:01:21.040> for<00:01:21.540> four<00:01:22.540> rough<00:01:23.049> patches<00:01:23.350> when<00:01:24.189> we

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
looking for four rough patches when we

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.780 
looking for four rough patches when we
come<00:01:24.460> across<00:01:24.790> one<00:01:25.030> if<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.540> grab<00:01:25.750> your<00:01:25.899> file

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
come across one if you grab your file

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.520 
come across one if you grab your file
you<00:01:27.790> can<00:01:27.909> just<00:01:28.180> start<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.780> take<00:01:28.960> away<00:01:29.229> some<00:01:29.470> of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
you can just start to take away some of

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.649 
you can just start to take away some of
those<00:01:29.680> bears<00:01:30.009> very<00:01:30.340> lightly<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.939> this<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.390> the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
those bears very lightly so this is the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.510 
those bears very lightly so this is the
edging<00:01:38.590> tool<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.130> you're<00:01:39.250> going<00:01:39.369> to<00:01:39.430> be

using to sharpen your edges you want to
make<00:01:41.710> sure<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.159> put<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.430> cross<00:01:43.030> head

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
make sure that you put that cross head

were<00:02:16.630> nice<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.379> sharp<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.220> lot<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.489> these

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.110 
case it's worth going to their website
and<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.290> trying<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> find<00:02:27.710> out<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.160> if<00:02:28.460> it<00:02:29.030> is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and just trying to find out if if it is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.760 
and just trying to find out if if it is
a<00:02:29.150> directional<00:02:29.510> file<00:02:29.900> or<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.290> can<00:02:30.470> use<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
a directional file or if you can use it

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.260 
a directional file or if you can use it
both<00:02:30.920> ways<00:02:31.190> so<00:02:31.610> once<00:02:31.790> you've<00:02:31.910> figured<00:02:32.060> out

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
both ways so once you've figured out

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.820 
both ways so once you've figured out
which<00:02:32.420> direction<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.960> file<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.530> meant<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
which direction you file it's meant to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.230 
which direction you file it's meant to
be<00:02:33.920> running<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.460> you've<00:02:34.610> got<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.820> set<00:02:35.000> in<00:02:35.150> the

be running and you've got it set in the
90-degree<00:02:36.010> side<00:02:37.010> we're<00:02:37.340> going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.490> start<00:02:37.760> to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
90-degree side we're going to start to

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.330 
90-degree side we're going to start to
file<00:02:38.360> away<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.840> edge<00:02:38.990> now<00:02:39.800> there's<00:02:40.040> lots<00:02:40.190> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
file away the edge now there's lots of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.830 
file away the edge now there's lots of
different<00:02:40.400> schools<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.180> thought<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.630> whether

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
different schools of thought on whether

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.690 
different schools of thought on whether
you're<00:02:42.020> meant<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:42.830> these<00:02:43.040> tools<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:43.640> your

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you're meant to use these tools on your

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.650 
you're meant to use these tools on your
base<00:02:44.150> edge<00:02:44.590> or<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:45.890> your<00:02:46.010> side<00:02:46.280> edge<00:02:46.660> my

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
base edge or just your side edge my

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.260 
base edge or just your side edge my
personal<00:02:48.140> opinion<00:02:48.560> is<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.770> if<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.880> use<00:02:50.120> it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
personal opinion is that if you use it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.880 
personal opinion is that if you use it
too<00:02:50.480> much<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.990> base<00:02:51.170> edge<00:02:51.440> it's<00:02:51.680> going<00:02:51.770> to

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
too much on the base edge it's going to

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.910 
too much on the base edge it's going to
bring<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.220> edge<00:02:52.600> below<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.960> base<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.560> then

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
bring the edge below the base and then

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.170 
bring the edge below the base and then
what<00:02:55.130> you'll<00:02:55.250> need<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> do<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.790> get<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:55.940> base

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
what you'll need to do is get a base

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.720 
what you'll need to do is get a base
grind<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.690> bring<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.990> base<00:02:57.170> back<00:02:57.500> down<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:58.250> sit

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
grind to bring the base back down to sit

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.550 
grind to bring the base back down to sit
flush<00:02:58.940> with<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.300> edge<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.050> we'd<00:03:00.230> recommend

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
flush with the edge so we'd recommend

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.890 
flush with the edge so we'd recommend
probably<00:03:01.060> filing<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.210> base<00:03:02.450> stitch<00:03:02.720> down

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
probably filing the base stitch down

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.870 
probably filing the base stitch down
with<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> gummy<00:03:03.380> stone<00:03:03.740> removing<00:03:04.490> any<00:03:04.610> burrs

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
with the gummy stone removing any burrs

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.210 
with the gummy stone removing any burrs
but<00:03:05.480> setting<00:03:05.930> any<00:03:06.050> edge<00:03:06.260> bevel<00:03:06.680> only<00:03:06.980> on<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
but setting any edge bevel only on the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.440 
but setting any edge bevel only on the
side<00:03:07.430> edge<00:03:07.670> which<00:03:07.880> is<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.150> we're<00:03:08.270> going<00:03:08.300> to

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
side edge which is what we're going to

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.120 
side edge which is what we're going to
do<00:03:08.630> now<00:03:09.010> so<00:03:10.010> got<00:03:10.400> it<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.580> at<00:03:10.700> 90<00:03:11.000> degrees<00:03:11.300> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
do now so got it in at 90 degrees and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.500 
do now so got it in at 90 degrees and
we're<00:03:13.130> going<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.280> make<00:03:13.430> sure<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.360> it's

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
we're going to make sure that it's

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.360 
we're going to make sure that it's
sitting<00:03:14.660> nice<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.020> flush<00:03:15.590> against<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.190> edge

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
sitting nice and flush against the edge

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.030 
sitting nice and flush against the edge
and<00:03:16.700> then<00:03:17.240> in<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.510> couple<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.870> smooth<00:03:18.200> movements

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
and then in a couple of smooth movements

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.940 
and then in a couple of smooth movements
we're<00:03:19.160> gonna<00:03:19.280> run<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.730> along<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.540> edge<00:03:20.810> so

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.320 

we're<00:03:27.950> going<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> couple<00:03:28.670> of<00:03:28.730> passes<00:03:29.150> and

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
we're going to do a couple of passes and

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.780 
we're going to do a couple of passes and
you'll<00:03:29.720> be<00:03:29.840> able<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.110> feel<00:03:30.410> where<00:03:30.830> your<00:03:31.310> file

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
you'll be able to feel where your file

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.160 
you'll be able to feel where your file
is<00:03:31.820> hitting<00:03:32.300> those<00:03:32.450> bears<00:03:40.600> three<00:03:41.600> passes<00:03:42.110> is

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
is hitting those bears three passes is

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.360 
is hitting those bears three passes is
probably<00:03:42.560> enough<00:03:42.770> you<00:03:42.890> don't<00:03:42.980> want<00:03:43.160> to<00:03:43.220> take

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
probably enough you don't want to take

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.300 
probably enough you don't want to take
away<00:03:43.489> too<00:03:43.640> much<00:03:44.060> material<00:03:44.300> a<00:03:44.860> lot<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:45.980> people

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
away too much material a lot of people

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.520 
away too much material a lot of people
will<00:03:46.459> actually<00:03:46.580> draw<00:03:47.110> along<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.260> edge<00:03:48.350> with

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
will actually draw along the edge with

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.050 
will actually draw along the edge with
the<00:03:48.590> marker<00:03:48.950> pen<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.310> they<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:49.580> see<00:03:49.730> exactly

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the marker pen so they can see exactly

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.660 
the marker pen so they can see exactly
what<00:03:50.360> they're<00:03:50.510> taking<00:03:50.690> off<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:52.040> that<00:03:52.070> final

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
what they're taking off so that final

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.080 
what they're taking off so that final
pass<00:03:52.850> felt<00:03:53.150> really<00:03:53.420> smooth<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.850> should

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
pass felt really smooth and that should

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.820 
pass felt really smooth and that should
be<00:03:56.180> good<00:03:56.209> make<00:03:56.989> sure<00:03:57.020> you<00:03:57.320> don't<00:03:57.500> touch<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
be good make sure you don't touch the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.470 
be good make sure you don't touch the
edge<00:03:58.160> after<00:03:58.790> you've<00:03:58.880> done<00:03:59.030> this<00:03:59.209> because<00:03:59.390> it

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
edge after you've done this because it

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.090 
edge after you've done this because it
will<00:03:59.600> be<00:03:59.750> full<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.080> metal<00:04:00.350> shards<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:00.830> if<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
will be full of metal shards so if you

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.460 
will be full of metal shards so if you
just<00:04:01.250> grab<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.580> rag<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:03.110> get<00:04:03.290> rid<00:04:03.410> of

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
just grab a rag you can just get rid of

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.010 
just grab a rag you can just get rid of
all<00:04:03.650> those<00:04:03.770> shards<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:04.510> they<00:04:05.510> don't<00:04:05.690> end<00:04:05.810> up<00:04:05.900> in

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
all those shards so they don't end up in

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.380 
all those shards so they don't end up in
your<00:04:06.080> fingers<00:04:08.770> and<00:04:09.770> that<00:04:10.610> edge<00:04:10.850> should<00:04:11.180> now

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
your fingers and that edge should now

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.570 
your fingers and that edge should now
feel<00:04:11.690> rather<00:04:12.230> smooth<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.890> touch<00:04:13.010> you<00:04:13.430> can

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
feel rather smooth to the touch you can

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.729 
feel rather smooth to the touch you can
do<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> little<00:04:13.940> nail<00:04:14.239> test<00:04:14.600> as<00:04:14.810> well<00:04:15.050> if<00:04:15.590> you

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
do a little nail test as well if you

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.680 
do a little nail test as well if you
just<00:04:15.860> run<00:04:16.040> your<00:04:16.100> nail<00:04:16.400> down<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.790> edge<00:04:16.910> if<00:04:17.570> it

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
just run your nail down the edge if it

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.449 
just run your nail down the edge if it
takes<00:04:17.930> off<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.140> fraction<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.769> material<00:04:18.830> from<00:04:19.340> in

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
takes off a fraction of material from in

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.729 
takes off a fraction of material from in
now<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:19.970> know<00:04:20.090> it's<00:04:20.269> nice<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.750> sharp<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.560> once

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
now you know it's nice and sharp so once

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.909 
now you know it's nice and sharp so once
you've<00:04:21.919> run<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.690> 90-degree<00:04:23.690> edge<00:04:23.870> file<00:04:24.230> all

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
you've run that 90-degree edge file all

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.890 
you've run that 90-degree edge file all
the<00:04:25.160> way<00:04:25.310> on<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.669> side<00:04:26.120> edge<00:04:26.360> from<00:04:26.720> one

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
the way on the side edge from one

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.810 
the way on the side edge from one
contact<00:04:27.320> points<00:04:27.710> through<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.730> other

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
contact points through to the other

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.940 
contact points through to the other
contact<00:04:29.270> point<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:30.260> can<00:04:30.410> flip<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.770> board

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
contact point you can flip the board

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.719 
contact point you can flip the board
over<00:04:31.160> and<00:04:31.490> do<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.120> same<00:04:32.330> on<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.870> other<00:04:33.020> side

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
over and do the same on the other side

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.650 
over and do the same on the other side
the<00:04:34.729> next<00:04:35.030> step<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.419> to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
the next step is to

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480 
the next step is to
grab<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.810> gummy<00:04:36.140> stone<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.920> to<00:04:36.980> polish<00:04:37.220> up

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
grab a gummy stone and just to polish up

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.080 
grab a gummy stone and just to polish up
both<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.970> side<00:04:38.240> edge<00:04:38.480> and<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.020> base<00:04:39.200> edge<00:04:39.500> and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
both the side edge and the base edge and

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.730 
both the side edge and the base edge and
just<00:04:41.090> get<00:04:41.300> just<00:04:41.630> smoothing<00:04:42.050> out<00:04:42.140> any<00:04:42.380> of<00:04:42.560> those

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
just get just smoothing out any of those

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.100 
just get just smoothing out any of those
final<00:04:43.340> microbrews<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.420> may<00:04:44.600> have<00:04:44.810> and

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
final microbrews that you may have and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.930 
final microbrews that you may have and
get<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.410> edge<00:04:45.500> really<00:04:45.890> nice<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.340> smooth<00:04:46.640> and

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
get the edge really nice and smooth and

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.180 
get the edge really nice and smooth and
good<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.480> go<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:48.320> once<00:04:48.530> you've<00:04:48.650> got<00:04:48.800> your<00:04:48.830> edges

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
good to go so once you've got your edges

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.100 
good to go so once you've got your edges
nice<00:04:49.430> and<00:04:49.640> sharp<00:04:49.820> one<00:04:50.240> final<00:04:50.630> step<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:50.960> might

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
nice and sharp one final step you might

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.900 
nice and sharp one final step you might
want<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.380> take<00:04:51.650> it's<00:04:52.220> just<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.520> detune<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
want to take it's just a detune the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.580 
want to take it's just a detune the
contact<00:04:53.450> point<00:04:53.630> slightly<00:04:53.900> so<00:04:54.260> that<00:04:54.410> you

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
contact point slightly so that you

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.250 
contact point slightly so that you
reduce<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.310> chances<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.700> hanging<00:04:56.060> up<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:56.960> the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
reduce the chances of hanging up so the

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.570 
reduce the chances of hanging up so the
way<00:04:57.350> you<00:04:57.410> do<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.950> take<00:04:58.130> your<00:04:58.280> file

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
way you do that is you take your file

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.870 
way you do that is you take your file
and<00:04:58.850> at<00:04:59.180> 45<00:04:59.660> degrees<00:05:00.040> you<00:05:01.040> just<00:05:01.250> want<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.520> round

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
and at 45 degrees you just want to round

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:14.350 
and at 45 degrees you just want to round
off<00:05:02.150> those<00:05:02.390> edges<00:05:09.070> slightly<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:13.150> then<00:05:14.150> you

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
off those edges slightly and then you

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.210 
off those edges slightly and then you
will<00:05:14.480> repeat<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:15.110> obviously<00:05:15.680> in<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:16.010> four

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
will repeat that obviously in the four

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.190 
will repeat that obviously in the four
corners<00:05:16.640> of<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:17.690> board<00:05:17.930> where<00:05:18.140> the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
corners of the the board where the

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.870 
corners of the the board where the
contact<00:05:18.620> points<00:05:18.920> are<00:05:19.100> so<00:05:19.700> you've<00:05:19.850> just

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
contact points are so you've just

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.580 
contact points are so you've just
detuned<00:05:20.600> your<00:05:20.810> contact<00:05:21.200> points<00:05:21.530> and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
detuned your contact points and

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.140 
detuned your contact points and
sharpened<00:05:22.010> your<00:05:22.100> edges<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.700> you're<00:05:22.820> ready<00:05:22.970> to

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
sharpened your edges and you're ready to

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.240 
sharpened your edges and you're ready to
take<00:05:23.270> your<00:05:23.420> board<00:05:23.570> out<00:05:23.750> on<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.020> hill<00:05:24.250> some

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
take your board out on the hill some

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.100 
take your board out on the hill some
jibbers<00:05:25.700> may<00:05:25.910> choose<00:05:26.120> to<00:05:26.330> employ<00:05:26.570> that<00:05:26.810> filing
