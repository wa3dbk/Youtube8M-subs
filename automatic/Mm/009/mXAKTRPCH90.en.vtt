00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, I'll show you today like one 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.899
 make sauce hollandaise yourself 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.719
 my information is sufficient for two portions 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.630
 and for this you need about 80 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.849
 grams of butter or margarine 1 egg to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.039
 I have a small glass separate then 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.640
 you need a tablespoon of water as well 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.980
 a third of a tablespoon of lemon juice or 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 Lemon concentrate needed for seasoning 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.779
 you salt and pepper you can too 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.939
 Use cayenne pepper if you like that 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.830
 like to have and then you have one more 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.300
 make a bath for this you need 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.850
 a pot I'm up to half 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.290
 about filled with water and there 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.989
 needed a small bowl for 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 on top 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 in the first step you put your pot 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.469
 with the water bath on high flame 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.180
 the hearth and now you separate your own 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.180
 now strengthened on the edge 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:01:00.590
 now you can open it easily and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.590
 allow the protein to run on the side 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.250
 so and the allgÃ¤u you live now in yours 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250
 bowl 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 this is now a tablespoon of water 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:25.799
 as well as a third of a tablespoon of that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:28.020
 Lemons concentrate a good splash 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.420
 so now you give a little salt 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:35.189
 and now everything has to be fine 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.079
 It is best done by mixing them 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.490
 with a whisk until all one 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.490
 become creamy mass 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.400
 a few minutes is the whole then 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.320
 finished now you take the keys from 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.280
 then she will not be in the water 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.750
 curdles and once swaps the pots 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 because now the mother has to 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
 or the margarine 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.450
 be melted be careful that 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.760
 she does not get too hot but that we 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.200
 Just take it to the load and take it 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.700
 then when it's done back down 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:12.260
 The melted butter has become like that now 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.020
 and now you give your sauce slowly 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:34.130
 with a tablespoon and stir 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:42.680
 You have to be careful and slow 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:44.959
 this already done so now she has to 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.200
 be tasted again for this 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:56.739
 you need your barrels and again 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.739
 little salt, stir everything well again 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.630
 and then she is already finished the 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.640
 In retrospect, sauce can no longer be used 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.410
 be heated because otherwise it coagulates 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.810
 how it tastes very well, for example 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.380
 asparagus have fun imitating and 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.380
 Enjoy your meal
