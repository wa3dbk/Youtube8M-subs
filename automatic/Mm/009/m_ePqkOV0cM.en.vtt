00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.350
 great for every lover to demolish 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.540
 towers in shooters I'm not at all autistic 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.240
 which very time decided to shoot 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.240
 review of call of duty black ops 2 when here 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.670
 here she comes to her logical 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.609
 sunset and just decided to share my opinion 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.260
 about this game with your impressions 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 which I have and share 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 I can only with you because my friends 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.070
 fucking fag who simply disdain 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.279
 play shooters 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.469
 black ops 2 is generally the most water it 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.850
 shit and at the same time the most popular 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.879
 modern shooter 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.190
 I'll say from the beginning that I'm big 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.230
 fan of this game but it is not at all 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.129
 means there are no things in this game 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.980
 which would not induce me to desire 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.440
 yoga something solid oblong 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.260
 over the heads of the developers about all this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.070
 Of course, in order, I will try to avoid 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 some confusion so where am I ran 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.260
 so there is nothing definite to do 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 the lion's share of success comes to be 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 single-player as if his tongues are not evil 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.600
 vilified but he's great is created 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 impression of several games and how much 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.000
 interactive cinema and see still but 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.650
 also great what the whole saga play with 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 oh so beautiful 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.720
 the whole saga with this fucking raul menendez 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.640
 riot by the way the main antagonist 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.130
 games leader international 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.170
 terrorist organization blah blah blah 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.560
 bla bla who dreams to win 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.070
 north america and who has a sister 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.829
 Josephine who mercilessly fucked why 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.520
 he caught huge baguettes very plot 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.759
 leaves no questions he 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 awesome 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.670
 and indeed from the script everything is built 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 very high level but there is one 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.259
 fucking but in the plot with some kind of cancer 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.820
 developers decided to move action 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.759
 games in the distant motive of the year 2025 and everything 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.310
 nothing but how they see this fucking 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.649
 new age suggests that here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.330
 just no drag dealer thing is not 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.500
 cost 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.630
 jump will know where some ppl and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.110
 flying mines ultrasound emitters 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.960
 everything is like this fictional herb all this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.320
 distorts the beautiful game that 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.750
 at first did not conceive such a hearty 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.780
 fairly I carried the brain out of the cranial 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.150
 boxes and before it is completely 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.540
 destroy it with the most moral 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.090
 way to fuck the remaining parts 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.920
 common sense is really up 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.920
 insanity comes as far as not run away 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.560
 and the gameplay is simply gorgeous, and I do not 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.920
 I want no crooked word to say those in 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.900
 his side is all clear here 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.610
 this mudachsky machine gun which is impossible 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.270
 neutralize and who will get you 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.990
 everywhere 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.420
 shave ready very long mine it at all 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.240
 a scourge that could only happen in a call 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.510
 of duty and such things just spoil 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.490
 gameplay right now I killed you can 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 run away with thoughts now here 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.130
 drag but hirama media hit you 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.920
 forehead asshole put me not at all 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.740
 bombed out of these fucking mine in general 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.720
 there is a way 1 not to explode this lie down 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.660
 while she starts to buzz 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.940
 but it all happens at such a wild pace 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.580
 that you just do not have time during 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.470
 I will not think what I think 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.410
 In general, the gap should have been dug to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.620
 come up with something terrifying but 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 we have what we have 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.770
 we have in principle a really cool game 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.170
 so do not think 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.810
 the fact that I am somehow saying this game to me 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.030
 don't like just the individual details in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.330
 mainly we are dealing with the present 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.330
 a masterpiece 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.720
 threw the parcel 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:12.610
 oh you bitch for it is necessary to put on the hose 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.610
 This insolence is inhuman 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.550
 Well, the menu is what horrified me 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.250
 not once as I just opened 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.020
 multiplayer this grand fucking 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.860
 just for human perception 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.590
 dozens of game modes a lot of all kinds 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.630
 upgrade weapons all very very 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.650
 it is very difficult to digest 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.690
 forty second level is already dohrena and 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.160
 it is believed that I almost passed the game 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.680
 but mastered only 50 percent of the system 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.620
 respawn then this is probably the last minus 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.770
 games you can rise right behind 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.080
 back of the opponent but considering how much I 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.500
 Doha Lucky Guy is Risen in 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.540
 mostly behind my back it's not at all 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.150
 great 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.070
 seems to say everything in general 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.800
 the toy is more than excellent 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.960
 I really liked it in principle and I 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.510
 looking forward to call of duty ghost 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.330
 that she will represent me 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.150
 I will definitely tell you so if you 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.340
 interesting subscribe if not mind 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.030
 I will not understand why you are all this now 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.030
 watched
