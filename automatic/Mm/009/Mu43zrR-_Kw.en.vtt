another question episode and today's
question<00:00:13.019> has<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:13.740> camera<00:00:14.400> cards<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
question has to do with camera cards so

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.480 
question has to do with camera cards so
here's<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> question<00:00:15.750> our<00:00:16.410> multiple<00:00:16.949> 16

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
here's the question our multiple 16

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.720 
here's the question our multiple 16
gigabyte<00:00:18.000> card<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.480> better<00:00:18.690> than<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.650> two

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
gigabyte card is better than one or two

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.870 
gigabyte card is better than one or two
32<00:00:20.730> gigabyte<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.390> 64<00:00:22.140> gigabyte<00:00:23.100> memory<00:00:23.279> cards

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte memory cards

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.540 
32 gigabyte or 64 gigabyte memory cards
if<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.449> why<00:00:25.070> that's<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.490> question

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
if so why that's a really good question

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
if so why that's a really good question
i<00:00:27.150> think<00:00:27.510> there<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.320> answers<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.890> yes

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
i think there is two answers that yes

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
i think there is two answers that yes
and<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.760> really<00:00:29.910> depends<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and no and it really depends on the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170 
and no and it really depends on the
shooter<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> what<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.980> film<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:33.149> example

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
shooter and what you film I for example

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.470 
shooter and what you film I for example
do<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.079> film<00:00:34.469> very<00:00:35.010> long<00:00:35.340> form<00:00:35.760> events<00:00:36.270> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
do not film very long form events so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.110 
do not film very long form events so
what<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> usually<00:00:36.989> do<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.829> more<00:00:38.070> b-roll<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
what I usually do is it's more b-roll a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
what I usually do is it's more b-roll a
couple<00:00:39.809> interviews<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
couple interviews here and there and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.779 
couple interviews here and there and
nothing<00:00:41.670> over<00:00:42.300> maybe<00:00:42.719> 10<00:00:43.170> or<00:00:43.200> 11<00:00:43.800> minutes<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.760> I

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
nothing over maybe 10 or 11 minutes so I

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.330 
nothing over maybe 10 or 11 minutes so I
really<00:00:45.270> don't<00:00:45.450> need<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.469> large<00:00:46.559> card

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
really don't need a very large card

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.440 
really don't need a very large card
because<00:00:47.700> I'm<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.300> shooting

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
because I'm not going to be shooting

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750 
because I'm not going to be shooting
continuously<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> long<00:00:50.250> period<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.700> time

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
continuously for a long period of time

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
continuously for a long period of time
but<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> still<00:00:51.629> would<00:00:51.840> recommend<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.559> try

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
but I still would recommend that you try

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
but I still would recommend that you try
to<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:53.070> 16<00:00:53.520> gigabyte<00:00:53.910> cards<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> here's<00:00:54.629> why

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
to do 16 gigabyte cards and here's why

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.950 
to do 16 gigabyte cards and here's why
if<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> 32<00:00:56.730> gigabyte<00:00:57.030> card<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
if you have a 32 gigabyte card and you

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
if you have a 32 gigabyte card and you
feel<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> puppy<00:00:58.649> all<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.039> up<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.340> can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
feel that puppy all the way up that can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.330 
feel that puppy all the way up that can
easily<00:00:59.789> take<00:01:00.270> maybe<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.690> day<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.199> footage<00:01:01.590> for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
easily take maybe a day of footage for

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450 
easily take maybe a day of footage for
people<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.760> me<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.500> lose<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> data<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
people like me and you lose the data on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
people like me and you lose the data on
that<00:01:05.610> card<00:01:05.850> you've<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.390> lost<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.869> entire

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
that card you've just lost an entire

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.859 
that card you've just lost an entire
days<00:01:07.770> worth<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.340> footage<00:01:08.610> whereas<00:01:09.570> if<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
days worth of footage whereas if you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.109 
days worth of footage whereas if you
film<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.470> 16<00:01:11.070> gigabyte<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.640> even<00:01:11.880> eight

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
film with 16 gigabyte or even eight

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.660 
film with 16 gigabyte or even eight
gigabyte<00:01:12.570> cards<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.439> forces<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> swap

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
gigabyte cards that forces you to swap

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
gigabyte cards that forces you to swap
out<00:01:14.909> cards<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.540> even<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> card<00:01:16.500> go

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
out cards so even if you have a card go

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
out cards so even if you have a card go
bad<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.520> still<00:01:17.820> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> multiple

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
bad you're still going to have multiple

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.060 
bad you're still going to have multiple
cards<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.049> footage<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
cards of footage and you're not going to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399 
cards of footage and you're not going to
lose<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> giant<00:01:21.060> amount<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> data<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.259> that's

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
lose a giant amount of data so that's

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
lose a giant amount of data so that's
why<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> haven't<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.250> gotten<00:01:23.490> into<00:01:23.670> using

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
why I haven't really gotten into using

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
why I haven't really gotten into using
larger<00:01:24.810> cards<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.580> feeling

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
larger cards now if you're feeling

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.149 
larger cards now if you're feeling
filming<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> camera<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.290> 5d<00:01:28.590> mark<00:01:28.799> 3

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
filming on a camera like the 5d mark 3

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
filming on a camera like the 5d mark 3
and<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.909> multiple<00:01:30.180> cards<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> you're

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and you have multiple cards and you're

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
and you have multiple cards and you're
recording<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.799> both<00:01:31.979> cards<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.360> are

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
recording to both cards or you are

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.649 
recording to both cards or you are
recording<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.680> HD<00:01:35.070> eight<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.729> recorder

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
recording to an HD eight my recorder

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.300 
recording to an HD eight my recorder
obviously<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:37.979> much<00:01:38.159> an

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
obviously that's going to be as much an

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
obviously that's going to be as much an
issue<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.509> something<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.140> about

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
issue but it is something to think about

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
issue but it is something to think about
so<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.729> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.030> those<00:01:42.240> huge

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
so if you are going to do those huge

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.630 
so if you are going to do those huge
cards<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.290> would<00:01:43.590> recommend<00:01:43.770> trying<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.460> come

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
cards I would recommend trying to come

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.030 
cards I would recommend trying to come
up<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.970> backup<00:01:45.390> solution<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> set<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
up with a backup solution on set so that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.679
