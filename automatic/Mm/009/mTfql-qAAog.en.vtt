00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is a convertible car seat which means it

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.550

installing<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.239> easy

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
installing it it's really not that easy

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.220 
installing it it's really not that easy
to<00:00:51.930> install<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.920> since<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:54.000> change<00:00:54.449> out<00:00:54.719> from

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
one car to the other it gets to be a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
one car to the other it gets to be a
pain<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> latch<00:00:59.039> system

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.440 
the convertible and I liked the dark
look<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.740> it'll<00:02:09.920> hide<00:02:10.250> any<00:02:10.610> dirt<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450

we are probably going to have to go and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.770 
we are probably going to have to go and
buy<00:02:28.250> another<00:02:28.490> one<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.000> even<00:02:29.180> though<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.540> was

Target<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:33.530> wasn't<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.100> good<00:02:34.280> buy<00:02:34.489> for<00:02:34.520> us

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.510 
Target it wasn't a good buy for us
because<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:36.230> does<00:02:36.500> not<00:02:36.530> work<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.459> I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
because it just does not work out and I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.440 
because it just does not work out and I
would<00:02:37.580> not<00:02:38.090> recommend<00:02:38.150> this<00:02:38.750> car<00:02:39.140> seat
