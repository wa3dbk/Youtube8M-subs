worse as man can be and the thing is
that<00:01:02.730> people<00:01:03.000> will<00:01:03.570> enjoy<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.019> female

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that people will enjoy a female

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.020 
that people will enjoy a female
protagonist<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.610> won't<00:01:05.850> suit

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

the<00:01:06.180> GTA<00:01:06.540> game<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.350> something<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the GTA game well it's something that

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.370 
the GTA game well it's something that
Rockstar<00:01:08.250> Games<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:09.000> wanted<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.570> Troy

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
Rockstar Games probably wanted to Troy

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
Rockstar Games probably wanted to Troy
at<00:01:10.740> some<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.460> Rockstar<00:01:12.119> Games<00:01:12.240> did

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
at some point and Rockstar Games did

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990 
at some point and Rockstar Games did
confirm<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.960> at<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.619> point<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.700> GTA

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
confirm that at some point in the GTA

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
confirm that at some point in the GTA
series<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.600> he<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:15.900> introduce<00:01:16.320> female

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
series that he will introduce female

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.010 
series that he will introduce female
character<00:01:17.580> look<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> me<00:01:17.970> it<00:01:18.060> isn't<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.689> idea

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
character look to me it isn't about idea

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
character look to me it isn't about idea
at<00:01:19.200> all<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> don't<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.280> actually

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
at all I don't think it will actually

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
at all I don't think it will actually
happen<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.090> GTA<00:01:21.390> 6<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.170> think<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.830> will

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
happen for GTA 6 but I do think it will

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
happen for GTA 6 but I do think it will
actually<00:01:23.159> happen<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.939> future<00:01:24.060> GPM<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
actually happen in the future GPM it's a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
actually happen in the future GPM it's a
very<00:01:25.350> interesting<00:01:25.560> topic<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.580> talked

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
very interesting topic to be talked

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.179 
very interesting topic to be talked
about<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:28.130> introducing<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
about because obviously introducing a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
about because obviously introducing a
female<00:01:29.579> character<00:01:30.329> into<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> GTA<00:01:31.200> game<00:01:31.290> could

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
female character into a GTA game could

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.319 
female character into a GTA game could
completely<00:01:32.009> change<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.610> whole<00:01:32.729> series<00:01:32.970> no

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
completely change the whole series no

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.700 
completely change the whole series no
it's<00:01:33.509> not<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.720> say<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.290> won't<00:01:34.500> happen

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's not to say that this won't happen

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's not to say that this won't happen
of<00:01:35.040> course<00:01:35.310> Rockstar<00:01:35.729> Games<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of course Rockstar Games would like to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
of course Rockstar Games would like to
do<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.979> could<00:01:38.189> actually

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
do this or the thing that could actually

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.060 
do this or the thing that could actually
my<00:01:39.000> prevent<00:01:39.720> them<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:39.960> doing<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
my prevent them from doing it is that it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.649 
my prevent them from doing it is that it
could<00:01:41.220> actually<00:01:41.250> lose<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.880> lot<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.150> interest

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
could actually lose a lot of interest

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.050 
could actually lose a lot of interest
for<00:01:42.990> order<00:01:43.259> GTA<00:01:43.649> fans<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.759> could<00:01:45.030> be

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
for order GTA fans so there could be

as a male character in the GTA series it

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.679 
as a male character in the GTA series it
would<00:02:13.980> be<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.159> little<00:02:14.370> bit<00:02:14.640> interesting<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689
