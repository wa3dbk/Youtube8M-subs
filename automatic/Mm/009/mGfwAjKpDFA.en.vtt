00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.040
 or friends now turn these two 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.010
 walkers modes that arrive in this new 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.809
 dirty money dlc part 2 and well then 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.940
 we are talking about what you see in 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.679
 screen that is the flirtatious and also 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.500
 let's put the Chinese baby the two 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.880
 vehicles are moix call cars there is a 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.920
 small conclusion because this coke 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.140
 Many wish classic sports but not 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.670
 is inside the moscos cars you have to 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.950
 clarify that and then we will face 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.660
 in this track where we are going to measure the 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.520
 acceleration and top speed against 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.219
 three vehicles that we already have 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.230
 present in gta 5 is a vehicle that 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.149
 has a good top speed like it is 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.339
 The dominator is another vehicle that has 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.800
 a brutal acceleration like the blade 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.600
 and it's another vehicle that is the Doge is a 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.159
 vehicle also very balanced and therefore 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 let's see how the performance is 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.449
 here we have the dominator boxes 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.850
 play up to the doge and chinese down to the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.679
 let's start with this let's see 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.999
 the first acceleration that is let's say 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.729
 that a very initial stage 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.409
 here we have stop the account when the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.969
 Cocker arrives at this checkpoint and 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.889
 we see that the only one who has passed this 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.540
 control point is the blade in second 

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:06.320
 place we have something that he wants 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.630
 say that it has a good acceleration 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.400
 an acceptable acceleration and well let's 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.840
 advance by this we have the Chinese in a 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.850
 very small box nothing more for not 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.490
 do it less but let's see who 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.280
 comes in this second point where are we going 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.650
 make reference here say 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.660
 who came in first good here we see that 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.700
 the blade has already passed, however, we are in 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.890
 a tie with him dominator and the flirtatious 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.190
 the doge has not arrived and the Chinese then 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.990
 is in the tunnel still the sweet is a 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.369
 it's a collection car go to this car 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.619
 we are not going to ask him to have a good 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.759
 sports performance and because we 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.180
 advancing with this competition 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.090
 clearly we already see that the dominator 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.490
 is recovering ground and then we are going to 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.100
 see in the following box here for 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.110
 ok here first goes the dominator 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.700
 secondly here he already gave the 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
 back the flirtatious has already turned the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.300
 coque such plate already arrived in second 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.789
 place in third we have to play and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 then we have the duke and let's say 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.380
 that this was already placed in a race of 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.520
 two dominator vehicles and coquette because 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.280
 you have to remember that the vehicle that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.979
 it reaches then they say that they win for 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.780
 chemical what reaches then also 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.890
 reached the play of the coke and then 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.080
 let's say he knocked him down 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.270
 that position is in second place this 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.819
 because we're going to see the rest of the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.270
 common competence how it presents itself and 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.280
 Well let's see here and came first 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.520
 the dominator is Texans after the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.920
 pocket is coming after the doge and the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.410
 blade is lagging far behind 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.230
 blade is suffering let's say that 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.910
 has all the efforts aimed at 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.430
 be a vehicle of total acceleration 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.920
 but loses completely in top speed 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.440
 the blade the dux is recovering 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.480
 because let's say it's a car more 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.430
 balanced and well let's see who 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.860
 is already seeing this play where already 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.080
 is on track in dominator is 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.640
 entering the curve the next one that 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.340
 is still going to be the flirtatious here we have 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.010
 to the coquettish then we have the doge and for 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.100
 last one is going to enter the play to this curve 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.680
 where is a big straight ascending 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.269
 a big line that demands power in 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 this straight I'm going to comment further 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.330
 as an anecdote the Chinese almost almost makes a 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.489
 change back because it cost him 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.870
 Pretty hard work getting on his life 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.330
 let's say a vehicle 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.549
 that we are not going to ask for much in this 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.379
 kind of competition and well let's see 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.810
 let's perform as the domain goes and 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.190
 thor here come some bridges that are 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.989
 let's say that they are going to serve us as 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.299
 reference this bridge will serve us 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.819
 as a reference we are entering with the 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.530
 domain to this bridge let's see who 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.819
 is approaching when catching the coke 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.549
 which is the one that is approaching also 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.890
 the bridge and is entering the bridge 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.989
 Now follow the doge is entering the doge 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.480
 to the bridge and then the plate will come 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.910
 the play is entering last place at 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
 bridge of these four major the 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.650
 Chinese the Chinese is still coming down very 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.980
 back the Chinese let's not say you're 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.049
 remaining he is coming another career and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.840
 Well, here we are saying that going down 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.670
 towards what is the ultimate goal and is 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.549
 coming first domain 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.409
 dominator has finished the race continue 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.760
 in the race the other vehicles are going to 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.379
 see who finishes it in second place 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.690
 it looks like it's going to be something that the 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.799
 coke is shaping up and the finished coke 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.709
 let's see who gets in third place 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.600
 in third place the doge arrives and in fourth 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.760
 place let's see who is arriving 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.750
 well here in this clearly is the 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.990
 lawsuit 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.910
 they have come in fourth place and daddy 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.980
 Chinese, he is still in competition 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
 he is running another race 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.780
 totally and well good friends 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.760
 conclusions the coke is a good car in 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.830
 what acceleration is defending or 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.480
 be the drives to compete against the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.820
 beast of acceleration that is the play 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.670
 he defended himself has boards is a taste 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.490
 much and also in the top speed then 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.400
 also it defended a say in 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.960
 measure against the terminator paper does not 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.630
 managed to win because the truth also the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.260
 minute beating, well, let's say many 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.030
 years forward in technology but 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.770
 because he also stood up to him, it 's a pleasure 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.080
 that does not make much difference to them 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.820
 bav dominator but he has won 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.520
 other vehicles for example the doge by 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.160
 example also won him what is the 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.590
 blake and then it's practically a car 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.230
 balanced I liked it and well let's see 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.610
 how these new cars behave in 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.410
 the driving test that I'll already be 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.360
 doing for tomorrow I hope and 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.180
 these put them tomorrow or a few days 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.010
 later not friends if you 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.180
 they left with that there is more rain is 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.979
 got this car 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.259
 or better well submitted to this other car 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.840
 not all cars have the same care 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.820
 let's run on this track to know 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.919
 your top speed and to know your 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.860
 acceleration do not miss it is going to be the 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.820
 next series that I'm going to do with these 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.820
 goodbye cars 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.310
 all right 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.229
 ah
