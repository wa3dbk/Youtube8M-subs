00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:53.350
 buy birthday gift 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:27.229
 34 boys ok so well or are they 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:29.780
 also the opinion that this is not you 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.469
 first movie you did this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.869
 angel heart 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:37.119
 he has made a whole latte of film 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.119
 And he is considered the new in Hollywood 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.539
 so he thinks is more of a star in 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.350
 europe less in hollywood less in 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.029
 the states 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.009
 and this is perhaps to be at 

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:21.379
 his difficulties has with the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:24.580
 People in Hollywood said everyone wants 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.629
 especially kiss his darling 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.069
 So his ass so that's clear 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.069
 Therefore, there is very little respect 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.090
 the people in hollywood and out of this 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.579
 reason for that I probably in 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.319
 Europe also better so now I want 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:43.299
 but not only I have the possibility 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.299
 to question who has a question 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:33.859
 Do you already have some as someone who 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.790
 really works great but has to 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.079
 Me too a bit on him 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 Hiring is difficult to believe 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.450
 could read that in several interviews 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.400
 that with robert de niro already his 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.890
 has difficulty here is already 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.900
 wrested 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.060
 which film partner is more interesting in 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.849
 the four weeks or now charlotte 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.680
 rampling in the new movie how should i 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.930
 the question which filed prefer 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.930
 or how that is that is already difficult 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.770
 where is that she was that what she was 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.200
 So expect a start of the new movie 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.380

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.380
