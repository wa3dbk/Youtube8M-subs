about two years ago I started designing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.970 
about two years ago I started designing

more charity events and people would see

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.950 
more charity events and people would see
me<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.710> parties<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.340> noticed<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.149> other<00:00:42.510> women

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.140 
me at parties I noticed that other women
were<00:00:43.110> coming<00:00:43.470> up<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.769> me<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.040> asking<00:00:44.790> me<00:00:44.940> where

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150
