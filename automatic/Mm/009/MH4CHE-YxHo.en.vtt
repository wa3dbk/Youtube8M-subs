 magnetic holder stripping or how it 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.100
 on drill 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:20.640
 What can I tell you this set as 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.070
 practice has shown very good 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 what is always on hand in your car 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.649
 like or you immediately took it on 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 work or just even at home just 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.790
 an indispensable thing to talk about 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.490
 quality bits and quite good drills 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.469
 metal could be better of course 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 feather drills were very helpful to good 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.630
 thing cool thing here it is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.340
 stripping danfoss glasses do somewhere in 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 metal 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.450
 unkillable to be honest very much by her 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.850
 I redid the restraints I am so 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:04.020
 principle never used as it were 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 as for me a meaningless thing but someone 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.519
 maybe it would have to be special 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.600
 tell on and nothing in this set 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.950
 he is worth his money 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.680
 it's worth having everything in it 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.470
 fine boxing 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.310
 everything is at hand yes I forgot the most important thing 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 to tell 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:33.450
 done it in china here they are already open 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.640
 wrote you know i'm pleased and drills 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.290
 on concrete let 's run again I 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.080
 something 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.990
 shield crumpled all sides of concrete 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.530
 enjoyed mediocre quality by 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.270
 metal could be better 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.380
 honestly say Soviet drills are old 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.620
 stocks work much better 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:59.700
 I tried these too peretachivat but you 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.140
 know how she would have no result 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:07.010
 I gave the tree very much 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.340
 non-aggressive drills awesome vsky 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.070
 feathers I have already said the working version here 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.310
 which is important that I did not like 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:21.860
 maximum size 12 would be in the set 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.890
 13 under the nut to the nozzle 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.050
 prices would this set have not been to bits 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.080
 normal quality load in principle 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.120
 holds don't know how about in prof 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.330
 use like this set 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.520
 used as I used 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.570
 previous 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:46.140
 also made of the same steel 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:51.780
 Now let's focus on 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:56.090
 we see only steel s2 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:59.569
 page 2 we have a bit 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.230
 that's all about mitapes 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.500
 sets worth the money 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.519
 the only negative is that there is no under the head 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.280
 on 13 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.769
 and in principle everything is fine for everyone 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.900
 Thank you for watching 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.989
 Have a nice day until we meet again 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.989
