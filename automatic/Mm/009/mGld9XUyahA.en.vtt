00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.720 
travel plans in the near future and as
you<00:00:36.440> guys<00:00:36.559> know<00:00:36.620> I<00:00:36.800> recently<00:00:37.220> went<00:00:37.550> on<00:00:37.699> a

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
you guys know I recently went on a

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.040 
you guys know I recently went on a
couple<00:00:38.030> airplanes<00:00:38.420> did<00:00:38.719> some<00:00:38.899> traveling

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
couple airplanes did some traveling

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.900 
couple airplanes did some traveling
myself<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:39.980> I<00:00:40.010> figured<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.399> would<00:00:40.579> just<00:00:40.610> go

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
myself and so I figured I would just go

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.549 
myself and so I figured I would just go
ahead<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.300> share<00:00:41.480> with<00:00:41.570> you<00:00:41.719> all<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.350> things

it doesn't take up room in my suitcase

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.230 
it doesn't take up room in my suitcase
