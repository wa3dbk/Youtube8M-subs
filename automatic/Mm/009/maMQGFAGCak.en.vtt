00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:06.740
This tutorial will cover how to “Factory
Reset” your Samsung Galaxy S3, and other

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:14.059
similar Android phones running Jelly Bean
version 4.3, especially those made by Samsung.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.090
A factory reset will delete all personal information
on the phone and restore it to the state it

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.730
was when it came from the factory.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.040
A “Factory Reset” will not delete information
stored on the SD card, only the internal storage

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.630
on the phone.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.580
It doesn’t hurt to remove the SD card if
you are concerned.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.320
There are two major ways to reset the phone
to factory settings.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.600
We will cover both the software reset, and
a hardware reset for those with problems with

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.800
the touch screen.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.910
Resetting the phone back to defaults will
not remove any updates that have been installed

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.370
since the device was purchased to the Android
operating system.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.059
You will still be on the latest version of
Android and will not have to update versions.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.340
Make sure that you backup your device before
you “Factory Reset” the device.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.079
All your personal information will be removed
so make sure you backup anything you want

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:07.630
to save such as messages, contacts, and settings.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.260
Software Reset.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.370
The software reset is the easiest way to rest
the phone to factory default settings.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.780
It is easiest to always use this method unless
the touch screen on your phone is broken.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.480
If that is the case move onto the “Hardware
Reset” option later in this tutorial.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.070
To start with we need to open the “Settings”
menu.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.511
Let’s drag our finger down from the top
of the screen to open the “Quick Settings

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:31.080
and Notification menu”.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.930
Now touch the “Settings” button in the
top right of the screen.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.360
Scroll down on the screen until you find the
“Personal” section.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.390
Touch to select “Backup and reset”.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.000
When the “Backup and reset” screen opens
we will see a “Backup and Restore” section.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.640
It is a good idea to have “Backup my data”
and “Automatic restore” selected.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.280
These options will backup some application
data, Wi-Fi passwords and other settings to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.440
Google’s servers.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.280
At the bottom of the screen under the “Personal
data” section we will see the “Factory

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.200
data reset” button.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.380
As long as everything you want to keep is
backed up, touch the “Factory data reset”

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.840
button.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
The next screen explains how proceeding will
delete all data from the device memory, including

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.750
the google, and other accounts, system and
application data, downloaded apps, music,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.230
photos, videos, and other user settings.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.200
The decryption keys for files on the SD card
will also be deleted.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.980
If you have an SD card in your phone with
encryption turned on, and you proceed with

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:57.910
the factory reset, you will no longer be able
to access the data.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.790
If you want to proceed touch the “Reset
device” button.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.790
The “Reset?”

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.130
screen reminds you that you are deleting all
information from the phone and that you will

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.130
not be able to recover it.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.130
Press the “Delete all” button.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.280
The phone will shut down, restart, delete
all data from the device, and then restart

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:44.319
once again..

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.819
Hardware Reset.

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.230
In case the touch screen is broken or for
any other reason that you need to reset the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.209
device, you can do this using the hardware
buttons on the phone.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.130
Again make sure you have a backup before you
reset the phone.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.790
To reset the device we need to power it off,
boot to the “System Recovery Screen”,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.860
and then delete the data.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.290
For the Samsung Galaxy S3 and other Samsung
phones the button combination to open the

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.930
“System Recovery Screen” is the Volume
Up + Home + Power buttons.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.280
Other android phones can be reset in a similar
fashion but may use a different key combination.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.251
For the HTC One and other similar devices
the key combination is Volume Down + Power

00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:25.900
buttons.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.690
The Motorola Razr and other similar devices
the key combination is the Volume Up + Power

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.970
buttons.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.470
To start with we need to turn the phone off.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.340
If your touch screen is broken you can remove
the battery and replace it to turn it off.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.340
If the touch screen is still working you can
follow these steps.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:52.830
Hold the power button on the phone down until
you see the “Phone options” screen.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.960
Touch the “Power Off” button.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.910
Touch “OK” to confirm.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:09.100
When the blue light in the top left of the
phone turns off the phone is off.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.900
We will now boot the phone into “Android
system recovery”.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.156
Hold down the Volume up and “Home” buttons
at the same time.

00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.510
Now press and hold the “Power” button.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.180
The phone will start to turn on, and as soon
as you feel the phone vibrate, release only

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.169
the “Power” button.

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.660
As soon as the Samsung logo appears you can
release all the buttons.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.470
We will see “Recovery booting…” in the
top left of the phone.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.990
We use the Volume up and Volume down buttons
to move up and down in the menu.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:54.940
Press the Volume down button until we have
“wipe data/factory reset” selected.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.050
Press the Power button to select it.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:07.840
Press the Volume down button until you highlight
“Yes -- delete all user data”.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:16.150
Press the Power button to select it.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:30.169
We will see the Android character with “Erasing…”
underneath it.

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:34.270
At the bottom it will show “Wiping Data…”,
“Formatting /data”, and “Formatting

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.270
/cache”.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.310
If all went well you should see “Data wipe
complete”.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.910
With “reboot system now” highlighted press
the Power button to select it and reboot the

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.810
phone.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.990
The phone will take some time to reboot.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:07:11.840
When it does you will 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.200
need to perform the initial setup of the device.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.350
