00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
2010 2.5 liter mazda3 the muffler is in
this<00:00:14.130> area<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.299> factory<00:00:15.719> vehicle

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this area here on the factory vehicle

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.019 
this area here on the factory vehicle
and<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> inlet<00:00:17.490> takes<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.850> really

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
and because the inlet takes a really

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.599 
and because the inlet takes a really
sharp<00:00:18.570> turn<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.230> comes<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.859> from<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.220> area

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
sharp turn and comes in from this area

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.480 
sharp turn and comes in from this area
and<00:00:20.820> our<00:00:21.270> exhaust<00:00:21.660> has<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> nice<00:00:22.230> split<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and our exhaust has a nice split in the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.640 
and our exhaust has a nice split in the
dual<00:00:23.670> exhaust<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.689> comes<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.140> back<00:00:25.439> from

dual exhaust that comes in back from
this<00:00:25.800> area<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.550> need<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> clearance<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:28.080> edge

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
this area we need to clearance this edge

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.820 
this area we need to clearance this edge
right<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.900> heat<00:00:31.080> shield<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
right here the of the heat shield the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.530 
right here the of the heat shield the
alternative<00:00:32.219> like<00:00:32.700> we've<00:00:32.910> done<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
alternative like we've done on this one

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.150 
alternative like we've done on this one
is<00:00:33.719> just<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> quarter<00:00:34.710> inch<00:00:34.829> drill<00:00:35.100> bit

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
is just to take a quarter inch drill bit

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.370 
is just to take a quarter inch drill bit
and<00:00:35.430> drill<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.820> each<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> four<00:00:36.809> rivets<00:00:37.050> in

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
and drill out each of the four rivets in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.160 
and drill out each of the four rivets in
these<00:00:37.710> locations<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.090> will<00:00:39.930> allow<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
these locations and that will allow you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.799 
these locations and that will allow you
just<00:00:40.500> remove<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.800> heat<00:00:41.100> shield<00:00:41.129> altogether

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
just remove the heat shield altogether

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.299 
just remove the heat shield altogether
because<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.079> muffler<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.710> close<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
because the muffler is so close to the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
because the muffler is so close to the
bottom<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.149> trunk<00:00:45.390> floor<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
bottom of the the trunk floor it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
bottom of the the trunk floor it
requires<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.680> heat<00:00:46.860> shield<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.430> our

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
requires this heat shield but our

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.979 
requires this heat shield but our
exhaust<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> lot<00:00:48.390> further<00:00:48.570> away<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
exhaust is a lot further away and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
exhaust is a lot further away and
doesn't<00:00:49.289> concentrate<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.070> heat<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
doesn't concentrate the heat there so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.889 
doesn't concentrate the heat there so
you<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.899> don't<00:00:52.079> need<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> start

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
you don't we don't need it so to start

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.000 
you don't we don't need it so to start
with<00:00:55.110> we're<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:57.649> this<00:00:58.649> one's<00:00:58.859> already

and we just taken we cut a straight of a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.500 
and we just taken we cut a straight of a
line<00:02:09.050> as<00:02:09.350> possible<00:02:09.560> there<00:02:10.039> right<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.270> where

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
line as possible there right up to where

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.030 
line as possible there right up to where
the<00:02:11.540> radius<00:02:12.050> begins<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:15.319> gets<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.770> piece

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the radius begins that gets this piece

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.910 
the radius begins that gets this piece
clear<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.270> can<00:02:17.360> see<00:02:17.510> very<00:02:17.900> very<00:02:18.410> premature

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
clear as you can see very very premature

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.449 
clear as you can see very very premature
and<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.420> take<00:02:20.600> our<00:02:21.310> right<00:02:22.310> handed<00:02:23.410> snips

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
and then we take our right handed snips

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.400 
and then we take our right handed snips
we<00:02:25.459> start<00:02:25.760> from<00:02:25.940> this<00:02:26.090> edge<00:02:26.300> here<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:32.350> try<00:02:33.350> and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
we start from this edge here and try and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.259 
we start from this edge here and try and
get<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.950> get<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:34.850> as<00:02:35.090> much<00:02:35.239> as

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
get but get up on that as much as

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.870 
get but get up on that as much as
possible<00:02:38.709> we<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:39.920> get<00:02:40.070> cutting<00:02:40.489> around<00:02:40.610> that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
possible we just get cutting around that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.070 
possible we just get cutting around that
corner<00:02:41.120> lifting<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:41.959> we<00:02:42.140> go<00:02:43.750> now<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.810> will<00:02:45.050> see

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
corner lifting as we go now you will see

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.140 
corner lifting as we go now you will see
that<00:02:45.410> what<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.680> does<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.160> actually<00:02:46.310> makes<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
that what it does is it actually makes a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.340 
that what it does is it actually makes a
little<00:02:47.330> bit<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.600> ruffle<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.290> edge<00:02:50.350> see

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
little bit of ruffle on that edge see

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.870 
little bit of ruffle on that edge see
there's<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.680> little<00:02:51.709> bit<00:02:52.040> standing<00:02:52.580> up<00:02:52.700> there

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
there's a little bit standing up there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.120 
there's a little bit standing up there
that's<00:02:53.540> where<00:02:53.780> our<00:02:53.810> pliers<00:02:54.110> come<00:02:54.470> in<00:02:54.590> handy<00:02:54.860> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
that's where our pliers come in handy I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.800 
that's where our pliers come in handy I
just<00:02:55.430> come<00:02:55.580> along<00:02:55.790> here<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.269> can<00:02:56.420> use<00:02:56.690> the

here you just come along just radius

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
here you just come along just radius
that<00:03:26.269> off<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.810> same<00:03:27.049> way<00:03:27.079> take<00:03:27.980> little<00:03:28.250> bites
