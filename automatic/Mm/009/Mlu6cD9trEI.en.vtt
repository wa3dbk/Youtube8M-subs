 here kotex do not take me seriously what you 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.210

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:37.010

 what are we going kids I'm here with 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.980
 this new gameplay as you can see 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.050
 I'm on the fibula map with the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.500
 remington and you will say 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 if you're with the bots playing and if the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.089
 true that he explained the bots before 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 nothing to clarify it is worth playing but look 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.760
 look look at manco aires uncle but look 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.229
 as if you're not in the recruit if the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.159
 it's true that he's in the recruiting mode 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.110
 forgot to change it 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.060
 I wanted to put it in tanning and burst 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 everyone did not really want to put a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.770
 professional and stay in negative good 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.530
 do what we help guys like you see 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.479
 here I am with the remington the weapon that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 I do not usually use and good since I'm 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 Here, I decided to try it a little and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 because on this map and because surely 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.970
 We would be standing guard to prove 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.130
 is a have you gone away loved much more 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.440
 small but how well can you be 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.659
 seeing in the title is the map the map 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.380
 that at least never touches me and the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.930
 map that I always hate 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.270
 I will explain the following reasons 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.340
 4 is a subject for me, yes, I like it because 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.950
 It is very big 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.590
 good to me, it does not matter to me 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.689
 map so I do not like it because it's 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.600
 very big for me and part of the 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.490
 masons at the bottom of the map not in 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.759
 this zone but in the other one in which there is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.350
 trees rocks grass no smoking grass 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.590
 not marijuana but the other kind of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.149
 grass that the truth fucks on this map and 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.189
 whatsapp seasonal miriam 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.530
 They are already sending me good things 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.090
 end the ok baby shaq and how do I go back to 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.680
 mark a little but well that does not 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.200
 It has nothing to do with what I want 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.849
 tell what we were going on map of 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.130
 drones and the map that I do not like and the 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.239
 map that I'm starting to hate from 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.780
 that the game came out from the beginning 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:27.590
 of the game if you look at that one- handed 12 and zach has 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.440
 dead the map that sincerely gave it to 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 death for that simple reason why 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.120
 for the campers that there are not for the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.420
 campers that are at the bottom whenever I 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.520
 I put in this game 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.410
 on this map 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.150
 you can always take a ride but the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.920
 way in which campear are sometimes touched 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.440
 much the eggs if you send the game to 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.810
 take by ass many times and I am 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.270
 some of them so I never vote 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.260
 this map for that simple reason that 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.560
 I meet campers and the truth 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.960
 bloodthirsty shot but so is 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.210
 taking out a recruit and that has no merit 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.250
 and on top they kill you and of great value by itself 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.960
 they kill me four times what happens but I do not 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.880
 happens nothing takes with dead people in cattle 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.340
 good to what he told me to roll up 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.610
 like the poppies 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.340
 it's the simple truth guys this map 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.180
 of the times that I have to play what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.180
 well 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.640
 the few times he touches me, I think 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.370
 which is why he also started it 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.340
 hate because I do not have to play this map 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.099
 that's why I hate it sincerely 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.379
 the few times I play it always 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:38.569
 I meet a camper in this area of 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.540
 here especially in the area I will 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.860
 climb up now as you see here in this area 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.569
 always put the campers with the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.159
 sniper eye that I take out the rpg and I say 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:50.989
 come your room a 50 in that area 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.269
 always put the campers always 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.030
 they put the ones that go with the sniper and 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:00.540
 they are always dedicated to fuck you the game 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.849
 and fuck your streaks your gameplay 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.969
 and the truth is that if you want to spend 70 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.400
 turkeys in doing this well congratulations for 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.319
 You I dedicate myself I encourage you to 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.019
 I said it is better to the parchÃ­s that you are going to have 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.750
 much more future than in the call of duty 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.209
 honestly but good here comes another 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.970
 epic moment of the grape but one 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.130
 granada I wait for me to return it and I 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.130
 kill as you could see but good 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.120
 that's not what matters what you dream 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.880
 buy was that 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.460
 maps that I hate very much 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.710
 but good what is there is no 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.990
 sincerely what are we going to do 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.240
 rarely do you touch it I begin to hate 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.500
 good death I do not think I start to hate is 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.390
 that I hate it basically 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.950
 and if you think the same about 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.440
 this map or if you think the same about 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.630
 the campers then leave it down in the 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.910
 comments on what you think about this 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.560
 map and 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.320
 and leave me the comments 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.240
 and well I wanted to cut a piece of 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.250
 gameplay is worth it because if we were going to do 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.930
 very heavy and I run out of saliva 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.360
 comment and that can not be worth here 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.389
 I shot the dragon faga and it destroyed me 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.630
 because I'm not interested and nothing I think the 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.560
 I ended her with a 25 4 I think 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.480
 nothing because what is said guys is the map that 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.760
 I started playing the map that I started 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.800
 hate the map that I hate and the map that 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.599
 It never touches me and that's why hatred 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.060
 and nothing much more than commenting on the 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:33.409
 gameplay left over I think it's a 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.629
 minute or so and during these days 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.940
 I will bring you some other gameplay is worth or 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.970
 some live another there is eye there that almost 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.699
 I kill myself epic grenade moment and like 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.750
 I ended up subscribing to xbox and what 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.000
 safer than until next month not 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.680
 can I take the subscription can 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.409
 hold some games and against 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.889
 bots but calm that I will change it 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.780
 to professional or seasoned by recruiting 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.900
 As you can see, it's a bit disgusting 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.129
 and pretty fucking playing it but good is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.729
 what is there fits well and if not 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.099
 as well 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:08.210
 and the usual guy this rule and 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:09.979
 favorites to take for ass and little more 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.919
 to comment the boys see you in the 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.790
 next and you're going to see the final low of a 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:19.240
 one-bot bank 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.520
 I hope you like it I laughed at him and 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.280
 nothing see you in the next and a greeting 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.400
 I want all of you to use it more than 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.400
 my life 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.009
 they played
