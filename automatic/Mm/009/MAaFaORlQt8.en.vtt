00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.129 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but
what<00:00:07.410> we've<00:00:07.649> what<00:00:08.220> we've<00:00:08.250> done<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.870> we've

what we've what we've done and and we've

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.720 
what we've what we've done and and we've
made<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.320> habit<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.519> book

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
made a habit of doing this if that book

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.320 
made a habit of doing this if that book
is<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.410> decided<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.030> over

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.050 

the<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.199> MacBook<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> quite<00:00:20.340> remarkable

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the new MacBook is a quite remarkable

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290 
the new MacBook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.480> achievement<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:23.789> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.830 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.220> complete<00:00:26.669> revolution<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:40.420 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.439> way<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.769> notebooks<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.250> made

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.950 

when<00:00:41.430> traditionally<00:00:42.030> notebooks<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.750> made

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
when traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.060 
when traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.700> multiple<00:00:44.700> parts<00:00:45.530> but<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> problem<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.970> multiple<00:00:48.420> parts<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.470> add

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.030 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.460> weight<00:00:50.699> and<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.290> increase<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.400 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.760> failure<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.979 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.100> breakthrough<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:57.449> heard<00:00:57.720> with

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> MacBook<00:00:58.850> was<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.059> replace<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.720> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
with the MacBook was to replace all of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.280 
with the MacBook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.140> parts<00:01:01.650> with<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.790> part<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.510> at

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.550 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.470> part<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.890> called<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.250> unibody<00:01:06.560> we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.040> out<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.190> way<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.960> being<00:01:09.960> able<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
figured out a way of being able to make

before and the only way to make that one

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.529 
before and the only way to make that one
part<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.280> machine<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.700> from<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.119> single

piece of aluminium aluminium was the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.660 
piece of aluminium aluminium was the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
ideal choice for this product because it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609
