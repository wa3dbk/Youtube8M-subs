batteries those are all wired in series
so<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> output<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.719> 9<00:01:01.050> volts<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:02.250> put

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so that the output is 9 volts if you put

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
so that the output is 9 volts if you put

anything on the other hand your tongue
is<00:01:33.890> quite<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.130> conductor<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.729> comparison

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
is quite a good conductor in comparison

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.319 
is quite a good conductor in comparison
your<00:01:37.140> tongue<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> thin<00:01:38.189> mucousy<00:01:38.820> membrane

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
your tongue is a thin mucousy membrane

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.420 
your tongue is a thin mucousy membrane
the<00:01:39.630> saliva<00:01:39.960> decreases<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> resistance<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the saliva decreases the resistance to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
the saliva decreases the resistance to
about<00:01:41.640> 7<00:01:42.030> kilo<00:01:42.270> ohms<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.320> means<00:01:43.590> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
about 7 kilo ohms what that means is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.620 
about 7 kilo ohms what that means is
once<00:01:44.040> again<00:01:44.310> using<00:01:44.490> Ohm's<00:01:44.820> law<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.479> can

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
once again using Ohm's law we can

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
once again using Ohm's law we can
determine<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.079> there's<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> two

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
determine that there's about one to two

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
determine that there's about one to two
milliamps<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:48.149> current<00:01:48.210> flowing<00:01:48.960> through

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
milliamps of current flowing through

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
milliamps of current flowing through
your<00:01:49.500> tongue<00:01:49.710> when<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> attach<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
your tongue when you attach the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
your tongue when you attach the
terminals<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.329> tongue<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.560> enough

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
terminals to your tongue that is enough

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.710 
terminals to your tongue that is enough
to<00:01:53.250> feel<00:01:53.460> you'll<00:01:53.909> start<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> feel<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> mild

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
to feel you'll start to feel a mild

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
to feel you'll start to feel a mild
tingling<00:01:55.140> sensation<00:01:55.860> maybe<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
tingling sensation maybe a little bit of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670 
tingling sensation maybe a little bit of
pain<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.899> setup<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
pain so what I have setup here is a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
pain so what I have setup here is a
9-volt<00:01:59.219> battery<00:01:59.549> connected<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.270> multimeter

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
9-volt battery connected to a multimeter

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.209 
9-volt battery connected to a multimeter
that<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> amount<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
that way we can see the amount of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.429 
that way we can see the amount of
current<00:02:02.579> flowing<00:02:02.850> through<00:02:03.000> my<00:02:03.329> tongue<00:02:03.439> let's

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
current flowing through my tongue let's

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.400 
current flowing through my tongue let's
give<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.770> shot<00:02:04.799> ah<00:02:06.530> ah<00:02:07.530> ah<00:02:08.129> ah

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
give it a shot ah ah ah ah

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.820 
give it a shot ah ah ah ah
ah<00:02:10.440> oh<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.940> things<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.210> do<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.540> science<00:02:12.690> as<00:02:13.050> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
ah oh the things I do for science as you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
ah oh the things I do for science as you
can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.160> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> meter<00:02:14.520> we<00:02:14.940> read<00:02:15.090> about<00:02:15.210> 1<00:02:15.540> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
can see on the meter we read about 1 to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.510 
can see on the meter we read about 1 to
2<00:02:15.810> milliamps<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.440> current<00:02:16.500> which<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:16.980> exactly

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
2 milliamps of current which is exactly

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
2 milliamps of current which is exactly
what<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.880> predicted<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> good<00:02:19.020> way<00:02:19.140> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
what we predicted this is a good way to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.350 
what we predicted this is a good way to
test<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.800> see<00:02:19.980> if<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.190> 9-volt<00:02:20.640> battery<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.150> still

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
test to see if a 9-volt battery is still

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.750 
test to see if a 9-volt battery is still
alive<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.810> hasn't<00:02:22.350> died<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.740> you<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.430> also<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
alive and hasn't died on you it's also a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.130 
alive and hasn't died on you it's also a
good<00:02:23.910> way<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.120> feel<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.780> effects<00:02:25.020> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
good way to feel the effects of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.810 
good way to feel the effects of
electricity<00:02:25.500> flowing<00:02:25.830> through<00:02:26.040> your<00:02:26.310> body<00:02:26.550> if

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
electricity flowing through your body if

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.060 
electricity flowing through your body if
you<00:02:27.330> tried<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.810> at<00:02:27.930> home<00:02:28.080> please<00:02:28.710> do<00:02:28.950> be

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
you tried this at home please do be

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.190 
you tried this at home please do be
careful<00:02:29.250> electricity<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.360> dangerous<00:02:30.960> it

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
careful electricity can be dangerous it

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.580 
careful electricity can be dangerous it
can<00:02:31.740> hurt<00:02:31.920> burn<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.790> even<00:02:33.210> kill<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.630> tune<00:02:34.470> in

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can hurt burn and even kill you tune in

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.370 
can hurt burn and even kill you tune in
next<00:02:34.710> time<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:34.950> more<00:02:35.220> science<00:02:35.430> ahhh

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.820 

I<00:02:40.920> don't<00:02:41.910> like<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:44.930> man<00:02:45.930> still<00:02:46.500> have<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.740> use

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
I don't like it man still have to use

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.310 
I don't like it man still have to use
hair<00:02:47.070> gel
