00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
know play he plays with the lead almost

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
know play he plays with the lead almost
better<00:01:11.880> than<00:01:11.909> anybody<00:01:12.210> else<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
better than anybody else out there so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
better than anybody else out there so
that<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.950> tough<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.189> me<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.729> i<00:01:14.850> had<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> couple

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
that was tough for me and i had a couple

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.450 
that was tough for me and i had a couple
of<00:01:15.390> chances<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.780> come<00:01:16.049> back<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:17.159> him<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
of chances to come back and got him to a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.370 
of chances to come back and got him to a
couple<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> used<00:01:17.970> games<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.689> his<00:01:18.869> serve<00:01:19.110> but

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
couple of used games on his serve but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.260

probably<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> said<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.400> was<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> bit

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
probably like you said it was a bit

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.960 
probably like you said it was a bit
tentative<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:22.080> passive<00:01:22.350> at<00:01:22.710> times<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.340> then

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
tentative bit passive at times and then

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
tentative bit passive at times and then
in<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> second<00:01:24.689> set<00:01:24.810> i<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:25.020> able<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> turn<00:01:25.439> it

and then at for two things you know
momentum<00:01:32.369> shifted<00:01:32.729> him<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.630> favor<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
momentum shifted him to in my favor and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.679 
momentum shifted him to in my favor and
I<00:01:34.890> i<00:01:34.920> must<00:01:35.400> say<00:01:35.549> i<00:01:35.579> really<00:01:35.880> started<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.479> serve

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I i must say i really started to serve

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.450 
I i must say i really started to serve
clutch<00:01:36.990> when<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.290> needed<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
clutch when I needed to that's what it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
clutch when I needed to that's what it
was<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> case<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.450> third<00:01:39.630> set<00:01:39.930> he

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
was the case is one of the third set he

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.359 
was the case is one of the third set he
had<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.229> couple<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> break<00:01:40.740> points<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.130> get<00:01:41.250> back

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
had a couple of break points to get back

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.580 
had a couple of break points to get back
into<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> match<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.810> hit<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> edge

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
into the match and I hit just the edge

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
into the match and I hit just the edge
of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> line<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.610> sometimes<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
of the line and that's the sometimes the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.300 
of the line and that's the sometimes the
stuff<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> makes<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> difference<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.530> should

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
stuff that makes a difference and should

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.160 
stuff that makes a difference and should

match because it would have given me an

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.969 
match because it would have given me an
