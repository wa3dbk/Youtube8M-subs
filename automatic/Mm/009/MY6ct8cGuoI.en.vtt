that<00:03:33.070> is<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:34.180> is<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.720> point<00:03:35.440> five<00:03:35.680> amps<00:03:36.930> output

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
that is that is a point five amps output

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.080 
that is that is a point five amps output
is<00:03:38.320> 2<00:03:38.560> amp<00:03:38.860> actually<00:03:39.340> so<00:03:39.670> that's<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:39.940> pretty

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
is 2 amp actually so that's a pretty

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.080 
is 2 amp actually so that's a pretty
good<00:03:40.209> charger<00:03:40.810> I<00:03:40.840> would<00:03:41.050> say<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.230> tablet<00:03:41.739> light

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
this pinhole design is on the speakers

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.150 
this pinhole design is on the speakers
actually<00:04:10.360> only<00:04:10.690> in<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.930> middle<00:04:11.230> same<00:04:11.980> went

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
actually only in the middle same went

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880 
actually only in the middle same went
down<00:04:12.280> here<00:04:12.640> that's<00:04:12.850> kind<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.320> one<00:04:14.320> side<00:04:14.650> is

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
down here that's kind of one side is

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.440 
down here that's kind of one side is
like<00:04:15.130> not<00:04:15.340> really<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.700> speaker<00:04:16.120> and<00:04:16.239> on<00:04:16.299> this

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
like not really a speaker and on this

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.539 
like not really a speaker and on this
side<00:04:16.630> as<00:04:16.750> a<00:04:16.780> speaker<00:04:17.260> but<00:04:18.160> we're<00:04:18.250> gonna<00:04:18.340> go

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
side as a speaker but we're gonna go

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.539 
side as a speaker but we're gonna go
over<00:04:18.669> everything<00:04:19.030> in<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.269> full<00:04:19.510> review<00:04:19.660> guys

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
over everything in the full review guys

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.290 
over everything in the full review guys
so<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.640> can<00:04:21.789> see<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.000> nice<00:04:22.180> colorful<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:25.210> they

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
so you can see a nice colorful but they

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.140 
so you can see a nice colorful but they
get<00:04:25.450> powered<00:04:25.840> up

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
get powered up

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.249 
get powered up
quick<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:32.300> we<00:04:32.360> could<00:04:32.540> see<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:32.780> takes<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.110> little

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:33.259 
quick and we could see it takes a little

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.230 
quick and we could see it takes a little
while<00:04:33.470> for<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:33.979> power<00:04:34.130> up<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.820> only<00:04:35.120> a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
while for it to power up it is only a

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.999 
while for it to power up it is only a
dual<00:04:35.479> core<00:04:35.660> processor<00:04:35.720> with<00:04:36.350> one<00:04:36.500> gigabyte<00:04:36.680> of

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
dual core processor with one gigabyte of

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.529 
dual core processor with one gigabyte of
RAM<00:04:37.130> so<00:04:37.340> don't<00:04:37.490> expect<00:04:37.610> blazing<00:04:38.210> fast<00:04:38.449> speeds

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
RAM so don't expect blazing fast speeds

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.420 
RAM so don't expect blazing fast speeds
and<00:04:38.900> as<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.229> see<00:04:39.410> already<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.919> screen<00:04:40.280> is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
and as you can see already the screen is

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.930 
and as you can see already the screen is
just<00:04:40.490> not<00:04:40.759> that<00:04:41.030> great<00:04:41.300> at<00:04:42.050> 1024<00:04:42.889> by<00:04:43.009> 600<00:04:43.400> don't

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
just not that great at 1024 by 600 don't

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.939 
just not that great at 1024 by 600 don't
expect<00:04:44.300> a<00:04:44.419> lot<00:04:44.630> now<00:04:45.259> what<00:04:45.440> I<00:04:45.470> can<00:04:45.680> say<00:04:45.860> about

the screen is that you can really not

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.070 
the screen is that you can really not
really<00:04:49.400> notice<00:04:49.699> how<00:04:49.880> terrible<00:04:50.330> it<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.570> because
