 they usually die so let's put on the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.240
 creative and we see them a little bit you see they are 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:17.280

 finally to see what has changed the 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.100
 hell 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.100
 LOL 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.040
 Here you have proposed that it was not 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.530
 I really like, for example, the 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.190
 land as it is of those harsh penalties as well 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.110
 funny are more childish black 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.389
 Arabs are faces to play for the truth 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.430
 I'm staying with the sun and kraft which is very 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:09.170
 similar and I like it more 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.180
 you are seeing hell a bit like 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:16.479
 it would be today we know 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.789
 assured so nothing guys this is this 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.770
 textures pack I remind you that we 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.030
 you are using ms to be to use 

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.300
 this step back if you will not see things with 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.340
 errors and installing if you see that in 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.810
 principle needs the mc to cher but 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.880
 for example you can see that the one that boston 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.530
 you see fire and rusty good stuff 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.880
 rare that sometimes you see that is because 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.979
 you have to use that patch that you have the 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.020
 description or have installed the 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:40.750
 optical I recommend having them the optimal 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:43.360
 installed that you also have it in the 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.310
 description a video for how 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.440
 install it and so I do not expect anything 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.639
 that you liked this video and even 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.639
 the next guys goodbye
