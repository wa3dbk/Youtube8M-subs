00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.979
 hello in this second part we are going to 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.979
 teach what to do besides with your armor 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.870
 for the body we need 9 grams of 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.510
 red gum paste we add a little 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.680
 of rubber choked we knead well and then 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.680
 we make a ball 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.240
 now we are giving it shape 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.609
 for the abdomen we stretch a little 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.969
 rubber paste and let's cut it out of this 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.969
 shape 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.610
 we put a little glue that is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.450
 made from water with a hint of 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 rubber delivery to the singing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.050
 and we paste it with care 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.420
 for the legs we need a rule 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.980
 of millimeter circles and we measure a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.390
 12 mm rubber dough ball 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.390
 in diameter for each 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.420
 and then we give it shape we add a little 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.420
 and we crush on one side 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 the same thing we do with the other leg 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.060
 we put a little glue and 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.060
 we put each leg in its place 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.519
 for the helmet we need a ball of 12 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.470
 millimeters in diameter we put a 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.470
 little bit of glue and we put it 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.680
 for each arm we need a ball of 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.230
 gumpaste 14 millimeters 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.180
 diameter then we lengthen it a little 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.870
 leaving a thicker end for the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.870
 part of the shoulder 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.940
 the same thing we do with the other arm 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.050
 now we put a little glue and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.050
 we put each arm in its place 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.600
 to make the details of the helmet we use 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.900
 two balls of dough and we give them the shape of 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.900
 drop 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.260
 then we stick each piece in its place 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.190
 for the face we are going to stretch a bit of 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.190
 white gum paste 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.990
 then we cut with a scalpel a small 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.990
 rectangle 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.120
 and then we end up giving it this form 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.530
 a cutter small circles 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.530
 let's make this cut 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.160
 in my life 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.150
 then we put some glue and 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.150
 we put this little piece in its place 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.720
 to paint the eyes we need 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.590
 diluted gel confectionery dyes 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.590
 with a little water 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.180
 and with that we finish you know max 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.660
 now we place you know more about the 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.280
 cupcake using a glue that is 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.280
 made with fondant with water 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.740
 you can also use class 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.580
 well that would be everything and I hope it is 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.580
 help hello and see you next time
