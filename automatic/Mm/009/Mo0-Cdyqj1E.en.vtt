better player and his area around the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.970 
better player and his area around the
breakdown<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.420> second<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.320> none<00:02:45.350> really<00:02:45.680> he

drags and standards up from all of the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.450 
drags and standards up from all of the
guys<00:02:48.020> including<00:02:48.620> me

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.780 

I<00:02:51.520> think<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.720> player<00:02:53.080> like<00:02:53.170> James<00:02:53.530> Wardwell<00:02:53.980> is

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
I think a player like James Wardwell is

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.310 
I think a player like James Wardwell is
a<00:02:54.880> great<00:02:55.150> player<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.510> having<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.780> squad<00:02:56.080> I

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
a great player to having the squad I

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.490 
a great player to having the squad I
think<00:02:56.800> his<00:02:57.660> experience<00:02:58.660> on<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.960> field<00:02:59.200> is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
think his experience on the field is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.550 
think his experience on the field is
invaluable<00:02:59.950> in<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.580> sense<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:01.060> understanding

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
invaluable in the sense of understanding

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.930 
invaluable in the sense of understanding
how<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> game<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.980> sevens<00:03:03.250> is<00:03:03.370> played<00:03:03.610> and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
how the game of sevens is played and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.700 
how the game of sevens is played and
having<00:03:04.420> someone<00:03:04.630> in<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.960> side<00:03:05.200> with<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
having someone in the side with that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.860 
having someone in the side with that
much<00:03:05.860> experience<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.700> vital<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.540> well<00:03:07.690> going

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
much experience is vital as well going

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.170 
much experience is vital as well going
forward<00:03:08.140> more<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.010> because<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.520> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
forward more so because of the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.460 
forward more so because of the
experience<00:03:10.600> he<00:03:10.690> can<00:03:10.810> give<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> young<00:03:11.290> guys

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
experience he can give to the young guys

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.370 
experience he can give to the young guys
coming<00:03:11.860> on<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:13.180> trying<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.110> sort<00:03:14.320> of

were occasions where I was chasing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.240 
were occasions where I was chasing
shadows<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.900> running<00:03:29.260> in<00:03:29.380> quicksand<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:30.130> all

that sort of stuff that made my debut in
the<00:03:31.960> gold<00:03:32.260> coast<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:33.160> was<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.340> time<00:03:33.460> I

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
the gold coast and that was the time I

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
tournament so for me that was ideal

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.480 
tournament so for me that was ideal
because<00:03:37.600> he<00:03:38.170> was<00:03:38.320> learning<00:03:38.500> how<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.160> group

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
because he was learning how the group

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.430 
because he was learning how the group
worked<00:03:40.090> at<00:03:40.330> tournament<00:03:40.720> time<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.200> how<00:03:41.380> he

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
when I first heard that it was it was

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.310 
when I first heard that it was it was
going<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.580> happen<00:05:34.700> I'll<00:05:35.570> set<00:05:35.810> my<00:05:35.840> sights<00:05:36.080> on<00:05:36.260> a

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
going to happen I'll set my sights on a

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.410 
going to happen I'll set my sights on a
straightaway<00:05:36.620> as<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:36.920> long<00:05:37.100> term<00:05:37.340> goal<00:05:37.610> but<00:05:37.820> now

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
straightaway as a long term goal but now

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.570 
straightaway as a long term goal but now
the<00:05:39.170> time<00:05:39.200> didn't<00:05:39.680> think<00:05:39.890> it<00:05:40.190> was<00:05:40.370> maybe

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
the time didn't think it was maybe

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.320 
the time didn't think it was maybe
possible<00:05:41.380> as<00:05:42.380> he<00:05:42.530> is<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.950> creep<00:05:43.370> on<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:43.880> I'm<00:05:44.030> my

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
possible as he is a creep on and I'm my

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.000 
possible as he is a creep on and I'm my
legs<00:05:44.510> are<00:05:44.660> still<00:05:44.870> going<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.410> I'm<00:05:45.830> thinking

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
legs are still going and I'm thinking

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.980 
legs are still going and I'm thinking
maybe<00:05:46.250> there's<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.580> chance<00:05:46.610> but<00:05:47.270> now<00:05:47.780> for<00:05:47.960> the

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
maybe there's a chance but now for the

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.210 
maybe there's a chance but now for the
time<00:05:48.260> being<00:05:48.440> it's<00:05:48.560> just<00:05:48.770> about<00:05:48.920> finishing

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
this season and taking it one step at a

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.200 
this season and taking it one step at a
time<00:05:51.230> next<00:05:51.560> year<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:52.010> hopefully<00:05:52.580> I'll<00:05:52.790> be<00:05:52.820> in

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210
