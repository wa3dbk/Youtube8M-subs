access and then I can present the
numbers<00:03:42.930> if<00:03:43.230> I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
numbers if I

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.680 
numbers if I
to<00:03:43.740> have<00:03:43.980> multiple<00:03:44.640> series<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.270> can<00:03:45.450> see

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
to have multiple series here you can see

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.110 
to have multiple series here you can see
that<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:46.350> each<00:03:46.590> click<00:03:46.950> another<00:03:47.400> series<00:03:47.880> gets

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that on each click another series gets

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.240 
that on each click another series gets
to<00:03:48.240> the<00:03:48.330> wheel<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.290> makes<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.740> easier<00:03:50.190> for

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
to the wheel so it makes it easier for

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.199 
to the wheel so it makes it easier for
me<00:03:50.520> to<00:03:50.550> explain<00:03:50.730> my<00:03:51.120> numbers<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.660> my<00:03:51.780> audience

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
me to explain my numbers to my audience

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.650 
me to explain my numbers to my audience
so<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:55.430> will<00:03:56.430> be<00:03:56.550> able<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.880> get<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.240> best<00:03:57.450> of

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
so you will be able to get the best of

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.750 
so you will be able to get the best of
both<00:03:57.870> words<00:03:58.110> when<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.770> have<00:03:58.800> Excel<00:03:59.580> and

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
both words when you have Excel and

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.360 
both words when you have Excel and
PowerPoint<00:04:00.360> used<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.260> tandem<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.920> create<00:04:02.040> your

chart to create your number
presentations<00:04:04.970> there<00:04:05.970> is<00:04:06.060> something<00:04:06.420> more

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
presentations there is something more

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.800 
presentations there is something more
when<00:04:08.160> you<00:04:08.280> combine<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.970> power<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.300> these<00:04:09.540> two

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
when you combine the power of these two

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.590 
when you combine the power of these two
software<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:11.100> get<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.819> create<00:04:12.120> some

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
software you get to create some

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.650 
software you get to create some
mind-blowing<00:04:13.319> charts<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.420> these<00:04:15.420> are

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
mind-blowing charts like this these are

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.909 
mind-blowing charts like this these are
some<00:04:15.810> of<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> examples<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.500> I<00:04:16.680> have<00:04:16.769> taken

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
some of the examples that I have taken

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.830 
some of the examples that I have taken
from<00:04:17.130> our<00:04:17.400> visual<00:04:17.760> PowerPoint<00:04:18.269> graphs<00:04:18.510> back

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
from our visual PowerPoint graphs back

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.800 
from our visual PowerPoint graphs back
and<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.890> see<00:04:20.100> here<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.390> chart

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
and you can see here that this chart

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.340 
and you can see here that this chart
looks<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.940> stunning<00:04:24.450> that<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.720> can't<00:04:24.960> believe

looks so stunning that you can't believe

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.650 
looks so stunning that you can't believe
that<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:25.950> actually<00:04:26.430> a<00:04:26.460> data-driven<00:04:27.180> chart

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
that it is actually a data-driven chart

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.430 
that it is actually a data-driven chart
but<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.560> reality<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.570> let<00:04:30.570> me<00:04:30.720> say<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
but the reality is it is let me say that

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
2013 as well which is a fantastic option

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.219 
2013 as well which is a fantastic option
PowerPoint<00:04:56.940> 2010<00:04:57.300> doesn't<00:04:57.870> have<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.110> option

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
PowerPoint 2010 doesn't have that option

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.170 
PowerPoint 2010 doesn't have that option
however<00:04:59.039> whatever<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.700> I<00:04:59.760> have<00:04:59.850> discussed

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
however whatever that I have discussed

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.630 
however whatever that I have discussed
so<00:05:00.330> far<00:05:00.360> like<00:05:00.810> sticking<00:05:01.289> Excel<00:05:02.100> chart<00:05:02.310> into

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
so far like sticking Excel chart into

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.159 
so far like sticking Excel chart into
PowerPoint<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.390> having<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.780> animation

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
PowerPoint and having the animation

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.560 
PowerPoint and having the animation
happening<00:05:04.530> works<00:05:05.160> in<00:05:05.370> PowerPoint<00:05:05.789> 2010<00:05:06.120> as

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
happening works in PowerPoint 2010 as

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.080 
happening works in PowerPoint 2010 as
well<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.470> let<00:05:07.590> us<00:05:07.620> say<00:05:07.890> I<00:05:08.039> want<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.430> edit<00:05:08.669> data

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
well so let us say I want to edit data

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
well so let us say I want to edit data
and<00:05:09.890> I<00:05:10.890> want<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.310> change<00:05:11.520> this<00:05:11.760> value<00:05:11.970> from<00:05:12.300> 4.3

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
and I want to change this value from 4.3

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.770 
and I want to change this value from 4.3
to<00:05:13.650> say<00:05:14.510> 6<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:17.010> can<00:05:17.190> see<00:05:17.370> here<00:05:17.610> that<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.600> value

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
to say 6 you can see here that the value

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.870 
to say 6 you can see here that the value
has<00:05:19.050> changed<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.950> is<00:05:20.100> indeed<00:05:20.610> a

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
has changed so it is indeed a

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.680 
has changed so it is indeed a
data-driven<00:05:21.539> chart<00:05:23.030> so<00:05:24.030> let<00:05:24.150> us<00:05:24.270> close<00:05:24.479> this

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
data-driven chart so let us close this

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.380 
data-driven chart so let us close this
let<00:05:24.900> us<00:05:24.960> go<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.200> another<00:05:25.320> chart<00:05:26.160> here<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:27.180> is

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
let us go to another chart here this is

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.210 
let us go to another chart here this is
an<00:05:27.600> infographic<00:05:28.190> believe<00:05:29.190> me<00:05:29.370> this<00:05:29.550> is<00:05:29.669> not<00:05:29.850> a

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
an infographic believe me this is not a

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.950 
an infographic believe me this is not a
clipart<00:05:32.220> it<00:05:32.430> is<00:05:32.550> actually<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.210> data<00:05:33.660> driven

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
clipart it is actually a data driven

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.440 
clipart it is actually a data driven
chart<00:05:34.350> let<00:05:34.830> me<00:05:34.950> show<00:05:35.190> you<00:05:35.250> how<00:05:35.640> we<00:05:36.090> can<00:05:36.270> edit

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
chart let me show you how we can edit

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.540 
chart let me show you how we can edit
this<00:05:36.810> like<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.380> way<00:05:37.470> we<00:05:37.620> did<00:05:37.740> earlier<00:05:38.130> edit

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
this like the way we did earlier edit

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.990 
this like the way we did earlier edit
data<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:39.090> go<00:05:39.960> here<00:05:40.289> maybe<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:41.010> can<00:05:41.190> observe<00:05:41.610> the

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
data I go here maybe you can observe the

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.020 
data I go here maybe you can observe the
data<00:05:42.360> for<00:05:42.720> April<00:05:42.900> it<00:05:43.289> is<00:05:43.410> 11<00:05:43.770> Here<00:05:44.010> I<00:05:44.160> am<00:05:44.669> going

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
data for April it is 11 Here I am going

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.950 
data for April it is 11 Here I am going
to<00:05:45.210> make<00:05:45.390> this<00:05:45.600> into<00:05:45.870> say<00:05:46.320> 16<00:05:47.160> and<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:48.570> can<00:05:48.720> see

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
to make this into say 16 and you can see

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.280 
to make this into say 16 and you can see
how<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:50.490> chart<00:05:50.910> has<00:05:51.060> changed

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
how the chart has changed

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.010 
how the chart has changed
the<00:05:52.740> same<00:05:52.980> way<00:05:53.220> because<00:05:54.090> of<00:05:54.540> the<00:05:54.660> power<00:05:54.870> of

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
the same way because of the power of

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.780 
the same way because of the power of
PowerPoint<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:55.950> Excel<00:05:56.390> you<00:05:57.390> can<00:05:57.420> combine<00:05:58.790> the

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
PowerPoint and Excel you can combine the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.260 
PowerPoint and Excel you can combine the
images<00:06:00.150> like<00:06:00.570> this<00:06:00.750> like<00:06:01.230> this<00:06:01.820> tab<00:06:02.820> phone

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
images like this like this tab phone

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.840 
images like this like this tab phone
which<00:06:03.690> is<00:06:03.720> once<00:06:04.290> again<00:06:04.560> we<00:06:04.920> created<00:06:05.370> entirely

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
which is once again we created entirely

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.320 
which is once again we created entirely
using<00:06:06.600> PowerPoint<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:08.400> smartphone<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.300> we

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
using PowerPoint the smartphone and we

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.920 
using PowerPoint the smartphone and we
have<00:06:09.990> used<00:06:10.230> that<00:06:10.410> as<00:06:10.680> a<00:06:10.710> placeholder<00:06:11.450> to<00:06:12.450> place

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
have used that as a placeholder to place

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.760 
have used that as a placeholder to place
our<00:06:13.200> bar<00:06:13.800> chart<00:06:14.130> here<00:06:14.400> and<00:06:15.440> we<00:06:16.440> have<00:06:16.560> done

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
our bar chart here and we have done

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.770 
our bar chart here and we have done
something<00:06:17.070> similar<00:06:17.700> for<00:06:18.060> this<00:06:18.270> one<00:06:18.480> as<00:06:18.600> well

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
something similar for this one as well

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.170 
something similar for this one as well
we<00:06:19.080> have<00:06:19.200> created<00:06:19.680> this<00:06:19.860> laptop<00:06:20.280> graphic

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
we have created this laptop graphic

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.420 
we have created this laptop graphic
entirely<00:06:21.810> using<00:06:22.350> PowerPoint<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.040> you<00:06:23.070> have

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
entirely using PowerPoint and you have

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.730 
entirely using PowerPoint and you have
some<00:06:23.700> very<00:06:23.730> useful<00:06:24.090> tutorials<00:06:24.750> to<00:06:25.380> create

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
some very useful tutorials to create

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.880 
some very useful tutorials to create
such<00:06:26.010> shapes<00:06:26.990> when<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.080> go<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.290> our<00:06:28.500> channel

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
such shapes when you go to our channel

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.560 
such shapes when you go to our channel
you<00:06:29.400> would<00:06:29.520> be<00:06:29.610> able<00:06:29.700> to<00:06:29.880> find<00:06:30.090> out<00:06:30.240> some<00:06:30.450> very

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
you would be able to find out some very

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.790 
you would be able to find out some very
remarkable<00:06:31.140> shapes<00:06:31.380> that<00:06:31.530> you<00:06:31.620> can<00:06:31.650> create

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
remarkable shapes that you can create

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.370 
remarkable shapes that you can create
using<00:06:32.430> PowerPoint<00:06:32.850> so<00:06:33.600> we<00:06:33.690> have<00:06:33.810> created<00:06:33.930> this

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
using PowerPoint so we have created this

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.320 
using PowerPoint so we have created this
laptop<00:06:34.590> entirely<00:06:35.160> in<00:06:35.310> PowerPoint<00:06:35.730> and<00:06:35.940> then

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
laptop entirely in PowerPoint and then

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.880 
laptop entirely in PowerPoint and then
we<00:06:36.660> have<00:06:36.840> placed<00:06:37.200> this<00:06:37.920> graph<00:06:38.280> on<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:39.060> screen

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
we have placed this graph on the screen
