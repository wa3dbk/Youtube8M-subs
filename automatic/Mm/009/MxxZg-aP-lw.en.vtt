00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.710

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.080
 now we will be removing this 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.780
 continuously good the matter of the 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.770
 I have put them that is why to do 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.440
 me not what are we going to elaborate as it is 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.080
 happen to jump to the hand is horrifying the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.990
 what a wonder then I protect myself with 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.350
 some gloves and llos for a little 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.350
 patience 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.460
 you see that it is forming 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.969
 allegory of candy we do not stop 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.969
 stir 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.409
 Hahaha 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.690
 ah 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.690
 ah 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.170
 ah 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.530
 when the candy is melted when 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.259
 the sugar is melted the almonds 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.770
 begin to petar will be the time when 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.770
 let's take them out 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.360
 to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.440
 Hello 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.790
 it's a little elaboration because it 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.849
 recommends continuous but good 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:44.000
 result is fantastic so a 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.000
 little arm and then to enjoy 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.830
 I assure you that when you make this nougat 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.880
 the one with the yolk you will not want later 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.230
 buy nougat because there is no color with 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.230
 the shopping 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.860
 for all 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.100
 let's continue making bitter 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.280
 we go 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.760
 well let's take out 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.090
 good as techniques things 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190
 not now 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.319
 low 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.220
 ah 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.440
 and now we have a visa mold and in 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.720
 this closed case of 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.720
 baking paper so I do not know 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.040
 so that it does not stick because so the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.110
 tablet then it comes off very well 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.820
 We have a few minutes so that the 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.560
 shoulder candy 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.560
 always refer to the same 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.380
 if we do not leave the candy all to 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.210
 background then if we wait now for a 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.630
 little for who cold if he is gay then 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.630
 is better 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.590
 ah 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.280
 and the same I say is not plastic because 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:13.090
 the high temperature of the candy 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.249
 would make the mold melt 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.399
 that has been good of 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.729
 glass or ceramic or from 

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.729
 metal 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.420
 good and now finally what we 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.420
 remains 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.180
 is that to throw him of our anise 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.180
 paralyzed 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.900
 what is it that gives 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.490
 the aguilar aspect 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.230
 high 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.900
 you see now that it cool very well 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.030
 before unmolding what 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.030
 and we already have our total of islands
