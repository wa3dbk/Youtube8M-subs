00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello I waited for another flash drive 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.900
 From the Chinese site I ordered a flash card 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.349
 32gb micro sd 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:17.840
 for a cell phone now let's see 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.220
 how it all looks and in general 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 it will be necessary to conduct tests and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 Check the flash drive here nafig 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:41.870
 also the adapter card itself and there is a vesbie 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:45.510
 where the flash drive is inserted 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.850
 you can transfer information directly from 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:56.039
 cards on the computer 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:01:00.000
 which is very convenient here we have an appeal 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.870
 from the seller was written by hand then 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 multiplied 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.909
 that is, it is such a photocopy 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.950
 is here now well asked to rate 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 as if by virtue of well 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.850
 merits and of course I will estimate 5 stars 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.200
 if the card is really 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 real there surely will be all five 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.869
 the stars 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.229
 I hope that this will happen very much 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.560
 The card is normal and so tested 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 new flash drive i need a little card 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:36.350
 Memory I will use Whistby the adapter and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.350
 I'll check it through the laptop 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.020
 here it is displayed disk and writes that 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.270
 31 free on 2 gigabytes remains 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.490
 test flash drive and make sure 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.509
 credibility of this information in order 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.530
 to test i will use 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 program that has already downloaded 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 The program is called Ashdod and 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.170
 before we start the test on our flash drive 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.810
 there must be a single file and so 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.860
 choose a language that is more understandable for 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.500
 and press the selector there is no choose 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.920
 our flash drive for testing which is here 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.380
 we choose to test everything and click 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.049
 reading and verification went the process by 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.340
 the end we will know what will give us this 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.120
 test for here we have displayed 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.400
 the number of checked bytes yes and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.440
 What is the speed of the process and the approximate 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
 remaining time 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.750
 so we will not wait for an hour and a half 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.549
 between pause and language I will show when everything 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.530
 end and so the first part 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.900
 testing comes to an end 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.239
 just a few seconds left 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.549
 this is only half the test 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.950
 verification will start i'm showing you this 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.380
 lest you think it's all fast 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.290
 happening verification process already 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.319
 you can see what happens with the card 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.620
 for the flash drive and what are its parameters 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.010
 so look 7 and 4 gigabytes such here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.859
 this is its real capacity of 18 9 megabytes 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.019
 data lost everything is like this what 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.930
 you can not use it essentially no 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.690
 there is actually this card no more 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.880
 eight gigabytes like that 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.799
 the stage will be and the formatting that is 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.049
 ghosts in normal divine form 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.209
 who will be able to rise as you 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.389
 guess 5 stars seller not 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.489
 will get and get open not so here 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.480
 They are final and data about 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:44.380
 testing theme 4 gigabytes real 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.769
 2-23 7 nonexistent so about speed 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:51.519
 read and write write speed 768 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.160
 reading speeds of 13 and a half and now 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.340
 look at himself apple 2 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.690
 me for which this flash drive was purchased 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.180
 and this purchase 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.690
 the only good thing is this 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.390
 this one 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.870
 adapter everything else you know see 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.210
 how cunning seller on aliexpress here 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.000
 He writes a full, see this 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.950
 tablet attention 4 gigabytes real 8 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.269
 gigabytes is real and that's where 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.850
 gone 16-32 64 8 gigabytes plus breit 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.440
 heard about abu warm up memory cards 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.950
 I did not even find information on the Internet 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.350
 by which someone once had a memory card 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.150
 able to upgrade and and here if you 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.050
 want 100 percent full power 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.940
 please click on this link and 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.440
 if we go over here we see that two 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.540
 times more expensive is the map 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.210
 conditions then you really 32 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.120
 gigabyte i will open a dispute and 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.690
 let's see how it ends for everyone 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.400
 the case of continuing to learn the flash drive threw off 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.770
 information 20 something gigabyte but so 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.890
 just from the flashlight as if the folder grabbed and 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.740
 I dropped it here he writes to me that 26 is one 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.660
 free from 30 12 before that he did not write 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.270
 an error that cannot transfer files 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.410
 but than let's go see what he does 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.540
 suffered a cabbage and that flash drive even when 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.130
 of its 8 gigabytes so real memory 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.160
 takes nothing at all 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.550
 if necessary on the meaning, we see that 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.550
 a laptop 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.800
 what is interesting busy is not clear so by 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.280
 flash drives I open the dispute click here 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:40.740
 on the button here they ask me what 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.810
 problem item received yes not working 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.300
 properly i think that's enough 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.300
 there are two options either complete 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.100
 refund or partial refund while i 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.890
 I will write a full refund and you will see 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:57.330
 on whose I translate using Yandex 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:59.310
 translator write what made the order card 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.660
 memory with the first machine is not information 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.670
 it turned out generally empty on not 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.010
 transferred only the name of the folder writes 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.140
 freely as well, there is a map at all 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.800
 does not save information card non-working 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.710
 by tests 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.890
 is determined by the following I will even write what 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.370
 there are as evidence photos and 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.740
 video 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.810
 copy and paste into the allotted 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:25.250
 This code is also available here. 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:29.120
 add attachment like screenshots 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:33.060
 photo and upload to mediafire 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.250
 the video was open dispute and not days me yes 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.290
 I was given to wait 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.210
 the result of this free seller 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.669
 most likely will resist judging 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.440
 according to reviews from other buyers 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:45.530
 but one way or another we will see it soon 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.210
 I hope the review was useful to you 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.880
 click like subscribe to the channel 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.620
 share videos with friends, new reviews 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.450
 there will be much more interesting 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.570
 thanks for watching all new meetings 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.570
