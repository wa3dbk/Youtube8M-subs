00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.700
 so that nice we recognized 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.439
 for black magic had already scored 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.480
 the minds in terms of design and 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.339
 now you come back with a voxan 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.179
 a bit peculiar it's a voxan 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:27.130
 electric what does it change 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's a bump in 100% electric 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 effect 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 and that I think that not only is she going 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 change a little voxan image but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.300
 it can also change the image of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.000
 the bike in general he was out of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.050
 question for me to draw a motorcycle 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.050
 too futuristic a motorcycle where we would 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.290
 obliged to put on the iron suit 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 man to drive it is not that the idea 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.760
 there are small details that evoke 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 futuristic films from science movies 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.019
 fiction that are also related to the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.719
 technology that is to say that I play 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.949
 especially with the lighting so we have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.329
 really feel like these lights 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.429
 blue gives the impression that there is a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.200
 kind of energy inside the 

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.910
 machine and that goes out by these small 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.640
 slots this is one of the messages 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.720
 so for the amateur that two motorcycles that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 you are it's continuity 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.399
 obligatory passage of the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.570
 electrical terminal or it's one of 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.580
 solutions for the future 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.149
 I do not think we have to be 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.710
 so radical wattman the owner of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.770
 walkman can very well have in his 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.830
 garage an old harley ducati a 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.659
 good scooter no matter I think that's 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.610
 which is important is to advance 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.549
 things and I would even say that in my 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 design approach ecology does not come 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.860
 not even mind what serves that 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.170
 I use the energy of the electric 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.759
 enjoy the pure pleasure and the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.189
 performance is the only thing that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.920
 I'm interested in the electrical so we 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.990
 will be able to roll with caen well the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.539
 the idea is to already test a little 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 people so we're going to be here exposed here 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.479
 I think that a little to go around the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 world in the development process 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.880
 we will also 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.099
 very quickly make a moment say a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.450
 demonstrator to do all the all 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.440
 the settings both electronic 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.930
 chassis etc 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.250
 and in the process as soon as possible 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 we will try to launch the machine well 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.150
 sure but I think it's going to happen 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.739
 a scale of a year and a half I think 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.540
 a year and a half two years so for 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.489
 the moment we do not speak we do not speak 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.580
 autonomy does not talk about all these 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.099
 a little practical questions we'll say 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.620
 can conjure up some figures I would say 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:34.920
 that autonomy is not really a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.680
 constraint in the motorcycle universe and 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.390
 I know it as the user that 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.130
 when driving on a small road 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.410
 mountain for a hundred terminals 120 terminals 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.040
 at the cleat we are happy to stop at 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.410
 end of 100 terminals 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.049
 so I would say that this a priori 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.739
 she will do 180 km with a use 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.970
 standardized normal but she can do 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.640
 much less as she can do 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.470
 plus what's important is to my 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.599
 opinion is rather numbers like the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.519
 motor torque that speaks that is to say that 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.970
 we still have two hundred newtons 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.769
 meters that are available as early as 2010 and 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 0 in fact minute revolutions up to 6000 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.920
 rpm and so so 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.930
 constant to say that we do not have 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.220
 curves we have a vertical it's 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.350
 extraordinary you imagine the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.579
 performance and approval of a machine 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.109
 like that it can be extraordinary 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.450
 that is, you are no matter 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.370
 the speed you can expert you 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.660
 like a ball from any bend 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.109
 finally I think there is no 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.109
 equivalent
