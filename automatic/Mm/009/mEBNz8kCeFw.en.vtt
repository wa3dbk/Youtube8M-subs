we go into it here and you can see we

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.280 
we go into it here and you can see we

have the speed boost plasmid we were

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.050 
have the speed boost plasmid we were
using<00:01:29.560> before<00:01:29.680> let's<00:01:30.100> swap<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.640> out<00:01:30.760> for<00:01:31.000> the

let's use the big Daddy to our advantage
to<00:02:03.220> deal<00:02:03.430> with<00:02:03.550> this<00:02:03.640> splicer<00:02:04.180> let's<00:02:04.540> use<00:02:04.690> our

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
to deal with this splicer let's use our

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.230 
to deal with this splicer let's use our
new<00:02:04.960> plasmid<00:02:05.560> called<00:02:06.400> aggressor<00:02:06.820> irritant

new plasmid called aggressor irritant

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.800 
new plasmid called aggressor irritant
throw<00:02:08.229> it<00:02:08.350> at<00:02:08.470> him<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.979> when<00:02:09.640> it's<00:02:10.179> great<00:02:10.540> when

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
throw it at him and when it's great when

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.500 
throw it at him and when it's great when
she<00:02:11.110> sees<00:02:11.470> him<00:02:11.800> she<00:02:12.580> goes<00:02:12.760> after<00:02:12.910> him<00:02:13.180> thinking

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
she sees him she goes after him thinking

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.820 
she sees him she goes after him thinking
he's<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.080> they're<00:02:14.170> gonna<00:02:14.260> start<00:02:14.470> duking

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
he's you and they're gonna start duking

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.380 
he's you and they're gonna start duking
it<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.040> let's<00:02:15.280> use<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.610> distraction<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.300> go

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it out let's use the distraction to go

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.900 
it out let's use the distraction to go
into<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> record<00:02:16.930> store<00:02:17.170> job<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.820> they're

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
into the record store job and they're

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.340 
into the record store job and they're
gonna<00:02:19.030> fight<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:20.110> problem

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
problem which is a security camp which

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.100 
problem which is a security camp which
is<00:02:53.830> watching<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.400> whole<00:02:54.610> scene<00:02:55.030> well<00:02:55.900> we<00:02:55.989> can

is watching the whole scene well we can

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.420 
is watching the whole scene well we can
fight<00:02:56.350> them<00:02:56.530> both<00:02:56.709> or<00:02:56.920> maybe<00:02:57.070> there's<00:02:57.250> another

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
fight them both or maybe there's another

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.699 
fight them both or maybe there's another
way<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.610> deal<00:02:57.850> with<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.090> problem

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
way to deal with this problem

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.420 
way to deal with this problem
let's<00:02:59.219> use<00:02:59.370> another<00:02:59.400> plasma<00:03:00.650> called<00:03:01.650> security

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
let's use another plasma called security

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.500 
let's use another plasma called security
kit<00:03:02.670> let's<00:03:03.120> cast<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.719> on<00:03:03.840> her<00:03:05.329> and<00:03:06.329> now<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
kit let's cast that on her and now the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
kit let's cast that on her and now the
camera<00:03:06.959> thinks<00:03:07.200> she's<00:03:07.349> you<00:03:07.620> remember<00:03:08.549> those

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
camera thinks she's you remember those

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.099 
camera thinks she's you remember those
box<00:03:08.969> you<00:03:09.180> had<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.390> deal<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.540> before<00:03:09.750> oh<00:03:09.989> well

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
box you had to deal with before oh well

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.110 
box you had to deal with before oh well
guess<00:03:10.290> what<00:03:10.530> now<00:03:11.189> they're<00:03:11.430> her<00:03:11.579> problem

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
guess what now they're her problem

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.819 
guess what now they're her problem
they're<00:03:12.359> gonna<00:03:12.510> start<00:03:12.780> duking<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.290> out<00:03:13.469> down

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
they're gonna start duking it out down

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.050 
they're gonna start duking it out down
there<00:03:14.040> meanwhile<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.609> can<00:03:14.730> take<00:03:14.879> out<00:03:15.030> the
