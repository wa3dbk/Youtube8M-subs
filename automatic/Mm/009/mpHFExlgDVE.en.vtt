00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.469
 Let's make a breakfast salad I'm glad 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.670
 I have heard breakfast right 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.740
 like first very much to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.179
 So breakfast with a bit of bread 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.830
 yes I want to show you today how 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.320
 this breakfast table works 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.609
 Thank you for the great recipe 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.920
 have not done it before and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 I'm curious so my dear 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.609
 First we start with that, we have eggs 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.029
 I have a cook here, and I have one here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.980
 egg cooker from funded this brand 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.760
 by rossmann the world or our world 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 or so and that's great so if you are 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.190
 drowned on the conventional cooking pot 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 want to do without is great and yes 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.059
 peel three eggs and cook simply 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.100
 let cool and set aside 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 then we need an onion now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.730
 Please make sure that you are not one 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.739
 all time takes but only a quarter 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.530
 So that was 40 dominant you learn 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.329
 also at the end of the video and I have 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 now given in thermomix and easy 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.550
 a little bit broken so we 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.040
 then have little red onions afterwards 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.040
 I have it in one then 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.270
 mixed whether so given a container over 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.970
 everything in afterwards 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.770
 nice to be able to turn around in peace 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 We do the same with one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.810
 half bunch parsley smooth and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 we'll just give you a top 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.409
 so then you can go there sheep cheese 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.869
 I crumble into it completely 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.990
 creamy only had but you can the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.060
 take normal from aldi or lidl 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
 no problem so then it continues 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 You need two to three tomatoes each 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.180
 after how many want the inner 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.380
 because out there because that's me 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.420
 everything is too watery 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.220
 and after I took that out 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 constantly that again in small mini 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.369
 bits and then that afterwards 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.100
 Also add to the pot with something 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.720
 is called the top-salary mixing bowl 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 shots were dropped so stirring bowl 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.979
 and then we had the eggs 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 have cooled well in the meantime and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.130
 We also create it once in small 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.140
 I have the one before 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.780
 cut decision and give that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 then add everything with you and far away 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.209
 the whole after we mulled the whole thing 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.740
 we continue with the spices 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.650
 and I just take a bit 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 pepper a bit of olive oil 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.010
 bit of salt and a bit 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.170
 Lemon juice but you can too 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.790

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.580
 at that time nicely mixed together and 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.140

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.470
