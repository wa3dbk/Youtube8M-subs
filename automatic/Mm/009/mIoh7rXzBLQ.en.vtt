00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
having a blast with this thing this

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.350 
having a blast with this thing this
thing<00:02:03.550> is<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:04.000> hoot<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.630> drive<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:07.210> is

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
thing is a hoot to drive it is

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.660 
thing is a hoot to drive it is
definitely<00:02:07.870> going<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> get<00:02:08.530> all<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.520> metal

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
definitely going to get all the metal

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.850 
definitely going to get all the metal
upgrades<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.479> are<00:02:10.539> currently<00:02:11.200> available<00:02:11.500> in

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
upgrades that are currently available in

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.890 
upgrades that are currently available in
any<00:02:12.010> new<00:02:12.280> ones<00:02:12.489> that<00:02:12.700> come<00:02:12.879> out<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.750> are

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
any new ones that come out and there are

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.410 
any new ones that come out and there are
a<00:02:13.930> few<00:02:14.319> metal<00:02:14.950> upgrades<00:02:15.340> plus<00:02:15.640> ball<00:02:15.940> bearings

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
a few metal upgrades plus ball bearings

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.880 
a few metal upgrades plus ball bearings
and<00:02:16.629> so<00:02:16.810> on<00:02:16.989> that<00:02:17.140> are<00:02:17.260> already<00:02:17.379> up<00:02:17.590> for<00:02:17.800> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and so on that are already up for the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.420 
and so on that are already up for the
sink<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.300> know<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.810> got<00:02:20.739> some<00:02:20.769> potential

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
sink so you know it's got some potential

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.170 
sink so you know it's got some potential
there<00:02:21.459> for<00:02:21.610> more

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
there for more

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.479 
there for more
or<00:02:22.269> now<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.079> am<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.859> be<00:02:24.010> taking<00:02:24.189> this

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
or now I am going to be taking this

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.000 
or now I am going to be taking this
thing<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.849> step<00:02:25.150> ahead<00:02:25.299> and<00:02:25.840> I'm<00:02:26.650> going<00:02:26.829> to<00:02:26.859> be

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
thing a step ahead and I'm going to be

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.789 
thing a step ahead and I'm going to be
replacing<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.730> servo<00:02:28.150> with<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.359> higher

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
replacing the servo with a higher

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.979 
replacing the servo with a higher
kilogram<00:02:29.909> servo<00:02:30.909> probably<00:02:31.359> a<00:02:31.390> metal<00:02:31.689> geared

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
kilogram servo probably a metal geared

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.160 
kilogram servo probably a metal geared
one<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:33.549> I'm<00:02:33.670> thinking<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.390> I'm<00:02:35.019> going

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
one is what I'm thinking and I'm going

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.369 
one is what I'm thinking and I'm going
to<00:02:35.230> replace<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.829> combination<00:02:36.840> ESC<00:02:37.840> receiver

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
to replace the combination ESC receiver

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.459 
to replace the combination ESC receiver
board<00:02:38.829> with<00:02:39.549> a<00:02:39.579> separate<00:02:40.389> receiver<00:02:40.870> separate

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
board with a separate receiver separate

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.830 
board with a separate receiver separate
speed<00:02:41.709> controller<00:02:42.219> and<00:02:42.549> still<00:02:43.329> keep<00:02:43.599> this<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
speed controller and still keep this a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.849 
speed controller and still keep this a
two<00:02:44.200> cell<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.969> I'm<00:02:45.969> also<00:02:46.209> going<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.859> strongly

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
two cell and I'm also going to strongly

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.229 
two cell and I'm also going to strongly
consider<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.849> brushless<00:02:49.239> upgrade<00:02:50.969> however<00:02:51.969> I'm

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
consider a brushless upgrade however I'm

consider a brushless upgrade however I'm
not<00:02:52.359> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.569> go<00:02:52.719> very<00:02:52.870> strong<00:02:53.319> I'm<00:02:53.560> gonna<00:02:53.620> go

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
not going to go very strong I'm gonna go

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.440 
not going to go very strong I'm gonna go
with<00:02:53.950> a<00:02:54.040> mild<00:02:54.310> brushless<00:02:54.669> one<00:02:55.060> because<00:02:55.209> even<00:02:55.389> a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
truck a few of them beating it up I'll

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.559 
truck a few of them beating it up I'll
put<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.840> stock<00:03:56.079> tires<00:03:56.379> on<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:57.519> when<00:03:58.299> I<00:03:58.329> ain't

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.360 
put the stock tires on but when I ain't
doing<00:03:58.900> videos<00:03:59.259> I'm<00:03:59.650> putting<00:03:59.949> these<00:04:00.040> tires

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
doing videos I'm putting these tires

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.670 
doing videos I'm putting these tires
back<00:04:00.669> on<00:04:00.970> because<00:04:01.150> I<00:04:01.449> really<00:04:02.109> like<00:04:02.319> how<00:04:02.500> these

little rally car and there's the pickup
truck<00:04:36.710> style<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.340> so<00:04:37.940> I'm<00:04:38.030> gonna<00:04:38.320> make<00:04:39.320> sure<00:04:39.350> I

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
truck style a so I'm gonna make sure I

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.909 
truck style a so I'm gonna make sure I
got<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.830> whole<00:04:39.980> set<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.410> but<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.440> think<00:04:42.710> this

one<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.430> maybe<00:04:44.330> one<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.930> other<00:04:45.080> ones<00:04:45.380> will

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
one and maybe one of the other ones will

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.920 
one and maybe one of the other ones will
be<00:04:45.800> modded<00:04:46.370> out<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.940> other<00:04:47.060> two<00:04:47.300> no<00:04:47.630> I'm<00:04:47.780> not

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.790 
going to invest that kind of money into
four<00:04:50.090> machines<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.720> totally<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.410> know<00:04:51.440> metal

the daylights out of them you know but

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.680 
the daylights out of them you know but
they'll<00:04:55.160> all<00:04:55.370> get<00:04:55.610> ball<00:04:55.850> bearings<00:04:56.270> us<00:04:56.479> for

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
they'll all get ball bearings us for

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.010 
they'll all get ball bearings us for
sure<00:04:56.900> because<00:04:57.470> these<00:04:58.389> oil<00:04:59.389> bearings<00:04:59.930> that

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
sure because these oil bearings that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.260 
sure because these oil bearings that
come<00:05:00.290> with<00:05:00.500> them<00:05:00.740> I<00:05:00.919> call<00:05:01.580> them<00:05:01.729> bushings

really they're not gonna last forever
you<00:05:06.139> know<00:05:06.290> bearings<00:05:07.190> are<00:05:07.340> gonna<00:05:07.430> be<00:05:07.639> a<00:05:07.669> much

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
you know bearings are gonna be a much

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.420 
you know bearings are gonna be a much
better<00:05:08.720> investment<00:05:09.169> you're<00:05:09.979> gonna<00:05:10.100> get<00:05:10.370> a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
better investment you're gonna get a

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.980 
better investment you're gonna get a
little<00:05:10.669> bit<00:05:10.790> more<00:05:10.970> speed<00:05:11.300> things<00:05:11.780> are<00:05:11.900> gonna

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
little bit more speed things are gonna

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.690 
little bit more speed things are gonna
be<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.169> little<00:05:12.260> bit<00:05:12.440> more<00:05:12.590> tighter<00:05:12.919> you<00:05:13.610> know

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
be a little bit more tighter you know

be a little bit more tighter you know
that<00:05:13.910> sort<00:05:14.210> of<00:05:14.270> thing<00:05:14.479> so<00:05:14.510> yeah<00:05:15.220> definitely

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
that sort of thing so yeah definitely

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.750 
that sort of thing so yeah definitely
ball<00:05:16.669> bearings<00:05:17.150> got<00:05:17.690> to<00:05:17.840> be<00:05:17.930> done<00:05:18.139> and

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
ball bearings got to be done and

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.330 
ball bearings got to be done and
adjustable<00:05:19.760> metal<00:05:20.950> turnbuckles<00:05:21.950> for<00:05:22.220> your

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
adjustable metal turnbuckles for your

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.279 
adjustable metal turnbuckles for your
steering<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:23.000> everything<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:23.990> can<00:05:24.140> do

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
steering and everything so you can do

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.400 
steering and everything so you can do
more<00:05:24.530> different<00:05:25.190> setups<00:05:25.669> and<00:05:25.850> whatnot

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
more different setups and whatnot

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
definitely a good idea and the parts for

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.230 
definitely a good idea and the parts for

know
especially<00:05:39.200> when<00:05:39.350> it<00:05:39.470> comes<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.890> parts<00:05:40.220> and

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
especially when it comes to parts and

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400 
especially when it comes to parts and
than<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.630> I've<00:05:41.840> already<00:05:42.080> gone<00:05:42.350> ahead

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
than that and I've already gone ahead

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.340 
than that and I've already gone ahead
and<00:05:42.710> I<00:05:43.250> had<00:05:43.580> a<00:05:43.610> couple<00:05:44.000> spare<00:05:44.390> clips<00:05:44.720> on<00:05:44.930> some

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
and I had a couple spare clips on some

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.370 
and I had a couple spare clips on some
HSP<00:05:45.950> shocks<00:05:46.280> so<00:05:47.240> now<00:05:47.479> I<00:05:47.510> got<00:05:47.750> three<00:05:47.900> clips<00:05:48.169> on

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
HSP shocks so now I got three clips on

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.680 
HSP shocks so now I got three clips on
either<00:05:48.500> side<00:05:48.830> at<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.070> back<00:05:49.280> so<00:05:49.520> that's<00:05:49.729> giving

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
either side at the back so that's giving

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.920 
either side at the back so that's giving
me<00:05:50.780> a<00:05:50.810> lot<00:05:50.990> better<00:05:51.350> in<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.370> rear<00:05:52.580> end<00:05:52.930> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
me a lot better in the rear end the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.990 
me a lot better in the rear end the
front<00:05:54.229> like<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.530> said<00:05:54.710> it's<00:05:55.130> pretty<00:05:55.280> much<00:05:55.639> fine

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
front like I said it's pretty much fine
