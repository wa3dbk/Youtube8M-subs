but<00:00:01.800> that<00:00:02.100> background<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:02.970> engineering<00:00:03.120> has

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
but that background in engineering has

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.160 
but that background in engineering has
served<00:00:03.929> me<00:00:04.110> quite<00:00:04.410> well<00:00:04.759> because<00:00:05.759> essentially

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:06.170 
served me quite well because essentially

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.650 
served me quite well because essentially
what<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.290> we<00:00:07.880> other<00:00:08.880> than<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.210> spiritual

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
what are we other than the spiritual

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
what are we other than the spiritual
beings<00:00:09.960> which<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.200> really<00:00:10.380> probably<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> most

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
beings which is really probably the most

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.879 
beings which is really probably the most
important<00:00:11.969> part<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.300> our<00:00:12.420> existence<00:00:13.049> but<00:00:13.740> we

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
important part of our existence but we

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.770 
important part of our existence but we
are<00:00:14.040> stuck<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.370> Newtonian<00:00:15.179> physics<00:00:15.360> world

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
are stuck in Newtonian physics world

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.939 
are stuck in Newtonian physics world
aren't<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.230> we<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.190> matter<00:00:18.529> we<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> machine

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
aren't we we are matter we are a machine

aren't we we are matter we are a machine
we<00:00:20.430> are<00:00:20.550> mechanical<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.510> operate

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
we are mechanical we operate

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.800 
we are mechanical we operate
mechanically<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:24.449> engineering

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
mechanically and so my engineering

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.589 
mechanically and so my engineering
training<00:00:24.990> has<00:00:25.260> helped<00:00:25.470> me<00:00:25.590> tremendously

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
training has helped me tremendously

translate understanding how human
movement<00:00:32.030> affects<00:00:33.030> our<00:00:33.270> health<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.950> how

movement affects our health and how

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.280 
movement affects our health and how
sometimes<00:00:35.520> human<00:00:35.820> movement<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.300> really<00:00:36.989> good

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
sometimes human movement is really good

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
sometimes human movement is really good
for<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.850> sometimes<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.750> good

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
for you and sometimes it's not so good

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
for you and sometimes it's not so good
for<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.440> because<00:00:41.250> there's<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.489> exercise

very risky activity to do and so my

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
very risky activity to do and so my

challenges<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.159> been<00:01:29.189> trying<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.700> folks

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
challenges have been trying to get folks

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
challenges have been trying to get folks
to<00:01:30.119> understand<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> real<00:01:30.810> benefits<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to understand the real benefits of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
to understand the real benefits of
exercise<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.700> biggest

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
exercise is one of the biggest

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
exercise is one of the biggest
complaints<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.869> office<00:01:34.079> now<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
complaints I get in my office now that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
complaints I get in my office now that
I'm<00:01:34.740> involved<00:01:35.009> mostly<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.750> biomechanical

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
I'm involved mostly in biomechanical

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
I'm involved mostly in biomechanical
assessment<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.320> correction<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.759> they

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
got hurt exercising and that's not good

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
got hurt exercising and that's not good
you<00:01:42.780> shouldn't<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.409> hurt<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.740> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you shouldn't get hurt when you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.889 
you shouldn't get hurt when you're
exercising<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> that's<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.630> we're<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
exercising so that's what we're going to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.560 
exercising so that's what we're going to
talk<00:01:46.079> about<00:01:46.259> today<00:01:46.520> because<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.759> my<00:01:48.180> process

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
talk about today because in my process

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.289 
talk about today because in my process
of<00:01:49.110> trying<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> figure<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.549> ran<00:01:51.000> into

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
of trying to figure this out I ran into

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
of trying to figure this out I ran into
a<00:01:51.329> skill<00:01:51.990> called<00:01:52.740> muscle<00:01:53.220> activation

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
a skill called muscle activation

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.350 
a skill called muscle activation
techniques<00:01:54.270> therapy<00:01:55.280> amazing<00:01:56.280> every<00:01:57.030> now<00:01:57.149> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
techniques therapy amazing every now and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.359 
techniques therapy amazing every now and
then<00:01:57.540> somebody<00:01:58.350> comes<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.130> something

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
then somebody comes up with something

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.170 
then somebody comes up with something
that's<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.630> amazing<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.909> you<00:02:02.909> almost

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that's really amazing and you almost

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.480 
that's really amazing and you almost
think<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.570> too<00:02:03.719> good<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.110> true<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:05.219> over

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
