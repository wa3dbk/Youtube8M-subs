00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
stairs now the strategy works by you
running<00:01:10.470> down<00:01:10.799> these<00:01:11.010> stairs<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.670> getting

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
them to respawn in their location so all

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.320 
them to respawn in their location so all
you<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> run<00:01:14.790> down<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.090> stairs

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the left side of the mini-map that's why

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
the left side of the mini-map that's why
I<00:01:52.649> aim<00:01:52.860> towards<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.310> middle<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
I aim towards the middle just so I have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.639 
I aim towards the middle just so I have
as<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.479> room<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.750> possible<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:55.350> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
as much room as possible and then that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.899 
as much room as possible and then that
means<00:01:55.829> they<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.159> spawned<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> means<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909

rifle and a an lmg so the other options
are<00:02:07.020> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.290> weird<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.680> tried<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
are kind of weird but I tried out the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.889 
are kind of weird but I tried out the
scout<00:02:08.459> rifle<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.420> good<00:02:09.780> at

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
scout rifle it's really not that good at

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.780 
scout rifle it's really not that good at
close<00:02:10.110> range<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.830> tried<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.069> Magnum<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> was

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
close range and I tried my Magnum it was

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.300 
close range and I tried my Magnum it was
kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.090> fun

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
kind of fun

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
kind of fun
but<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.550> service<00:02:12.880> regime<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:13.690> just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
but the service regime is really just

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.510 
but the service regime is really just
the<00:02:13.930> best<00:02:14.260> thing<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.340> slow

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
the best thing you can do and the slow

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.860 
the best thing you can do and the slow
fire<00:02:15.730> rate<00:02:15.760> helps<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.180> get<00:02:16.300> those<00:02:16.450> accurate

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
fire rate helps you get those accurate

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.360 
fire rate helps you get those accurate
shots<00:02:17.110> without<00:02:17.319> running<00:02:17.800> out<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.099> entire

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
shots without running out the entire

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.190 
shots without running out the entire
clip<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.000> that's<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.450> really<00:02:19.750> really<00:02:19.870> good

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
clip so that's just a really really good

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.390 
clip so that's just a really really good
thing<00:02:20.410> if<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.739> source<00:02:20.920> regime<00:02:21.220> this

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
thing if you have the source regime this

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160 
thing if you have the source regime this
thing<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.730> absolutely<00:02:22.120> false<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.720> tried

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
thing is just absolutely false I tried

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.570 
thing is just absolutely false I tried
some<00:02:23.349> things<00:02:23.530> with<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.770> shotgun<00:02:24.069> but<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.489> was

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
some things with the shotgun but it was

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.190 
some things with the shotgun but it was
kind<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> weird<00:02:25.090> when<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.360> had<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.599> like<00:02:25.720> go<00:02:25.930> back

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
kind of weird when I had to like go back

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.080 
kind of weird when I had to like go back
and<00:02:26.380> forth<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:26.770> i<00:02:27.040> found<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.459> fusion<00:02:27.790> rifles

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and forth and i found that fusion rifles

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.790 
and forth and i found that fusion rifles
work<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.480> best<00:02:28.630> as<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.870> secondary<00:02:29.319> weapon<00:02:29.650> and

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
work the best as a secondary weapon and

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.259 
work the best as a secondary weapon and
the<00:02:29.830> light<00:02:30.130> machine<00:02:30.430> guns<00:02:30.580> as<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.880> last<00:02:31.120> you

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
the light machine guns as the last you

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.670 
the light machine guns as the last you
obviously<00:02:31.660> news<00:02:31.810> rocket<00:02:32.230> launcher<00:02:32.500> just

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
obviously news rocket launcher just

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.080 
obviously news rocket launcher just
blasts<00:02:32.920> open<00:02:33.099> thing<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.610> kill<00:02:33.790> all<00:02:33.940> them

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
blasts open thing and you kill all them

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.030 
blasts open thing and you kill all them
the<00:02:34.209> same<00:02:34.390> time<00:02:34.569> but<00:02:35.050> i<00:02:35.080> found<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.590> LMG

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
the same time but i found that the LMG

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.740 
the same time but i found that the LMG
if<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.280> can<00:02:36.430> use<00:02:36.550> basically<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.330> third<00:02:37.660> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
if you can use basically like a third of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.570 
if you can use basically like a third of
the<00:02:37.810> clip<00:02:38.140> of<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.470> 40<00:02:38.860> bullets<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.430> can

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
the clip of like 40 bullets and you can

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.490 
the clip of like 40 bullets and you can
actually<00:02:39.849> take<00:02:40.269> out<00:02:40.420> almost<00:02:40.870> every<00:02:41.260> single

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
actually take out almost every single

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.960 
actually take out almost every single
one<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.620> them<00:02:41.800> with<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.190> amount<00:02:42.489> of<00:02:42.640> ammo<00:02:42.880> and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
one of them with that amount of ammo and

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.759 
one of them with that amount of ammo and
that's<00:02:43.090> just<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.900> best<00:02:44.230> way<00:02:44.350> to<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.650> it

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
that's just really the best way to do it

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.380 
that's just really the best way to do it
in<00:02:44.830> my<00:02:44.890> opinion<00:02:45.190> fighter<00:02:45.519> other<00:02:46.030> than<00:02:46.150> that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
in my opinion fighter other than that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.699 
in my opinion fighter other than that
that's<00:02:46.540> pretty<00:02:46.720> much<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.959> straps<00:02:47.410> you<00:02:47.530> guys

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that's pretty much the straps you guys

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.080 
that's pretty much the straps you guys
there's<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:48.040> not<00:02:48.340> much<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.819> all<00:02:49.000> you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
there's really not much to it all you

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.699 
there's really not much to it all you
have<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> do<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.569> basically<00:02:49.810> clear<00:02:50.319> out<00:02:50.500> those

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
have to do is basically clear out those

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.559 
have to do is basically clear out those
guys<00:02:50.890> on<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> side<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.670> go<00:02:52.060> up<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.330> down<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
guys on the side and go up and down the

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.660 
guys on the side and go up and down the
thing<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:53.019> catch<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.340> guys<00:02:54.459> are

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
thing one catch is that if you guys are

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.039 
thing one catch is that if you guys are
having<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.150> problem<00:02:55.390> when<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.750> not

that's<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.810> only<00:03:20.109> straggler<00:03:20.530> thing<00:03:20.739> when<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
that's the only straggler thing when a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.340 
that's the only straggler thing when a
public<00:03:21.640> event<00:03:21.730> does<00:03:22.060> spawn<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.690> does<00:03:23.079> not

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
public event does spawn it does not

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.599 
public event does spawn it does not
actually<00:03:23.560> mess<00:03:23.890> up<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.130> spawns<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.459> these

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
actually mess up the spawns of these

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.650 
actually mess up the spawns of these
things<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.120> could<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.510> can

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
things because you could so you can

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.780 
things because you could so you can
completely<00:03:26.200> ignore<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.980> public<00:03:27.310> events<00:03:27.609> or

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
completely ignore the public events or
