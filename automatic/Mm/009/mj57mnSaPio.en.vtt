00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.029
 ah 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.020
 ah 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.730
 ah 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.349
 Y 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.630
 Well today I am going to present you 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:29.890
 an object that we captured on the 13th of 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.980
 February 2013 and it is an object that 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.590
 I probably found the height of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.420
 Lake of Guadalupe here is if 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.350
 you are not aware we are opening 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.390
 all the camera zoom good what 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.239
 we are opening it in the 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.070
 sense that we are leaving it in the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.409
 normal vision to see an object 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.899
 with an impressive luminosity they look 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.790
 the trees on the left side and there's a 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.250
 pole that is in the middle along with the 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.890
 bus cables that pass over that post 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.930
 when doing the approach is that 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.110
 object are going to make bridges are going to 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.880
 give an account of the luminosity that 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.060
 so tremendous this object this object 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.850
 came much brighter and when entering 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.369
 possibly almost at the height where it 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.670
 I found the lake of guadeloupe low 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.400
 intensity and stays in that in that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.630
 shine but it came easy from the brightness that 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:30.439
 has are currently brought as if not 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.759
 sometimes more the luminosity that I had and 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.909
 he came from a luminosity 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.119
 impressive but then it came down and it 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 it was already in that tone in that tone you see 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.500
 the length that is there one of the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.630
 parts of that tree is a cypress tree and see 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.880
 how will it go through the back of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.130
 this tree 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.399
 we also have the reference of a 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.890
 plane that passes by this object 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.509
 here I am opening again the zoom of 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.410
 the camera to be able to compare the size 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.319
 of the object with that of the plane passing through 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 The top 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.819
 almost close to this object 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.319
 right now will get almost checkered 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.660
 They are going to give you an account when 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.879
 let's have there and last is indicating 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.769
 exactly where is the plane from 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.150
 last night it 's there in the vineyard 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.580
 going through the top part well that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.459
 is the size of the plane very small and the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.920
 object as seen in the bottom 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.500
 It has an impressive luminosity but 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.730
 as I tell you, it came with a luminosity 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.989
 much much greater possibly about 4 or 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.440
 5 times what I am showing you and 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:53.130
 moved east 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.740
 from the city ​​of mexico by the end of 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.900
 those of the municipalities conurbated with the 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.990
 state of mexico possibly I am 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.980
 here in Atizapán this object was aimed 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:08.470
 towards a tepozotlán 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.470
 to the east of the city 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.190
 and it's going through the top of 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.550
 Lake of Guadalupe 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.330
 this happened at 7:20 pm on the night of 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.450
 day 13 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.190
 in February 2003 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.980
 good 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.470
 I am cotton and roll and until next time 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 we are 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.170
 if you like videos subscribe and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.810
 so we can put more material of the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.850
 that we are capturing us or others 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.560
 collaborators of us 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.560
 we do not have another person
