molecular experimentation right in the
proximity<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.649> experimental<00:00:35.370> setup<00:00:36.320> my

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
proximity of our experimental setup my

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.530 
proximity of our experimental setup my
Master's<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> hear<00:00:38.760> about<00:00:39.000> sensing<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
Master's I was a hear about sensing of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
Master's I was a hear about sensing of
coral<00:00:39.780> reefs<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.260> looking<00:00:41.070> at<00:00:41.219> coral<00:00:41.489> reefs

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
coral reefs so looking at coral reefs

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.990 
coral reefs so looking at coral reefs
and<00:00:41.790> satellite<00:00:42.270> sensors<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.430> one<00:00:44.430> thing<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
and satellite sensors and one thing I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
and satellite sensors and one thing I
came<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.480> kind<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.840> discover<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> not

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
came to kind of discover was that not

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
came to kind of discover was that not
enough<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.030> knowing<00:00:48.239> about<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.750> much

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
enough is really knowing about them much

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
enough is really knowing about them much
smaller<00:00:49.920> scale<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> idea<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.480> doing<00:00:51.539> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
smaller scale so the idea of doing this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.170 
smaller scale so the idea of doing this
project<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.500> ready<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.030> them

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
project was ready to to work with them

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
project was ready to to work with them
when<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.329> saw<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.660> smaller<00:00:55.050> scale<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.710> really

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
when i saw the smaller scale to really

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.910 
when i saw the smaller scale to really
understand<00:00:56.370> how<00:00:56.550> light<00:00:56.789> interacts<00:00:57.270> reports

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
understand how light interacts reports

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.439 
understand how light interacts reports
so<00:00:58.920> having<00:00:59.100> access<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.820> coral<00:01:00.329> reef

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
so having access to the coral reef

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
so having access to the coral reef
aquarium<00:01:00.899> here<00:01:01.079> at<00:01:01.170> knox<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.710> invaluable<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
aquarium here at knox is invaluable to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.579 
aquarium here at knox is invaluable to
my<00:01:02.550> project<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.449> enables<00:01:04.350> me<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
my project because it enables me to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
my project because it enables me to
really<00:01:04.949> work<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.460> curls<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.970> day-to-day

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really work with curls in a day-to-day

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
really work with curls in a day-to-day
basis<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.170> i<00:01:07.229> can<00:01:07.439> run<00:01:07.650> both<00:01:08.040> short<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
basis and i can run both short and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.000 
basis and i can run both short and
long-term<00:01:08.790> experiments<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.350> how

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
long-term experiments to really see how

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.240 
long-term experiments to really see how
the<00:01:11.850> clothes<00:01:12.090> change<00:01:12.570> over<00:01:12.930> time<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> i<00:01:14.070> can

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the clothes change over time and i can

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.280 
the clothes change over time and i can
also<00:01:14.369> manipulate<00:01:14.670> different<00:01:15.570> environmental

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
also manipulate different environmental

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
also manipulate different environmental
factors<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.130> how<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.490> affects<00:01:17.820> how

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
factors to see how that affects how

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.450 
factors to see how that affects how
crows<00:01:18.330> use<00:01:18.570> light<00:01:18.840> i<00:01:19.250> think<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.340> particular

crows use light i think in particular

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
crows use light i think in particular
what<00:01:20.850> drew<00:01:21.060> me<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.509> particular<00:01:22.020> PhD

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
what drew me to do this particular PhD

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.320 
what drew me to do this particular PhD
is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> ability<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.880> learn<00:01:24.000> some<00:01:24.210> new

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
is the ability to learn some new

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
is the ability to learn some new
techniques<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> lab<00:01:25.049> say<00:01:25.490> specifically

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
techniques in the lab say specifically

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
techniques in the lab say specifically
molecular<00:01:26.939> biological<00:01:27.240> techniques<00:01:27.780> which

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
molecular biological techniques which

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
molecular biological techniques which
have<00:01:28.049> always<00:01:28.409> there<00:01:28.650> been<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.310> interest<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.640> me

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
have always there been of interest to me

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.890 
have always there been of interest to me
and<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.119> till<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.299> i<00:01:30.420> haven't<00:01:30.630> had<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> chance

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
and up till now i haven't had the chance

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.410 
and up till now i haven't had the chance
to<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.530> many<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.520> those<00:01:32.640> skills<00:01:33.270> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to you many of those skills in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.819 
to you many of those skills in
particular<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.229> what<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.590> drew<00:01:34.799> me

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
particular so that's what really drew me

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.069 
particular so that's what really drew me
in<00:01:35.729> addition<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.329> i<00:01:36.360> also<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.869> quite<00:01:37.049> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
in addition to that i also have quite a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.990 
in addition to that i also have quite a
lot<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.259> experience<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.829> corals<00:01:38.460> previously

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
lot of experience with corals previously

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
lot of experience with corals previously
so<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.509> nice<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> try<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.020> combine<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> two

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so it's nice to try and combine the two

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.789 
so it's nice to try and combine the two
things<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.460> obviously<00:01:41.970> being<00:01:42.240> able<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.799> get

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
things so obviously being able to get

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
things so obviously being able to get
hands-on<00:01:44.100> experience<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.520> corals<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.119> have

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
hands-on experience with corals and have

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.810 
hands-on experience with corals and have
them<00:01:45.540> available<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.560> use<00:01:46.920> within<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.430> research

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
them available to use within my research

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.149 
them available to use within my research
is<00:01:48.119> absolutely<00:01:48.689> critical<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.259> from<00:01:50.040> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
is absolutely critical and from that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.980 
is absolutely critical and from that
point<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.460> view<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.970> use<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.450> aquarium<00:01:51.899> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
point of view the use of the aquarium is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.609 
point of view the use of the aquarium is

coral reefs are threatened all over the
planet<00:01:57.210> they're<00:01:58.200> often<00:01:58.590> fatal<00:01:58.830> coral

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
planet they're often fatal coral

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.340 
planet they're often fatal coral
bleaching<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.390> major<00:02:00.600> drivers<00:02:00.960> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
bleaching is one of the major drivers of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.609 
bleaching is one of the major drivers of
coral<00:02:01.799> reef<00:02:01.979> decline<00:02:02.600> our<00:02:03.600> research<00:02:04.290> found

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
coral reef decline our research found

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
coral reef decline our research found
however<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.220> improving<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.119> water<00:02:06.330> quality

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
however that improving the water quality

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.960 
however that improving the water quality
can<00:02:07.170> make<00:02:07.409> corals<00:02:07.860> more<00:02:08.190> resilient<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can make corals more resilient to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.179 
can make corals more resilient to
bleaching

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.319 

so<00:02:15.189> what<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.579> see<00:02:15.849> here<00:02:15.879> is<00:02:16.299> the

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
so what you can see here is the

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.110 
so what you can see here is the
fluorescence<00:02:17.139> of<00:02:17.319> corals<00:02:17.769> so<00:02:18.249> they<00:02:18.430> glow<00:02:18.849> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
fluorescence of corals so they glow in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.869 
fluorescence of corals so they glow in
this<00:02:19.269> beautiful<00:02:19.829> orange<00:02:20.829> red<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.310> green

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
this beautiful orange red and green

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.550 
this beautiful orange red and green
color<00:02:22.209> so<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.689> we<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.989> green<00:02:23.290> bit

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
color so here we have a green bit

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.550 
color so here we have a green bit
there's<00:02:23.829> the<00:02:24.180> orange<00:02:25.180> color<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.139> those<00:02:26.319> are

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
there's the orange color and those are

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.080 
there's the orange color and those are
fluorescent<00:02:26.859> proteins<00:02:27.579> and<00:02:27.790> they<00:02:27.879> are<00:02:27.999> very

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
fluorescent proteins and they are very

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.599 
fluorescent proteins and they are very
important<00:02:28.930> tools<00:02:29.170> for<00:02:29.349> biomedical<00:02:29.950> research

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
important tools for biomedical research

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.179 
important tools for biomedical research
so<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.420> use<00:02:31.719> them<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.170> light<00:02:32.409> up<00:02:32.620> tumor

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
so you can use them to light up tumor

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.550 
so you can use them to light up tumor
cells<00:02:33.489> for<00:02:33.790> example<00:02:33.879> so<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.870> what<00:02:35.049> our<00:02:35.230> lab<00:02:35.530> is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
cells for example so in what our lab is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.759 
cells for example so in what our lab is
doing<00:02:36.069> that<00:02:36.189> we<00:02:36.370> screen<00:02:36.819> for<00:02:36.849> novel<00:02:37.769> proteins

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
doing that we screen for novel proteins

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.670 
doing that we screen for novel proteins
with<00:02:38.980> exciting<00:02:39.579> properties<00:02:40.150> for<00:02:40.840> research

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
with exciting properties for research

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.069 
with exciting properties for research
applications<00:02:42.389> the<00:02:43.389> national<00:02:43.780> shopping

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
applications the national shopping

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.629 
applications the national shopping
center<00:02:44.349> is<00:02:44.439> obviously<00:02:44.739> part<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:45.310> the

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
center is obviously part of the

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.220 
center is obviously part of the
University<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.150> Southampton<00:02:46.389> as<00:02:46.930> well<00:02:47.109> as

so<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.930> facilities<00:02:50.349> here<00:02:50.379> are<00:02:50.939> second<00:02:51.939> to

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:51.969 
so the facilities here are second to

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.390 
so the facilities here are second to
none<00:02:52.030> really<00:02:52.389> as<00:02:52.659> far<00:02:52.870> as<00:02:52.989> the<00:02:53.169> national<00:02:54.099> and

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
none really as far as the national and

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.459 
none really as far as the national and
international<00:02:55.030> concerns<00:02:55.449> so<00:02:55.780> if<00:02:56.290> you're

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
international concerns so if you're

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.449 
international concerns so if you're
looking<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:56.709> somewhere<00:02:57.010> where<00:02:57.219> you're<00:02:57.310> going

looking for somewhere where you're going

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.860 
looking for somewhere where you're going
to<00:02:57.519> have<00:02:57.609> the<00:02:57.699> expertise<00:02:58.120> both<00:02:58.329> in<00:02:58.510> teaching

indeed your undergraduate or any other
form<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.099> postgraduate<00:03:09.489> teaching<00:03:09.969> so<00:03:10.599> we<00:03:10.750> have

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
form of postgraduate teaching so we have

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.500 
form of postgraduate teaching so we have
world-class<00:03:11.680> facilities<00:03:12.669> down<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:13.329> so<00:03:13.480> we

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
world-class facilities down here so we

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.479 
world-class facilities down here so we
have<00:03:13.719> molecular<00:03:14.079> labs<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.799> have<00:03:14.980> imaging

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
have molecular labs we have imaging

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.729 
have molecular labs we have imaging
facilities<00:03:16.090> we<00:03:16.329> have<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.689> mass<00:03:16.870> spectrometry

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
facilities we have to mass spectrometry

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.390 
facilities we have to mass spectrometry
in<00:03:17.919> reach<00:03:18.189> so<00:03:18.699> this<00:03:18.909> allows<00:03:19.060> us<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.509> do<00:03:19.840> our<00:03:20.400> wet

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
in reach so this allows us to do our wet

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.420 
in reach so this allows us to do our wet
experiments<00:03:22.299> on<00:03:22.449> side<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.229> then<00:03:23.680> analyze<00:03:24.220> the
