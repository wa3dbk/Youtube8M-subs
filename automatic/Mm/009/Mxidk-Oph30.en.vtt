00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.850
 and hello everyone and welcome once more 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.560
 to a new flight tutor session in 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.080
 this session we are going to define the strength 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.480
 centripetal and centrifugal and we'll see a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.190
 basic way how the turns affect 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 the forces acting on an airplane 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.790
 first let's define the radius and the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.520
 turning regime 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.590
 the turning radius is defined as the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.270
 distance from the plane that is in 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.579
 turn to the center of the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.219
 imaginary circumference 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.800
 On the other hand, the steering regime is 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.559
 defined as the speed with which the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.140
 airplane rotates on an imaginary axis 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.329
 vertical for example if our plane 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.149
 rotate at a ratio of 3 degrees for each 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.430
 second let's complete the 360 ​​degrees 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.560
 of the circumference in two minutes and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.510
 therefore we can say that our 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 Turning rate is two minutes 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.740
 It should be emphasized that this three- regime 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.030
 degrees per second is called regime 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 standard for small aircraft 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.510
 if we keep our I see it constant 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.850
 we will observe that at higher speed we are going 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.560
 to obtain a higher rate of turn and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.140
 our radius and turn will increase 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.540
 On the other hand, if we reduce 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.509
 our speed our regime 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.159
 turn will decrease and in turn we will 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.920
 be able to have a smaller turning radius 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.719
 the latter is something very important that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.729
 we must take into account especially 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.619
 when we are maneuvering in zones 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.799
 where we have obstacles to our 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.799
 around 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.360
 Now let's define what the force is 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.760
 centripetal and centrifugal 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.910
 originally if we to the sphere 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.110
 that we show you apply a force 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.360
 it will continue with a trajectory 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 straight unless we apply it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.040
 another force to change direction 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.860
 if this sphere now we hold it with 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.780
 a rope the rope will generate a 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.629
 force that will prevent the sphere 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.370
 continue in a straight direction and it will be 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.370
 that follows a circular path 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.840
 this force that somehow attracts 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.760
 the sphere at the center of the circle 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.760
 it is called centripetal force 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.550
 if we now remember the third law of 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.379
 Newton where we are told that every action 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.230
 has a reaction of the same magnitude 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.090
 but in the opposite direction let's see 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.129
 that the sphere is going to experience another 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.080
 strength that makes this one want 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.420
 move away from the center of the circle 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.360
 This force is called strength 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.360
 centrifuge and as you can see there is a 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.920
 strength that we are generating 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.830
 directly but rather it is a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.330
 reaction to the generated centripetal force 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.330
 originally by the rope 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.200
 knowing the above we can define 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.720
 the forces that act on an airplane 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.070
 during the turn when the plane 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 maintains a straight path and 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.590
 leveled let's have the lift 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.970
 and to the weight as shown in the figure 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.160
 however when we start our 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.350
 turn things change 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.080
 now the support is going to be divided into 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.180
 two components one vertical which is the 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.460
 that keeps us flying and another 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.050
 horizontal that will act as the 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.880
 rope tied to the sphere of the blade 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.830
 earlier and that will make the plane 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.960
 want to go to the center of our 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.380
 trip or what would be our strength 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.380
 centripetal 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.430
 on the other hand we are going to have the weight that 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.740
 always goes to the center of the earth 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.530
 but now we're going to have a 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.540
 additional force generated as a reaction 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.610
 to the horizontal vector of lift 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.690
 and that would be our strength 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.209
 centrifuge 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.400
 the sum of the weight and this force 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.739
 additional centrifuge will generate a 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.260
 total component greater than we had 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.330
 originally generated only by the 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.930
 weight when we were flying straight and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.930
 leveled 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.030
 observing a little more in detail about 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.370
 the last two forces generated at 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.830
 moment of the turn we will be able to define 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.750
 to the load factor as the sum of the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.590
 forces generated by the weight and 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.590
 centrifugal force 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.919
 let's see that this load factor 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.440
 generated in turn will make the 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.750
 plane we experience a force 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.639
 greater than the gravity the greater 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.139
 be the turn as we can see in the 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.419
 figure 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:02.849
 where for example as a turn of 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.099
 60 degrees let's experience a 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.090
 Total force equivalent to 2 severity is 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.090
 and so on 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.259
 and how the load factor affects the 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:20.629
 loss we see this quickly with a 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.039
 graphic in which we will be able to see that 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.440
 as our load factor 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.510
 increases our speed of loss 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.730
 it will also increase 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.340
 therefore if we are in a turn 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.830
 we must be very careful with our 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.230
 speed since we could be surprised 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.540
 in a not very pleasant way when entering 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.400
 loss at a speed greater than 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.230
 normal loss speed when 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.230
 we are flying straight and level 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.600
 one last concept that I would like 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.390
 explain in a basic way is the 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.700
 famous coffin corner 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.130
 as we fly higher 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.690
 our true speed is greater and 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.880
 additionally our speed of 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.040
 loss is also increasing since 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.540
 while we ascend the air has lower 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.060
 amount of air molecules for 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.860
 hold the plane and therefore we must 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.360
 fly at a higher speed to be able to 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.669
 compensate for this 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.319
 will reach a point where you no longer 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.060
 we can fly faster because 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.310
 we could exceed the maximum speed 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.159
 to which structurally the aircraft is 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.229
 certificate and therefore neither 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.969
 we can do maneuvers like trips and 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.400
 that the lost speed will increase 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:35.800
 even more so he left us a margin 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.199
 very low to maneuver and if we do not have 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.770
 careful we can go into loss of a 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.770
 very easy way 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:54.990
 in this session we have seen what is the 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:57.540
 radio and the steering regime 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.050
 how they define the centripetal force and 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.050
 centrifuge 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.160
 what is the load factor and how does it affect 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.160
 the flight of the plane 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:13.229
 and finally we took a quick look at 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.229
 what is the corner border 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:23.209
 now we have reviewed the load factor 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.849
 in the case of a constant turn and 

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:27.830
 keep them level however 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:29.749
 There are other types of situations in 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.500
 which also the load factor is 

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:34.840
 something that we must take into account 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.480
 how do you think the load factor can 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.840
 additionally affect us in other phases 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.840
 Of flight
