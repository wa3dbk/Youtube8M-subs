dumpster door whatever cuz I thought it
was<00:01:28.980> cool<00:01:30.920> problem<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.010> I<00:01:32.190> couldn't<00:01:32.370> get<00:01:32.550> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
was cool problem is I couldn't get the

was cool problem is I couldn't get the
record<00:01:32.940> players<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.390> work<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.440> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
record players to work that I had the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
record players to work that I had the
needles<00:01:34.860> were<00:01:34.950> bad<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.430> don't<00:01:35.700> really

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
needles were bad and one I don't really

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.560 
needles were bad and one I don't really
have<00:01:36.060> any<00:01:36.210> records<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.400> rigged<00:01:39.330> up<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
have any records so I rigged up the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.520 
have any records so I rigged up the
wiring<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.080> several<00:01:40.970> adapters<00:01:42.260> that<00:01:43.260> I<00:01:43.350> could

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
wiring of several adapters that I could

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.970 
wiring of several adapters that I could
run<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.070> standard<00:01:45.530> one<00:01:46.530> 8<00:01:46.940> speaker<00:01:47.940> jack<00:01:48.980> which

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
run a standard one 8 speaker jack which

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.710 
run a standard one 8 speaker jack which
is<00:01:50.010> stereo<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.330> I've<00:01:51.540> got<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.810> splitter<00:01:52.580> to

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
is stereo which I've got the splitter to

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710 
is stereo which I've got the splitter to
on<00:01:54.720> RCA<00:01:55.190> splitter<00:01:56.190> which<00:01:56.400> goes<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.480> one

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
on RCA splitter which goes to and one

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.020 
on RCA splitter which goes to and one
which<00:01:58.260> is<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.530> stereo<00:01:59.100> into<00:01:59.400> one<00:01:59.580> for<00:01:59.850> mono

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
which is the stereo into one for mono

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.930 
which is the stereo into one for mono
and<00:02:00.420> I've<00:02:01.110> got<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.380> rigged<00:02:01.620> up<00:02:01.710> with<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.920> wire<00:02:02.160> it

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
and I've got it rigged up with a wire it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.730 
and I've got it rigged up with a wire it
goes<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.270> input<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.900> underside<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
goes the input on the underside of this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.770 
goes the input on the underside of this
there<00:02:05.370> might<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.550> an<00:02:05.730> easier<00:02:06.060> adapter<00:02:06.570> than

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
there might be an easier adapter than

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.830 
there might be an easier adapter than
all<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.470> but<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:08.159> couldn't<00:02:08.879> find<00:02:09.119> one<00:02:09.390> short

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
all these but I couldn't find one short

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.210 
all these but I couldn't find one short
notice<00:02:10.079> so<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.349> just<00:02:10.499> kind<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.739> put

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
notice so I just kind of put

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.260 
notice so I just kind of put
there<00:02:11.370> was<00:02:11.460> stuff<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.820> could<00:02:11.970> find<00:02:12.180> at

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
there was stuff I could find at

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.240 
there was stuff I could find at
RadioShack<00:02:13.310> but<00:02:14.310> anyway<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.790> plugs<00:02:15.660> into

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
RadioShack but anyway just plugs into

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:26.240 
RadioShack but anyway just plugs into
any<00:02:17.250> standard<00:02:19.790> yeah<00:02:20.960> are<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:23.180> there<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.270> go

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
laptop whatever I want so I hit play and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.970 
laptop whatever I want so I hit play and
will<00:02:36.660> turn<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.020> on<00:02:37.110> which<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.620> power<00:02:37.830> is

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
will turn it on which the power is

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.490 
will turn it on which the power is
integrated<00:02:38.820> in<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.970> treble<00:02:39.300> which<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.350> don't

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
integrated in the treble which I don't

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.750 
integrated in the treble which I don't
know<00:02:40.650> why<00:02:40.770> it's<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.220> volume<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
know why it's not on the volume but I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.550 
know why it's not on the volume but I
guess<00:02:41.910> it's<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.210> how<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:42.510> designed<00:02:42.660> the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
guess it's just how it's designed the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.020 
guess it's just how it's designed the
little<00:02:43.800> light<00:02:43.980> comes<00:02:44.340> on<00:02:44.550> with<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> tubes

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
little light comes on with the tubes

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.690 
little light comes on with the tubes
warm<00:02:45.330> up<00:02:47.360> which<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.810> easy<00:02:49.050> takes<00:02:49.380> 30<00:02:50.160> seconds<00:02:50.610> a

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
warm up which it easy takes 30 seconds a

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.570 
warm up which it easy takes 30 seconds a
minute<00:02:50.820> whatever<00:02:52.040> yeah<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.280> there<00:02:53.520> it
