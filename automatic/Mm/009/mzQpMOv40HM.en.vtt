00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
here's where the waterway it comes back

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.949 
here's where the waterway it comes back
around<00:04:11.410> curves<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.609> through<00:04:12.790> here<00:04:13.090> and

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
around curves in through here and

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.479 
around curves in through here and
there's<00:04:14.319> a<00:04:14.410> lot<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.709> it<00:04:14.859> makes<00:04:15.010> it<00:04:15.099> perfect<00:04:15.459> for

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:29.249 

and<00:04:25.770> over<00:04:26.770> here<00:04:26.919> it<00:04:27.009> gets<00:04:27.069> really<00:04:27.370> dense<00:04:28.259> and

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
and over here it gets really dense and

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:31.080 
and over here it gets really dense and
