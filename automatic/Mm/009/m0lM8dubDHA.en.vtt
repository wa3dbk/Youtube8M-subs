in<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> past<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:07.080> had<00:00:07.230> stretched<00:00:07.859> years

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
in the past I've had stretched years

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.879 
in the past I've had stretched years
called<00:00:09.179> it<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.450> think<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.750> like<00:00:09.809> 7/16<00:00:10.679> or<00:00:10.800> an

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
called it I think it was like 7/16 or an

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.259 
called it I think it was like 7/16 or an
inch<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.309> something<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.759> that

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
inch or something like that

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.120 
inch or something like that
when<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.480> was<00:00:12.599> younger<00:00:12.870> got<00:00:13.410> those<00:00:13.590> taken<00:00:13.980> out

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
when I was younger got those taken out

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490 
when I was younger got those taken out
and<00:00:14.460> they<00:00:14.549> didn't<00:00:14.759> heal<00:00:15.289> particularly<00:00:16.289> well

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
and they didn't heal particularly well

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.410 
and they didn't heal particularly well
but<00:00:16.980> then<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.279> also<00:00:17.430> had<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> dermal<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.090> my<00:00:18.180> face

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
but then I also had a dermal on my face

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.540 
but then I also had a dermal on my face
because<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.930> got<00:00:19.170> taken<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:19.949> that's

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
because it just got taken out and that's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.070 
because it just got taken out and that's
probably<00:00:21.090> why<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> clicked<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.900> video

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
probably why you clicked on this video

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380 
probably why you clicked on this video
so<00:00:22.710> I'm<00:00:22.800> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> show<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.130> exactly<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:24.359> it

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
so I'm going to show you exactly what it

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
so I'm going to show you exactly what it
was<00:00:24.510> like<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.500> then<00:00:25.619> exactly

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
was like to get it in and then exactly

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380 
was like to get it in and then exactly
what<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> get<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
what it's like to get it out so I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
what it's like to get it out so I
videotaped<00:00:27.570> both<00:00:28.050> those<00:00:28.260> experiences<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.220> I

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
videotaped both those experiences and I

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.620 
videotaped both those experiences and I
think<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> pretty<00:00:29.939> cool<00:00:30.269> what<00:00:30.390> kind<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
think that pretty cool what kind of

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
think that pretty cool what kind of
shows<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
shows you just kind of if you have a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.819 
shows you just kind of if you have a
irrational<00:00:33.000> fear<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:34.020> piercings<00:00:34.530> or

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
irrational fear of like piercings or

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.049 
irrational fear of like piercings or
something<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> still<00:00:35.520> want<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.700> do<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059

could do it and I don't think it's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.540 
could do it and I don't think it's
particularly<00:02:06.990> maple<00:02:07.470> at<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.710> other<00:02:08.310> than<00:02:08.459> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
particularly maple at all other than I
