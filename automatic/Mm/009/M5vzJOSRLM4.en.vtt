then you're going to feed the wiring
through<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> cable<00:00:25.769> management<00:00:25.920> system

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
through the cable management system

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.730 
through the cable management system
towards<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> front<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> cart<00:00:27.740> sometimes

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
towards the front of the cart sometimes

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.609 
towards the front of the cart sometimes
it's<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.789> helpful<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.210> keep<00:00:31.050> one<00:00:31.349> end<00:00:31.529> of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's a it's helpful to keep one end of

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.979 
it's a it's helpful to keep one end of
the<00:00:31.769> cable<00:00:31.890> management<00:00:32.189> system<00:00:32.399> tightened<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the cable management system tightened so

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.740 
the cable management system tightened so
that<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> stays<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.649> secure<00:00:35.040> finally<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that it stays more secure finally and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.180 
that it stays more secure finally and
just<00:00:36.780> tighten<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.440> cable<00:00:37.829> management<00:00:37.980> system

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
just tighten the cable management system

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.740 
just tighten the cable management system
so<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.760> move<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> front<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.540> cart

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
so we can move to the front of the cart

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
so we can move to the front of the cart
so<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.620> front<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> cart<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:41.550> going

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so at the front of the cart we're going

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.250 
so at the front of the cart we're going
to<00:00:41.820> find<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> cord<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.420> just<00:00:42.600> fed<00:00:42.780> through<00:00:43.050> and
