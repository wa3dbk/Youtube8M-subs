really bad pink to it i think my ping is
somewhere<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.289> 200<00:00:28.949> range<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.670> i<00:00:30.320> usually

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
somewhere in the 200 range and i usually

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.560 
somewhere in the 200 range and i usually
play<00:00:31.560> without<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.859> minecraft<00:00:32.369> server<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
play without a minecraft server but it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.299 
play without a minecraft server but it
is<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.989> bad<00:00:34.559> because<00:00:35.070> you're<00:00:35.219> not

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
is really that bad because you're not

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.790 
is really that bad because you're not
doing<00:00:35.700> pvp<00:00:35.940> too<00:00:36.420> much<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.410> you're<00:00:37.530> doing

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
doing pvp too much but when you're doing

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.549 
doing pvp too much but when you're doing
pvp<00:00:38.270> ping<00:00:39.270> makes<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.780> big<00:00:40.110> difference

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
pvp ping makes a big difference

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
pvp ping makes a big difference
paintings<00:00:41.520> essentially<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> amount<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.450> time

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
paintings essentially the amount of time

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
paintings essentially the amount of time
it<00:00:42.629> takes<00:00:42.870> figure<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.829> hit<00:00:44.040> state<00:00:44.280> registered

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
it takes figure so hit state registered

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
it takes figure so hit state registered
on<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> server<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.690> someone<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.320> 10

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
on the server so someone has like 10

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
on the server so someone has like 10
millisecond<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.510> that<00:00:48.510> means<00:00:48.690> they're

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
millisecond thing that means they're

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.810 
millisecond thing that means they're
hits<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> register<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.829> 20<00:00:50.129> times<00:00:50.340> faster<00:00:50.430> than

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
hits a register in 20 times faster than

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.790 
hits a register in 20 times faster than
mine<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.690> while<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.140> might<00:00:52.289> not<00:00:52.350> seem<00:00:52.739> like

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
mine so while it might not seem like

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.799 
mine so while it might not seem like
that<00:00:52.949> much<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.340> i<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.579> near<00:00:53.760> ppl<00:00:54.420> told<00:00:54.600> someone

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that much of i go near ppl told someone

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.410 
that much of i go near ppl told someone
and<00:00:55.079> i'll<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.070> absolutely<00:00:56.460> annihilated<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and i'll get absolutely annihilated and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
and i'll get absolutely annihilated and
it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> bit<00:00:58.800> annoying<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.430> makes<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
it is a bit annoying and it makes it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.430 
it is a bit annoying and it makes it
really<00:00:59.879> hard<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> get<00:01:00.329> games<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.809> mean<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.170> think

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
really hard to get games I mean I think

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.620 
really hard to get games I mean I think
I'm<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.520> 40<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:04.460> kills<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.760> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I'm in that like top 40 of kills and I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.200 
I'm in that like top 40 of kills and I
think<00:01:06.810> I'm<00:01:06.900> like<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> 1.5<00:01:07.619> k<00:01:08.460> d<00:01:08.520> or<00:01:08.790> something<00:01:09.119> on

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
think I'm like a 1.5 k d or something on

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
think I'm like a 1.5 k d or something on
this<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.900> when<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.110> comes<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> winning<00:01:10.590> games

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
this but when it comes to winning games

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
this but when it comes to winning games
consistently<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.760> can't<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
consistently I just can't do it just

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.810 
consistently I just can't do it just
because<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.799> PvP<00:01:14.280> battles<00:01:14.310> i<00:01:14.670> get

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
because of the the PvP battles i get

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.030 
because of the the PvP battles i get
into<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.330> lag<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.170> holds<00:01:16.409> me<00:01:16.500> back<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.860> much

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
into the lag just holds me back so much

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
into the lag just holds me back so much

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
end up my death so I have to have to
play<00:01:42.020> tactically<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.890> bad

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
play tactically and if you do have a bad

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.160 
play tactically and if you do have a bad
connection<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.640> mine<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.240> bad<00:01:45.780> connection<00:01:45.990> i

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
connection like mine a bad connection i

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.870 
connection like mine a bad connection i
probably<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.560> consider<00:01:46.829> any<00:01:46.979> war<00:01:47.220> from

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
probably would consider any war from

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.780 
probably would consider any war from
like<00:01:48.030> 120<00:01:48.630> paying<00:01:48.840> above<00:01:49.110> i<00:01:49.700> really<00:01:50.700> would

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
like 120 paying above i really would

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.389 
like 120 paying above i really would
have<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.479> grab<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> bow<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.799> practice

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
have a just to grab a bow and practice

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.080 
have a just to grab a bow and practice
bow<00:01:53.610> shots<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:55.350> hard<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.880> lag

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
bow shots and it's hard because the lag

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.179 
bow shots and it's hard because the lag
means<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.409> compensate<00:01:58.799> for

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
means that you have to compensate for

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
means that you have to compensate for
that<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.549> end<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.420> you'll<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> eat

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that on your end so you'll have to eat

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.510 
that on your end so you'll have to eat
your<00:02:01.290> shots<00:02:01.590> sort<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> wrong

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
your shots sort of in the wrong

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.370 
your shots sort of in the wrong
direction<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:03.360> because<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> lag<00:02:04.110> they'll

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
direction but because of the lag they'll

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.749 
direction but because of the lag they'll
be<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:04.920> direction<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.579> makes

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
be in the right direction if that makes

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.169 
be in the right direction if that makes
sense<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.869> that's<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:08.129> honestly<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.910> best

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
sense so that's that's honestly my best

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.790 
sense so that's that's honestly my best
tactic<00:02:09.569> right<00:02:09.750> now<00:02:09.869> i'm<00:02:10.080> not<00:02:10.229> sure<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.619> else

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
tactic right now i'm not sure what else

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360 
tactic right now i'm not sure what else
happens<00:02:11.190> but<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.090> go<00:02:12.120> into<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
happens but if I go into a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.140 
happens but if I go into a
1v1<00:02:13.840> fight<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:15.049> someone<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:17.030> have

i am dead and regardless of the you know
you<00:02:24.379> can<00:02:24.590> put<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.830> best<00:02:25.010> pvp<00:02:25.220> r<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.760> there<00:02:25.970> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
you can put the best pvp r in there in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.649 
you can put the best pvp r in there in
the<00:02:26.269> world<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.720> he'd<00:02:26.989> still<00:02:27.200> die<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:29.330> right

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
the world and he'd still die so right

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.240 
the world and he'd still die so right
now<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.079> bit<00:02:30.290> connection<00:02:30.890> based<00:02:31.040> which

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
now it is a bit connection based which

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.809 
now it is a bit connection based which
kinda<00:02:31.519> sucks<00:02:31.690> but<00:02:33.129> again<00:02:34.129> as<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.340> said<00:02:34.370> once<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
kinda sucks but again as I said once a

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.699 
kinda sucks but again as I said once a
European<00:02:35.209> server<00:02:35.360> come<00:02:35.569> up<00:02:35.720> all<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.470> should

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
European server come up all that should

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.319 
European server come up all that should
be<00:02:36.799> fixed<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.370> hopefully<00:02:37.940> we'll<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.209> alright

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
be fixed and hopefully we'll be alright

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.110 
be fixed and hopefully we'll be alright
so<00:02:38.930> what<00:02:39.079> my<00:02:39.620> general<00:02:40.040> plan<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.489> just<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:40.819> scout

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
so what my general plan is just to scout

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.630 
so what my general plan is just to scout
out<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.540> area<00:02:41.989> Simon<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:43.099> like<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.549> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
out the area Simon and I like just a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.509 
out the area Simon and I like just a
whole<00:02:43.819> Dinah<00:02:44.030> center<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.599> map<00:02:45.340> or<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
whole Dinah center of the map or the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.830 
whole Dinah center of the map or the
majority<00:02:46.879> of<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> traffic<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.750> just

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
majority of the traffic is and just

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.690 
majority of the traffic is and just
paying<00:02:48.109> people<00:02:48.319> off<00:02:48.530> in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.739> distance<00:02:48.890> when<00:02:49.670> I

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
paying people off in the distance when I

paying people off in the distance when I
play<00:02:49.970> survival<00:02:50.900> games<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.290> don't<00:02:51.590> like<00:02:51.680> sitting

play survival games I don't like sitting
in<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.910> corner<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.420> waiting<00:02:53.840> until<00:02:53.930> there's

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
in a corner and waiting until there's

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.170 
in a corner and waiting until there's
one<00:02:54.410> person<00:02:54.620> left<00:02:54.920> all<00:02:55.280> mostly<00:02:55.640> we<00:02:55.849> do<00:02:55.970> that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
one person left all mostly we do that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.970 
one person left all mostly we do that
you're<00:02:56.810> not<00:02:57.140> playing<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.620> game<00:02:57.650> correctly

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
you're not playing the game correctly

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.759 
you're not playing the game correctly
yeah<00:02:58.730> well<00:02:58.940> yeah<00:02:59.359> it's<00:03:00.019> arguable<00:03:00.590> but

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
yeah well yeah it's arguable but

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.110 
yeah well yeah it's arguable but
honestly<00:03:01.099> just<00:03:01.280> takes<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.579> fun<00:03:01.819> out<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.000> it

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
honestly just takes the fun out of it

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.509 
honestly just takes the fun out of it
when<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.359> sit<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.629> corner<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.079> you<00:03:03.920> know

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
when you sit in the corner and you know

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.280 
when you sit in the corner and you know
I<00:03:04.579> did<00:03:04.790> get<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:04.970> lot<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.150> kills<00:03:05.359> this<00:03:05.480> key<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.260> I

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
I did get a lot of kills this key so I

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.970 
I did get a lot of kills this key so I
do<00:03:06.440> consider<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.099> decent<00:03:07.250> game<00:03:07.549> um<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.560> i

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
do consider it a decent game um and I i

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.849 
do consider it a decent game um and I i
think<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:12.019> know<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.140> get<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.470> lot<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.620> people

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
think you know you get a lot of people

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.080 
think you know you get a lot of people
who<00:03:12.950> win<00:03:13.129> these<00:03:13.250> games<00:03:13.310> he's<00:03:13.730> in<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.940> corner

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
who win these games he's in the corner

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.399 
who win these games he's in the corner
and<00:03:14.239> wait<00:03:14.390> until<00:03:14.540> there's<00:03:14.840> one<00:03:14.959> person<00:03:15.140> left

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
and wait until there's one person left

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.289 
and wait until there's one person left
and<00:03:15.650> then<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:15.920> ambush<00:03:16.280> them<00:03:16.459> which<00:03:17.030> kind<00:03:17.239> of

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
and then just ambush them which kind of

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.390 
and then just ambush them which kind of
sucks<00:03:17.540> because<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:18.139> know<00:03:18.769> you<00:03:19.160> want<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
sucks because you know you want the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.559 
sucks because you know you want the
winner<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.700> be<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.880> person<00:03:20.090> who<00:03:20.180> plays<00:03:20.329> the

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
winner to be the person who plays the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.759 
winner to be the person who plays the
best<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:20.900> obviously<00:03:21.169> it's<00:03:21.349> not<00:03:21.410> always<00:03:21.650> like

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
best but obviously it's not always like

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.580 
best but obviously it's not always like
that<00:03:21.889> in<00:03:22.099> survival<00:03:22.489> games<00:03:22.669> um<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:23.750> just<00:03:24.530> see

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
that in survival games um I just see

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.960 
that in survival games um I just see
someone's<00:03:24.829> died<00:03:25.069> here<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.489> think<00:03:25.700> towards

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
someone's died here and I think towards

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.069 
someone's died here and I think towards
the<00:03:26.060> end<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.239> the<00:03:26.299> game<00:03:26.359> when<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.750> do<00:03:26.870> kill

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
the end of the game when you do kill

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.449 
the end of the game when you do kill
people<00:03:27.380> they<00:03:27.410> just<00:03:27.680> leave<00:03:27.919> the<00:03:28.099> litter

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
people they just leave the litter

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.309 
people they just leave the litter
because<00:03:28.639> they<00:03:29.540> haven't<00:03:29.690> got<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.930> time<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.139> go

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
because they haven't got the time to go

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.539

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
just because my screen isn't updating

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.180 
just because my screen isn't updating
because<00:04:11.359> it<00:04:11.750> hasn't<00:04:12.109> received<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.739> data<00:04:12.949> from

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
because it hasn't received the data from

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.280 
because it hasn't received the data from
the<00:04:13.280> Soviet<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:13.910> when<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.690> data<00:04:14.870> does<00:04:15.049> come

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
the Soviet and when the data does come

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.110 
the Soviet and when the data does come
it<00:04:15.410> just<00:04:15.560> updates<00:04:15.709> at<00:04:15.980> all<00:04:16.070> so<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.820> get<00:04:17.030> like

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
it just updates at all so I get like

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.330 
it just updates at all so I get like
three<00:04:17.359> or<00:04:17.449> four<00:04:17.510> hits<00:04:17.810> on<00:04:17.989> me<00:04:18.139> from<00:04:18.680> one<00:04:18.949> hit<00:04:19.130> on

three or four hits on me from one hit on
my<00:04:19.519> screen<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:20.419> it<00:04:20.479> kind<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.720> sucks<00:04:21.010> because<00:04:22.010> I

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
my screen so it kind of sucks because I

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.120 
my screen so it kind of sucks because I
really<00:04:22.580> have<00:04:22.969> no<00:04:23.090> chance<00:04:23.330> but<00:04:23.890> i'll<00:04:24.890> make<00:04:25.039> the

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
best of it and again the bow is

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.029 
best of it and again the bow is

the end of the game here and you know

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.380 
the end of the game here and you know
the<00:07:04.900> map<00:07:05.050> slowly<00:07:05.440> closes<00:07:05.770> off<00:07:05.970> over<00:07:06.970> time<00:07:07.120> and

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
the map slowly closes off over time and

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.140 
the map slowly closes off over time and
I'm<00:07:07.630> kind<00:07:07.810> of<00:07:07.870> sitting<00:07:08.080> here<00:07:08.260> thinking<00:07:08.380> okay

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150 
I'm kind of sitting here thinking okay

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.850

where<00:07:10.150> is<00:07:10.330> the<00:07:10.480> center<00:07:10.690> of<00:07:10.810> the<00:07:10.960> map<00:07:11.110> and<00:07:11.770> I

where is the center of the map and I

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.140 
where is the center of the map and I
thought<00:07:12.070> the<00:07:12.190> center<00:07:12.430> of<00:07:12.460> the<00:07:12.610> map<00:07:12.760> was<00:07:12.910> done
