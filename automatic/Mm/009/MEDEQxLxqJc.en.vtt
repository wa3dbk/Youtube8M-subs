missing it storage rack right now but

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.620 
missing it storage rack right now but
mainly<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.790> took<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.150> off<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> we're

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
mainly because we took it off and we're

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.830 
mainly because we took it off and we're
gonna

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
gonna

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.190

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
reweld and paint it and you could see

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.969 
reweld and paint it and you could see
over<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:15.110> we<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.680> already

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
over here that we got it was already
