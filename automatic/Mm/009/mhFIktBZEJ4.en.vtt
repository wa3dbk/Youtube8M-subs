00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.720

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.289
 great landscape and inspiration is the brand 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 of our coffee unfortunately 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.610
 the agro-economic context that the 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.449
 country and specifically the conjuncture of the 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.120
 coffee makes us rethink this business of 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.980
 a raw material or a commodity that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.079
 is sold in the market and that 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.079
 unfortunately in the last 20 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.649

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.440
 why we decided to value a 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.620
 series of dreams that we have come 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.189

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.020
 developed a specialized company 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.750

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.060
 of coffee inside my farm and we made a 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.399
 great synergy 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.430
 is design in its function of these 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.140
 experiences come into participation with the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.140
 hacienda combia to create the project 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.320

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.390
 what is it is an experience is an immersion 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.149
 experiential in the cafe in which you go to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.649

 a basket maker will teach me how to extract 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.930
 the fibers of nature expressed 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.180
 in a bamboo so that with my hands I go to 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.780
 weave my own basket collector 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 coffee and a barista will teach me what is 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.560
 astringency that is body aroma acidity 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.959
 and how will I go out to the field to collect 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.510
 the fruits that I feel are going to 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.030
 seduce in my mouth in this way I'm going to 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.890
 pick coffee cherries and I'm going to 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.459
 collect the secrets that the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.470
 nature expresses in the landscape 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.020

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.630
 the secret of the earth and I will find the 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.850
 secrecy of flora and fauna as well 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.880
 as well as the animals that 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.990
 cohabitate with the cultivation of coffee 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.900

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.850
 a pendulum euro and the importance of 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.240
 the nests of the birds in the crop 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.240

 impose you contribute in the situation and that 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.500
 makes the experience stop being 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.650
 experience and become a 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.540
 experience here we want to exalt the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.870
