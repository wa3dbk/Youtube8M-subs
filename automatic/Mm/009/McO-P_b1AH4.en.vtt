00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
that runs around here and so it's a

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.610 
that runs around here and so it's a
matter<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.300> keeping<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.810> trim<00:03:14.080> keeping<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
matter of keeping it trim keeping it

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.280

down<00:03:14.860> tall<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.540> doesn't<00:03:16.840> have<00:03:16.989> to<00:03:17.170> be

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
down tall but it doesn't have to be

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.080 
down tall but it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.920> backyard<00:03:18.400> he<00:03:18.520> doesn't<00:03:18.880> care

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
perfect in the backyard he doesn't care

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.449 
perfect in the backyard he doesn't care
about<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.510> as<00:03:19.690> much<00:03:19.930> as<00:03:19.959> he<00:03:20.200> does<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:21.160> front

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459

yard the entertainment area and so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
yard the entertainment area and so
that's<00:03:24.910> why<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.270> do<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.540> extra<00:03:25.959> little<00:03:26.200> things
