00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
of these controllers which are RGB

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.900 
of these controllers which are RGB
controlled<00:00:14.700> us<00:00:14.820> again<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:16.520> I've<00:00:17.520> been<00:00:17.670> upon

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
it with all the strip life the 5 meter

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580 
it with all the strip life the 5 meter
of<00:00:20.160> strip<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> LED<00:00:21.180> strip<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.660> along<00:00:22.439> with

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
of strip the LED strip and along with

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.950 
of strip the LED strip and along with
one<00:00:22.800> controller<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.970> cost<00:00:24.180> me<00:00:24.300> about<00:00:24.330> 17

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
one controller it cost me about 17

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
one controller it cost me about 17
pounds<00:00:25.289> from<00:00:25.740> Amazon<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.539> from<00:00:27.779> UK

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
pounds from Amazon but that was from UK

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.990 
pounds from Amazon but that was from UK
itself<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.859> what<00:00:29.039> are<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.310> actually<00:00:29.490> about

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
itself so what are they actually about

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.600 
itself so what are they actually about
these<00:00:30.480> controller<00:00:31.070> individual<00:00:32.070> ones<00:00:32.279> which

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
these controller individual ones which

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.880 
these controller individual ones which
cost<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:32.969> about<00:00:33.059> one<00:00:33.360> pound<00:00:33.600> fifty<00:00:34.200> seventy

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
cost me about one pound fifty seventy

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340 
cost me about one pound fifty seventy
pounds<00:00:35.280> came<00:00:36.030> from<00:00:36.180> came<00:00:36.540> from<00:00:36.780> Hong<00:00:37.020> Kong

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350

came<00:01:02.640> along<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.840> controller<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:06.619> five

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
came along with one controller and five

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
hooked it up with the 12-volt power

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.800 
hooked it up with the 12-volt power
supply<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.790> buy<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.600> buy<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
if I hold we can fireballed 5volts world

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.310 
if I hold we can fireballed 5volts world
and<00:02:13.030> also<00:02:13.210> 24-volt<00:02:14.310> for<00:02:15.310> world<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.200> one

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
and also 24-volt for world so the one

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.770 
and also 24-volt for world so the one
which<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.680> bought<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> 12-volt<00:02:18.700> one<00:02:19.090> it's<00:02:19.690> a

these two buttons you see on the top
they<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.990> to<00:03:05.530> reduce<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.070> instant<00:03:06.610> intensity

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
they are to reduce the instant intensity

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.470 
they are to reduce the instant intensity
of<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.660> lightless<00:03:08.080> let's<00:03:08.650> put<00:03:09.550> it<00:03:09.670> in<00:03:09.820> I'm

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
of the lightless let's put it in I'm

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.650 
of the lightless let's put it in I'm
gonna<00:03:10.630> reduce<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.110> intensity<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.770> it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.260 

you<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.860> can<00:03:18.010> see<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.520> keep

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
you can you can see that just keep

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.770 
you can you can see that just keep
coming<00:03:19.600> down<00:03:20.850> that's<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:22.030> minimum<00:03:22.270> you<00:03:22.570> could

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
coming down that's the minimum you could

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.840 
coming down that's the minimum you could
do<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.680> that's<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.980> minimum<00:03:24.130> light<00:03:24.520> you<00:03:24.700> can

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
do so that's the minimum light you can

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.710 
do so that's the minimum light you can
do<00:03:25.000> it<00:03:25.150> what<00:03:25.300> from<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:27.400> camera<00:03:27.850> from<00:03:28.240> mobile

though it's just pretty good and these

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.030 
though it's just pretty good and these
are<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.100> DIY<00:04:21.280> ethics<00:04:21.790> these<00:04:22.060> are<00:04:22.210> simple

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
are the DIY ethics these are simple

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.160 
are the DIY ethics these are simple
functions<00:04:24.040> you<00:04:24.310> can<00:04:24.430> store<00:04:24.760> into<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.300> you<00:04:26.050> can

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
functions you can store into it you can

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.020 
functions you can store into it you can
store<00:04:26.470> whatever<00:04:26.650> action<00:04:27.340> you<00:04:27.430> wanted<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.880> do

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
store whatever action you wanted to do

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.300 
store whatever action you wanted to do
with<00:04:28.240> these<00:04:28.420> buttons<00:04:28.780> as<00:04:29.110> well<00:04:29.140> if<00:04:29.980> you<00:04:30.130> want

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
with these buttons as well if you want

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.860 
with these buttons as well if you want
other<00:04:30.490> one<00:04:30.670> it's<00:04:30.850> got<00:04:31.000> nothing<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.300> store<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.720> it

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
other one it's got nothing a store in it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.080 
other one it's got nothing a store in it
so<00:04:31.990> that's<00:04:32.169> why<00:04:32.290> it's<00:04:32.440> just<00:04:32.590> he<00:04:33.490> goes<00:04:33.760> gotta

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
so that's why it's just he goes gotta

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.920 
so that's why it's just he goes gotta
jump<00:04:34.390> more<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.690> selector<00:04:35.290> jump<00:04:35.590> on<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:36.930> three

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
jump more a selector jump on to three

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.430 
jump more a selector jump on to three
and<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.680> see<00:04:38.860> this<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.480> slowly<00:04:40.840> intense

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
and you see this so it slowly intense

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.560 
and you see this so it slowly intense
intensity<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.700> can<00:04:42.850> use<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.240> for<00:04:43.390> quite

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
intensity of it you can use it for quite

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.260 
intensity of it you can use it for quite
many<00:04:43.600> application<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:44.680> sort<00:04:44.950> of<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:46.000> sort

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270
