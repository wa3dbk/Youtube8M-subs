 a<00:00:02.899> mature<00:00:05.120> female<00:00:06.120> chicken<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:06.870> called<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
 a mature female chicken is called a

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.600 
 a mature female chicken is called a
hen<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:09.660> distance<00:00:10.170> between<00:00:10.349> two<00:00:10.889> numbers<00:00:11.340> is

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
hen the distance between two numbers is

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.140 
hen the distance between two numbers is
the<00:00:11.969> absolute<00:00:12.509> value<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.559> difference

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
the absolute value of the difference

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.859 
the absolute value of the difference
let's<00:00:15.150> think<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.049> means<00:00:17.869> difference

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
let's think what that means difference

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.950 
let's think what that means difference
means<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.590> subtract<00:00:21.619> absolute<00:00:22.619> value<00:00:23.130> means

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
means we subtract absolute value means

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.550 
means we subtract absolute value means
zero<00:00:24.960> or<00:00:25.260> positive<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.960> distance<00:00:27.960> means<00:00:28.170> how

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
zero or positive and distance means how

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.920 
zero or positive and distance means how
far<00:00:29.599> we<00:00:30.599> travel<00:00:31.160> so<00:00:32.160> let's<00:00:32.430> look<00:00:32.759> at<00:00:32.969> one<00:00:33.390> minus

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
far we travel so let's look at one minus

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.979 
far we travel so let's look at one minus
seven<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:35.190> start<00:00:35.640> at<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.760> we<00:00:38.989> subtract

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
seven we start at one and we subtract

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.930 
seven we start at one and we subtract
seven<00:00:40.730> subtract

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
seven subtract

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.110 
seven subtract
subtracting<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.930> positive<00:00:42.960> means<00:00:43.969> moving<00:00:44.969> to

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
subtracting a positive means moving to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.000 
subtracting a positive means moving to
the<00:00:45.239> left<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:47.129> two<00:00:47.640> three<00:00:48.360> four<00:00:48.899> five<00:00:49.469> six

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the left one two three four five six

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.189 
the left one two three four five six
seven<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:54.680> minus<00:00:55.969> seven<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.500> negative<00:00:58.500> six

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
seven so one minus seven is negative six

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.579 
seven so one minus seven is negative six
the<00:01:01.199> distance<00:01:02.149> between<00:01:03.149> one<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.110> seven

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the distance between one and seven

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
the distance between one and seven
should<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> absolute<00:01:06.360> value<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.170> negative

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
should be the absolute value of negative

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.760 
should be the absolute value of negative
six<00:01:09.049> theoretically<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:12.570> absolute<00:01:13.110> value<00:01:13.560> of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
six theoretically the absolute value of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.950 
six theoretically the absolute value of
negative<00:01:14.189> six<00:01:14.670> means<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.150> far<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.570> negative

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
negative six means how far is negative

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.859 
negative six means how far is negative
six<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.439> zero<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:18.060> six<00:01:18.479> units<00:01:20.600> what<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
six from zero it's six units what is the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.920 
six from zero it's six units what is the
distance<00:01:22.380> between<00:01:22.850> one<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.920> seven<00:01:26.689> one<00:01:27.689> two

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
distance between one and seven one two

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
distance between one and seven one two
three<00:01:28.110> four<00:01:28.950> five<00:01:29.310> six<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:31.380> works<00:01:31.790> let's<00:01:32.790> try

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
three four five six it works let's try

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.460 
three four five six it works let's try
it<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> another<00:01:33.540> example<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.290> one

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it on another example because one

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.289 
it on another example because one
example<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> doesn't<00:01:35.220> prove<00:01:35.400> anything

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.069 

let's<00:01:39.299> give<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.570> example<00:01:40.610> six<00:01:41.659> minus<00:01:42.659> negative

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
let's give an example six minus negative

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.940 
let's give an example six minus negative
two<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.640> start<00:01:45.439> at<00:01:46.439> six<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:49.350> subtract<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
two if we start at six and we subtract a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
two if we start at six and we subtract a
positive<00:01:50.549> number<00:01:50.729> we<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.720> left<00:01:51.960> but

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
positive number we go to the left but

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.160 
positive number we go to the left but
when<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.710> subtract<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.460> negative<00:01:54.180> number<00:01:54.810> we

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
when we subtract a negative number we

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.719 
when we subtract a negative number we
move<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> right<00:01:56.540> one<00:01:57.540> two<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.710> six<00:01:58.740> minus

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
move to the right one two so six minus

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.709 
move to the right one two so six minus
negative<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.659> equals<00:02:01.040> positive<00:02:02.040> eight<00:02:02.719> you

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
negative two equals positive eight you

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.020 
negative two equals positive eight you
may<00:02:03.990> remember<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.500> six<00:02:04.950> minus<00:02:05.460> negative<00:02:05.670> 2

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
may remember that six minus negative 2

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.550 
may remember that six minus negative 2
means<00:02:06.270> six<00:02:06.659> plus<00:02:07.079> positive

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.520 

so<00:02:11.780> what<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.290> distance<00:02:13.890> between<00:02:14.160> six<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so what is the distance between six and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.150 
so what is the distance between six and
negative<00:02:16.530> two

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
negative two

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.990 
negative two
here's<00:02:17.430> negative<00:02:17.670> two<00:02:18.410> here's<00:02:19.410> six<00:02:19.800> one<00:02:20.700> two

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
here's negative two here's six one two

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.250 
here's negative two here's six one two
three<00:02:21.810> four<00:02:22.350> five<00:02:22.800> six<00:02:23.340> seven<00:02:23.760> eight<00:02:24.080> which<00:02:25.080> is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
three four five six seven eight which is

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.010 
three four five six seven eight which is
the<00:02:25.410> absolute<00:02:26.040> value<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.550> eight<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.569> absolute

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the absolute value of eight the absolute

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.150 
the absolute value of eight the absolute
value<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.470> eight

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
value of eight

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.060 
value of eight
how<00:02:29.520> far<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:29.940> eight<00:02:30.180> from<00:02:30.510> 0<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:32.060> 8
