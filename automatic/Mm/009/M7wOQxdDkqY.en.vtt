00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.620
 Hey, people, I'm the player's. 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.680
 and today I am with you as you play with the game exitem to 2 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.029
 to start the game we'll click on the menu nobody said 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.839
 and let's go 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.980
 and put our name 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.390
 so I'll put it here 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.640
 william 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.640
 and I'll give it ok 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.079
 the game in the beginning story that we will have as reported the newspaper's website 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 talking about city criminals 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.250
 my mandate is that I will start in omission mode since a free way of doing 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.250
 whatever you want the city is closed and will only be released after the people 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.210
 complete a mission mode 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.670
 first career game ando 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.670
 and so we will have an animation zinha building 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 none of us and a comparsa at the exit of the place 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.840
 here we will have several conversations - vl 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 and to be discovered they have to present only because the space 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.229
 There was an explosion and he's calling, come on tomorrow we have to be 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 hence 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 still losing space for us to leave 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 showed the car breaks with next year is that we will use the arrows 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 directional 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.730
 preparing a nearby base 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.780
 because to drive it we will use the directional keys too 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.980
 again practical space pass quickly through the conversation 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.150
 so we can move people to use renewable energy we can 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
 run away with the car 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.120
 so that's how you play the pieter game 2 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.230
 complex missions and have to reach the end of the month I hope you like it and even 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.560
 next
