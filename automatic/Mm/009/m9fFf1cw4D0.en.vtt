00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello to montblanc for the first time 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.490
 long time from the saints 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 echo away from you know we were 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.840
 Only in Japan on the way was I 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.309
 was traveling with macoto in germany 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.199
 Of course many many particles we share 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.890
 visited and there was accordingly 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.260
 to film a lot 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.430
 but I'm having melanie right now 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.020
 spoken and we want now 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.939
 necessarily a few blocks from 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.680
 make here because the real sense 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.970
 the montreux blog is not ten 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.250
 million particles to say so I know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 that pleases you like that many 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 is easy food but actually it works 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 because we continue to know him 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 help to know the attitude and the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 We really can not be out there on the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.950
 mediate pond but that is one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.420
 little theory and we want that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 just in a fun and funny way 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 but before we do that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.460
 would like to start again on one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
 written application received this time from a 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.480
 I can only tell you this 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 woman has a blatant hobby but everyone 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.289
 of them the way I might like them 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.149
 moved in public and with the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 one or two statements about products 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.140
 or opinions about certain things 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.820
 peddling is about to happen 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.019
 take care of this person and you 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.369
 Maybe it's like me 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.930
 Smile when they hear something 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.850
 happened and hello mr camera 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 I follow with great interest their 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.930
 blog the videos are really very 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.470
 informative designed so many thanks 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.030
 for this 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.710
 in an older block are on the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 largest development of call received 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 and have there also the space factor 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.320
 So mentioned the fire in a small space 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.630
 not so great for that I have 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.009
 Coincidentally an ancient one, after all 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 very interesting scientific 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.640
 Paper is found in the paper 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.439
 as if by chance in a trial 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430
 buy equipment to breed loose 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.560
 was determined 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.479
 what immense growth on the smallest 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
 Space is possible if everyone else 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.590
 Parameters are optimal I have them 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.570
 The paper is attached as a small 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.750
 thank you for the many blogs best 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.729
 greetings then there was a pdf from me 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 do not know 1900 and somehow at least 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.960
 at that time the postcodes were still 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 four-digit twix still raider and me 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.840
 I read that through and that was 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.579
 really as well as we have the experience 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.259
 at least as well as it did from 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.810
 weird know as he the garage 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.060
 Bred two years after he got out 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 first looked for is small 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.409
 a customer of the 1500 2000 liters 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.300
 had come back with 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.500
 the 80 centimeter big buy 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.450
 asked if he please again nice 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130
 can trade for the little one 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.770
 because his 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.290
 that was so fortune of his pond 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.600
 or its inside bracket would be the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.590
 no longer allow koi size so and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.810
 of course I am 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.580
 become curious and then have the lady 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.820
 back written how to because as 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.500
 Normally such studies would come 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.150
 and it would burn me 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.990
 I'm interested in what she works because of me 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.190
 do not know if they are now in 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.660
 scientist is providing them with 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.370
 fish busy where you maybe 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.260
 also one or the other 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.210
 can refer to useful paper 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 I got the following answer hello 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.010
 mr camera well, the question is how far 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.480
 my hobby is called a normal 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.340
 Of course I have to take care of that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.470
 I am professional in one 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.540
 completely different corner there me 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.440
 investment manager investment fund 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.840
 managerin but another hobby of 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.730
 I can see if it is subjective 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.770
 Observations of universal validity 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.510
 are also scientifically proven 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.670
 No matter if it's about buying growth 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 cold or similar goes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.960
 thanks to the internet you come across quickly 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.610
 Interesting studies like this 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.620
 and of course that's crazy 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.570
 someone on the engine block in the 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.490
 Internet can make it easy afterwards 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.860
 sift through to browse 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.450
 whether it is on the subject anything 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.240
 scientifically founded there are 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.500
 i love barry to be the woman i am 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.060
 of course, can not say the last name 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.290
 as it has also placed value on it as 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.600
 I asked her if I have this 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.920
 may publish mail traffic there must 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.990
 Of course I will love to say 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.790
 that you are koi with the theme and 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.320
 Science was very fast, of course 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.180
 reaches its limits because I believe 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.150
 Over 90 percent of what's there in Japan 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.740
 is examined what color what is being done 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.200
 scientifically not proven 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.360
 and that's why I do a lot 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.760
 Of course, still very much coffee reading 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.160
 build much more on empirical data 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.700
 but then the love berit still has 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.530
 I asked a question 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.360
 looking forward to the next blogs and if 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.740
 you can already dedicate a blog to me 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.600
 maybe even a small question 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.150
 you can answer the tour you are with 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.530
 12 to 14 centimeters buys just as big 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.480
 will be like toaster from later 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.350
 So selections already rank in the 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.000
 same age 2025 will have or become more 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.100
 at the first selection stages 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.110
 respected so much in the size 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.610
 first selection stadia the small one 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.800
 stay off to be selected 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.139
 there is a very clear answer 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.849
 no, so every choir and even if we 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.580
 now have a goal last year 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.050
 whoever sees first or is 12 cm tall 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.400
 so this herb can still do that 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.490
 have potential in them 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.479
 80 to become 90 or 100 inches tall and 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.669
 if you look at the blogger 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.069
 remember where macroeconomics at chris 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.240
 vietoris the small size is or 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:49.129
 rather, she did not select 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.409
 but he really has 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:53.780
 mentions that it is the fast growing one 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.849
 in the beginning the in a certain 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.680
 time window to double or 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.960
 triple your siblings grow 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.909
 that's what they are 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.710
 not really looking for those are the 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.930
 who often do not keep the color 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.159
 can i know now please please please love 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.729
 Behrendt they do not immediately ask that 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.349
 google on 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.270
 I do not know if this fast 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:12.740
 growth is responsible for that 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.819
 the colors get lost or not or 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.099
 that the color is not so good 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.219
 pronounced but you know that the am 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.680
 beginning fastest growing small co the 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:23.330
 are qualitatively worst and then 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.340
 but it is also quite a koi 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.289
 needs not only growth but 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.610
 body of color quality he needs one 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.569
 good drawing and he needs 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.400
 growth potential 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.050
 without a good skin and a nice skin 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.629
 gloss of the skin that he as a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.000
 high quality is accepted what to believe 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.800
 she selected out like many little coco's 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.960
 be thrown or in the standards 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.839
 just because the drawing is not that 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.310
 corresponds because, for example, a coca cola burri 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.169
 head drawing this into complete 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.210
 red heads then it can be that 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.849
 he selected with 10 12 centimeters off 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.020
 whereas others are koi 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.949
 maybe much weaker 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.779
 but growth has a nice one 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.849
 Color quality plus an attractive 

00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:01.279
 The drawing will then be further promoted 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.770
 if I'm funny at first the first 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.680
 independent of growth potential 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.449
 those from the selection or from the 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.770
 group of so-called kashirina like 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.020
 the group of the best of the vintage 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.129
 fly it out somewhere at seven 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.520
 to ten centimeters 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:21.259
 then there are again at 12 15 cm at 18 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.939
 20 cm at 225 cm and of which I know 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.580
 They are believed to be three and a half 4 million 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:29.659
 teu are offered on the buyer 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:32.449
 only about 1,500 koi manage the nine 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.009
 months after birth still as 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.639
 john postage was to the group of the cashier 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.650
 davari brain and then in consequence too 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.090
 to minister 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.910
 but it would be natural 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.979
 a certificate of poverty for the ko in itself and 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.110
 for our train a lot more if 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:49.330
 under three and a half million born 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.949
 fischer if only because 1500 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.449
 growth potential 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.400
 I can also join them 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.750
 So with marco through germany 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.870
 he drove at some point at the very time 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.810
 In the end, martin makes the most fun 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.419
 robbie probably with the co in the 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.430
 second row so not this absolute 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.050
 World class fish where you are scared every day 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.570
 it must be somehow wrong 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.789
 or develop negatively or not 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.229
 loses a school of color or on 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.479
 Another show band Jimmy is coming 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:19.150
 but just these little ones cost just 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.530
 these little mistakes like the red ones 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.389
 head or something else but I can 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.850
 They promise you every chance 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.199
 if the genetics if the body structure 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.300
 if at least that's right 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:30.190
 reasonably assume that if they 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.470
 have feelings and they offer him the 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.030
 correct environmental conditions over the 

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.400
 The choir can do so in the next years 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.500
 easily be as big as his 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.380
 Siblings from the breeder of beginning 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.020
 from birth to the fifth 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.060
 be promoted sixth year of life so 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.860
 so i have the question now sustainable 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.990
 to have answered and I would 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.110
 anyway, if anyone and as well 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.190
 also consults about any documents 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.820
 has the scientific nature 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:08:00.190
 and the community may help 

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.229
 but the real truth is real 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.940
 truth is also a truth normal 

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:06.250
 I would come closer to getting closer 

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.479
 happy if that is sent to us 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.460
 and we would that be natural 

00:08:07.479 --> 00:08:11.919
 always like to dedicate a blog or 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.419
 also the documents then if we that 

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:16.380
 may be available in this sense 

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:16.380
 until then bye
