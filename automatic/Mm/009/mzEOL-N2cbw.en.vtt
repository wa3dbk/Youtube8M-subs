today<00:00:01.070> we're<00:00:02.070> doing<00:00:02.370> a<00:00:02.520> new<00:00:02.970> experiment<00:00:03.720> new

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
today we're doing a new experiment new

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.490 
today we're doing a new experiment new
for<00:00:04.589> us

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:26.020 

holy<00:00:08.500> crap<00:00:08.920> I<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:10.690> it

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.179 

the<00:00:27.030> reaction<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.020> sodium<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.590> water<00:00:28.619> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the reaction of sodium with water is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.760 
the reaction of sodium with water is
terribly<00:00:29.820> well-known<00:00:30.330> we've<00:00:30.689> done<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> lots

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
terribly well-known we've done it lots

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.790 
terribly well-known we've done it lots
of<00:00:32.040> times<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:32.970> videos<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.660> drop<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.350> piece

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
of times on our videos you drop a piece

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.970 
of times on our videos you drop a piece
of<00:00:34.980> sodium<00:00:35.430> into<00:00:35.820> water<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.590> sodium

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
of sodium into water and because sodium

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.729 
of sodium into water and because sodium
is<00:00:38.160> lighter<00:00:38.430> than<00:00:38.730> water<00:00:38.970> it<00:00:39.480> skitters<00:00:40.379> around

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
is lighter than water it skitters around

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
is lighter than water it skitters around
on<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.129> surface<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:43.400> reacting<00:00:44.570> liberating

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
on the surface and reacting liberating

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.380 
on the surface and reacting liberating
hydrogen<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.410> then<00:00:46.980> sometimes<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.790> hydrogen

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
hydrogen and then sometimes the hydrogen

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.140 
hydrogen and then sometimes the hydrogen
catches<00:00:48.840> fire<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:50.220> one<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> our<00:00:50.730> videos

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
catches fire and in one of our videos

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.090 
catches fire and in one of our videos
exploded<00:00:51.960> -<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.650> orange<00:00:53.220> sodium<00:00:53.820> grain<00:00:56.780> and<00:00:58.100> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
exploded - the orange sodium grain and a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.969 
exploded - the orange sodium grain and a
piece<00:00:59.970> of<00:01:00.150> it<00:01:00.299> hit<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> camera<00:01:01.080> which<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.860> your

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
piece of it hit the camera which on your

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.660 
piece of it hit the camera which on your
camera<00:01:02.220> oh<00:01:02.809> it<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.900> -<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.589> time<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.370> want<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
camera oh it is - this time we want to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.710 
camera oh it is - this time we want to
react<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.299> small<00:01:06.780> amount<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> water<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:08.340> an

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
react a small amount of water with an

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.660 
react a small amount of water with an
excess<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.930> sodium<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.310> way<00:01:11.430> we've<00:01:11.640> done

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
excess of sodium and the way we've done

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.240 
excess of sodium and the way we've done
it<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> piece<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> sodium<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.710> put

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it is to take a piece of sodium and put

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
it is to take a piece of sodium and put
it<00:01:14.400> in<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> bottom<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> beaker<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.900> then

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
it in the bottom of the beaker and then

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.990 
it in the bottom of the beaker and then
drop<00:01:17.450> drops<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.720> water<00:01:19.100> from<00:01:20.100> quite<00:01:20.729> high<00:01:20.970> up

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
drop drops of water from quite high up

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.109 
drop drops of water from quite high up
onto<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:22.320> block<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.740> sodium<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.790> drop

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
onto the block of sodium so one drop

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170 
onto the block of sodium so one drop
after<00:01:25.020> another

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.170 

you

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.710 

so<00:01:37.080> what<00:01:37.260> happened<00:01:37.800> was<00:01:37.980> that<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.360> few

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so what happened was that the first few

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.550 
so what happened was that the first few
drops<00:01:40.610> hit<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.940> surface<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.690> because<00:01:43.200> it's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
drops hit the surface and because it's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.770 
drops hit the surface and because it's
hard<00:01:44.690> probably<00:01:45.690> ran<00:01:45.930> partly<00:01:46.560> off<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
hard probably ran partly off and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.450 
hard probably ran partly off and
reaction<00:01:48.780> started<00:01:49.380> round<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.700> bottom<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
reaction started round the bottom of the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.600 
reaction started round the bottom of the
lamp<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.700> sodium<00:01:54.150> and<00:01:54.770> you<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.980> see<00:01:56.160> bubbles

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
lamp of sodium and you can see bubbles

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.200 
lamp of sodium and you can see bubbles
and<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> bubbles<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.770> probably<00:01:59.430> hydrogen

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and the bubbles are probably hydrogen

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
and the bubbles are probably hydrogen
coming<00:02:00.660> off<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:01.530> reaction<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.250> water

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
coming off because the reaction of water

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090 
coming off because the reaction of water
with<00:02:02.850> sodium<00:02:03.270> gives<00:02:03.570> sodium<00:02:04.380> hydroxide<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
with sodium gives sodium hydroxide and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.570 
with sodium gives sodium hydroxide and
hydrogen<00:02:06.350> since<00:02:07.350> there<00:02:07.620> isn't<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:07.950> much

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
hydrogen since there isn't very much

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
hydrogen since there isn't very much
water<00:02:08.910> there'll<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> strong<00:02:10.320> solution<00:02:10.649> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
water there'll be a strong solution of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.730 
water there'll be a strong solution of
sodium<00:02:11.370> hydroxide<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:13.170> unlikely<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
sodium hydroxide and that's unlikely to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580 
sodium hydroxide and that's unlikely to
boiled<00:02:14.810> because<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> alternative

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
boiled because the alternative

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.560 
boiled because the alternative
explanation<00:02:17.370> that<00:02:17.730> these<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.090> bubbles<00:02:18.420> of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
explanation that these are bubbles of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.940 
explanation that these are bubbles of
steam<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:20.209> then<00:02:21.380> because<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> reaction

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
steam and then because the reaction

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.170 
steam and then because the reaction
produces<00:02:23.610> heat<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.840> appears<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.730> sodium

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
produces heat it appears that the sodium

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.630 
produces heat it appears that the sodium
melted<00:02:28.050> but<00:02:28.590> because<00:02:28.920> it's<00:02:29.100> quite<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> small

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
melted but because it's quite a small

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.790 
melted but because it's quite a small
piece<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.600> just<00:02:30.840> stayed<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.740> glob<00:02:32.459> of<00:02:32.700> liquid

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
piece it just stayed as a glob of liquid

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.190 
piece it just stayed as a glob of liquid
sitting<00:02:34.800> on<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> bottom<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.459> beaker<00:02:36.200> then

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
sitting on the bottom the beaker then

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.400 
sitting on the bottom the beaker then
when<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> last<00:02:37.830> drop<00:02:38.340> came<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.959> very

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
when the last drop came down it very

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.880 
when the last drop came down it very
conveniently<00:02:41.130> hit<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:42.000> surface<00:02:42.269> of<00:02:42.890> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
conveniently hit the surface of the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.790 
conveniently hit the surface of the
sodium<00:02:44.310> moreless<00:02:44.850> square<00:02:46.640> holy<00:02:47.640> crap<00:02:48.030> I<00:02:48.800> got

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
sodium moreless square holy crap I got

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.180 
sodium moreless square holy crap I got
it<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:51.860> because<00:02:52.860> water<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.250> quite<00:02:53.580> dense<00:02:53.959> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
it and because water is quite dense it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.880 
it and because water is quite dense it
made<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.489> crater<00:02:56.850> as<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> were<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.959> puddle<00:02:58.650> where

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
made a crater as it were a puddle where

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.729 
made a crater as it were a puddle where
it's<00:02:59.040> hit<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.550> sodium<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.750> because<00:03:01.590> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
it's hit the sodium and then because the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.729 
it's hit the sodium and then because the
water<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.220> denser<00:03:02.730> than<00:03:02.760> sodium<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:04.200> settled

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
water is denser than sodium it's settled

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.030 
water is denser than sodium it's settled
inside<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:06.060> liquid<00:03:06.239> sodium<00:03:06.800> imagine<00:03:07.800> you

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
inside the liquid sodium imagine you

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
inside the liquid sodium imagine you
have<00:03:08.220> liquid<00:03:08.610> sodium<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:09.480> melting<00:03:09.930> point<00:03:10.230> is

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
have liquid sodium the melting point is

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.810 
have liquid sodium the melting point is
96<00:03:11.340> degrees<00:03:12.380> Celsius<00:03:13.380> or<00:03:13.620> centigrade<00:03:13.820> however

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
96 degrees Celsius or centigrade however

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.350 
96 degrees Celsius or centigrade however
you<00:03:14.970> like<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.209> say<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.910> which<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.090> very

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
you like to say it and which is very

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.420 
you like to say it and which is very
close<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:18.989> boiling<00:03:19.230> point<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.769> water<00:03:19.830> and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
close to the boiling point of water and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.460 
close to the boiling point of water and
of<00:03:21.060> course<00:03:21.299> it<00:03:21.570> could<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.810> been<00:03:21.930> hotter<00:03:22.170> than

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
of course it could have been hotter than

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.840 
of course it could have been hotter than
96<00:03:23.100> degrees<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.239> when<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> water<00:03:24.810> goes<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.850> it

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
96 degrees so when the water goes in it

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.479 
96 degrees so when the water goes in it
may<00:03:27.209> well<00:03:27.510> be<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.959> an<00:03:28.500> environment<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:29.220> is

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
may well be in an environment that is

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.060 
may well be in an environment that is
higher<00:03:29.760> than<00:03:29.970> its<00:03:30.150> boiling<00:03:30.420> point<00:03:31.070> but

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
higher than its boiling point but

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.979 
higher than its boiling point but
because<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.519> water<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.910> denser<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.690> has

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
because the water is denser and has

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.590 
because the water is denser and has
momentum<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:35.130> will<00:03:35.459> go<00:03:35.880> down<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.450> bottom

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
momentum it will go down to the bottom

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.770 
momentum it will go down to the bottom
so<00:03:37.100> it's<00:03:38.100> completely<00:03:38.730> surrounded<00:03:39.330> by<00:03:39.510> hot

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
so it's completely surrounded by hot

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.190 
so it's completely surrounded by hot
sodium<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:41.220> reaction<00:03:41.730> starts<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.540> if

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
sodium and the reaction starts and if

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.949 
sodium and the reaction starts and if
you<00:03:43.350> look<00:03:43.530> carefully<00:03:43.880> first<00:03:44.880> of<00:03:45.209> all<00:03:45.389> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
you look carefully first of all the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.310 
you look carefully first of all the
reaction<00:03:46.560> blows<00:03:46.829> upwards<00:03:47.780> presumably<00:03:48.780> going

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
reaction blows upwards presumably going

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.000 
reaction blows upwards presumably going
through<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.739> hole

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
through the hole

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.039 
through the hole
all<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.430> waters<00:03:50.849> made<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.689> in<00:03:51.870> and

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
all that the waters made going in and

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.920 
all that the waters made going in and
you<00:03:52.980> could<00:03:53.189> see<00:03:53.370> an<00:03:53.430> orange<00:03:53.849> color<00:03:54.209> which<00:03:54.540> is

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you could see an orange color which is

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.559 
you could see an orange color which is
probably<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.650> color<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:56.099> hot<00:03:56.310> sodium<00:03:56.670> vapor<00:03:57.360> a

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
probably the color of hot sodium vapor a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.009 
probably the color of hot sodium vapor a
few<00:03:58.290> frames<00:03:58.680> later<00:03:59.040> on<00:03:59.459> the<00:04:00.060> reaction<00:04:00.599> really

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
few frames later on the reaction really

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.339 
few frames later on the reaction really
gets<00:04:01.230> going<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.220> pressure<00:04:02.549> of<00:04:02.790> gas

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
gets going and the pressure of gas

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.860 
gets going and the pressure of gas
probably<00:04:04.349> hydrogen<00:04:05.010> blows<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.450> whole<00:04:06.629> thing

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
probably hydrogen blows the whole thing

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.229 
probably hydrogen blows the whole thing
apart<00:04:07.040> because<00:04:08.040> there's<00:04:08.400> much<00:04:08.610> less<00:04:08.940> water

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
apart because there's much less water

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.839 
apart because there's much less water
than<00:04:09.720> sodium<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.860> liquid<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.430> comes<00:04:11.640> out

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
than sodium the liquid that comes out

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.000 
than sodium the liquid that comes out
must<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.510> not<00:04:12.959> completely<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.799> large

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
must be not completely but a large

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.580 
must be not completely but a large
amount<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.549> it<00:04:14.700> will<00:04:14.940> be<00:04:15.120> tiny<00:04:15.870> droplets<00:04:16.470> of

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
amount of it will be tiny droplets of

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.610 
amount of it will be tiny droplets of
metallic<00:04:17.130> sodium<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.880> as<00:04:18.539> these<00:04:18.780> droplets<00:04:19.109> go

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
metallic sodium and as these droplets go

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.860 
metallic sodium and as these droplets go
through<00:04:19.889> the<00:04:20.039> air<00:04:20.250> some<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.209> them<00:04:21.359> will<00:04:21.570> react

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
through the air some of them will react

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.439 
through the air some of them will react
with<00:04:22.169> the<00:04:22.289> water<00:04:22.320> vapor<00:04:22.889> in<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.190> air<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.820> some

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
with the water vapor in the air and some

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.900 
with the water vapor in the air and some
will<00:04:24.720> react<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.979> oxygen<00:04:26.010> in<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.880> air

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
will react with the oxygen in the air

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.300 
will react with the oxygen in the air
and<00:04:27.270> there's<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.539> lot<00:04:27.720> more<00:04:27.930> oxygen<00:04:28.080> than<00:04:28.650> water

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and there's a lot more oxygen than water

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.580 
and there's a lot more oxygen than water
and<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:30.300> can<00:04:30.510> see<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:30.870> one<00:04:31.020> or<00:04:31.169> two<00:04:31.199> pieces

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
and you can see there one or two pieces

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.620 
and you can see there one or two pieces
that<00:04:31.770> come<00:04:32.130> off<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.520> this<00:04:32.669> direction<00:04:32.729> that<00:04:33.479> are

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
that come off in this direction that are

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.529 
that come off in this direction that are
glowing<00:04:33.840> really<00:04:34.470> very<00:04:34.710> hot<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.610> orange<00:04:35.970> it

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
glowing really very hot and orange it

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.719 
glowing really very hot and orange it
just<00:04:36.870> demonstrates<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:38.160> when<00:04:38.340> you<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.639> an

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
just demonstrates that when you do an

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.370 
just demonstrates that when you do an
experiment<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.510> a<00:04:39.630> new<00:04:39.840> way

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
experiment in a new way

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.400 
experiment in a new way
you<00:04:40.620> see<00:04:40.830> even<00:04:41.280> quite<00:04:42.060> a<00:04:42.090> common<00:04:42.630> reaction<00:04:42.930> in

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
you see even quite a common reaction in

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.120 
you see even quite a common reaction in
a<00:04:43.740> completely<00:04:44.130> new<00:04:44.430> light<00:04:44.930> of<00:04:45.930> course<00:04:46.620> to

a completely new light of course to

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.250 
a completely new light of course to

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
understand precisely what's going on

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.750 
understand precisely what's going on
you'd<00:04:49.440> have<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.800> do<00:04:49.949> lots<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.340> different

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
you'd have to do lots of different

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.110 
you'd have to do lots of different
experiments<00:04:51.510> varying<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> amount<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.830> water

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
experiments varying the amount of water

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.640 
experiments varying the amount of water
varying<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> temperature<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.229> sodium

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
varying the temperature of the sodium

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.980 
varying the temperature of the sodium
perhaps<00:04:56.039> even<00:04:56.430> putting<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.910> thermocouple<00:04:57.510> into

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
perhaps even putting a thermocouple into

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.920 
perhaps even putting a thermocouple into
the<00:04:58.110> sodium<00:04:58.889> to<00:04:59.099> measure<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.490> temperature

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
the sodium to measure the temperature

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.310 
the sodium to measure the temperature
but<00:05:01.400> doesn't<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.610> matter<00:05:02.910> what<00:05:03.810> does

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
but doesn't really matter what does

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.129 
but doesn't really matter what does
matters<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.130> can<00:05:05.160> see<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.990> even<00:05:06.990> this

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
matters you can see that even this

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.620 
matters you can see that even this
reaction<00:05:07.830> is<00:05:08.039> more<00:05:08.669> exciting<00:05:09.330> than<00:05:09.510> we

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
reaction is more exciting than we

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.310 
reaction is more exciting than we
thought<00:05:09.900> as<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.710> know<00:05:10.889> sodium<00:05:11.699> is<00:05:12.180> only<00:05:12.720> the

thought as you know sodium is only the
second<00:05:13.830> of<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.070> alkali<00:05:14.639> metals<00:05:14.669> as<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.539> go

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
second of the alkali metals as you go

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.260 
second of the alkali metals as you go
down<00:05:15.930> the<00:05:16.110> group<00:05:16.260> and<00:05:16.699> we<00:05:17.699> were<00:05:17.849> lucky<00:05:18.030> enough

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
down the group and we were lucky enough

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.080 
down the group and we were lucky enough
when<00:05:19.169> we<00:05:19.320> were<00:05:19.500> using<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.070> high-speed<00:05:20.280> camera

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
when we were using the high-speed camera

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.550 
when we were using the high-speed camera
to<00:05:21.810> also<00:05:22.229> video<00:05:23.180> potassium<00:05:24.180> rubidium<00:05:24.960> and

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
to also video potassium rubidium and

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.240 
to also video potassium rubidium and
cesium<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.599> in<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.720> next<00:05:27.930> few<00:05:28.199> weeks<00:05:28.250> you'll

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
cesium and in the next few weeks you'll

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.240 
cesium and in the next few weeks you'll
be<00:05:29.400> able<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.699> see<00:05:29.849> all<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.060> those<00:05:30.360> and<00:05:31.099> some<00:05:32.099> of

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
be able to see all of those and some of

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.399 
be able to see all of those and some of
those<00:05:32.400> were<00:05:33.090> even<00:05:33.419> more<00:05:33.599> exciting<00:05:34.260> than

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
those were even more exciting than

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:36.860 
those were even more exciting than
sodium
