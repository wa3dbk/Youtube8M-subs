00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.319
 after seeing this great trailer he told us 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.770
 that the game will come soon we do not know 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.620
 when but will come later this we 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.860
 it aroused curiosity to everyone and we did 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.230
 our own theories of the game that 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.710
 the passage of time go 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.380
 resolving one by one but no doubt 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.249
 this trailer has more of a mystery 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.949
 so here I show you the 6 mysteries 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:35.020
 stranger that they leave pods to you 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.020
 fredys 3 teaser trailer 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.000
 the sixth is very clear and leaves the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.090
 trailer words which are your 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.440
 way comeback which means the always 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:57.190
 come back and always you always do it and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.040
 the last ouija goes price forging we have 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.129
 a place for him the mystery is of 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.560
 who is spoken will be the purple man who 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.470
 is supposed to be the killer or will it be the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.080
 phone man I say this because 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.270
 these are the only ones in history that 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.270
 appear in the two previous installments 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.250
 the fifth place is whether the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.830
 Animatronics of the toy type not to say 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.650
 of the second game the one that this shows 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.930
 in a teaser of the image type and in the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.140
 room where it's supposed to be your 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.720
 game room and I also say it since 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.230
 They are the only ones that do not come complete in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.070
 the trailer the truth we will not know if 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.070
 these will be 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.730
 in the fourth position this one opens 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 New gameplay is a game because the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.070
 images of steam appears an image that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.330
 it seems to be game controls in the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:09.450
 which comes auriol and vice camera system and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.350
 ventilation that makes us think that this 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.210
 game could have a new gameplay 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.750
 starting the previous one and without leaving their 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.750
 traits 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.050
 in position 3 is the name again 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.230
 animatronic everyone has put golden 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.540
 bonnie for its similarity to this but this one 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.390
 It is also created by many parts of 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.990
 animatronics we can assume that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.290
 this is a hybrid and if so, how 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.520
 it would actually be called a mystery that 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.520
 we all want to know 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.460
 in the second place is the question 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.190
 who is this new animatronic or for 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.620
 the rest of them since in the trailer 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.970
 we can see that bonnie moves his eye 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.680
 looking at us but this will be a 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.860
 sign of fear towards the new 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.310
 animatronic besides the words that 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.730
 come out 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.890
 there they are written in the first person 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 giving so that animatronics are the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.780
 what those words say 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.860
 ironically but the truth this has not 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.860
 been revealed 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:37.400
 in the first place that for me is the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.890
 strangest ministry is where it is pop 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.500
 &amp; since this is the only one of the 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.050
 characters from the second game that is not 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.330
 in the box with the parts of the others and 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.430
 it is also displayed in one of the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.400
 drawings on a wall of one of the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.010
 scenes from the trailer will be that dad is 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.610
 behind all this even after the 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.750
 death is certainly a great mystery that 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.520
 will be revealed to play the video game 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.360
 We give away great lies the video has 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.820
 liked to share it with everyone
