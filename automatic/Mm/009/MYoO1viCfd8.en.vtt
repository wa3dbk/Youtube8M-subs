00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.540
 and now Michael says he wants what 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.460
 have others see what seems to be one 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.070
 of robberies like the one they told us in 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.170
 the information of May 2 we see a 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.260
 armored car in the industrial zone 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.869
 of the saints a crane like those of the san 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.329
 Andreas is attacked, it is very noticeable 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.340
 Euphoria engine capacity watching as 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.950
 I turn the van and see how it breaks the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.680
 wall we see that the van belongs 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.390
 group sets on the doors brings something 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.579
 similar to the group set is being 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.020
 authorized to use deadly force or 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.239
 kill 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.850
 maikel places loads of c4 and exploits them 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.829
 again the graphic engine shows us its 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.449
 power with the explosion and how it 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.579
 move the doors 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.350
 maikel pulls employees out by force 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.390
 but they do not seem to offer much 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.500
 resistance despite appearing to go 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.910
 armed 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.949
 maikel carries in his hand a 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.379
 light machine gun with coupled sight 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.110
 the therapist tells him that he is addicted to 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.300
 chaos appears michael in what looks like a 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.820
 car dealership where I suppose 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.460
 that we can buy cars by hitting a 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.320
 punch a man behind we see a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.640
 blue sports car that reminds me of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.979
 an audi although I do not know 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.409
 and behind a yellow SUV that 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.960
 remember one mer then give another 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.960
 nudge no doubt the system has changed 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.790
 of melee fight back we see the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.979
 highway and a pencil ad that we 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.320
 makes us think that we could be close to 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.990
 this gta 5 image that rockstar sack 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.810
 long ago the black car behind did not 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.060
 identified him in this scene is with his 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.100
 son seems to throw a man out of a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.890
 chair in hand seems to be wearing a 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.229
 tray but it does not distinguish well behind 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.180
 I can distinguish what could be a 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.330
 new patriot model of san andreas 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.610
 here we see him playing golf again 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.470
 a very realistic movement I think they have 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.470
 known how to use the graphic engine very well 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.940
 for the movements of the characters 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.860
 at the bottom on the left we see the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.840
 building where I asked you to notice 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.670
 when amanda did yoga 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.090
 this makes us have a pretty idea 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 Exactly where is that golf course 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.410
 just below the mountains that surround 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.060
 the saints on the right to the bottom another 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.739
 time the downtown that you see from 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.560
 practically anywhere in the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.060
 when we turn the camera we confirm what 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.790
 what did you think of the location 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.220
 michael looks furious and hits the ground 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.830
 with the stick at the bottom up we see the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.590
 griffith observatory here we see how 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.630
 destroys a plasma television a lot 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.910
 people think that the one that destroys is the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.769
 tele of your living room but this is not the case 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.630
 of the room is a projector and is this 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.090
 plasma and also the environment is very 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.489
 different the break of the television is 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.160
 incredibly realistic the crystal and 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.810
 how the light goes the chair is postulated 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.540
 as another object with which we can 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.239
 interact says he is rich and unhappy and 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.040
 we see him lying on the bed the physical 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.040
 of the mattress when falling michael look 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 affected everything very well done says 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.840
 which is the most normal in the city 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.720
 and here we see the three enter into a 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.540
 jewelry called evangelicals with 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.300
 balaclava the security guard is 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.790
 quickly disarmed the weapon they pose 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.770
 in my opinion is a rifle enfield the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.390
 money at least in the robberies is not a 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.610
 simple item on which to pass for 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.980
 grow a number in you but 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.650
 you have to carry it in bags now 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.690
 we see a helicopter chase them 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.970
 pursue a butchart similar to that of the 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.490
 cover that building we see behind 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.250
 of the bouchard is the fbi building the 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.020
 parody of fbi michael shoots what 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.750
 It looks like a submachine gun but we can not 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.480
 see practically michael takes a few 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.830
 Helmets for propeller noise 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.380
 incredible customization and level 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.450
 of detail before game in this change of 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.940
 camera we can see that they are being chased 2 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.920
 bufers the red helicopter is a 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.810
 maverick and takes it to trevor michael goes 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.870
 back and there's a third man firing 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.490
 so they did not shoot maikel the building 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.980
 that we see on the left is the hotel 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.690
 westin bonaventure here we see how 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.820
 maikel enters the guide building 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.240
 I was rappelling like we already had 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.770
 seen in an image of game informer 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.020
 they quickly point you two with guns 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.030
 one is a 9 millimeter and the other a 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.280
 revolver but he gets catch 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.770
 someone and uses it as a human shield so 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.990
 that this is confirmed the fall of the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.200
 crystals as it affects the shadows at 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.840
 incredible character we see in the background the 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.540
 cia logo here we see how they point 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.190
 with a sniper rifle now it 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.920
 you can see people through the 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.840
 crystals is amazing how you notice the 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.410
 shot in the chest and how it goes through 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:00.170
 the bullet now we see a boeing 747 of 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.750
 the company erler taking land several 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.580
 police cars are waiting for you 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.590
 plane is destroying the cars of 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.630
 police and mickael is dodging them 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.450
 amazing way with your car that does not 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.340
 I finally identify his 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.280
 therapist tells him to look for another 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.200
 that's all I hope you liked and 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.190
 that you wait for the next analysis that 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.190
 it will be franklin's
