00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
more this is what the raw marzipan looks

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.610 
more this is what the raw marzipan looks
like<00:01:11.850> when<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.240> open<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.810> take<00:01:13.050> that<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.500> you

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
like when you open it take that when you

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.210 
like when you open it take that when you
took<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.220> packet<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:16.229> mix<00:01:17.040> it

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
took it out of the packet and you mix it

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.070 
took it out of the packet and you mix it
with<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.460> little<00:01:17.640> bit<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.970> castor<00:01:18.510> sugar<00:01:18.540> or

with a little bit of castor sugar or
icing<00:01:19.110> sugar<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.950> think<00:01:20.010> you<00:01:20.310> call<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.560> give

icing sugar I think you call it to give

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.719 
icing sugar I think you call it to give
it<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.770> smooth<00:01:23.159> consistency

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
it a smooth consistency

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
it a smooth consistency
divide<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.940> marzipan<00:01:27.299> into<00:01:27.810> four<00:01:28.049> equal

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
divide the marzipan into four equal

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
divide the marzipan into four equal
pieces<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.400> roll<00:01:29.670> them<00:01:30.000> through<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> little

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
pieces and roll them through a little

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260 
pieces and roll them through a little
sausage<00:01:31.159> like<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.430> measure<00:01:32.789> all<00:01:33.060> the

I<00:02:20.209> actually<00:02:21.209> tried<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> film<00:02:22.050> how<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.650> put<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I actually tried to film how I put the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.280 
I actually tried to film how I put the
things<00:02:23.879> together<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.629> do<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.379> my<00:02:25.560> hand<00:02:25.860> I
