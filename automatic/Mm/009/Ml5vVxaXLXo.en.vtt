00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.030 

the<00:00:56.720> way<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:56.870> approach<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.260> was<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.710> say<00:00:57.890> look

pushing and by holding ourselves to that
standard<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:03.170> think<00:01:03.560> we<00:01:03.650> got<00:01:03.830> to<00:01:03.980> something

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
