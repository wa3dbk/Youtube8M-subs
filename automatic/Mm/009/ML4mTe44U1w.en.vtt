00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
ahead and do it and so in this case you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.600 
ahead and do it and so in this case you
can<00:02:03.500> see<00:02:03.590> these<00:02:03.680> are<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.860> ways<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:04.040> escape

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
can see these are the ways you escape

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.910 
can see these are the ways you escape
the<00:02:04.820> area<00:02:05.000> I'm<00:02:05.689> not<00:02:05.930> gonna<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.170> craft<00:02:06.380> them<00:02:06.590> yet

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
the area I'm not gonna to craft them yet

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.339 
the area I'm not gonna to craft them yet
but<00:02:07.250> what<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:07.939> could<00:02:08.090> do<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.599> work<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:08.929> my<00:02:08.989> quest

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
but what I could do is work on my quest

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.800 
but what I could do is work on my quest
here<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:10.129> basically<00:02:10.640> explored<00:02:11.239> my<00:02:11.330> apartment

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
here I basically explored my apartment

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.230 
here I basically explored my apartment
getting<00:02:12.019> some<00:02:12.230> random<00:02:12.709> stuff

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.270 

and<00:02:16.840> then<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.200> can<00:02:17.350> go<00:02:17.470> ahead<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.830> head<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.190> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
and then I can go ahead and head to the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.960 
and then I can go ahead and head to the
right<00:02:18.870> before<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.230> though<00:02:20.730> let's<00:02:21.730> check

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
right before that though let's check

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.210 
right before that though let's check
this<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.600> see<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.200> can<00:02:29.500> go<00:02:29.650> ahead<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:29.980> use

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
this you can see I can go ahead and use

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920 
this you can see I can go ahead and use
it<00:02:30.370> again<00:02:30.580> if<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.790> wanted<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.210> but<00:02:31.480> cause<00:02:31.630> gold
