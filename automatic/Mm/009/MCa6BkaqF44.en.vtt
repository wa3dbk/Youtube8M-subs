00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.700
 from the moment the steering wheel is 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:08.379
 displayed on the screen is that the system 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.300
 is able to produce launch of the 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:11.980
 product 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.269
 on a country road simply 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.960
 because he knew how to measure the road 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.119
 and those to follow the landmark hd webcam 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.160
 the white lines the arrows on the ground 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.630
 and the speed boards for 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.239
 allow drivers not to 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.980
 touching the steering wheel olivier picard work 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.390
 for five years on the advice we take 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.730
 a photo using the camera that is 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.489
 fixed on this windshield the photo is 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.160
 immediately analyzed by the pc that does 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.620
 a lot of calculations to be able to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.030
 then transmit to the device that 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.890
 is under the wheel a movement of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.050
 flying that will match the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.050
 rectification necessary to the conduits 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.160
 thirty frames per second are 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.440
 analyzed by the software his glasses 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 announces the calculation it took 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.610
 many studies on behavior 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.040
 drivers to translate the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.540
 information in algorithms resulted 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.320
 Olivier is less stressed today 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.320
 when it is convenient 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.370
 there is no such anguish of evil 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.830
 driving or committing an error and 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.330
 there is much less fatigue especially 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.130
 the driver must still stay 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.570
 vigilant 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.750
 I do not think a car can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.450
 to lead without human supervision 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.450
 without them without the slightest danger 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.430
 because we're not there yet 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410
 it's still a long way to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 browse before 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.850
 result road safety follows from 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 near this new driving system 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.590
 joseph of the father we even tried this 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.690
 prototype it is preventive and even 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.950
 size of curative especially because 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.210
 it's the only system that brings you back 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.500
 in your fingers and 40 control 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.600
 to hit vehicles that will be 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.250
 in front and make dead this prototype 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.800
 begins to talk about him 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.810
 several industrialists and engineers are 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.700
 interested because the automatic driving 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.700
 it may be the car of tomorrow
