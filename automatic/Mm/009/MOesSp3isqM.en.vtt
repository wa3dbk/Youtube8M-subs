thinking<00:00:54.350> about<00:00:54.620> it<00:00:54.830> I<00:00:59.440> thought<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.620> the

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
thinking about it I thought that the

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.890 
thinking about it I thought that the
Warriors<00:01:01.190> was<00:01:01.430> kind<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.790> a<00:01:01.850> strange<00:01:02.390> movie<00:01:02.780> to

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
Warriors was kind of a strange movie to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.570 
Warriors was kind of a strange movie to
base<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.110> video<00:01:03.470> game<00:01:03.800> on<00:01:04.010> but<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.250> did<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.489> little

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
base a video game on but I did a little

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.280 
base a video game on but I did a little
more<00:01:04.879> research<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.479> apparently<00:01:06.020> there's<00:01:06.200> a

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
more research and apparently there's a

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.280 
more research and apparently there's a
remake<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.310> works<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.600> now<00:01:08.780> it<00:01:08.900> makes<00:01:09.080> more

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
remake in the works so now it makes more

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.399 
remake in the works so now it makes more
sense<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.830> this<00:01:10.070> game<00:01:10.340> is<00:01:10.610> like<00:01:11.260> Streets<00:01:12.260> of

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
sense this this game is like Streets of

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.789 
sense this this game is like Streets of
Rage<00:01:12.470> with<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.490> 1979<00:01:14.479> feel<00:01:14.990> mixed<00:01:15.290> with<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.560> bit

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
Rage with a 1979 feel mixed with a bit

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.890 
Rage with a 1979 feel mixed with a bit
of<00:01:15.830> pit<00:01:16.190> fighter<00:01:16.540> something<00:01:17.540> about<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
of pit fighter something about the

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.810 
of pit fighter something about the
visuals<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.440> remind<00:01:19.040> me<00:01:19.159> of<00:01:19.190> pit<00:01:19.430> fighter<00:01:19.700> I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.010 
visuals just remind me of pit fighter I
don't<00:01:20.060> know<00:01:20.119> maybe<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:20.570> pit<00:01:20.780> fighter

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
don't know maybe is that pit fighter

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
don't know maybe is that pit fighter
basically<00:01:21.680> looks<00:01:21.860> like<00:01:21.950> it<00:01:22.190> came<00:01:22.340> out<00:01:22.490> in<00:01:22.640> 1981

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
basically looks like it came out in 1981

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.330 
basically looks like it came out in 1981
I<00:01:29.080> just<00:01:30.080> wanted<00:01:30.410> to<00:01:30.560> get<00:01:30.740> to<00:01:30.920> those<00:01:31.070> tap
