 indeed well, we continue with 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 this rain forecast we are not going to 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.450
 jump the umbrella, much less the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.790
 sweaters in the afternoon because the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.769
 temperature is going down now 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.929
 we have 18 degrees centigrade a 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.000
 pretty cool environment pretty cold and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.949
 we will continue to rise in descent 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 for this afternoon and evening so good to 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.070

 and well we're just going to check 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.950
 our satellite image because 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.420
 we already have several phenomena 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.280
 meteorological we have a line of 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 trough levels atmospheric means 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.200
 we also have emilia that is already located 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970
 towards what is the South Pacific away from 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.830
 Mexican coasts without affecting it but 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.900
 we also have this very present 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.820
 tropical disturbance the most important thing 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.020
 in this satellite image is just 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.879
 this tropical disturbance that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 will continue to wreak havoc for what 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.510
 it's the south pacific area and also 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.160
 for the western states and 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.470
 southwest of Mexican territory with 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.050
 affectations of severe rains and very 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.860
 strong for the next 48 hours this 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.140
 forecast 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.550
 just mark these 48 hours for what 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.170
 which is the Pacific coast and what 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.940
 we see here in our satellite image 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.740
 the yucatan peninsula 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.259
 justly affected by this area of 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.790
 instability this low pressure coupled to 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.500
 these wind gusts and this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.990
 tropical disturbance that possibly 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.550
 intensify to tropical cyclone with 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.080
 very glad that I will keep you informed 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.000
 about the evolution of this 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.590
 tropical disturbance and emilia that 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.960
 just already moves away definitively 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 of Mexican territory but still the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.259
 satellite image does not report it so 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.909
 good you have to take it into account because 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.409
 is joining a low pressure 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.819
 just in the low peninsula 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.859
 california that can leave rains 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.350
 quite severe for the entire area of ​​the 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.789
 north the pearl tapatía affected by this 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.829
 line of convergence together with these 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.479
 gusts of wind and rainfall 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.340
 they will be the constant for the most part 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.899
 of the Mexican Republic not only in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.939
 puebla hurts us but also in everything 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.859
 our country to take it into account do 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.209
 plans regarding the this image of 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.670
 precipitation we have this 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.379
 tropical disturbance wind and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.450
 exactly where we see these years is 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.799
 the convective electrical activity that 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.840
 has wreaked havoc on us here in the 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:15.430
 angelópolis we had a storm but 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.379
 with electrical activity we will continue 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.150
 with this severe storm forecast 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.400
 with electrical activity taking very in 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.900
 account avoid sudden changes of 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 temperature and also to handle with 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 a lot of caution because you're 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.540
 precipitations will be the constant for 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.310
 all the Mexican territory and justly 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.379
 at the moment we are reaching 18 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.420
 Celsius degrees the maximum for the day 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.120
 today is 20 degrees centigrade for the 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.250
 night we will arrive between 15 and 16 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.930
 degrees as temperature the conditions 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.090
 of the sky are currently partially 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.950
 cloudy to mostly cloudy this we 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.290
 It causes lower visibility to 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 handle take it very seriously, manage with 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.710
 caution without much 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.360
 speed so we can be very 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.130
 well on this weekend friday 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
 Saturday and Sunday we have a cool climate 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.110
 the maximum at 20 degrees Celsius 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.300
 the day Saturday 18 to 19 degrees but 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.819
 we will wake up between 10 and 11 degrees 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.410
 centigrade with these precipitations 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.670
 marked for Saturday and for 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.190
 Friday and Sunday we have conditions 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.900
 of the sky partially cloudy the index 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.280
 rise in the afternoon is reflected as very 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.200
 tall despite this great layer of 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.209
 cloudiness to use protector factor 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.220
 solar my recommendation as always and the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.380
