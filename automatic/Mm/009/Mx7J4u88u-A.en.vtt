some alerts on this system right now I'm
going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> generate<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.140> CPU<00:01:40.800> problem<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.580> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
going to generate a CPU problem on it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.070 
going to generate a CPU problem on it
and<00:01:41.940> then<00:01:42.810> we'll<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.259> how<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.650> remedy<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
and then we'll see how to remedy that
