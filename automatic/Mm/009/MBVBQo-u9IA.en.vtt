just quickly take you through how i've
done<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.400> because<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.660> was<00:01:00.170> worried<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.470> was

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
done that because I was worried it was

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.630 
done that because I was worried it was
going<00:01:00.740> to<00:01:00.830> be<00:01:00.890> difficult<00:01:01.040> but<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:01.460> really

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
going to be difficult but it really

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.220 
going to be difficult but it really
wasn't<00:01:01.850> in<00:01:02.330> fact<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.630> think<00:01:02.690> it's<00:01:02.930> worked<00:01:03.110> out

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
wasn't in fact I think it's worked out

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.399 
wasn't in fact I think it's worked out
better<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.360> I've<00:01:05.360> also<00:01:05.659> got<00:01:05.960> to<00:01:06.049> show<00:01:06.259> you<00:01:06.290> a

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
better and I've also got to show you a

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.550 
better and I've also got to show you a
quick<00:01:06.590> trick<00:01:06.920> of<00:01:07.130> them<00:01:07.280> with<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.729> rain<00:01:07.970> fly

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
quick trick of them with this rain fly

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
quick trick of them with this rain fly
alright<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:09.950> let's<00:01:10.369> have<00:01:10.490> a<00:01:10.549> look

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 

if<00:01:15.539> you'll<00:01:15.869> recall<00:01:16.200> from<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> first<00:01:16.770> video<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
if you'll recall from the first video I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.090 
if you'll recall from the first video I
made<00:01:17.219> about<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.609> DD<00:01:18.000> 2012<00:01:18.539> hammock<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.079> made<00:01:19.920> my

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
made about the DD 2012 hammock I made my

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.789 
made about the DD 2012 hammock I made my
own<00:01:20.130> DIY<00:01:20.670> under<00:01:21.299> quilt<00:01:21.539> using<00:01:22.380> an<00:01:22.469> old<00:01:22.619> army

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
own DIY under quilt using an old army
surplus<00:01:22.950> sleeping<00:01:23.850> bag<00:01:24.319> basically<00:01:25.319> just

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
surplus sleeping bag basically just

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.590 
surplus sleeping bag basically just
cutting<00:01:25.859> the<00:01:26.340> foot<00:01:26.549> box<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.969> so<00:01:27.179> it<00:01:27.240> becomes<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
cutting the foot box out so it becomes a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
cutting the foot box out so it becomes a
rectangle<00:01:28.200> stitching<00:01:28.859> up<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> duct<00:01:29.310> tape

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
rectangle stitching up with duct tape

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.270 
rectangle stitching up with duct tape
and<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.479> attaching<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.799> bottom<00:01:32.100> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and then attaching it to the bottom of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.249 
and then attaching it to the bottom of
the<00:01:32.340> DD<00:01:32.610> hammock<00:01:32.909> using<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:33.810> whipping

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the DD hammock using these whipping

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
the DD hammock using these whipping
knots<00:01:34.469> with<00:01:34.979> mitten<00:01:35.340> hooks<00:01:35.490> attached<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:35.969> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
knots with mitten hooks attached at the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
knots with mitten hooks attached at the
end<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.069> makes<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.609> very<00:01:38.789> modular<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.719> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
end so that makes it very modular on the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.459 
end so that makes it very modular on the
old<00:01:40.140> model<00:01:41.039> you<00:01:41.369> would<00:01:41.490> attach<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.969> to<00:01:42.469> the

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
old model you would attach it to the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.699 
old model you would attach it to the
tabs<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.420> guideline<00:01:45.420> tie<00:01:45.719> outs<00:01:45.959> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.289> base

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
tabs for guideline tie outs on the base

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.760 
tabs for guideline tie outs on the base
of<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> ad<00:01:47.369> hammock<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.720> I'm<00:01:48.989> just

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
of the ad hammock on this one I'm just

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.359 
of the ad hammock on this one I'm just
clipping<00:01:50.009> into<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.369> grommets<00:01:50.849> here<00:01:52.369> these

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
clipping into these grommets here these

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.109 
clipping into these grommets here these
grommeted<00:01:54.049> intended<00:01:55.049> for<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.219> an

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
grommeted intended for the as an

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.020 
grommeted intended for the as an
optional<00:01:57.569> way<00:01:57.929> to<00:01:57.989> put<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.500> arch<00:01:59.280> artist

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
optional way to put the arch artist

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.190 
optional way to put the arch artist
through<00:02:00.179> perhaps<00:02:00.569> if<00:02:00.719> you're<00:02:00.810> using<00:02:00.959> it<00:02:01.079> as<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
through perhaps if you're using it as a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.410 
through perhaps if you're using it as a
bivy<00:02:01.560> then<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.640> put<00:02:02.819> the<00:02:02.849> artist<00:02:03.239> through

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
bivy then you put the artist through

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.029 
bivy then you put the artist through
gamma<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.140> would<00:02:04.259> double<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.619> as<00:02:04.739> a<00:02:04.770> peg

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
gamma so it would double up as a peg

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.069 
gamma so it would double up as a peg
well<00:02:05.849> if<00:02:06.119> you're<00:02:06.239> not<00:02:06.299> using<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.629> as<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> bivy

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
well if you're not using it as a bivy

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.830 
well if you're not using it as a bivy
you're<00:02:07.709> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.890> need<00:02:08.009> an<00:02:08.099> undercoat<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
you're going to need an undercoat and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.569 
you're going to need an undercoat and
the<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:09.959> I've<00:02:10.140> designed<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:11.310> clips

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
the way I've designed this it just clips

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.069 
the way I've designed this it just clips
really<00:02:11.879> nicely<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.269> that<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
really nicely to that I think it

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.569 
really nicely to that I think it
actually<00:02:13.200> works<00:02:13.620> better<00:02:13.769> because<00:02:14.040> it's

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
actually works better because it's

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.309 
actually works better because it's
clipped<00:02:14.819> into<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.060> metal<00:02:15.540> grommet<00:02:15.989> rather<00:02:16.200> than

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
clipped into a metal grommet rather than

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.580 
clipped into a metal grommet rather than
a<00:02:16.530> fabric<00:02:16.860> tab<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:17.340> because<00:02:18.030> these<00:02:19.019> arches

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a fabric tab and because these arches

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.879 
a fabric tab and because these arches
keep<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.730> grommets<00:02:21.120> at<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.230> same<00:02:22.470> distance

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
keep the grommets at the same distance

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.250 
keep the grommets at the same distance
apart<00:02:23.010> all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.489> time<00:02:23.819> so<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.480> think<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:25.170> going

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
apart all the time so I think I'm going

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.390 
apart all the time so I think I'm going
to<00:02:25.319> get<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> more<00:02:25.739> uniform<00:02:26.750> fit<00:02:28.220> from<00:02:29.220> this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
to get a more uniform fit from this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
to get a more uniform fit from this
quilt<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.090> on<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.480> hammock<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.900> think<00:02:31.079> it's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
quilt now on this hammock I think it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.229 
quilt now on this hammock I think it's
going<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.319> work<00:02:31.470> out<00:02:31.680> better<00:02:32.000> quickly<00:02:33.000> show

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
going to work out better quickly show

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:42.110 
going to work out better quickly show
you<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:34.200> around

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.240 

and<00:02:43.120> go<00:02:43.420> on<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.690> one<00:02:43.900> I've<00:02:44.380> used<00:02:44.620> bungee<00:02:45.010> cord

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
and go on this one I've used bungee cord

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.490 
and go on this one I've used bungee cord
to<00:02:45.700> create<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> mitten<00:02:46.330> hooks<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
to create the mitten hooks to the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.470 
to create the mitten hooks to the
webinars<00:02:48.430> in<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.580> mitten<00:02:48.760> hooks<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.550> it'll

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
webinars in the mitten hooks so it'll

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.820 
webinars in the mitten hooks so it'll
just<00:02:52.510> stretch<00:02:56.970> it'll<00:02:57.970> just<00:02:58.000> stretch<00:02:58.830> leaving

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
just stretch it'll just stretch leaving

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.260 
just stretch it'll just stretch leaving
the<00:03:00.070> quilt<00:03:00.750> exactly<00:03:01.750> where<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> want<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:03.270> at

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
the quilt exactly where I want it at

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.490 
the quilt exactly where I want it at
each<00:03:04.390> end<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.810> hammer<00:03:04.930> got<00:03:05.170> basically

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
each end of the hammer got basically

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.260 
each end of the hammer got basically
done<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:06.070> same<00:03:06.220> thing<00:03:06.280> I've<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> whipping

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
done the same thing I've got a whipping

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.890 
done the same thing I've got a whipping
not<00:03:07.500> made<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.680> bungee<00:03:09.070> cord<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:10.780> the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
not made out of bungee cord and on the

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.650 
not made out of bungee cord and on the
end<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.730> another<00:03:12.730> little<00:03:12.880> man<00:03:13.450> hook

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
end of that is another little man hook

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.030 
end of that is another little man hook
which<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.950> clips<00:03:15.310> around<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:17.710> Whoopie

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
which just clips around the Whoopie

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.540 
which just clips around the Whoopie
slings<00:03:18.400> at<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.270> end<00:03:19.420> there<00:03:20.160> do<00:03:21.160> not<00:03:21.340> on<00:03:21.460> each

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
slings at the end there do not on each

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.990 
slings at the end there do not on each
end<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.770> basically<00:03:23.820> holds<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.880> whole

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
end and that basically holds the whole

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.440 
end and that basically holds the whole
thing<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.270> place<00:03:25.450> very<00:03:25.690> nicely

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.449 

when<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.319> comes<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.620> attaching<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.129> gear

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
when it comes to attaching the gear

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.600 
when it comes to attaching the gear
shove<00:03:35.290> well<00:03:36.290> it's<00:03:36.440> yeah<00:03:36.769> I'm<00:03:37.190> not<00:03:37.340> sure<00:03:37.580> about

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
shove well it's yeah I'm not sure about

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.520 
shove well it's yeah I'm not sure about
this<00:03:37.879> yet<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.720> certainly<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> temporary

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
this yet this is certainly a temporary

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.690 
this yet this is certainly a temporary
measure<00:03:39.709> until<00:03:39.800> figure<00:03:40.370> out<00:03:40.459> something

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
measure until figure out something

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.229 
measure until figure out something
better<00:03:40.879> I'm<00:03:41.510> just<00:03:41.690> taking<00:03:42.819> this<00:03:43.819> length<00:03:44.120> of

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
better I'm just taking this length of

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.160 
better I'm just taking this length of
cord<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.019> wrapping<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.769> over<00:03:46.629> the<00:03:47.629> knot<00:03:47.900> at

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
cord and wrapping it over the knot at

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.470 
cord and wrapping it over the knot at
the<00:03:48.200> end<00:03:48.319> where<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:48.920> join<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.430> bug<00:03:49.640> net<00:03:49.849> to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
the end where you join the bug net to

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.140 
the end where you join the bug net to
the<00:03:50.510> base<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:50.989> hammock<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:52.790> wrapping<00:03:53.090> it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
the base of the hammock just wrapping it

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.940 
the base of the hammock just wrapping it
over<00:03:53.330> like<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:55.930> then<00:03:56.930> I've<00:03:57.110> got<00:03:57.319> this

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
over like that and then I've got this

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.009 
over like that and then I've got this
carabiner<00:03:58.540> attached<00:03:59.540> already<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.810> I'm<00:04:02.900> just

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
carabiner attached already and I'm just

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.650 
carabiner attached already and I'm just
going<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.230> clip<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:04.269> one<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.450> loops

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
going to clip that to one of the loops

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.039 
going to clip that to one of the loops
made<00:04:06.049> by<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.860> series<00:04:07.160> of<00:04:07.250> overhand<00:04:07.610> knots

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
made by this series of overhand knots

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.449 
made by this series of overhand knots
and<00:04:09.049> that's<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.590> place<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:10.040> worked<00:04:10.250> last

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
and that's that in place it worked last

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.710 
and that's that in place it worked last
night<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.790> didn't<00:04:11.030> seem<00:04:11.239> to<00:04:11.360> cause<00:04:11.540> any

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
night it didn't seem to cause any

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.330 
night it didn't seem to cause any
problems<00:04:12.280> just<00:04:14.319> not<00:04:15.319> sure<00:04:15.590> if<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.130> going<00:04:16.250> to

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
problems just not sure if it's going to

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.430 
problems just not sure if it's going to
cause<00:04:16.549> undue<00:04:16.880> stress<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:18.169> might<00:04:18.320> think

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
cause undue stress so I might think

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.210 
cause undue stress so I might think
about<00:04:18.560> another<00:04:18.799> way<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.010> do<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:21.010> but<00:04:22.010> that's

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
about another way to do that but that's

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.700 
about another way to do that but that's
my<00:04:22.370> two<00:04:22.430> modules<00:04:22.790> from<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.240> 2012<00:04:23.780> system

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
my two modules from the 2012 system

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.719 
my two modules from the 2012 system
transferred<00:04:25.669> over<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.940> 2013<00:04:26.570> system<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.729> lot

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
transferred over the 2013 system a lot

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.100 
transferred over the 2013 system a lot
easier<00:04:28.940> than<00:04:29.060> I<00:04:29.210> thought

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.850 

okay<00:04:36.110> i<00:04:36.140> just<00:04:36.290> want<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.440> show<00:04:36.560> you<00:04:36.620> what<00:04:36.770> i've

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
okay i just want to show you what i've

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.650 
okay i just want to show you what i've
learned<00:04:37.070> about<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> rain<00:04:37.550> fly<00:04:37.820> it<00:04:38.540> was

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
learned about the rain fly it was

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.960 
learned about the rain fly it was
probably<00:04:38.960> designed<00:04:39.890> like<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.190> I'm<00:04:40.730> not<00:04:40.790> sure

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
probably designed like this I'm not sure

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.270 
probably designed like this I'm not sure
but<00:04:41.210> what<00:04:41.900> I've<00:04:42.020> done<00:04:42.230> if<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.710> can<00:04:42.860> see<00:04:43.070> is

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
but what I've done if you can see is

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.910 
but what I've done if you can see is
I've<00:04:43.460> clipped<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.300> end<00:04:44.660> of<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.650> rain<00:04:46.490> fly<00:04:46.700> to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
I've clipped the end of the rain fly to

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.540 
I've clipped the end of the rain fly to
to<00:04:48.920> the<00:04:49.040> carabiner<00:04:51.040> weather<00:04:52.040> will<00:04:52.250> be<00:04:52.280> slain

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
to the carabiner weather will be slain

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.330 
to the carabiner weather will be slain
joins<00:04:52.820> where<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.390> suspension<00:04:53.900> joins<00:04:54.340> I've

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
joins where the suspension joins I've

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.850 
joins where the suspension joins I've
done<00:04:55.490> out<00:04:55.610> of<00:04:55.640> both<00:04:55.850> ends<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.530> keeps<00:04:57.770> it

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
done out of both ends and that keeps it

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.130 
done out of both ends and that keeps it
really<00:04:58.130> taught<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:59.950> then<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.220> comes<00:05:01.460> with

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
really taught and then it comes with

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.930 
really taught and then it comes with
guidelines<00:05:03.140> at<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.830> bottom<00:05:04.100> so<00:05:04.310> you<00:05:04.550> can<00:05:04.730> peg

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
guidelines at the bottom so you can peg

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.240 
guidelines at the bottom so you can peg
it<00:05:05.060> out<00:05:05.440> let<00:05:06.440> me<00:05:06.530> just<00:05:06.680> get<00:05:06.740> a<00:05:06.800> close-up<00:05:07.040> of

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
it out let me just get a close-up of

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.790 
it out let me just get a close-up of
those<00:05:07.960> ok<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.050> comes<00:05:09.110> with<00:05:09.410> these<00:05:09.530> guylines

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.130 

you<00:05:12.800> use<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.730> peg<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.600> rain<00:05:14.750> fire<00:05:14.990> I

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
you use it to peg out the rain fire I

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.340 
you use it to peg out the rain fire I
assume<00:05:15.670> or<00:05:16.670> tie<00:05:16.850> it<00:05:16.910> out<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.120> foliage<00:05:17.480> but

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
assume or tie it out the foliage but

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.100 
assume or tie it out the foliage but
what<00:05:18.470> I've<00:05:18.590> discovered<00:05:18.890> is<00:05:19.100> if<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.550> add<00:05:20.110> loops

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
what I've discovered is if you add loops

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.520 
what I've discovered is if you add loops
to<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.410> bottom<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:22.030> draw<00:05:23.030> them<00:05:23.260> across<00:05:24.260> each

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
to the bottom and draw them across each

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.720 
to the bottom and draw them across each
other<00:05:24.940> like<00:05:25.940> doors<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:27.560> can<00:05:27.590> then<00:05:27.920> use<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
other like doors you can then use the

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.610 
other like doors you can then use the
loop<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:30.250> just<00:05:31.250> hook<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.670> over<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:33.140> foot<00:05:33.410> of

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
loop and just hook it over the foot of

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.410 
loop and just hook it over the foot of
the<00:05:33.950> arch<00:05:35.440> in<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.910> same<00:05:37.910> way<00:05:38.030> that<00:05:38.150> you<00:05:38.240> did

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
the arch in the same way that you did

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.030 
the arch in the same way that you did
when<00:05:38.780> you're<00:05:38.930> originally<00:05:39.320> erecting<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.890> rain

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
when you're originally erecting the rain

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.740 
when you're originally erecting the rain
fly<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:44.260> that<00:05:45.760> spreads<00:05:46.760> these<00:05:46.940> closed<00:05:47.360> doors

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
fly and that spreads these closed doors

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.950 
fly and that spreads these closed doors
and<00:05:48.110> along<00:05:48.410> with<00:05:49.120> the<00:05:50.120> stretch<00:05:50.420> credit<00:05:50.840> by

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
and along with the stretch credit by

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.550 
and along with the stretch credit by
clipping<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:52.270> carabiners<00:05:53.270> at<00:05:53.360> the<00:05:53.450> top<00:05:53.690> it

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
clipping to the carabiners at the top it

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.080 
clipping to the carabiners at the top it
now<00:05:54.770> no<00:05:55.040> longer<00:05:55.190> touches<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.760> netting

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
now no longer touches the netting

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.540 
now no longer touches the netting
there's<00:05:56.270> a<00:05:56.300> nice<00:05:56.480> space<00:05:57.020> between<00:05:57.410> this<00:05:58.340> rain

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
there's a nice space between this rain

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.710 
there's a nice space between this rain
fly<00:05:58.730> on<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:58.910> netting<00:05:59.180> so<00:05:59.330> there's<00:05:59.480> not<00:05:59.600> going

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
fly on the netting so there's not going

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.090 
fly on the netting so there's not going
to<00:05:59.780> be<00:05:59.870> any<00:06:00.020> transfer<00:06:00.380> of<00:06:00.470> moisture<00:06:00.860> it's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
to be any transfer of moisture it's

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.400 
to be any transfer of moisture it's
definitely<00:06:01.310> keep<00:06:01.730> you<00:06:01.760> dry<00:06:02.050> which<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.170> really

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
definitely keep you dry which I really

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.320 
definitely keep you dry which I really
like<00:06:03.670> the<00:06:04.670> only<00:06:04.760> problem<00:06:05.090> with<00:06:05.180> this<00:06:05.270> method

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
like the only problem with this method

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.469 
like the only problem with this method
is<00:06:05.810> with<00:06:06.590> this<00:06:06.710> being<00:06:06.920> fairly<00:06:07.370> small<00:06:07.640> talk

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.150 

I'm<00:06:13.479> not<00:06:13.840> sure<00:06:14.080> that<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.290> is<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:14.889> to<00:06:14.949> keep

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
I'm not sure that that is going to keep

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.310 
I'm not sure that that is going to keep
my<00:06:15.970> under<00:06:16.540> quilt<00:06:16.780> or<00:06:17.380> my<00:06:17.650> gear<00:06:17.889> shelf<00:06:18.220> dry<00:06:19.320> it's

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
my under quilt or my gear shelf dry it's

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.260 
my under quilt or my gear shelf dry it's
going<00:06:20.440> to<00:06:20.470> keep<00:06:20.620> me<00:06:20.830> dry<00:06:21.009> in<00:06:21.280> the<00:06:21.400> hammock<00:06:21.699> but

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
going to keep me dry in the hammock but

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.719 
going to keep me dry in the hammock but
if<00:06:22.509> you've<00:06:22.660> got<00:06:22.870> heavy<00:06:23.229> rain<00:06:23.560> or<00:06:23.860> sideways

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
if you've got heavy rain or sideways

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.670 
if you've got heavy rain or sideways
rain<00:06:25.030> that's<00:06:25.840> probably<00:06:26.139> not<00:06:26.259> going<00:06:26.410> to<00:06:26.470> work

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
rain that's probably not going to work

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.800 
rain that's probably not going to work
so<00:06:27.039> I'm<00:06:27.759> probably<00:06:28.060> still<00:06:28.210> going<00:06:28.509> to<00:06:28.570> have<00:06:28.690> to

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
so I'm probably still going to have to

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.219 
so I'm probably still going to have to
pack<00:06:28.990> at<00:06:29.169> are<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.650> bigot<00:06:30.039> are<00:06:30.600> to<00:06:31.600> throw<00:06:31.840> up<00:06:32.020> if

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:32.229 
pack at are a bigot are to throw up if

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:35.129 
pack at are a bigot are to throw up if
the<00:06:32.680> weather<00:06:32.710> turns<00:06:32.949> really<00:06:33.490> bad<00:06:33.750> but<00:06:34.750> this<00:06:34.960> is

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:35.139 
the weather turns really bad but this is

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:36.900 
the weather turns really bad but this is
this<00:06:35.380> is<00:06:35.530> perfect<00:06:35.919> for<00:06:36.070> if<00:06:36.310> I<00:06:36.520> know<00:06:36.580> it's<00:06:36.820> going

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
this is perfect for if I know it's going

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.760 
this is perfect for if I know it's going
to<00:06:36.970> be<00:06:37.060> a<00:06:37.120> fairly<00:06:37.330> good<00:06:37.570> day<00:06:37.750> and<00:06:38.410> that's<00:06:38.620> just

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
to be a fairly good day and that's just

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.920 
to be a fairly good day and that's just
there<00:06:39.340> for<00:06:39.370> emergencies<00:06:39.970> or<00:06:40.509> for<00:06:40.720> nighttime

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
there for emergencies or for nighttime

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.820 
there for emergencies or for nighttime
or<00:06:41.289> whatever<00:06:41.560> get<00:06:42.009> a<00:06:42.039> bit<00:06:42.220> of<00:06:42.250> privacy

absolutely perfect I love it last few

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.730 
absolutely perfect I love it last few
points<00:06:47.860> I<00:06:48.039> have<00:06:49.560> replaced<00:06:50.820> this<00:06:52.650> where<00:06:53.650> you

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
points I have replaced this where you

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.050 
points I have replaced this where you
used<00:06:53.889> to<00:06:53.979> have<00:06:54.130> to<00:06:54.250> type<00:06:54.460> or<00:06:54.669> not<00:06:54.850> and<00:06:55.030> just

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
used to have to type or not and just

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.310 
used to have to type or not and just
create<00:06:56.020> an<00:06:56.229> infinite<00:06:56.500> loop<00:06:56.830> and<00:06:57.810> either<00:06:58.810> being

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
create an infinite loop and either being

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.700 
create an infinite loop and either being
it<00:06:59.470> to<00:06:59.620> it<00:06:59.740> so<00:06:59.949> it<00:07:00.010> just<00:07:00.190> clips<00:07:00.400> on<00:07:00.610> like<00:07:00.789> that

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.710 
it to it so it just clips on like that

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.159 
it to it so it just clips on like that
I'll<00:07:02.710> create<00:07:03.039> the<00:07:03.190> loop<00:07:03.400> just<00:07:03.970> by<00:07:04.120> using<00:07:04.330> to

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
I'll create the loop just by using to

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.760 
I'll create the loop just by using to
fisherman's<00:07:05.770> bends<00:07:06.900> tie<00:07:07.900> to<00:07:07.960> tie<00:07:08.349> the<00:07:08.410> rope<00:07:08.620> to

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:08.770 
fisherman's bends tie to tie the rope to

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.469 
fisherman's bends tie to tie the rope to
itself<00:07:09.070> as<00:07:09.220> if<00:07:09.340> your<00:07:09.460> time<00:07:09.669> to<00:07:10.120> different

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
itself as if your time to different

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.230 
itself as if your time to different
ropes<00:07:11.110> together<00:07:11.289> with<00:07:11.560> fishing<00:07:11.830> Bend<00:07:12.240> and

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 
ropes together with fishing Bend and

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.370 
ropes together with fishing Bend and
that<00:07:13.599> creates<00:07:13.930> the<00:07:13.990> loop<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:15.310> then<00:07:15.490> I<00:07:15.610> just

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
that creates the loop and then I just

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.270 
that creates the loop and then I just
obviously<00:07:17.380> you<00:07:17.470> have<00:07:17.620> two<00:07:17.740> threaded<00:07:18.070> it

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280 
obviously you have two threaded it

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.650 
obviously you have two threaded it
through<00:07:18.490> this<00:07:18.639> tab<00:07:18.910> before<00:07:19.090> you<00:07:19.360> create<00:07:19.570> that

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:19.660 
through this tab before you create that

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.140 
through this tab before you create that
loop<00:07:19.930> and<00:07:20.110> then<00:07:20.650> you<00:07:20.800> just<00:07:20.979> clip<00:07:21.699> to<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:21.910> N<00:07:22.060> a

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150 
loop and then you just clip to the N a

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.550 
loop and then you just clip to the N a
nap<00:07:22.300> sword<00:07:23.430> the<00:07:24.430> other<00:07:24.550> thing<00:07:24.729> is<00:07:24.910> I<00:07:25.560> was

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 
nap sword the other thing is I was

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.159 
nap sword the other thing is I was
worried<00:07:28.680> with<00:07:29.680> this<00:07:29.830> not<00:07:30.010> having<00:07:30.250> two<00:07:30.490> layers

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:31.169 
worried with this not having two layers

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:33.510 
worried with this not having two layers
what<00:07:32.169> I<00:07:32.199> was<00:07:32.349> going<00:07:32.440> to<00:07:32.500> do<00:07:32.680> with<00:07:33.099> the<00:07:33.190> mattress

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 
what I was going to do with the mattress

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.760 
what I was going to do with the mattress
but<00:07:33.699> I<00:07:33.760> didn't<00:07:34.060> see<00:07:34.300> it<00:07:34.990> sits<00:07:35.229> in<00:07:35.380> there<00:07:35.530> nicely

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770 
but I didn't see it sits in there nicely

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.980 
but I didn't see it sits in there nicely
I<00:07:36.190> think<00:07:36.639> with<00:07:36.789> these<00:07:36.909> arches<00:07:37.330> creating<00:07:37.960> a

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
I think with these arches creating a

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.300 
I think with these arches creating a
short<00:07:38.229> of<00:07:38.349> a<00:07:38.729> sort<00:07:39.729> of<00:07:39.760> tube<00:07:40.120> shape<00:07:40.479> I<00:07:41.310> stepped

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.310 
short of a sort of tube shape I stepped

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.469 
short of a sort of tube shape I stepped
on<00:07:42.400> it<00:07:42.460> last<00:07:42.639> night<00:07:42.820> and<00:07:42.849> there's<00:07:43.060> no<00:07:43.180> worries

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:43.479 
on it last night and there's no worries

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:44.820 
on it last night and there's no worries
about<00:07:43.570> rolling<00:07:43.960> up<00:07:44.110> on<00:07:44.289> and<00:07:44.500> offered<00:07:44.740> it

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
about rolling up on and offered it

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.560 
about rolling up on and offered it
wasn't<00:07:45.039> popping<00:07:45.250> out<00:07:45.430> place<00:07:45.699> it<00:07:45.729> if<00:07:46.030> anything

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:46.570 
wasn't popping out place it if anything

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.560 
wasn't popping out place it if anything
it<00:07:46.690> was<00:07:46.780> actually<00:07:47.139> more<00:07:47.380> stable<00:07:48.039> than<00:07:48.240> it<00:07:49.240> has

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:49.570 
it was actually more stable than it has

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.140 
it was actually more stable than it has
been<00:07:49.599> in<00:07:50.050> the<00:07:50.289> twenty<00:07:50.560> twelve<00:07:50.680> mugga<00:07:51.150> so

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.150 
been in the twenty twelve mugga so

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.050 
been in the twenty twelve mugga so
overall<00:07:53.099> this<00:07:54.099> is<00:07:54.310> definitely<00:07:54.699> my<00:07:54.760> new

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.060 
overall this is definitely my new

00:07:55.060 --> 00:08:06.070 
overall this is definitely my new
sleeping<00:07:56.020> system<00:07:56.440> of<00:07:56.530> choice

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
