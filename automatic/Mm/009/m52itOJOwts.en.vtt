of<00:01:03.990> course<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.370> right<00:01:05.640> angle<00:01:06.360> for

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
of course you need the right angle for

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.770 
of course you need the right angle for
this<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.100> course<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.910> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> hard<00:01:09.660> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
this and of course it's kind of hard to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.700 
this and of course it's kind of hard to
record<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.740> general<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:12.260> think<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
record it in general I think this is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.590 
record it in general I think this is
just<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:14.160> about<00:01:14.190> the<00:01:14.610> disparate<00:01:14.970> technology
