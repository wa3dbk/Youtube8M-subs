00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 hey people here are from ford with halo 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.400
 anniversary thelon terminals part 5 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.530
 double at the very beginning of the mission 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.900
 bike is the eighth terminal 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.480
 on the other side of this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.480
 It's pretty easy to find 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.370
 the piÃ±ata skull in the same mission 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.550
 is a bit harder to achieve than that 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:29.250
 terminal in front but that's what you get 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.330
 of course, too 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.760
 that's what you need for that skull 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.230
 a bungee game to the point at the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.480
 a big fight between plate and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.150
 alliance with two raves takes place 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.980
 after you fly to benji time flies 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.430
 He 'll be back all the way to the end 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.170
 big entrance where he came from 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.520
 on the large area above you can find 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.520
 then the teenie old skull 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.990
 again on the bridge of the trooper 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.640
 reconciliation in the mission gravel 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.110
 This time you will be under the control 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.110
 platform the nine dates 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.240
 the last terminal is on 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.780
 the level of the maw on the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:27.649
 second level of the chamber b and e mails 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.710
 so in about the terminal 1 must be said 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:35.439
 yet all that can only be in us 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.439
 remake graphic can be found 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.750
 There is also the 50 g success 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.880
 Dear Diary 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.180
 You get that if you have all the terminals 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 after collecting in the level 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.540
 the git all for generators 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.670
 destroyed means nothing like it 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.410
 get off the ship so grab yourself 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 a rock and ride to the spot 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.119
 at which you should pick up before the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.430
 There are pipes on the sides of the bridge 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.740
 then on the front right pipe away 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.479
 The skull is simply used on board 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.000
 to occur on that and collects it 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.560
 the stone but it was respectful to one 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 very very slippery 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.950
 I thank you for seeing something 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.100
 and for the patience they bring 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.740
 would have to see this series finished 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.380
 that took about a year to go 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.180
 the squares was finally finished 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.460
 finished with episode 5 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.180
 halo skull under minus 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.650
 thanks for to see it again and pass 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.820
 the partly abstruse best again 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.860
 Write a comment if it is you 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.960
 I did not like the writing down 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.960
