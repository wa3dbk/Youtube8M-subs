develop<00:00:47.489> rot<00:00:48.090> organisms<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> would<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.170> make

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
develop rot organisms and would not make

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.610 
develop rot organisms and would not make
a<00:00:49.440> good<00:00:49.770> tuber<00:00:50.160> next<00:00:50.460> spring<00:00:50.730> anyway<00:00:51.620> after

a good tuber next spring anyway after
several<00:00:53.280> days<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> two<00:00:54.059> weeks<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.750> find

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
several days to two weeks and you find

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
several days to two weeks and you find
that<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> tops<00:00:55.530> have<00:00:55.770> begun<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.219> die<00:00:56.430> down<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that the tops have begun to die down and

their roots have begun to shrivel you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.529 
their roots have begun to shrivel you
can<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.129> ahead<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> remove<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.420> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
can go ahead and remove those so that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
can go ahead and remove those so that
you<00:01:00.629> only<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> tuber<00:01:01.920> itself<00:01:02.309> then

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you only have just the tuber itself then

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.329 
you only have just the tuber itself then
that<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.239> store<00:01:03.589> then<00:01:04.589> once<00:01:05.129> these
