00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
perfectly empty glass now i'm going to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.260 
perfectly empty glass now i'm going to
place<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.230> in<00:01:45.590> there<00:01:45.770> I<00:01:46.150> think<00:01:47.150> I've<00:01:47.240> got

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
place that in there I think I've got

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.630 
place that in there I think I've got
enough<00:01:47.390> vibrations<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:48.710> I'm<00:01:49.430> going<00:01:49.580> to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
enough vibrations and then I'm going to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.120 
enough vibrations and then I'm going to
put<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:49.880> hanky<00:01:50.840> over<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.260> there<00:01:51.500> each<00:01:51.740> other

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
vibration all right and he only does

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.679 
vibration all right and he only does
that<00:03:12.129> on<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.430> trick<00:03:12.760> it's<00:03:12.969> not<00:03:13.120> like<00:03:13.299> every

trick he does he has to touch somebody
does<00:03:16.000> that<00:03:16.180> just<00:03:16.420> be<00:03:16.540> stupid<00:03:16.780> wouldn't<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.260> you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
does that just be stupid wouldn't it you

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
really should come and do this in a sort

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.229 
really should come and do this in a sort
of<00:03:19.659> close<00:03:19.870> up<00:03:20.109> so<00:03:20.319> you<00:03:20.379> can<00:03:20.560> actually<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:21.239> how

Malthus<00:03:22.689> I<00:03:22.840> am<00:03:22.959> are<00:03:23.109> doing<00:03:23.379> this<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:23.920> is

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
Malthus I am are doing this but this is

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.250 
Malthus I am are doing this but this is
a<00:03:24.159> figure<00:03:24.430> of<00:03:24.489> speech<00:03:24.670> if<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.629> watch<00:03:25.780> person

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
a figure of speech if you watch person

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.110 
a figure of speech if you watch person
and<00:03:26.560> I'll<00:03:26.709> see<00:03:26.889> how<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.129> no<00:03:27.340> need<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.909> you

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
and I'll see how it no need for that you

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.330 
and I'll see how it no need for that you
see<00:03:28.299> that's<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.720> no<00:03:29.560> you're<00:03:29.829> not<00:03:29.919> getting<00:03:30.099> any

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
see that's not no you're not getting any

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.059 
see that's not no you're not getting any
vibrations<00:03:30.970> area<00:03:31.389> you<00:03:32.200> see<00:03:32.379> where<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> Perito

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
vibrations area you see where the Perito

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.789 
vibrations area you see where the Perito
factors<00:03:33.609> now<00:03:34.569> why<00:03:35.169> are<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.290> gonna<00:03:35.409> see<00:03:35.650> now

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
factors now why are you gonna see now

in<00:03:40.930> stole<00:03:41.200> his<00:03:41.379> thunder<00:03:41.739> but<00:03:41.769> this<00:03:42.359> right<00:03:43.359> not

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
in stole his thunder but this right not

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.679 
in stole his thunder but this right not
him<00:03:44.169> but<00:03:44.430> somebody<00:03:45.430> else<00:03:45.639> on<00:03:45.939> this<00:03:46.060> program<00:03:46.329> is

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:46.689 
him but somebody else on this program is

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.379 
him but somebody else on this program is
gonna<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.139> a<00:03:47.169> trick<00:03:47.560> well<00:03:48.340> I've<00:03:48.760> seen<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.329> a

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
gonna do a trick well I've seen that a

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:50.940 
gonna do a trick well I've seen that a
thousand<00:03:49.810> times<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.290> think<00:03:50.469> it's<00:03:50.620> camera

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
thousand times and I think it's camera
