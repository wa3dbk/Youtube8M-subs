00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.370
 it's in the front area of him 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.870

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.330
 down ponderable 0 17 18 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.680

 that we will feel for the menu that good 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.670
 that's why we live less than 1 jose and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:26.050
 and computer cepeda 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.050
 computer cp this structure 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.770
 good good good we're still here 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.010
 we are not less eyes 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.700
 of dishes two vouchers here like where is 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.690
 the point that we have found before 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.190
 simple 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.610
 we would be here 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.200
 but we drag right here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.330
 binder 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.720
 to replace that I have already put 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.720
 doing 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.950
 we go down below here the philips and there 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.500
 we would find psm for ps3 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.959
 efe points for the integrated by this 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.959
 from here we are 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.100
 hinojosa in bot vale 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.930
 that 's the menu itself the debut is that 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.660
 we said we put you directly then 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.840
 it's attractive you get the record that the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.130
 weapon puts you 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.130
 what else do we do? 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.830
 so the look is on the weapon many things 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.590
 very cool once we 've done 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.860
 that will be behind the whole 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.870
 and we would look for a layer of sama tmp 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:51.880
 inside the mp for a job at all 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.880
 it serves as you know things in you valÃ©s 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.280
 hinojosa then we drag it to the 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.780
 same site that I said before here to the 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.800
 right 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.290
 replacing the compound as Well one 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.380
 Once you do that false to local vale 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.450
 active is the menu I think that was the 3 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.030
 and r3 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.420
 he bought it seems google according to the menu 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.110
 what do you want 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:23.170
 good that place you activate it and it's already 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.170
 you can enjoy online or wherever you want 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.080
