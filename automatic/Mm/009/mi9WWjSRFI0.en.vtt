00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.280

 worried will he need to know more expensive 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.940
 lennon perrin rohff three rare cards 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.670
 like that it limits I like it changes 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.320
 or in addition to the same homework that not 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.840
 used to have card shots 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.110
 like sade river but hey it's not 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.490
 top 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.480
 frankly I tell you I said when 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.530
 even bring them this year pac 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.930

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.100

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:48.030

 given times my next player win 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.140
 so 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.540
 a map a shape for the moment but 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.819
 there is a side anyway right the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.849
 cleac'h brit air we'll say it goes 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.870
 and again yeah I think of being the 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.469
 best player I've seen next to a 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.519
 good time apple johnson h amrani mar lô 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.159

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.090
 foutage of mouth is not that up there 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.430
 or ozil 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.430
 that's a good little player 86 2 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.509
 general it's good even if it's not 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.180
 here you have understood it's okay but 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.710
 it's that day - we're typing on tape 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.199
 heavy good it's in German it's 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.380
 maybe it's not that guys who got 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.639
 still seen just now the way 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.820
 Bernardi with selestat of better 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.919
 notes it's stiff is there what costs 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.780
 dear in the end I do not think at all of this 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:43.570
 single day can but kraut hockey 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.250
 djilobodji 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.690
 yeah ben haddou rocket rocket 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.669
 ok guys are playing the little one 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.800
 last pack to 15 me crazy for this pack 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.710
 opening go give me a nice card 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.680
 down there that silva ends well I'll have 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.590
 87.2 general with luiz gustavo who has 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.389
 marked no it's really frankly there 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.680
 ends on an awesome leap because it 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.259
 would have been shocking even to have that 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:09.020
 a few days to 86.2 general and aline 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.240
 silver form to 113 114 2 general I 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.340
 believe so here is the little silva at least 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.550
 this is not bad we will say that like 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.690
 it 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.449
 so here are the guys I hope we're launching 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.380
 do not believe that pennington six special 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.490
 defender will have made you happy if 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.110
 this is the case how guys place 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.590
 little blue thumbs that really does 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.610
 pleasure 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.440
 do not hesitate to put the 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.509
 comments will you tell me you 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.340

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.750
 had a blue player which one or a big one 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.610
 player frankly says that me that in 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.050
 comments I would see it well your 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.940
 returns in relation to that so here it is 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.440
 will normally have other packs 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.990
 opening for minors for 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.020
 attackers and then for all 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.460
 players together I 'll do a big live 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.870
 definitely 24 hours I would tell you a 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.070
 little more in the days that go 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.210
 come our valleys the story of this 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.139
