00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.620 

have<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.800> ever<00:00:13.980> wondered<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.700> effects<00:00:15.180> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
have you ever wondered what effects the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.030 
have you ever wondered what effects the
stopping<00:00:16.170> distance<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.860> car<00:00:18.349> well<00:00:19.349> well

stopping distance of a car well well

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
stopping distance of a car well well
there's<00:00:20.460> two<00:00:20.730> main<00:00:21.029> factors<00:00:23.060> braking

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
there's two main factors braking

there's two main factors braking
distance<00:00:34.460> how<00:00:35.460> fast<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:35.970> stop<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> car

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
distance how fast you can stop the car

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.870 
distance how fast you can stop the car
depends<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.500> reaction<00:00:38.010> time<00:00:40.880> your

depends on your reaction time your
reaction<00:00:42.269> time<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:42.809> quickly<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.350> brain

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
reaction time is how quickly your brain

we're<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.900> thinking<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.530> stopping

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
we're just thinking about stopping

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the car to stop this depends on lots of

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
the car to stop this depends on lots of
factors<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.700> condition<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> car

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
factors like the condition of the car

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.880 
factors like the condition of the car
the<00:01:21.780> condition<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> his<00:01:22.290> tires<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.829> the
