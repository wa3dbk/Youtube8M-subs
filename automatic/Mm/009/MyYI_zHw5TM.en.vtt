welcome<00:00:04.279> to<00:00:04.730> sweet<00:00:05.090> Maria's<00:00:05.600> coffee<00:00:06.910> okay<00:00:07.910> I

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
welcome to sweet Maria's coffee okay I

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.850 
welcome to sweet Maria's coffee okay I
keep<00:00:08.780> trying<00:00:08.990> to<00:00:09.019> figure<00:00:09.200> out<00:00:09.380> how<00:00:09.589> to<00:00:09.650> make

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
keep trying to figure out how to make

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.860 
keep trying to figure out how to make
videos<00:00:10.400> that<00:00:10.429> are<00:00:10.759> really<00:00:10.849> short<00:00:11.209> so<00:00:11.660> what<00:00:11.839> I

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
videos that are really short so what I

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.589 
videos that are really short so what I
did<00:00:12.169> is<00:00:13.099> I<00:00:13.219> got<00:00:13.370> the<00:00:13.459> sample<00:00:13.730> roaster<00:00:14.240> going

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
did is I got the sample roaster going

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.279 
did is I got the sample roaster going
but<00:00:15.100> there<00:00:16.100> we<00:00:16.190> go<00:00:16.340> we<00:00:17.030> got<00:00:17.060> three<00:00:17.810> minutes<00:00:18.140> on

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
but there we go we got three minutes on

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:19.850 
but there we go we got three minutes on
the<00:00:18.410> clock

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
the clock

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.010 
the clock
so<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> only<00:00:20.610> have<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:20.940> extremely<00:00:21.420> limited

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so I only have an extremely limited

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.150 
so I only have an extremely limited
amount<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.350> time<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.710> show<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:25.100> this<00:00:26.100> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
amount of time to show you this this is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.359 
amount of time to show you this this is
called<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.850> quest<00:00:27.680> m3<00:00:29.180> roaster<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:31.020> is<00:00:31.800> made

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
called the quest m3 roaster it is made

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.189 
called the quest m3 roaster it is made
in<00:00:32.550> Taiwan<00:00:32.970> hi<00:00:33.620> hi<00:00:34.620> mom

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
in Taiwan hi hi mom

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.780 
in Taiwan hi hi mom
it's<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.350> 110<00:00:37.800> volt<00:00:38.000> roaster<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.769> it's<00:00:40.790> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it's a 110 volt roaster and it's it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's a 110 volt roaster and it's it's
pretty<00:00:42.059> nifty<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:42.989> could<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.379> working

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
pretty nifty if I could get it working

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.950 
pretty nifty if I could get it working
right<00:00:43.920> we<00:00:44.640> keep<00:00:45.030> burning<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.600> heating

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
right we keep burning out heating

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
right we keep burning out heating
elements<00:00:46.350> on<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:47.730> give<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
elements on it I want to just give you a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.219 
elements on it I want to just give you a
little<00:00:48.269> preview<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.199> it<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.100> love<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:51.229 
little preview of it because I love it

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:53.509 
little preview of it because I love it
it's<00:00:52.229> really<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.650> something<00:00:52.949> more<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
it's really like something more that

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.240 
it's really like something more that
came<00:00:53.729> out<00:00:53.909> of<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> workshop<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.559> than<00:00:56.100> an

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
came out of a workshop you know than an

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.539 
came out of a workshop you know than an
ax<00:00:56.420> appliance<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.690> mean<00:00:58.049> it's<00:00:58.830> all<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.040> sort

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
ax appliance I mean it's all just sort

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.390 
ax appliance I mean it's all just sort
of<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.479> know<00:01:00.510> screwed<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.320> riveted<00:01:01.769> here<00:01:02.220> you

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
of you know screwed and riveted here you

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.270 
of you know screwed and riveted here you
can<00:01:02.549> take<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:02.940> any<00:01:03.180> panel<00:01:03.659> you<00:01:03.809> want<00:01:04.280> you

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
can take off any panel you want you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.870 
can take off any panel you want you
could<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.610> changes<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.700> bottom<00:01:08.700> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
could make changes on the bottom it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
could make changes on the bottom it's
essentially<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.720> small<00:01:10.140> computer<00:01:10.409> fan

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
essentially like a small computer fan

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.219 
essentially like a small computer fan
you<00:01:11.430> could<00:01:11.640> swap<00:01:11.940> that<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.479> could<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.049> see

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you could swap that out I could just see

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289 
you could swap that out I could just see
from<00:01:13.979> mechanically<00:01:14.640> inclined<00:01:15.030> or

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
from mechanically inclined or

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.060 
from mechanically inclined or
engineering<00:01:15.960> type<00:01:16.170> people<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.799> there's<00:01:17.010> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
engineering type people that there's a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.550 
engineering type people that there's a
lot<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.790> here<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.290> where<00:01:19.439> you're

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
lot you can do here this is where you're

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.620 
lot you can do here this is where you're
gonna<00:01:19.650> collect<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.580> chaff<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.450> going

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
gonna collect your chaff which is going

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
gonna collect your chaff which is going
to<00:01:22.400> come<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:25.040> across<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> roaster<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to come from the across the roaster and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.330 
to come from the across the roaster and
it's<00:01:26.910> essentially<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:28.290> basket<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.160> with<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's essentially a basket here with a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.300 
it's essentially a basket here with a
fan<00:01:29.670> pulling<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.330> downdraft<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:32.010> creates

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
fan pulling a downdraft so that creates

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
fan pulling a downdraft so that creates
an<00:01:32.430> airflow<00:01:32.730> through<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.060> drum<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.230> airflow

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
an airflow through the drum the airflow

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.550 
an airflow through the drum the airflow
is<00:01:34.650> controlled<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.550> fan<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:37.320> fan

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
is controlled by a fan here the fan

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.130 
is controlled by a fan here the fan
speed<00:01:37.860> here<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.370> here's<00:01:38.790> your<00:01:39.060> heat<00:01:39.690> setting

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
speed here and here's your heat setting

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
speed here and here's your heat setting
essentially<00:01:40.710> which<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.160> in<00:01:41.550> by<00:01:42.270> controlling

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
essentially which is in by controlling

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.660 
essentially which is in by controlling
aerials<00:01:43.170> there

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
aerials there

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.500 
aerials there
it's<00:01:45.480> runs<00:01:45.990> off<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> timer<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:48.270> there

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
it's runs off a timer which is there

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's runs off a timer which is there
basically<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.290> on-off<00:01:49.920> switch<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.520> also

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
basically as an on-off switch but also

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.710 
basically as an on-off switch but also
to<00:01:51.290> keep<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> from<00:01:53.120> going<00:01:54.120> on<00:01:54.360> forever

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
to keep it from going on forever

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.220 
to keep it from going on forever
-<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.980> know<00:01:57.130> auto-shutoff<00:01:57.700> essentially<00:01:58.390> so

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
- you know auto-shutoff essentially so

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.630 
- you know auto-shutoff essentially so
what<00:01:59.350> I'm<00:01:59.440> doing<00:01:59.680> here<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.070> you're<00:02:00.400> not<00:02:00.550> gonna

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
what I'm doing here and you're not gonna

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.120 
what I'm doing here and you're not gonna
be<00:02:00.730> able<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:00.940> hear<00:02:01.210> it<00:02:01.360> that's<00:02:02.350> fan<00:02:02.680> at<00:02:02.890> full

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
be able to hear it that's fan at full

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.340 
be able to hear it that's fan at full
speed<00:02:03.430> and<00:02:03.790> thus<00:02:04.240> and<00:02:04.450> son<00:02:04.720> of<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.900> Sampo<00:02:05.200> us

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
speed and thus and son of the Sampo us

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.260 
speed and thus and son of the Sampo us
in<00:02:05.440> the<00:02:05.500> backgrounds<00:02:06.040> but<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.790> barely<00:02:06.940> hear

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
in the backgrounds but I can barely hear

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.010 
in the backgrounds but I can barely hear
it<00:02:07.360> right<00:02:07.510> here

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
it right here

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.710 
it right here
that's<00:02:08.500> fan<00:02:08.770> it<00:02:09.070> at<00:02:09.610> zero<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.300> I'm<00:02:10.360> gonna<00:02:10.510> put

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
that's fan it at zero so I'm gonna put

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.160 
that's fan it at zero so I'm gonna put
it<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.900> four<00:02:11.430> I'm<00:02:12.430> going<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.940> turn<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.690> up<00:02:13.840> and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
it on four I'm going to turn it up and

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.770 
it on four I'm going to turn it up and
this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.500> where<00:02:14.620> we've<00:02:14.770> had<00:02:14.890> trouble<00:02:15.540> we<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:16.690> up

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
this is where we've had trouble we go up

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.810 
this is where we've had trouble we go up
to<00:02:16.900> 10<00:02:17.110> amps<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:19.320> got<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.350> hope<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.820> using

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
to 10 amps here and got I hope I'm using

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.150 
to 10 amps here and got I hope I'm using
the<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.210> term<00:02:22.780> I'm<00:02:23.140> an<00:02:23.260> electrical<00:02:23.620> ideot

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
the right term I'm an electrical ideot

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.300 
the right term I'm an electrical ideot
so<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.960> definitely<00:02:26.710> not<00:02:26.830> carrying<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
so it's definitely not carrying the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.690 
so it's definitely not carrying the
vault<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:27.850> many<00:02:28.240> amps<00:02:28.600> so<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:30.130> seven<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
vault so many amps so that's seven and a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.820 
vault so many amps so that's seven and a
half<00:02:30.730> amps<00:02:31.330> there<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:32.440> we're<00:02:32.590> gonna<00:02:32.680> be

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
half amps there and we're gonna be

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.990 
half amps there and we're gonna be
preheating<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:36.150> our<00:02:37.150> dramas<00:02:37.630> turning<00:02:39.000> let's

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
they're how motivated they are to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.789 
they're how motivated they are to
actually<00:04:16.930> get<00:04:17.350> these<00:04:17.580> to<00:04:18.580> us<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.410> think<00:04:20.410> there's

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
actually get these to us I think there's

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.770 
actually get these to us I think there's
a<00:04:20.859> really<00:04:21.280> neat<00:04:21.519> place<00:04:21.730> form<00:04:22.150> when<00:04:22.360> people<00:04:22.660> are

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
a really neat place form when people are

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.750 
a really neat place form when people are
frustrated<00:04:23.350> with<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> beam<00:04:23.770> or<00:04:24.010> they're

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
frustrated with the beam or they're

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.790 
frustrated with the beam or they're
frustrated<00:04:25.330> with<00:04:25.420> the<00:04:25.510> hot<00:04:25.690> top<00:04:25.930> they've<00:04:26.470> kind

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
frustrated with the hot top they've kind

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.330 
frustrated with the hot top they've kind
of<00:04:26.860> reached<00:04:27.040> that<00:04:27.280> level<00:04:27.960> they<00:04:28.960> really<00:04:29.320> want<00:04:30.160> a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
of reached that level they really want a

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.540 
of reached that level they really want a
miniature<00:04:30.790> craft<00:04:31.330> shop<00:04:32.290> roaster<00:04:32.860> it's<00:04:33.340> what

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
miniature craft shop roaster it's what

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.340 
miniature craft shop roaster it's what
it<00:04:33.670> is<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.480> it's<00:04:34.690> really<00:04:34.900> not<00:04:35.080> much<00:04:35.290> more

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
it is and it's really not much more

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.260 
it is and it's really not much more
money<00:04:35.770> than<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.160> a<00:04:36.190> programmable<00:04:36.790> hot<00:04:37.030> top

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
money than like a programmable hot top

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.720 
money than like a programmable hot top
it's<00:04:37.570> right<00:04:38.470> in<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.650> same<00:04:38.800> league<00:04:38.980> so<00:04:39.310> kind<00:04:39.670> of

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
it's right in the same league so kind of

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.060 
it's right in the same league so kind of
cool<00:04:39.880> little<00:04:40.090> machine<00:04:40.450> we're<00:04:40.840> still<00:04:41.740> figuring

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
cool little machine we're still figuring

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:52.260 
cool little machine we're still figuring
it<00:04:42.280> out<00:04:43.020> all<00:04:44.020> right<00:04:44.280> let's<00:04:45.280> check<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.640> out

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.690 

okay<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.570> lied<00:04:54.470> I'm<00:04:55.070> gonna<00:04:55.220> show<00:04:55.400> you<00:04:55.460> some<00:04:55.670> more

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
okay I lied I'm gonna show you some more

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.650 
okay I lied I'm gonna show you some more
things<00:04:56.060> about<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.420> quest<00:04:58.420> this<00:04:59.420> is<00:05:00.200> the

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
things about the quest this is the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.380 
things about the quest this is the
thermometer<00:05:03.730> because<00:05:04.730> right<00:05:04.940> here

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
thermometer because right here

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.980 
thermometer because right here
it's<00:05:05.930> screw<00:05:06.230> bounce<00:05:06.500> right<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:06.980> there<00:05:07.190> and

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
it's screw bounce right in there and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.630 
it's screw bounce right in there and
what<00:05:08.990> I've<00:05:09.110> simply<00:05:09.470> done<00:05:09.650> is<00:05:09.860> taken<00:05:10.280> a<00:05:10.400> simple

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
what I've simply done is taken a simple

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.710 
what I've simply done is taken a simple
fitting<00:05:11.270> available<00:05:11.990> from<00:05:12.230> Omega<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.600> put<00:05:14.600> in

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
fitting available from Omega and put in

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.590 
fitting available from Omega and put in
a<00:05:14.900> little<00:05:15.740> ferrule<00:05:16.340> there<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:16.910> put<00:05:17.180> in<00:05:17.300> one<00:05:17.570> of

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
a little ferrule there and put in one of

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.230 
a little ferrule there and put in one of
the<00:05:17.920> really<00:05:18.920> inexpensive<00:05:19.610> thermometers

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
the really inexpensive thermometers

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.390 
the really inexpensive thermometers
digital<00:05:20.810> thermometers<00:05:21.260> myself<00:05:21.680> with<00:05:22.370> a

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
digital thermometers myself with a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.660 
digital thermometers myself with a
k-type<00:05:22.940> thermocouple<00:05:23.740> right<00:05:24.740> now<00:05:24.920> it<00:05:25.280> is

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
k-type thermocouple right now it is

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.580 
k-type thermocouple right now it is
pretty<00:05:25.910> much<00:05:26.270> probing<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:26.930> empty<00:05:27.290> space<00:05:27.560> in

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
pretty much probing the empty space in

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.290 
pretty much probing the empty space in
the<00:05:27.830> drum<00:05:28.130> well<00:05:28.490> it's<00:05:28.610> obviously<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.270> because

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
the drum well it's obviously is because

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.600 
the drum well it's obviously is because
I'm<00:05:29.750> just<00:05:29.930> warming<00:05:30.260> up<00:05:30.380> the<00:05:30.500> drum<00:05:30.740> but<00:05:31.430> if<00:05:31.520> you

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
I'm just warming up the drum but if you

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.940 
I'm just warming up the drum but if you
look<00:05:31.820> on<00:05:31.970> either<00:05:32.180> side<00:05:32.570> of<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.990> UM<00:05:33.200> the<00:05:33.560> window

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
look on either side of the UM the window

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.600 
look on either side of the UM the window
there's<00:05:34.400> some<00:05:34.610> nice<00:05:34.820> screws<00:05:35.300> there<00:05:35.630> to

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
there's some nice screws there to

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.840 
there's some nice screws there to
remount<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:37.940> down<00:05:38.270> into<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.290> bean<00:05:39.470> mass<00:05:39.850> so

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
remount that down into the bean mass so

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.640 
remount that down into the bean mass so
there's<00:05:41.210> some<00:05:41.360> real<00:05:41.510> possibilities<00:05:42.230> that<00:05:42.440> for

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
there's some real possibilities that for

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.490 
there's some real possibilities that for
getting<00:05:42.800> some<00:05:43.040> great<00:05:43.250> readings<00:05:43.700> in<00:05:44.330> any<00:05:45.200> case

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
getting some great readings in any case

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.070 
getting some great readings in any case
I<00:05:46.010> wanted<00:05:46.940> to<00:05:47.030> show<00:05:47.210> you<00:05:47.270> a<00:05:47.390> couple<00:05:47.570> things<00:05:47.900> I'm

gonna put the coffee and in a second but

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.230 
gonna put the coffee and in a second but
this<00:05:50.660> is<00:05:50.840> something<00:05:51.140> I<00:05:51.230> just<00:05:51.290> love<00:05:51.910> so<00:05:52.910> this<00:05:53.090> is

this is something I just love so this is

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.240 
this is something I just love so this is
the<00:05:53.390> bean<00:05:53.540> tray<00:05:53.950> basically<00:05:54.950> you're<00:05:55.190> gonna

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
the bean tray basically you're gonna

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.830 
the bean tray basically you're gonna
dump<00:05:55.520> a<00:05:55.640> batch<00:05:55.820> you're<00:05:56.060> gonna<00:05:56.150> open<00:05:56.510> this<00:05:56.630> with

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
dump a batch you're gonna open this with

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.930 
dump a batch you're gonna open this with
the<00:05:56.960> counterweighted<00:05:57.530> handle<00:05:58.070> just<00:05:58.670> like<00:05:58.820> a

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
the counterweighted handle just like a

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.940 
the counterweighted handle just like a
little<00:05:59.270> shop<00:05:59.450> roaster<00:05:59.960> then<00:06:00.710> it's<00:06:00.860> gonna

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
little shop roaster then it's gonna

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.460 
little shop roaster then it's gonna
drive<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.490> coffee<00:06:01.730> out<00:06:01.970> into<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.360> tray<00:06:02.660> you

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
drive the coffee out into the tray you

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.640 
drive the coffee out into the tray you
shake<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:03.830> a<00:06:04.040> little<00:06:04.070> level<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.090> out<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:05.780> you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
shake it a little level it out and you

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.210 
shake it a little level it out and you
basically<00:06:06.860> lift<00:06:07.460> up<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:08.740> pan<00:06:09.740> in<00:06:09.950> the<00:06:10.010> back

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
basically lift up the pan in the back

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.280 
basically lift up the pan in the back
and<00:06:10.790> then<00:06:10.940> the<00:06:11.180> only<00:06:11.390> thing<00:06:11.540> I<00:06:11.630> can<00:06:11.810> see<00:06:11.990> is<00:06:12.020> the

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
and then the only thing I can see is the

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.930 
and then the only thing I can see is the
chaff<00:06:12.560> gets<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:12.920> little<00:06:13.160> moist<00:06:13.400> underneath

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
chaff gets a little moist underneath

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.910 
chaff gets a little moist underneath
there<00:06:14.210> just<00:06:14.900> because<00:06:15.230> of<00:06:15.470> the<00:06:15.710> moisture

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
there just because of the moisture

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.720 
there just because of the moisture
coming<00:06:16.700> from<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:17.120> roast<00:06:17.770> but<00:06:18.770> anyway<00:06:19.430> at<00:06:19.580> this

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:19.730 
coming from the roast but anyway at this

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:21.760 
coming from the roast but anyway at this
point<00:06:20.030> it's<00:06:20.300> dry<00:06:20.630> and<00:06:20.960> you<00:06:21.260> basically<00:06:21.470> are

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
point it's dry and you basically are

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.560 
point it's dry and you basically are
gonna<00:06:21.890> put<00:06:22.160> your<00:06:22.340> hot<00:06:22.550> batch<00:06:23.150> your<00:06:23.360> coffee

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
gonna put your hot batch your coffee

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.680 
gonna put your hot batch your coffee
right<00:06:23.840> here<00:06:24.200> into<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:25.100> top<00:06:25.400> and<00:06:25.730> it's<00:06:26.540> going

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
right here into the top and it's going

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.690 
right here into the top and it's going
to<00:06:26.750> cool

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
to cool

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.650 
to cool
in<00:06:27.790> about<00:06:29.040> two<00:06:30.040> minutes<00:06:30.900> has<00:06:31.900> been<00:06:32.040> average<00:06:33.040> to

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
in about two minutes has been average to

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.470 
in about two minutes has been average to
room<00:06:34.660> temperature<00:06:35.200> cooling<00:06:35.670> perhaps<00:06:36.670> three

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
room temperature cooling perhaps three

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.090 
room temperature cooling perhaps three
minutes<00:06:37.900> at<00:06:38.230> the<00:06:38.350> outside

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.100 
minutes at the outside

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.680 
minutes at the outside
I<00:06:39.130> haven't<00:06:39.700> measured<00:06:40.000> that<00:06:40.150> some<00:06:40.450> kind<00:06:40.630> of

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
I haven't measured that some kind of

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.590 
I haven't measured that some kind of
guesstimating<00:06:41.410> but<00:06:41.620> it's<00:06:41.980> really<00:06:42.280> good<00:06:42.610> it's

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
guesstimating but it's really good it's

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.960 
guesstimating but it's really good it's
a<00:06:43.690> really<00:06:43.720> neat<00:06:44.200> system<00:06:44.440> where<00:06:44.950> you<00:06:45.760> could

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
a really neat system where you could

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.480 
a really neat system where you could
basically<00:06:46.120> move<00:06:46.630> the<00:06:46.810> batch<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.410> then<00:06:47.800> you

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
basically move the batch and then you

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.910 
basically move the batch and then you
have<00:06:48.640> this<00:06:48.880> really<00:06:49.780> nice<00:06:49.960> cooling<00:06:50.350> with<00:06:50.680> no

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920 
have this really nice cooling with no

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.910 
have this really nice cooling with no
mechanical<00:06:51.730> arm<00:06:52.000> no<00:06:52.930> none<00:06:53.260> of<00:06:53.290> the<00:06:53.440> costs

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
mechanical arm no none of the costs

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.680 
mechanical arm no none of the costs
associated<00:06:54.490> with<00:06:54.640> like<00:06:54.880> the<00:06:55.030> hot<00:06:55.210> top<00:06:55.450> which

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
associated with like the hot top which

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.740 
associated with like the hot top which
is<00:06:55.840> spinning<00:06:56.230> you<00:06:57.190> know<00:06:57.730> cooling<00:06:58.150> tray<00:06:58.420> I

00:06:58.740 --> 00:06:58.750 
is spinning you know cooling tray I

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.570 
is spinning you know cooling tray I
think<00:06:59.290> that's<00:06:59.440> just<00:06:59.620> an<00:06:59.830> ingenious<00:07:00.370> way<00:07:00.460> to

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
think that's just an ingenious way to

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.490 
think that's just an ingenious way to
cut<00:07:01.060> costs<00:07:01.540> and<00:07:01.630> get<00:07:01.750> really<00:07:02.080> effective

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
cut costs and get really effective

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.180 
cut costs and get really effective
cooling<00:07:02.890> which<00:07:03.490> is<00:07:03.640> really<00:07:03.880> important<00:07:05.190> I'll

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
cooling which is really important I'll

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.560 
cooling which is really important I'll
show<00:07:06.370> you<00:07:06.430> how<00:07:06.580> you<00:07:06.640> put<00:07:06.910> the<00:07:07.000> batch<00:07:07.150> and<00:07:07.390> they

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
show you how you put the batch and they

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.500 
show you how you put the batch and they
include<00:07:07.870> this<00:07:08.020> little<00:07:08.700> handy<00:07:09.700> dandy<00:07:09.730> scoop

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
include this little handy dandy scoop

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.650 
include this little handy dandy scoop
thing<00:07:11.280> that<00:07:12.280> goes<00:07:12.640> in<00:07:12.850> here

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
thing that goes in here

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.730 
thing that goes in here
I<00:07:14.520> just<00:07:15.520> basically<00:07:15.730> use<00:07:16.270> one<00:07:16.450> my<00:07:16.570> trace<00:07:16.870> this

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
I just basically use one my trace this

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.790 
I just basically use one my trace this
is<00:07:18.010> a<00:07:18.040> 200<00:07:18.700> gram<00:07:18.730> batch<00:07:19.290> that's<00:07:20.290> about<00:07:20.620> the

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
is a 200 gram batch that's about the

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.560 
is a 200 gram batch that's about the
capacity<00:07:20.980> the<00:07:21.400> only<00:07:21.580> thing<00:07:21.820> that<00:07:22.000> is<00:07:22.150> that<00:07:22.390> you

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
capacity the only thing that is that you

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.390 
capacity the only thing that is that you
don't<00:07:22.780> want<00:07:22.900> to<00:07:23.110> pour<00:07:23.560> it<00:07:23.620> in<00:07:23.830> in<00:07:23.950> a<00:07:24.040> way<00:07:24.190> that

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 
don't want to pour it in in a way that

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.670 
don't want to pour it in in a way that
it<00:07:24.490> lands<00:07:24.760> right<00:07:24.910> in<00:07:25.060> here<00:07:25.600> which<00:07:26.260> is<00:07:26.290> where

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 
it lands right in here which is where

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.920 
it lands right in here which is where
that<00:07:26.920> airflow<00:07:27.460> goes<00:07:27.820> through<00:07:28.180> the<00:07:28.360> drum<00:07:28.660> just

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
that airflow goes through the drum just

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:40.389 
that airflow goes through the drum just
like<00:07:29.290> a<00:07:29.320> pro<00:07:29.800> bot<00:07:30.010> does

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:40.399 

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:45.979 

let's<00:07:41.399> start<00:07:41.669> our<00:07:41.819> timers<00:07:44.749> there's<00:07:45.749> our

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:45.989 
let's start our timers there's our

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:48.949 
let's start our timers there's our
coffee<00:07:46.229> we<00:07:46.469> can<00:07:46.889> see<00:07:47.099> it<00:07:47.189> very<00:07:47.429> well<00:07:47.839> very<00:07:48.839> very

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:48.959 
coffee we can see it very well very very

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:53.359 
coffee we can see it very well very very
easily<00:07:49.379> and<00:07:51.169> our<00:07:52.169> temperature<00:07:52.709> we're<00:07:53.219> on<00:07:53.339> a

00:07:53.359 --> 00:07:53.369 
easily and our temperature we're on a

00:07:53.369 --> 00:07:55.159 
easily and our temperature we're on a
normal<00:07:53.639> temperature<00:07:54.119> drop<00:07:54.629> that<00:07:54.869> was<00:07:55.019> about

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:55.169 
normal temperature drop that was about

00:07:55.169 --> 00:07:58.879 
normal temperature drop that was about
250<00:07:55.589> yeah<00:07:55.919> a<00:07:56.309> little<00:07:56.639> bit<00:07:56.759> low<00:07:57.679> so<00:07:58.679> I'm<00:07:58.769> not

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:58.889 
250 yeah a little bit low so I'm not

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.109 
250 yeah a little bit low so I'm not
going<00:07:59.039> to<00:07:59.099> show<00:07:59.279> you<00:07:59.339> the<00:07:59.519> rest<00:07:59.699> of<00:07:59.849> the<00:07:59.909> roast

00:08:00.109 --> 00:08:00.119 
going to show you the rest of the roast

00:08:00.119 --> 00:08:03.909 
going to show you the rest of the roast
but<00:08:00.360> I<00:08:00.389> wanted<00:08:00.749> to<00:08:00.809> add<00:08:01.289> that<00:08:01.619> to<00:08:02.279> the<00:08:02.519> previous

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 
but I wanted to add that to the previous

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:06.489 
but I wanted to add that to the previous
now<00:08:04.919> I<00:08:04.949> have<00:08:05.129> to<00:08:05.219> go<00:08:05.339> check<00:08:05.519> my<00:08:05.669> other<00:08:05.699> rester
