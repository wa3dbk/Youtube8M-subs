00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
compromise between like you know pretty

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.629 
compromise between like you know pretty
good<00:00:13.080> like<00:00:13.440> ultimate<00:00:13.889> protection<00:00:14.190> well<00:00:14.519> not

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
good like ultimate protection well not

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:15.890 
good like ultimate protection well not
so<00:00:14.759> much<00:00:14.880> ultimate<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.389> terms<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.750> like

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so much ultimate in terms of like

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.870 
so much ultimate in terms of like
OtterBox<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.740> know<00:00:16.830> along<00:00:17.460> those<00:00:17.609> lines

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
OtterBox and you know along those lines

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.210 
OtterBox and you know along those lines
but<00:00:18.090> um<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.320> decent<00:00:20.039> protection

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
but um you know pretty decent protection

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.880 
but um you know pretty decent protection
but<00:00:21.029> keeping<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.539> very<00:00:21.900> minimalistic<00:00:22.500> at<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but keeping it very minimalistic at the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.290 
but keeping it very minimalistic at the
same<00:00:23.070> time<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> is<00:00:23.640> actually<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.939> two

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
same time so this is actually a two

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and I like how flat it keeps everything

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.080 
and I like how flat it keeps everything
as<00:00:44.160> well<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.460> what<00:00:44.550> we're<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.700> do

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

as well so what we're gonna do
there's<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.480> no<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:46.050> or<00:00:46.170> wrong<00:00:46.200> way<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
there's really no right or wrong way to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
there's really no right or wrong way to
install<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> personally<00:00:48.420> prefer<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
install this so I personally prefer to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.860 
install this so I personally prefer to
just<00:00:49.020> take<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> bumper<00:00:50.129> off<00:00:50.280> first<00:00:50.579> snap<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
just take the bumper off first snap that

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
just take the bumper off first snap that
in<00:00:52.110> place<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.710> everything<00:00:53.309> automatically

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
in place there everything automatically

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.580 
in place there everything automatically
just<00:00:54.059> lines<00:00:54.270> up<00:00:54.480> perfectly<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.379> cutouts

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just lines up perfectly all the cutouts

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.160 
just lines up perfectly all the cutouts
everything<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> bang<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.989> you'll

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
everything is bang on and then you'll

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.779 
everything is bang on and then you'll
notice<00:00:58.289> we've<00:00:58.559> actually<00:00:58.680> got<00:00:58.920> some<00:00:58.949> tabs<00:00:59.370> on

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
notice we've actually got some tabs on

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.750 
notice we've actually got some tabs on
the<00:01:00.149> bottom<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.620> bumper<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.489> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the bottom of the bumper here and so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
the bottom of the bumper here and so
with<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
with that I like to kind of go from the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.380 
with that I like to kind of go from the
top<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.489> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.729> stick<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
top and just kind of stick it in that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
top and just kind of stick it in that
way<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> mold<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.010> around

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
way and you just kind of mold it around

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
way and you just kind of mold it around
the<00:01:08.369> case<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> eventually<00:01:08.909> everything<00:01:09.390> will

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
the case and eventually everything will

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300 
the case and eventually everything will
just<00:01:09.720> kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> fit<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.229> place<00:01:10.439> again

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
just kind of fit into place again

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
just kind of fit into place again
there's<00:01:11.490> no<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:11.880> wrong<00:01:12.030> way<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.990> put

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there's no right or wrong way to put

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.780 
there's no right or wrong way to put
this<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.950> everything<00:01:14.400> will<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.640> kind<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this on and everything will just kind of

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
this on and everything will just kind of
snap<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.659> there<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.009> that's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
snap in and there I think that's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:17.719 
snap in and there I think that's
everything

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
everything

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.359 
everything
yep<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.180> everything<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.710> really
