00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.740
 hi to all the boys and welcome back 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.210
 today we will see how to recover a phone 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.699
 who is in this situation here 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 or in a boot loop practically for 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.140
 whoever does not know it continues to restart 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.519
 but fails to boot the system 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.640
 operational is a situation that can be 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.040
 check in the normal operations of 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.350
 modding so we can incur as it is 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 happened to me in a corrupt file e 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 then have the phone in this one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.149
 situation here there are three types of but 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 love or a book that is in truth it 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.289
 there are two, but I consider myself 3 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.930
 because it exists but love the mild ones 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 like this one here because we still succeed 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 to access the download mode e 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.640
 those who are practically bric del 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.579
 phone where we fail to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.580
 access the download mode e 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.159
 we will have to resort to gvs b 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.860
 if it's okay or throw practice 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.060
 ning the phone so let's see how 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.650
 hospitalized the phone from this one 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 software situation here 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.900
 the software we need to use e 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 obviously we also need audine 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.590
 firmware in languages ​​of course you find it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.780
 in registration of our s2 so that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.549
 unfortunately we can recharge it being 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.930
 in a boot flop situation not 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.360
 we can do the classic wipe and format 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.790
 to make a clean installation but 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.650
 however, it will then provide all of them now 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.280
 he removed the battery because we have to 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:52.170
 enter but in download mode closed a 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 I hold the phone , I assure you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.130
 It does not leave the battery during 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 operations and we go by from smooth 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.719
 then volume down home key and key 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.719
 power on 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.360
 ok to this screen we confirm with 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.550
 volume up we are now downloading mod 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.360
 I remind you that we must have installed 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.510
 the kies on our computer have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.370
 connected the phone at least once 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.370
 why so that the computer can 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.290
 recognize it when we start working 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.410
 instead with orders we must make sure 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.730
 that no church process is in 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:38.220
 is open so now let's go to pda e 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.080
 let's select the firmware that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.020
 we have to reload so let's go to 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.150
 select our film when it is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.510
 download it found in a zip format lo 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.280
 zip I talk about zip you will have this 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 format here m teaching that what we do 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.200
 need 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.820
 let's open it and then we'll make sure 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 only author boot and reset time are 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.100
 selected 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:13.260
 at this point we can connect the 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.350
 our phone on the computer and how 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.820
 you see it will be recognized by him 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:25.380
 now just press start and wait for the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:27.739
 operations that audine do the sails le 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.739
 own operations 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.710
 as you can see we will begin to see here in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.580
 top left of the writing and one 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.180
 green bar advancing and on the phone 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.880
 we will see this blue bar here now as 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.210
 it takes some time 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.610
 stop and resume will resume when the 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.310
 operations are about to end 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.540
 here we are again or almost has team 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.040
 finished his elaborations then I do 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.990
 see the last few seconds 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.709
 of the workings 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.330
 I remember that this operation is for 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.720
 obviously restore the firmware 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.270
 original so if you followed mine 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.240
 procedures for the acquisition of 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.990
 root permissions for installation 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.720
 of the rom you will also recover the guarantee 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.090
 because as you can see I don't know who 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.950
 escapes the barrier in the room here not 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.950
 the counter is started here 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.530
 ok now the phone will restart ne 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.140
 we will have our s2 as it came out 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.980
 the factory now ends operations 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.540
 after that it will restart again when 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.540
 will be the final reboot 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.140
 here it is 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.170
 well the tutorial is finished 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.240
