instant<00:03:09.980> ability<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.940> turn<00:03:11.360> these<00:03:11.540> on<00:03:11.810> and<00:03:12.080> off

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
instant ability to turn these on and off

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.190 
instant ability to turn these on and off
at<00:03:12.470> will<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:13.550> back<00:03:13.820> side<00:03:14.090> panel<00:03:14.540> with

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
at will the back side panel with

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:23.770 
at will the back side panel with
Plexiglas<00:03:15.770> in<00:03:15.980> it

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:37.320 

you

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.869 

here's<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.569> feet<00:03:39.260> with<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.980> copper<00:03:40.400> risers

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
here's the feet with the copper risers

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.220 
here's the feet with the copper risers
so<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.930> manifold<00:03:42.890> on<00:03:43.220> lower<00:03:43.459> side<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:44.230> be

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
so the manifold on lower side can be

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.089 
so the manifold on lower side can be
accessed<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:50.629> back<00:03:50.810> side<00:03:51.050> panel<00:03:51.560> taken<00:03:51.890> off

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
accessed the back side panel taken off

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.880 
accessed the back side panel taken off
and<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.550> flow<00:03:52.790> rate<00:03:53.090> meter<00:03:53.840> flow<00:03:54.830> in<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:57.650> back

sorta<00:04:56.080> looks<00:04:57.080> like<00:04:57.289> a<00:04:57.320> mess<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:58.060> hose<00:04:59.139> but<00:05:00.139> I

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
sorta looks like a mess of hose but I

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.750 
sorta looks like a mess of hose but I
think<00:05:00.470> it's<00:05:00.620> intricately<00:05:01.190> laid<00:05:01.880> out
