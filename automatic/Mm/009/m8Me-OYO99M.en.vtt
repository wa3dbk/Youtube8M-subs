00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:10.139
 Briefly about the browser installed here 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.330
 usual standard browser from the well rather 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.480
 he is not quite standard but nevertheless 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 very good google has loaded 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.250
 there is support for tabs there is such 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.170
 special function like scaling 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.779
 with help let's say two points that is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.630
 we put two thumbs up 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.510
 screen away or closer to us 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.400
 going on scaling and so here y 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.070
 we have some tabs already open 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.070
 but actually it is 1 so open 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.230
 mobile forum 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.970
 The speed is very high compared with 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.210
 iphone 4s i won't because then 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.460
 will have to bother to exhibit 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.250
 rather, turn off the flash so that all these 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.260
 the buns were turned off in general this is not 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.080
 very nice yes i don't think that anyone 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.140
 it will be interesting to see the difference in there 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.740
 some fractions of seconds or seconds in general 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 I did not see 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.329
 huge difference between iphone 4s and here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.850
 with this device, that is , there and there very much 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.270
 quickly there is no problem so little 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 decrease the contrast opened 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.710
 page accordingly everything is here 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.259
 this flash 11 flash 10 automatically it 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.350
 updated just to adobe flash 11 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.289
 version that's why you can watch the video 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.719
 play games and things like that 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.039
 the question is that now the whole world refuses 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.139
 flash 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.859
 he will of course be supported by all affairs 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:52.670
 but now it is hard and we have 5 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:55.170
 how this particular apparatus will behave 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.810
 html5 what he will ball and gain on 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.850
 different pages this already 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.470
 interesting well in any case, all 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.270
 opens quickly scaled 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.670
 no problems 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.330
 let's see any review here 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.970
 smartphone 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:15.310
 erasing we open it appears 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.370
 the page is very beautiful 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.099
 displayed let's see how it will be 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.690
 scale the text so well 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:29.730
 theoretically visible as well if i want a closer look 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 Here it is impossible that there is 2 tapas 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.940
 aligned properties and so review 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.400
 page just can see what 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.760
 there are auto fit settings 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:50.980
 give put up 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:54.280
 back well well, something doesnâ€™t want to 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:05.489
 Now drove yes but with an increase in already 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:07.989
 he doesn't want to scale the settings like that 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.769
 it we will not include it just 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:14.370
 javascript extension and follow what 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.370
 there still is 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.120
 peel the skin on in general not particularly 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.550
 Everything is important to fit 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.770
 does in this embodiment that is possible in 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.140
 principle, read already without problems, that is 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:35.280
 eyes do not strain plus good 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:38.490
 resolution displays black well 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:49.830
 minutes we run away again flash 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:52.790
 flash poke everything plays well 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.700
 I do not know how people play games on 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.500
 splesham machines after all there sometimes 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.030
 need a mouse sometimes need a keyboard 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:06.420
 honestly i don't understand yes there is a very flash 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.760
 ok well honestly for me it's like 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:15.480
 it generally does not cause any special 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.710
 emotions you see a banner and everything 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:22.520
 displayed you can flip quickly 

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.520
 turns 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.860
 let's go somewhere'll go 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.380

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.180

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.210
 fit here 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.070
 In general, the browser as a browser is fine everything 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.870

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.870
 one page here 2 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:35.260
 find the brightness in the browser and add 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:37.820
 bookmark all add bookmark 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.370
 Internet does not work well wifi
