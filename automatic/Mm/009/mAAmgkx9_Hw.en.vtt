00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.040
 well found in orobie extra simone moro 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.770
 has recently published his new book 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.699
 kneeling on the wings yes no first of all 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.269
 because this title 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.680
 then a title that I suggested ed 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.910
 liked it immediately 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:34.540
 the publisher rizzoli because kneeling 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 on the wings is the metaphor of many 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.570
 situations of life and is also 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.070
 the identikit of my pilot story 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.840
 and entrepreneur let's call them 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.379
 helicopter then when you say 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.079
 that one and on the wings is because it flies with the 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.910
 thought or is in a good mood or is 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 dreaming when he says you are always on 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.270
 always wings for air 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.160
 when one around who instead is in a 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.980
 moment of difficulty at a time 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.190
 maybe not even happy in a moment 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.600
 so where should he find the energies or 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.210
 must must get back up is exactly what it is 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.909
 happened to me I became a pilot I 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.610
 dreamed of this project to open a 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.740
 sort of helicopter rescue in the Himalayas 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.560
 mountains that they know best 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 to do this I became a pilot 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.159
 probed in the united states to become 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.600
 pilot then I came to Europe are 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.770
 amused pilot also here in europe with 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.020
 European licenses 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.119
 then I went to Nepal and I started 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.040
 to pilot then when I realized that 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.880
 also the helicopter was needed 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.700
 I did madness because I am not a 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.710
 magnate and not even a sheikh of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.960
 go into the neck to buy a 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.840
 helicopter to take it in nepal in 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.640
 Himalayas to do so many beautiful relief efforts 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 also world records help too 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.409
 the local people and for this helicopter 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.509
 and crashed crashed you do n't pilot me 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.299
 pilot another person and felt 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.979
 badly and everything went destroyed and from 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.549
 wings of a dream I found myself in 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.350
 knee knee stretch 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.479
 brutally for this helicopter then 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.340
 now it had to be paid and it was gone but 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.680
 to produce the necessary income 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.740
 to repay him since among other things that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.870
 I also had 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.760
 a total rejection of the institutions of 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.950
 credit in helping you buy it 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.530
 so they personally got me into debt 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.000
 up to his neck he is kneeling on his wings 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.250
 also a bit of a metaphor for everyone's life 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.040
 we who very often are not happy 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.570
 we are dreaming is a positive period and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.300
 then we find ourselves on our knees under everyone 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.310
 the profiles and then tell my story 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.360
 history 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.040
 also explaining how I did it to 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.900
 resist not only financially but 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.920
 even emotionally to a hit of the 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.750
 kind and so I liked it too 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.640
 because the helicopter blades are 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.910
 loyal to the helicopter and fatigue but to the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.700
 rotating then perfectly fits the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.560
 wing term also on the lips you have it 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.480
 written mostly in the 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.590
 technique basically in writing 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.050
 to the base camp 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.330
 once again the publisher does not know that a 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.840
 a month from the contract in which I owed 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.870
 deliver it and 40 days from 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.120
 Reservation of the book printing slot 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.760
 it was still all here and I wrote it in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.020
 20 days a book of almost 300 pages 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.370
 with photographs and tells told 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.690
 really my whole journey from 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.330
 when I started to fall in love 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.190
 of the helicopter when I realized that the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.100
 desire to become a pilot was not for 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.870
 a vision shows you the helicopter 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.020
 Negra would go around doing the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.600
 helicopter manager but because I wanted to 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.030
 create what for us and forbids it and 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.520
 of which often almost always there 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.390
 we realize the luck we have 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.190
 because if we get hurt here 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.170
 the helicopter comes for us is free 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.980
 and a quarter of an hour arrives in ten minutes 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.320
 to the ambulance or the harbor master's office 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.180
 a patrol boat my balloon exists 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.080
 nothing comes when it arrives for a fee 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.870
 salty 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.050
 then I wanted to do some sort of 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.820
 charity that is a kind of project of 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.680
 solidarity and also commercial because 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.480
 I had to pay for the helicopter 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.900
 bought my money not with money 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.900
 public and I told all this 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.640
 history that starts from 2009 as a pilot but 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.940
 part first as falling in love with this one 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.750
 car arrives until 2014 and not 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.760
 demorde torni in fact speaks more known 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.110
 he returned to the wings 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.889
 I got up from the 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.509
 eye to tone on the wings or deciding to 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.330
 go to nepal now and pilot a 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.039
 helicopter that there is and is the one on which 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.370
 I started my business 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:38.870
 but I am dreaming of resuming it and a 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.969
 other come back down and have a 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.770
 fully dedicated helicopter I know that 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.530
 no one will give me a hand yet but 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.689
 I do it alone but there is a ranking 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.150
 the mountain in your life of passion 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:54.110
 up to now but now yes 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.460
 they are shaking hands and soon they are 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.740
 they will greet because I am not rambo 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.270
 a 46 year old man who can think of 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.870
 make a certain level mountain climber 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.400
 for a few years and then and then the mountain 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.840
 since I know the Himalaya seen 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.639
 that makes her look bad I want to put myself in 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.090
 first line no longer with ax but 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.949
 with a collective cyclic and pedals in 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.430
 good luck to simone moro thanks to you 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.430
 for following us
