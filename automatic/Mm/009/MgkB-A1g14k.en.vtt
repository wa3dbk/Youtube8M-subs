do correctly most people think I just
match<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.219> game<00:00:56.840> not<00:00:57.840> exactly<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190

here's<00:01:01.410> where<00:01:01.910> holding<00:01:02.910> cells<00:01:03.180> take<00:01:03.899> effect

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
here's where holding cells take effect

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
here's where holding cells take effect
because<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> seems<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.400> be<00:01:05.720> apparent<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:06.869> third
