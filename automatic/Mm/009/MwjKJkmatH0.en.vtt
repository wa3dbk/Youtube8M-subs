00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.380
 acerola will be a product of weight on the agenda 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.170
 export of fruit and vegetables 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.180
 only one Bahian company 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.570
 exports the equivalent of 85% 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.170
 of its production totaling over two thousand 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.699
 tonnes or 1500 tonnes 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.920
 of pulp 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.320
 another important factor that stimulates 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.570
 investments in the cultivation of acerola is 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.940
 internal consumer market 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.710
 the Brazilian consumer has become more 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.290
 aware of the importance of food 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.149
 natural resources for human health and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.940
 eat more fruits 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.270
 northeastern Brazil is the region that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.180
 more cultivate acerola in brazil near 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.790
 nine Northeastern states implement 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.820
 today, this culture stands out among 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.860
 they are the bahia and pernambuco with more than 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.009
 800 hectares planted 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 the cultivation of acer asia can be 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.070
 found in all other regions of the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.440
 Brazil 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.050
 however with less intensity in the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.390
 South and Southeast regions due to 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.840
 temperatures of these regions during the 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.600
 winter like acerola a perennial culture 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.819
 and in climate friendly places 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.490
 production takes place during the 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.880
 your whole crop in the projects 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.099
 irrigated from the northeast has no doubt 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.470
 great social importance mainly 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:39.649
 for the small fruit grower who may 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.869
 have a constant cash flow the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.649
 yield achieved by plants per 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.349
 hectare 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.289
 will of course depend on the variety the 

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:52.130
 clone you'll work from the weather and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.690
 of the soil of the cultural treatments of fertilization 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.819
 irrigation and other factors 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.310
 What is known is that plants conducted 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.119
 without rainfed areas that depend on 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.450
 rain 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.729
 with an average rainfall of around 1,000 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.039
 480 mm per year presented 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.000
 productions of up to 27 kilos per plant 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.200
 with four harvests per year in 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.330
 irrigated 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.390
 studies show that it is possible to 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.540
 productivity levels of around 100 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.850
 kilos per plant per year 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 in one hectare of acerola in 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.400
 ideal planting conditions is possible 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.650
 productivity of around 62 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.620
 tons of fruit per year 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.700
 the fruit of acerola presents a 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.620
 average juice yield between 59 and 73 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.890
 percent of its weight 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.470
 costs of maintenance and 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.810
 production of an orchard to accelerate also 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.170
 will vary according to where you are 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.460
 will be installed the purpose of production 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.990
 and the cultural practices adopted 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.000
 according to the information contained in the manual 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.010
 of the secretary of 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.910
 development of the Ministry of 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 agriculture 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.580
 under irrigation conditions after 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.280
 the second year may reach levels 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.840
 productivity of 18 tonnes per 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.240
 hectare per year 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.480
 all this seems to be very good and 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.740
 profitable but the deal is not so easy 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 how much seems 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.630
 let's listen to the Lord's directions 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.140
 landmarks amaro da silveira CEO 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.490
 of the futel and tropical cultures limited 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.560
 agricultural enterprise in the south of 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.630
 which for several years has been 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.400
 specializing in horticulture which 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.440
 in relation to the plantation of acerola 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.500
 cultivation of acerola I think it is very 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.560
 important to make it clear that many people 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.600
 cerol plant and copy and paste cucumber is from 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.550
 It is more important to have some 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.700
 in the acerola planting 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.670
 first make sure you can 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.680
 place in a region that should not give in to 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.050
 200 kilometers away from your 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.720
 planting its production be it on the 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.500
 form of production and nature is to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.930
 industry pulp industry 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.460
 So I think this is the producer 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.860
 You have to evaluate this very carefully. 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.170
 with great discretion at the time of decision 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.940
 planting acerola acerola have 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.160
 past five years 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.320
 through a major crisis a crisis 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.120
 excess supply although demand has 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.940
 grown and will grow in a way 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 accelerated but the volume of planting 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.750
 has increased in a very large way 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.150
 also 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.090
 the greatest concern in this case is 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.030
 being that in the case of a crop 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.650
 perennial is a crop and takes three 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.660
 in the third year of production 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.120
 in the fourth year it achieves a good production 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.970
 only reaching maturity in the fifth there 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.190
 What is the concern about this that a crisis 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.350
 of oversupply in a perennial crop 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.390
 is much more serious than a crisis in a 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.490
 short-cycle cropping then this is the 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.460
 great risk in this market and it is 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.070
 production in the country 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.940
 production from the paraná to the 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.560
 ceará and it is and what is the 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.200
 planting there is practically no 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.840
 harvests the planting of the 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.660
 it basically takes place nine 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.370
 months of the year in all regions of the country 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.350
 these are the concerns that you 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.479
 producer has to know at the moment that 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.690
 will make the decision to plant acerola 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.690
 not
