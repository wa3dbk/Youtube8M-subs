00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 welcome to riemer design in this 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.670
 video we show you how they faked 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.130
 for boots can do it yourself 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.809
 You will need the boots for this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.750
 scissors a carpet knife needle and thread 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.949
 pins a ruler shoelace and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.690
 First of all, you place art art cases 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.029
 the boots on the fake fur and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.130
 put these off with the pins and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.039
 let it extra a big edge 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.289
 because we still have to sew this up 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.449
 about 20 centimeters here with that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.800
 Carpet simply at the ruler 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.510
 cut off along 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.790
 and of course you need two of them 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.440
 this one because you have a few boots and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 the art festival from the inside out 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.860
 turned that means they cut the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.379
 not due page and then below 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.000
 just break that was an old one in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.289
 old pillowcase already below 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.480
 Sewn was that we wanted, of course 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.579
 not at the study have the boots 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 then put it on and again with the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.539
 inside out and then on the back 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.170
 boots with worlds pins 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 then stuck again from the boot 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.150
 pull off and this is now sewn with 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.119
 the sewing machine a zigzag stitch 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.060
 choose and thread a black thread 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.810
 then thread along the back 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 side take me a little extra 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 left more hand and meanwhile the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.110
 then remove the pins 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 sew again at the very end and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.740
 cut thread with scissors and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 already we have the cuff then 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.579
 this turned inside out like that 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.740
 that the fan page shows only to the outside 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 pull over the boots again and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.180
 Now take the laces 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.829
 We hold this once in the middle 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 together then the middle with one 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.579
 mark pin and that will be 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.220
 Sewn down at the bottom of the study 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.100
 hide so easily one of them 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.909
 Needle and yarn will then be the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.229
 Shoelaces sewn to the strip and 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.009
 from the inside out so that too 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.009
 really holds 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:14.290
 sewn knot in again 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.450
 cut it off and get over it now 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.519
 pull boots and now with the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:27.069
 wrap shoelaces a few times 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:29.050
 and then make a knot in and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.880
 already they have a fashionable coat 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.450
 Trip for the cold season 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.790
 and so then I see that from these are 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.860
 then two missed hours from the back where that 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.150
 was firmly knotted and a great idea 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.630
 Thank you for watching for more
