00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
real push on the green side you know the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
real push on the green side you know the
environment<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.380> travel<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:53.369> all

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
environment because for travel we all

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.069 
environment because for travel we all
leave<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> carbon<00:01:54.030> footprint<00:01:54.329> when<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:55.049> we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
leave a carbon footprint when we when we

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
leave a carbon footprint when we when we
fly<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:56.549> impact<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.969> environment<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
fly and we impact the environment to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.700 
fly and we impact the environment to
some<00:01:57.659> degree<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.560> things

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
some degree what are some of the things

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.789 
some degree what are some of the things
that<00:01:58.890> you've<00:01:59.310> done<00:01:59.570> with<00:02:00.570> sandals<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.350> protect

that you've done with sandals to protect

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.499 
that you've done with sandals to protect
the<00:02:01.890> environment<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:03.030> enhance<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
natural beauty we're seeing here I mean

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.380 
natural beauty we're seeing here I mean
I<00:02:05.490> think<00:02:05.549> first<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.360> people

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
I think first of all you know people

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.150 
I think first of all you know people
people<00:02:07.140> stand<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> stage<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> see

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
people stand up on a stage and see

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.589 
people stand up on a stage and see
they're<00:02:08.310> doing<00:02:08.459> all<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:08.759> things<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> lot

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
they're doing all these things and a lot

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.669 
they're doing all these things and a lot
of<00:02:09.629> time<00:02:09.869> they're<00:02:10.020> probably<00:02:10.140> doing<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.530> lot

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
of time they're probably doing a lot
