00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
myself whether this seems to be ripe now
normally<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.740> course<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.189> would<00:01:35.400> harvest<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
normally of course I would harvest this

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.240 
normally of course I would harvest this
by<00:01:36.570> taking<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> off<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> lock<00:01:37.590> off<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> vine

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
by taking it off the lock off the vine

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.590 
by taking it off the lock off the vine
but<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.509> just<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:40.939> in<00:01:41.939> my<00:01:42.000> learning
