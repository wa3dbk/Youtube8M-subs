00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it lasts all year long and this year I'm

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
it lasts all year long and this year I'm
trying<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:39.030> see<00:00:39.210> monthly<00:00:39.540> planner

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
trying out the just see monthly planner

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
trying out the just see monthly planner
so<00:00:40.020> it's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> lot<00:00:40.410> smaller<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.370> doesn't<00:00:41.610> like

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so it's a lot smaller so it doesn't like

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.580 
so it's a lot smaller so it doesn't like
weight<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.329> pack<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.719> much<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
weight on your back pack as much and I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.360 
weight on your back pack as much and I
think<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:43.860> really<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.309> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
think I'm really going to like it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.799 
think I'm really going to like it
because<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.850> normally<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.210> use<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> month

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
because I normally just use the month

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.220 
because I normally just use the month
part<00:00:46.379> anyway<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.280> planner<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> must<00:00:48.809> for

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
part anyway so planner is a must for

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
think i got what's do I get this is the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.600 
think i got what's do I get this is the
college<00:01:22.200> rolled<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.280> doesn't<00:01:23.520> really

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
college rolled so it doesn't really
