00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.080
Don't you ever ride on my Shetland Pony
Oh my pony

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.000
Oh oh oh oh.
Don't you ever ride on it

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.040
Don't you ever ride on it
Don't you ever ride on it

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.500
No no no no.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.900
He's like a tiny horse

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.640
You have to walk next to it of course

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.940
You don't ride it

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.960
He's company for going to the shops

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.520
Hear his hooves go clippety clop

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.560
It's relaxing, relaxing horsey company

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.620
What's that you say? Oh you've got a big dog

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.540
What do you want? Some kind of award?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.060
Look at me I feeding my pony sugar lumps

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.460
You can't do that with Mutley there

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.820
Don't you ever ride on my Shetland pony

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.740
Oh my pony

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.280
Oh oh oh

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.940
Don't you ever ride on it

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.720
Don't you ever ride on it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240
Don't you ever ride on it. No no no no

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.240
It can fit in your car

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.980
And you can throw it quite far

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.480
But you shouldn't do that oh no no no

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.260
'Cos it's a horse after all

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.860
And sure it might not be tall

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.860
But you will give my Shetland pony the respect it...

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.460
Deserrrrrrrrr-errr-errrr-errr-eeerrrrves

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.980
Don't ride it, don't ride it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.160
Don't ride it, don't ride it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.520
No no. That's not how he rolls

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.540
It's not how he ro-ooooollls

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.480
It's not how he rolls

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.720
It's not how it rolls

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.660
It rolls like a horse.
