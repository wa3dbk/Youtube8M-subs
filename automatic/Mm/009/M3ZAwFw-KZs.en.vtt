00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.733
- YOU ARE NOW HANGING OUT
IN DUBAI,

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:04.033
AND I WANT TO FIND OUT
HOW THIS COMES ABOUT,

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.666
THAT YOU JUST START--

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.233
THEY'RE SHEIKS--
SHEIKS, CHICS?

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.500
- I SAY SHEIKS.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.800
- SHEIKS;
I'LL SAY WHAT YOU SAY

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.400
BECAUSE YOU'RE HANGING OUT
WITH THEM.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.833
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.466
- SO YOU GO TO DUBAI

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:16.700
AND YOU MEET SOME SHEIKS,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.666
AND YOU JUST START
HANGING OUT WITH SHEIKS.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:21.166
- TOO MANY SHEIKS TO REMEMBER.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.666
SHEIKS EVERYWHERE.

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.733
WE CAME UP WITH SHEIK NAMES.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.133
I EVEN HAVE A SHEIK NAME
FOR YOU.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:26.633
- WHAT'S MY NAME?

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.633
- "SHEIKING THAT ASS,"
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:31.466
[cheers and applause]

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.000
YOU SHAKE THAT ASS A LOT.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.333
- I DO, I DO.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.766
WHAT'S YOUR SHEIK NAME?

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:36.766
- "SHEIK YA BOOTY."

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.300
- UH-HUH.
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.766
- SO TELL ME,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:41.733
BECAUSE I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
THE LIFESTYLE THERE.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.400
THERE IS SO MUCH OPULENCE IN--
I'VE NEVER BEEN.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.600
- NO, IT'S UNREAL.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.033
IT'S UNREAL.
IT'S LIKE A DREAM--

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:48.466
I FELT LIKE I WAS DREAMING,

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.033
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST AMAZING.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.800
SO IF YOU EVER HAVE
A CHANCE TO GO

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
TO ABU DHABI,
DUBAI.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.700
WE WENT AND VISITED--

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.666
LIKE, THIS GUY HAD
A FULL-ON ZOO.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:01:00.266
HE HAD ALL TYPE OF JUST
ALMOST EXTINCT ANIMALS.

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:01.533
IT WAS AMAZING.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.433
I ACTUALLY GOT A CHANCE
TO FEED A TIGER.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.966
- YEAH, I SAW THE PICTURE.

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:06.366
OH, I DIDN'T SEE THE VIDEO.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.433
I SAW--

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:08.800
- OH, YEAH.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.766
- SO HE HAD IT SINCE IT
WAS A BABY, SO IT WAS TAME.

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:12.133
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.366
I WAS SCARED AS HELL,
BY THE WAY.

00:01:13.366 --> 00:01:14.566
- YEAH.

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:16.000
- YEAH, I'M NOT AFRAID
TO ADMIT THAT.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.866
- WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.
THAT'S A NORMAL--

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:19.633
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE SCARED
OF THAT THING.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:20.866
- YEAH, I SAW ERIC STONESTREET.

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:22.066
HE FED A FISH.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.300
SO THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.800
- YEAH.
- JUST A LITTLE BIT.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.666
[cheers and applause]

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.066
NO OFFENSE TO ERIC AT ALL.

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:31.100
NONE WHATSOEVER.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.366
- AW,

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.600
- BY THE WAY, I NEED
TO MAKE SURE

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.266
- YEAH, HE'S GONNA--

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.133
NOW HE'S GONNA COME OUT HERE
AND SCARE YOU.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:39.433
- YEAH, YEAH, I GOT TO MAKE SURE
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TIGERS--

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.200
WHITE TIGERS COMING OUT.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.633
- SO THIS IS--

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:45.200
ANOTHER THING THAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LAST TIME--

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.033
YOU HAVE A PLANE,
YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PLANE,

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.066
WHICH IS VERY COOL.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.400
BUT YOU DRIVE A '90--
WHAT YEAR IS IT?

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.366
- '93.
- '93 ACURA.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:56.133
- I STILL HAVE
MY '93 ACURA LEGEND.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:57.833
I HAD THIS CAR BEFORE
THE RECORD DEAL,

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.000
BEFORE ALL THE FAME.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.200
I STILL HAVE IT.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.766
IT HAS OVER 250,000 MILES
ON THIS CAR.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:04.600
- SO YOU DRIVE THAT CAR
TO YOUR PRIVATE JET?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.166
- TO THE PLANE, YES.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.466
YEAH.
[laughs]

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:09.600
[cheers and applause]

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.933
- TO BALANCE IT OUT?

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:12.033
- BALANCE IT OUT.

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:14.033
IT SAYS A LOT
ABOUT MY PERSONALITY,

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:15.800
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST
A HUMBLE INDIVIDUAL.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.000
I ALWAYS--I USED
TO WRITE MUSIC IN THIS ACURA,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.633
AND I STILL DO
TILL THIS DAY.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.233
SO IT'S JUST--IT'S ONE
OF THOSE THINGS

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:22.600
THAT I CAN NEVER GET RID OF.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.300
I WILL NEVER GET RID OF,
EVER.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.766
- THAT'S VERY COOL,

00:02:25.766 --> 00:02:27.633
AND A LITTLE CRAZY.

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:28.733
- IT IS.

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.433
WELL, MY NAME IS LUDACRIS,
SO THAT MEANS--

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:31.633
- YEAH, YEAH.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:33.166
- IT'S BEYOND CRAZY.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.500
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE A BREAK,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.100
AND WE'LL TALK
TO LUDACRIS A LITTLE MORE.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.600
- ABSOLUTELY.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.933
WE'RE BACK WITH THE VERY,
VERY PHYSICALLY FIT LUDACRIS.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.133
- [laughs]

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.633
- DO YOU WORK OUT EVERY DAY?

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:45.633
- EVERY DAY.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:46.766
- WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY DAY?

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.966
- DIFFERENT THINGS
EVERY DAY.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.366
YOU GOT TO CONFUSE THE BODY.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.700
[audience whoops]

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.066
HEY.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.966
- WELL, THAT'S PHOTOSHOPPED.
THAT'S NOT REAL.

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:55.500
- YEAH, THAT'S PHOTOSHOPPED
FOR SURE.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.066
- YOU'VE GOT TO PROVE
THAT THAT'S NOT--

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.700
[audience whooping]

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.866
- DO I REALLY NEED
TO PROVE IT?

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.033
- YEP.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.033
[audience screaming]

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:12.700
- ALL RIGHT.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.100
- I STILL GOT THE
ELLEN UNDERWEAR.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.166
YOU SEE THAT,
RIGHT?

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.333
- ALL RIGHT, I LIKE IT.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:18.933
ALL RIGHT,
SO FOR DOING THAT,

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:21.200
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A GIFT FOR YOUR ACURA

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.066
BECAUSE YOU NEED
SOME FANCINESS IN THERE.

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.333
- OH, WHAT'S THAT?

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:26.233
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU NEED--

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.700
WELL, HERE'S A BUMPER STICKER--
"WHAT WOULD ELLEN DO?"

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.200
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.566
- HERE'S
FOR YOUR STEERING WHEEL.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:38.666
THIS IS SOME DICE.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.100
OKAY?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.733
- THE DICE I MIGHT
BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH.

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:43.166
THIS STEERING WHEEL,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:44.600
I MIGHT GET PULLED OVER
FOR THIS.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.966
IT'S BEDAZZLED.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:47.366
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:49.233
THAT'S GONNA ADD VALUE
TO YOUR ACURA.

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:51.033
- THE FACT THAT IT SAYS "ELLEN,"
WE'RE GOOD.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:52.633
ALL THE WAY RIGHT.
I'M WITH IT.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.600
- NEXT TIME YOU GO TO DUBAI,
TAKE ME WITH YOU, OKAY?

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.000
- YOU'RE COMING.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.933
- I'M SERIOUS; I WANT
TO HANG THERE OUT WITH YOU

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.566
WITH THE SHEIKS.

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:00.900
- [laughs]

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.100
- GO TO BEATS MUSIC
TO DOWNLOAD "PARTY GIRLS"

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.733
AND HEAR MORE MUSIC
FROM LUDACRIS

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:05.966
AND SEE THE DIRTY VERSION

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:07.533
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK
AT THE DIRTY VERSION.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:08.833
[audience screaming]

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.333
I WANT TO THANK LUDACRIS,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.966
ERIC STONESTREET,
JOHN AND ANTHONY.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:13.766
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.166
BYE-BYE.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:18.166
[cheers and applause]
