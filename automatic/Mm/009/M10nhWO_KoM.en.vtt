00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everyone with you green tour 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.860
 today I want to open a parcel with you 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.830
 which came to me from Russia is a rug 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:19.560
 which I won in the competition and the same 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.650
 for the best comics let's be her 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650
 open 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.290
 that's actually 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.730
 the scribbles that lies the carpet for 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.730
 gaming mouse from the company where farmer 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:10.100
 box a little damaged but it 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 clear let's see the back mat here 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.610
 so here it looks just plain 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.680
 black carpet with the inscription 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.170
 his downside is as if 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.250
 a little rubber this is done in order 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.210
 so that the mat does not slide on the table on 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.950
 the upper part of the fabric with such 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.929
 holes made it for better 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.159
 of control 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:43.789
 as far as i know and as far as i 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:50.420
 known such rugs are more suitable 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:54.140
 for fps counter-strike shooters and so 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.170
 further here is such a comparison with my 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.170
 last rug frezer mantis is sleeping 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.660
 I had someone past the mat 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.599
 and what I want to say immediately about this my 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:18.760
 old rug it pretty much more 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:24.459
 than sent new but I think the size 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:30.310
 new, too, will be enough problems 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:33.010
 Mantis was sleeping in his sides like this 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.980
 he looked normal 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.950
 then there where you constantly touch him 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.190
 hand is obtained when the mouse slide 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.670
 here you can touch his hand was 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.670
 he moved away 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.700
 I am a question 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.019
 there it turned over but from this side of it 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:00.349
 waited the same fate 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:04.890
 and unfortunately unfortunately new floor mats 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:07.530
 defender I think it will be expected so 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.849
 same fate because he, too, here 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.859
 this top layer is exactly the same 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:20.069
 connected to the bottom like a rug reisen 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:23.340
 Of course I am very pleased with this rug 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.359
 just my old rug is already more of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.250
 building it needs to be changed 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:36.900
 Many thanks to the company Defender 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:39.109
 also portal game z for this prize to all 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.109
 until
