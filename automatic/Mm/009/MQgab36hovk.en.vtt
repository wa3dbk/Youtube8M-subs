00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
companies yeah I think because it was

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.009 
companies yeah I think because it was
perceived<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.269> actually<00:00:12.630> now<00:00:12.809> we're

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
perceived that actually now we're

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.419 
perceived that actually now we're
stronger<00:00:13.200> but<00:00:13.380> now<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> lot<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.889> people<00:00:13.980> think<00:00:14.280> a

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
stronger but now a lot of people think a

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.099 
stronger but now a lot of people think a
radio<00:00:14.700> actually<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> lot<00:00:15.330> stronger<00:00:15.540> once<00:00:16.020> he

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
radio actually is a lot stronger once he

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.170 
radio actually is a lot stronger once he
