 wolf hard work tirelessly 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.110
 perfecting dota in particular 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 matchmaking for the uninitiated is the word 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.540
 means searching for players in allies 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.439
 opponents having similar skill and 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.980
 knowledge of the game that I am your most recently 6 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.289
 December 2013 on the developer blog 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.119
 a record appeared which they promise in 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 next update add 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 ranked matchmaking 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 This mode will be intended for 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 players who are serious about 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 the game and not alien to experience for yourself 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.070
 the difficulties of competitive dota to that 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.829
 same matchmaking rating reduced mr 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.860
 becomes visible to all players 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.760
 and here are some items from the blog which 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.079
 as the authors assure you are obliged to know 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 ranked matchmaking opens 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.039
 after 150 matches played all players in 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.780
 Pati must fulfill the first point 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.149
 available peak peak draft captains 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
 and captains mode you can not participate 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.310
 ranked matchmaking if you have 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.220
 low priority trainer sixth player not 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.439
 can participate in this mode 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.930
 mmr in a normal game does not affect mmr 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.350
 matchmaking spar and vice versa 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 your mr is visible only to friends for 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.689
 normal game he is invisible when you first 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.549
 time to start and this kind of matchmaking 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.220
 then enter the selection phase which is necessary 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 play 10 matches before that time 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.770
 mr do not see the player's skill score 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.290
 depends primarily on the fact that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.229
 happened during the match but mostly 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 the system looks like it lost mr 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.540
 decreases won mr goes up to have 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.640
 opportunity when it increases 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.829
 after a lesion and decreases after 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.200
 wins but on average the team will 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.840
 either fall or rise in 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.950
 ranking we also monitor the criteria 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.939
 uncertainties 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.070
 let it be there mcn for new 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.350
 players and net accounts he 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.649
 contributes to significant changes and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.590
 more after each match than less to 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.120
 ent the weaker adjustments also have 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.580
 zoom circuit to 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.650
 for old players for example you have 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.810
 stable uncertainty criterion 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.540
 due to the fact that you play with 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.400
 identical performance win loss 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.080
 individual skill but when you 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.920
 start constantly changing these 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.209
 indicators only n increases by 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.239
 in fact, the developers will 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.360
 track 4 mm for each player in 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.579
 normal matchmaking solo normal 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.629
 matchmaking party ranked 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.220
 ranked matchmaking party his 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.560
 basis automatically players belt 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.099
 pursues several goals for each 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.810
 teams a chance to win 50 percent 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.829
 divergence in skill and quantity 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.200
 games played 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.530
 between the most and least experienced 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.989
 players in the match is reduced to a minimum 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.359
 skill of the most skillful player Raiden 3dr 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.459
 should be similar should not be 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.220
 a situation where party against five players 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.959
 play 5 singles are strictly counted 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.480
 language preferences are not for your 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.500
 teams but not so strict for the whole match 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.760
 In general, for example, Russian speakers are against 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.370
 English speakers are quite acceptable 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.470
 script timeout should be 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.519
 not long 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.410
 developers say rarely 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.510
 it turns out to follow all the rules but they 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.650
 try to experiment with importance 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.660
 each criterion 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.870
 the main point is still the probability 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.980
 each team win 50 percent 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.530
 if you have a series of victories 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.389
 then surely your mdr is growing due 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.400
 What are you fighting with more experienced 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.139
 by the players 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.359
 matchmaking system doesn't use number 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.730
 wins as a player's skill score 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:51.959
 the task of the system is to collect players with 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.329
 the same experience why because people 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.609
 with the same skill but different experience 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.799
 have a different understanding of how 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.169
 must be played match the difference 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.540
 equally significant as for players 40 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.260
 and a hundred and twenty games so for players 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.000
 played 120 and 280 games on this 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.000
 chart you can see the odds on 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.829
 falling into one team the closer the arrows 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.169
 each other the higher the odds 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.660
 the point is that an experienced player having created 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.789
 the account is often immediately gaining mr and 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.810
 moves forward when less experienced 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.639
 mindset and to certain 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.060
 moment reaches about the same 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.419
 mr level and what about party 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.389
 there are many criteria but what they do 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.210
 developers they count your owls 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.669
 Hypathy Mayor derive average effective 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.950
 mr based on the number of people in 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.070
 group and skill level of people for her 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.820
 limits in this case on average mmr 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.130
 reaches the number 2700 with the help of many 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.960
 mathematical methods and functions when 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.470
 statistics help 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.810
 yours successfully operates with mr to 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.060
 example even using the difference in gold 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.190
 during the game more about this blog 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.979
 developers yes for the system 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.630
 matchmaking needs to be monitored constantly not 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.880
 forget to leave feedback on 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.010
