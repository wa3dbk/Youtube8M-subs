work on the US one but as a friend of
mine<00:00:48.430> has<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:49.170> region<00:00:50.170> modded<00:00:50.500> one<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.949> it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
mine has a region modded one and it

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.950 
mine has a region modded one and it
works<00:00:51.190> fine<00:00:51.430> on<00:00:51.460> that<00:00:51.760> so<00:00:52.150> I'm<00:00:52.420> not<00:00:52.479> sure<00:00:52.690> what

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
works fine on that so I'm not sure what

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.509 
works fine on that so I'm not sure what
the<00:00:53.140> logic<00:00:53.559> behind<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.860> is<00:00:53.979> but<00:00:54.129> I'm<00:00:54.190> gonna<00:00:54.309> try

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
the logic behind it is but I'm gonna try

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.240 
the logic behind it is but I'm gonna try
and<00:00:54.610> region<00:00:54.850> matter<00:00:55.000> anyway<00:00:55.269> so<00:00:55.900> and<00:00:56.290> first

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
and region matter anyway so and first

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.250 
and region matter anyway so and first
thing<00:00:57.430> I<00:00:57.489> did<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.729> cycle<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.720> power<00:00:58.870> off<00:00:59.080> with

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
thing I did is cycle the power off with

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.810 
thing I did is cycle the power off with
the<00:00:59.350> with<00:00:59.650> the<00:01:00.269> Paris<00:01:01.269> play<00:01:01.449> unplugged<00:01:01.780> and

other screws so what I'm going to be

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.969 
other screws so what I'm going to be
doing<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.479> diminish<00:01:28.840> is<00:01:29.020> looking<00:01:29.829> for

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
doing the diminish is looking for

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.380 
doing the diminish is looking for
somewhere<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.250> put<00:01:30.700> two<00:01:31.649> switches<00:01:33.390> apparently

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
somewhere to put two switches apparently

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.330 
somewhere to put two switches apparently
under<00:01:34.509> here<00:01:34.719> is<00:01:34.810> pretty<00:01:35.020> good<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.439> then<00:01:35.979> what

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
under here is pretty good and then what

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.730 
under here is pretty good and then what
what's<00:01:37.090> gonna<00:01:37.179> happen<00:01:37.539> is<00:01:37.659> I<00:01:37.689> have<00:01:37.929> a<00:01:38.020> two

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
what's gonna happen is I have a two

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.919 
what's gonna happen is I have a two
point<00:01:39.009> two<00:01:39.189> kilo<00:01:39.700> ohms<00:01:40.000> resistor<00:01:40.750> that's

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
point two kilo ohms resistor that's

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.840 
point two kilo ohms resistor that's
gonna<00:01:41.020> go<00:01:41.200> up<00:01:41.259> between<00:01:41.350> two<00:01:41.649> switches<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.640> so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
gonna go up between two switches and so

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.480 
gonna go up between two switches and so
these<00:01:43.000> are<00:01:43.210> this<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.259> an<00:01:44.380> example<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.799> switch

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
these are this is an example that switch

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.039 
these are this is an example that switch
here's<00:01:45.700> one<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:45.969> ones<00:01:46.359> that<00:01:46.539> me<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.899> two

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
here's one that ones that me in two

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.889 
here's one that ones that me in two
positions<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:48.520> got<00:01:48.759> three<00:01:48.999> double<00:01:49.689> poles

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
positions that's got three double poles

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.830 
positions that's got three double poles
here<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.979> I'm<00:01:51.850> gonna<00:01:51.939> be<00:01:52.119> basically<00:01:52.600> this<00:01:52.689> is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
here and I'm gonna be basically this is

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
here and I'm gonna be basically this is
following<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.350> monkey<00:01:54.130> mmm<00:01:54.969> monkey<00:01:55.329> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
following the monkey mmm monkey and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.870 
following the monkey mmm monkey and
Super<00:01:57.310> Nintendo<00:01:58.619> pam<00:01:59.619> region<00:02:00.429> mod<00:02:00.579> enjoyed

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
Super Nintendo pam region mod enjoyed

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.429 
Super Nintendo pam region mod enjoyed
and<00:02:01.299> I'll<00:02:01.390> include<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.689> link<00:02:01.719> down<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> bottom

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
and I'll include a link down the bottom

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.230 
and I'll include a link down the bottom
and<00:02:02.619> so<00:02:02.920> this<00:02:03.069> may<00:02:03.340> work<00:02:03.549> or<00:02:03.759> may<00:02:03.939> go<00:02:04.060> horribly

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and so this may work or may go horribly

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.020 
and so this may work or may go horribly
wrong<00:02:04.359> the<00:02:05.049> M<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.979> people<00:02:06.249> in<00:02:06.340> Maplin<00:02:06.700> assured

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
wrong the M the people in Maplin assured

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.370 
wrong the M the people in Maplin assured
me<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.420> resistor<00:02:07.780> they<00:02:07.869> gave<00:02:08.050> me<00:02:08.229> was

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
me that the resistor they gave me was

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.980 
me that the resistor they gave me was
with<00:02:09.009> still<00:02:09.340> somehow<00:02:09.670> close<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.600> two<00:02:10.750> point

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
with still somehow close to two point

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.650 
with still somehow close to two point
two<00:02:11.170> kilo<00:02:11.980> ohms<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.940> bit<00:02:13.060> of<00:02:13.150> corridor<00:02:13.510> what

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
two kilo ohms and a bit of corridor what

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.620 
two kilo ohms and a bit of corridor what
a<00:02:13.690> paragraph<00:02:14.110> or<00:02:14.370> even<00:02:15.370> though<00:02:15.460> it<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:16.120> seems

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
a paragraph or even though it it's seems

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.790 
a paragraph or even though it it's seems
to<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.780> something<00:02:16.930> slightly<00:02:17.260> different<00:02:17.740> but

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
to be something slightly different but

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.170 
to be something slightly different but
they<00:02:17.890> even<00:02:18.130> got<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.280> multimeter<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:19.000> showed

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
they even got the multimeter and showed

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.610 
they even got the multimeter and showed
me<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.750> turns<00:02:19.900> into<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.200> mushroom<00:02:20.530> cloud

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
me so if it turns into a mushroom cloud

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.740 
me so if it turns into a mushroom cloud
it's<00:02:20.890> all<00:02:20.980> their<00:02:21.130> fault<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:22.030> I'm<00:02:22.330> gonna<00:02:22.480> just

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
it's all their fault but I'm gonna just

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's all their fault but I'm gonna just
kick<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.740> I'll<00:02:24.180> show<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.210> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
kick on with this and I'll show you and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.309 
kick on with this and I'll show you and
when<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> got<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> bit<00:02:26.830> more<00:02:27.010> dawn<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:28.200> jump<00:02:29.200> cut

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
when I got a bit more dawn on a jump cut

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.360 
when I got a bit more dawn on a jump cut
to<00:02:29.440> there<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.739> show<00:02:29.860> you<00:02:29.950> what's<00:02:30.099> going<00:02:30.159> on

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
to there and show you what's going on

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.930 
to there and show you what's going on
okay

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
okay

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.780 
okay
okay<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:33.489> left

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
okay so and it's left

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.979 
okay so and it's left
following<00:02:34.120> Daniel<00:02:34.390> don't<00:02:34.540> even<00:02:34.719> see<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
following Daniel don't even see the

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.539 
following Daniel don't even see the
light<00:02:35.140> has<00:02:35.260> changed<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:37.409> this<00:02:38.409> is<00:02:38.680> two

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
light has changed and this is two

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.800 
light has changed and this is two
switches<00:02:39.849> and<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:42.390> fortunate<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.599> many

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
switches and now fortunate so many

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.119 
switches and now fortunate so many
problems<00:02:44.140> is<00:02:44.290> marred<00:02:44.469> I<00:02:44.650> didn't<00:02:44.890> stop<00:02:45.099> to

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
problems is marred I didn't stop to

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.440 
problems is marred I didn't stop to
record<00:02:45.760> as<00:02:45.939> I<00:02:46.030> went

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
record as I went

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.619 
record as I went
so<00:02:47.079> I<00:02:47.459> suggested<00:02:48.459> this<00:02:48.579> is<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.030> black<00:02:49.239> there

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
so I suggested this is the black there

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.589 
so I suggested this is the black there
connect<00:02:50.379> to<00:02:50.920> none<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.819> you<00:02:51.879> can<00:02:51.970> see<00:02:52.209> that<00:02:52.510> this

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
connect to none of you can see that this

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.720 
connect to none of you can see that this
is<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.810> parrot<00:02:53.049> regulator<00:02:53.530> here<00:02:53.730> and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is the parrot regulator here and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.360 
is the parrot regulator here and
underneath<00:02:55.090> there<00:02:55.329> there's<00:02:55.540> old<00:02:55.780> G&amp;I<00:02:56.439> and<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
underneath there there's old G&amp;I and the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.220 
underneath there there's old G&amp;I and the
red<00:02:57.549> one<00:02:57.760> carries<00:02:58.090> 5<00:02:58.299> volt<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.840> connected<00:02:59.200> to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
red one carries 5 volt that connected to

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.229 
red one carries 5 volt that connected to
the<00:02:59.349> hole<00:02:59.500> underneath<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.519> G's<00:03:00.730> ground<00:03:01.060> to

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
the hole underneath the G's ground to

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.099 
the hole underneath the G's ground to
that<00:03:01.359> connect<00:03:01.659> to<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.079> G<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:04.019> so<00:03:05.019> the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
that connect to the G and then so the

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.500 
that connect to the G and then so the
black<00:03:05.230> cable<00:03:05.439> of<00:03:05.620> G<00:03:05.799> it's<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.400> base<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.730> e<00:03:06.819> it's

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
black cable of G it's the base of e it's

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.569 
black cable of G it's the base of e it's
connected<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.019> this<00:03:08.170> pole<00:03:08.409> and<00:03:09.040> then<00:03:09.280> in<00:03:09.370> turn

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
connected to this pole and then in turn

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.729 
connected to this pole and then in turn
I<00:03:09.819> got<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> second<00:03:10.720> cable<00:03:10.870> looping<00:03:11.349> to<00:03:11.439> this<00:03:11.560> one

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
I got a second cable looping to this one

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.509 
I got a second cable looping to this one
here<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.939> red<00:03:13.150> carries<00:03:14.019> 5<00:03:14.439> volts<00:03:14.889> to<00:03:15.370> this

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
here the red carries 5 volts to this

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.460 
here the red carries 5 volts to this
pole<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.720> turn<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.109> goes<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.379> the

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
pole and the turn it goes to the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.940 
pole and the turn it goes to the
resistor<00:03:17.919> and<00:03:18.129> goes<00:03:18.639> to<00:03:18.790> here<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:20.769> blue

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
resistor and goes to here and this blue

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.740 
resistor and goes to here and this blue
one<00:03:21.359> goes<00:03:22.359> no<00:03:22.629> I'm<00:03:22.900> not<00:03:23.019> taking<00:03:23.230> tape<00:03:23.590> off<00:03:23.799> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
one goes no I'm not taking tape off and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.289 
one goes no I'm not taking tape off and
there<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:28.439> a<00:03:29.549> lockout<00:03:30.549> chip<00:03:30.609> there<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.239> I'll

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
there is a lockout chip there and I'll

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.330 
there is a lockout chip there and I'll
include<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.840> details<00:03:32.200> right<00:03:32.290> I'm<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.620> monkey

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
include the details right I'm a monkey

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.960 
include the details right I'm a monkey
sight

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
sight

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.050 
sight
okay<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.569> think<00:03:34.750> it's<00:03:35.159> f43<00:03:36.159> 1a<00:03:36.430> or<00:03:36.819> something

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
okay I think it's f43 1a or something

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.390 
okay I think it's f43 1a or something
like<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.629> it's<00:03:37.959> leg<00:03:38.229> four<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.949> that<00:03:39.129> and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
like that and it's leg four on that and

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.729 
like that and it's leg four on that and
it's<00:03:39.489> such<00:03:39.699> a<00:03:39.729> horrible<00:03:40.299> time<00:03:40.620> taking<00:03:41.620> that

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
it's such a horrible time taking that

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.520 
it's such a horrible time taking that
out<00:03:41.889> but<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:42.639> just<00:03:42.669> barely<00:03:43.120> managed<00:03:43.659> to<00:03:43.810> be

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
out but it just barely managed to be

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.869 
out but it just barely managed to be
pretty<00:03:44.799> much<00:03:44.919> the<00:03:45.069> chit<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.370> pin<00:03:45.549> broke

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
pretty much the chit the pin broke

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.839 
pretty much the chit the pin broke
pretty<00:03:46.329> much<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:47.280> just<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:48.340> was<00:03:48.430> an<00:03:48.519> orb<00:03:48.729> of

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
pretty much on the just it was an orb of

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.520 
pretty much on the just it was an orb of
it<00:03:48.970> left<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.900> was<00:03:49.989> enough<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.199> solder

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
it left and that was enough to solder

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.500 
it left and that was enough to solder
but<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.099> have<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.819> tape<00:03:52.030> there<00:03:52.239> I'm<00:03:52.359> not

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
but I have that tape there I'm not

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.099 
but I have that tape there I'm not
taking<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:52.780> off<00:03:54.269> to<00:03:55.269> show<00:03:55.449> you<00:03:55.510> because<00:03:55.780> it's

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
taking it off to show you because it's

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.599 
taking it off to show you because it's
just<00:03:56.349> if<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.650> comes<00:03:56.799> off<00:03:56.949> I<00:03:57.099> don't<00:03:57.280> think<00:03:57.459> that

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
just if it comes off I don't think that

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.640 
just if it comes off I don't think that

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
something is loose by the way because it

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:03.990
