discharged your static electricity can
really<00:03:01.739> really<00:03:02.739> destroy<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> computer<00:03:04.000> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
really really destroy a computer you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:13.199 
really really destroy a computer you
know<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:10.840> going<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:11.019> put<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:12.209> one

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
know so I'm going to put this in one

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.600 
know so I'm going to put this in one
module<00:03:13.420> at<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.810> time<00:03:14.049> play<00:03:14.320> pay<00:03:15.010> attention<00:03:15.040> to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
module at a time play pay attention to

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.080 
module at a time play pay attention to
your<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.950> your<00:03:17.980> modules<00:03:18.549> because<00:03:18.730> there's<00:03:19.000> a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
your to your modules because there's a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.690 
your to your modules because there's a
short<00:03:19.420> end<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:20.019> I<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.890> longer<00:03:21.280> end<00:03:21.310> look

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
short end and I and the longer end look

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.030 
short end and I and the longer end look
in<00:03:21.910> there<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:23.100> at<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.310> slot<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.620> at<00:03:26.620> least<00:03:26.769> on

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
in there the at the slot and at least on

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.770 
in there the at the slot and at least on
mine<00:03:27.220> I'll<00:03:27.459> see<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.820> the<00:03:27.910> shorter<00:03:28.420> end<00:03:28.450> of

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
mine I'll see that the shorter end of

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.390 
mine I'll see that the shorter end of
the<00:03:28.840> module<00:03:28.989> goes<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> right<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:33.250> I'm

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
the module goes to the right so I'm

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.840 
the module goes to the right so I'm
pushing<00:03:33.880> out<00:03:34.950> there's<00:03:35.950> these<00:03:36.070> two<00:03:36.130> white<00:03:36.519> tabs

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
pushing out there's these two white tabs

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.470 
pushing out there's these two white tabs
in<00:03:37.150> here<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:39.250> push<00:03:39.489> out<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.030> allows<00:03:40.269> this

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
in here you push out and it allows this

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.130 
in here you push out and it allows this
memory<00:03:40.900> door<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.320> lift<00:03:41.530> down<00:03:42.720> once<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.840> memory

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
memory door to lift down once the memory

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.199 
memory door to lift down once the memory
door<00:03:44.320> lifts<00:03:44.709> down<00:03:44.950> put<00:03:45.850> your<00:03:45.880> modules<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
door lifts down put your modules and

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.180 
door lifts down put your modules and
again<00:03:49.540> make<00:03:49.810> sure<00:03:49.840> you're<00:03:50.260> you're<00:03:50.769> minding<00:03:51.100> it

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
again make sure you're you're minding it

00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:03.610 
again make sure you're you're minding it
up<00:03:51.310> right<00:03:51.549> look<00:03:51.730> at<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.000> slot<00:03:52.299> in<00:03:52.480> there

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.350 

and<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.310> never<00:04:04.430> want<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:04.760> force<00:04:04.940> with<00:04:05.209> this

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
and you never want to force with this

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.350 
and you never want to force with this
but<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:05.629> want<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:05.810> make<00:04:05.989> sure<00:04:06.049> it's<00:04:06.379> seated<00:04:07.360> so

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
but you want to make sure it's seated so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.059 
but you want to make sure it's seated so
with<00:04:08.510> your<00:04:08.540> fingers<00:04:08.959> gently<00:04:09.230> push<00:04:09.590> make<00:04:09.860> sure

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
with your fingers gently push make sure

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:12.729 
with your fingers gently push make sure
it<00:04:10.190> seats<00:04:10.489> in<00:04:10.879> and<00:04:11.450> and<00:04:12.319> then<00:04:12.379> kind<00:04:12.590> of

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
it seats in and and then kind of

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.920 
it seats in and and then kind of
visually<00:04:13.099> inspect<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.700> make<00:04:13.819> sure<00:04:13.849> that<00:04:14.060> it's

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.640 

yep<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.169> looks<00:04:18.350> good<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:21.320> then<00:04:21.410> I'm<00:04:21.470> going<00:04:21.620> to

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
yep it looks good and then I'm going to

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.129 
yep it looks good and then I'm going to
do<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.889> second<00:04:22.310> module<00:04:22.900> again<00:04:23.900> these<00:04:24.080> are

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
do the second module again these are

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.890 
do the second module again these are
eight<00:04:24.440> gig<00:04:24.740> modules<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.580> since<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.510> came<00:04:26.720> with

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
eight gig modules so since it came with

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.939 
eight gig modules so since it came with
16<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:28.580> adding<00:04:29.060> 16<00:04:29.540> more<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.990> 16<00:04:30.410> times<00:04:30.650> two

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
16 I'm adding 16 more and 16 times two

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:47.249 
16 I'm adding 16 more and 16 times two
is<00:04:30.979> 32

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.680 

and<00:04:48.259> I<00:04:48.349> mean<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.620> saved<00:04:48.919> a<00:04:49.069> ton<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.310> cash<00:04:49.580> like<00:04:50.569> I

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
and I mean I saved a ton of cash like I

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
and I mean I saved a ton of cash like I
said<00:04:50.750> doing<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.440> on<00:04:51.680> my<00:04:51.710> own<00:04:53.530> keep<00:04:54.530> in<00:04:54.680> mind

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
said doing this on my own keep in mind

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.439 
said doing this on my own keep in mind
if<00:04:55.039> you<00:04:55.129> buy<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.340> mac<00:04:55.729> with<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.060> minimum

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
if you buy the mac with the minimum

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.749 
if you buy the mac with the minimum
amount<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.800> memory<00:04:57.949> it's<00:04:58.220> likely<00:04:58.610> going<00:04:58.699> to

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
amount of memory it's likely going to

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:00.580 
amount of memory it's likely going to
have<00:04:58.940> four<00:04:59.270> modules<00:04:59.569> which<00:05:00.169> means<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.500> you

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
have four modules which means that you

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.230 
have four modules which means that you
would<00:05:00.770> have<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.220> discard<00:05:03.370> see<00:05:04.370> this<00:05:04.580> this<00:05:05.000> came

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
would have to discard see this this came

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.909 
would have to discard see this this came
with<00:05:05.449> two<00:05:05.629> eights<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.770> maximum

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
with two eights so the maximum

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.950 
with two eights so the maximum
configuration<00:05:07.879> for<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.180> for<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.479> side<00:05:08.720> Mac

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
configuration for the for the side Mac

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.159 
configuration for the for the side Mac
is<00:05:09.110> 32<00:05:09.710> gigs<00:05:09.979> so<00:05:10.280> I<00:05:11.210> had<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.449> buy<00:05:11.599> two<00:05:11.629> more<00:05:11.840> aged

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
is 32 gigs so I had to buy two more aged

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.110 
is 32 gigs so I had to buy two more aged
but<00:05:12.470> pay<00:05:13.009> attention<00:05:13.039> to<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:13.669> because<00:05:13.729> if<00:05:14.030> you

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
but pay attention to that because if you

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.089 
but pay attention to that because if you
bought<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.449> with<00:05:14.539> other<00:05:14.659> configurations<00:05:15.440> yes

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
bought it with other configurations yes

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:17.920 
bought it with other configurations yes
you're<00:05:16.909> probably<00:05:17.090> going<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.360> end<00:05:17.389> up<00:05:17.509> spending

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you're probably going to end up spending

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.520 
you're probably going to end up spending
more<00:05:18.199> money<00:05:18.259> and<00:05:19.690> not<00:05:20.690> using<00:05:21.199> some<00:05:21.380> of<00:05:21.409> the

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
more money and not using some of the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.710 
more money and not using some of the
modules<00:05:21.699> okay<00:05:22.699> so<00:05:22.759> all<00:05:22.880> those<00:05:23.210> are<00:05:23.389> in<00:05:23.509> there<00:05:23.690> I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
modules okay so all those are in there I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.700 
modules okay so all those are in there I
just<00:05:23.990> did<00:05:24.139> a<00:05:25.900> finger<00:05:26.900> sweep<00:05:27.169> to<00:05:27.409> make<00:05:27.560> sure

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
just did a finger sweep to make sure

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.550 
just did a finger sweep to make sure
they<00:05:27.889> feel<00:05:28.099> feel<00:05:28.729> secure<00:05:29.169> this<00:05:30.169> is<00:05:30.349> obviously

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
they feel feel secure this is obviously

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.809 
they feel feel secure this is obviously
something<00:05:30.979> you<00:05:31.190> don't<00:05:31.340> want<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.520> have<00:05:31.610> to<00:05:31.699> be

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
something you don't want to have to be

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.399 
something you don't want to have to be
opening<00:05:32.210> on<00:05:32.330> a<00:05:32.360> regular<00:05:32.539> basis<00:05:33.080> so<00:05:33.110> make<00:05:33.380> sure

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
opening on a regular basis so make sure

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.649 
opening on a regular basis so make sure
it's<00:05:33.650> done<00:05:33.770> right<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.130> first<00:05:34.159> time<00:05:34.659> once

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
it's done right the first time once

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.059 
it's done right the first time once
they're<00:05:35.840> in<00:05:35.990> they're<00:05:36.020> well<00:05:36.409> seated<00:05:36.710> push

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:37.069 
they're in they're well seated push

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.879 
they're in they're well seated push
these<00:05:37.250> little<00:05:37.520> tabs<00:05:37.699> back<00:05:38.120> in<00:05:38.360> gently<00:05:38.889> and

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
these little tabs back in gently and

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.369 
these little tabs back in gently and
then<00:05:40.300> they'll<00:05:41.300> lock<00:05:41.479> in<00:05:41.719> on<00:05:41.840> the<00:05:41.960> side<00:05:44.379> check

00:05:45.369 --> 00:05:45.379 
then they'll lock in on the side check

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:46.839 
then they'll lock in on the side check
your<00:05:45.530> modules<00:05:46.009> again<00:05:46.280> make<00:05:46.490> sure<00:05:46.520> they're

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
your modules again make sure they're

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.649 
your modules again make sure they're
seated<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.569> then<00:05:47.840> put<00:05:48.020> your<00:05:48.050> door<00:05:48.349> back<00:05:48.650> on<00:05:48.860> I

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659 
seated and then put your door back on I

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.790 
seated and then put your door back on I
laid<00:05:50.659> it<00:05:50.690> down<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.199> I<00:05:51.229> remember<00:05:51.650> the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
laid it down so I remember the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:59.740 
laid it down so I remember the
orientation<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:58.210> it's<00:05:59.210> kind<00:05:59.389> of<00:05:59.449> a<00:05:59.569> funny

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
orientation and it's kind of a funny

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.540 
orientation and it's kind of a funny
feeling<00:06:00.229> when<00:06:00.349> it<00:06:00.440> snaps<00:06:00.680> in<00:06:00.949> it's<00:06:01.190> just<00:06:01.400> the

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
feeling when it snaps in it's just the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:09.850 
feeling when it snaps in it's just the
design<00:06:01.880> of<00:06:01.909> it<00:06:07.900> but<00:06:08.900> once<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.199> snaps<00:06:09.469> in<00:06:09.710> is

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
design of it but once the snaps in is

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.519 
design of it but once the snaps in is
flush<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:11.419> if<00:06:11.599> you<00:06:11.690> ever<00:06:11.810> need<00:06:12.050> it<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.259> remove

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
flush and if you ever need it to remove

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.080 
flush and if you ever need it to remove
that<00:06:12.560> again<00:06:12.979> for<00:06:13.009> whatever<00:06:13.460> reason<00:06:13.909> it's

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
that again for whatever reason it's
