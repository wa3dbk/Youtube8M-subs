00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.010
 today I will show you how to sew a secret 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.130
 this zipper can be sewn 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.529
 imperceptibly visible only lock 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.690
 lightning secret zipper 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.760
 different from the usual in that she has 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.360
 the lock is on the back of 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.150
 winding 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.189
 or lightning teeth when like normal 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.710
 the zipper is on the side 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.410
 teeth but be careful when 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.320
 buying because it is selling and there are similar 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.690
 German in which navivka hidden under 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.670
 braid zipper but such zipper 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.130
 impossible to sew as a secret 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.080
 it's just plain hidden zipper 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.420
 cloves how to distinguish them 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.650
 a secret zipper teeth can be bent 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.530
 unbuttoned 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.910
 under the iron when ironing products zipper 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.090
 may get a little hooked 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.050
 and the seam will start the power to not 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.720
 Happened to the right and utyuzhit for you 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.020
 if cotton zipper need it 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.030
 iron the seam before joining 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.290
 lightning sheet of what's on a typewriter 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 inspection and ingot and loose tensile 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.320
 or cut by a scythe then when starting under 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.079
 lightning 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.850
 better glue carts non-woven this 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.329
 there may be gang- shaped stripes 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.780
 or conden gang they are different in that 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.740
 we will bow a background on a braid and it is applied 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.539
 on oblique cuts and knitwear 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.380
 You press on like that 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.659
 the forum bow coincided with the marking of the seam a 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.090
 content bow we carve straight from the thread 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.969
 piercing flizelin and is used for 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.310
 strengthen straight cuts 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.499
 we iron it on the allowance so that 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.069
 marking seam he went to one 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.819
 millimeter then sweep the seam allowances 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.579
 on the bottom not 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.889
 it must be done to 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.250
 avoid skewing the two sides of the leg when 

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:06.070
 stitching her 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.880
 seam allowances are wrapped separately 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.580
 if you unleash and there is a rule 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.800
 when starting, you first need to iron 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.080
 then just undoing now take 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.870
 zip and impose it from the inside out on 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.170
 sour cream seam so that the cloves form 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.820
 I pin a zipper to the noise along the seam 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.560
 pins across just under the teeth 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.380
 loose ends of lightning above too 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.070
 fall on the allowances of the lock should 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.140
 reach the markup of your top 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.750
 for convenience, you can pull the lock in 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.180
 front side of fabric 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.880
 Now lightning needs to be scaled but attention 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.239
 only one layer of fabric per allowances 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.470
 seam 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:55.840
 basting comes in the middle with a zipper tape 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.250
 we remove pins and remove the mark under 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 lightning open lightning to the end now 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.260
 we need to stitch it 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.760
 make it sweet to eat 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.120
 complete with any typewriter 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.790
 this is the so-called 1 horn foot or 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.450
 zipper foot it allows you to walk 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.239
 close her teeth set 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.780
 foot so that the needle was to the left of 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.430
 paws 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.190
 the needle is in the extreme left position 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.920
 now bend the allowance with my turn down 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 finger zippers put under 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.310
 foot in a tight clove expended 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.280
 when the cloves get back the line 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.290
 hide under them if the lines are on 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.579
 lightning is not visible then you all did 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.790
 scribble correctly as long as the foot 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.030
 will not rest on the zipper lock 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.150
 stop 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.720
 zakrepku tip lightning 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:58.870
 sewn second half lightning 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.510
 can be sewn up from the bottom also bend 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.569
 clove and pave the line leaving 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.459
 free tip null 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.950
 moving webs of the type with satin 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.500
 combining a cell or strip to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.870
 avoid skewing the fabric is better the second 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.570
 side zipper also sew on top 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.260
 down for this you need to rearrange the foot 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.800
 so that the needle was to her right the needle 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.419
 Expose extreme right 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.050
 close the zipper and check the quality 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.770
 seam 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.530
 quite the mole should not be visible if 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.199
 suddenly she is visible repeat the operation not 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.919
 stripping the previous line trying 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.100
 come closer to cloves much left 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.380
 Stitch seam reinforcements 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.830
 paws put so that the needle was on the right 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.280
 from her I needle we expose the extreme right 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.919
 position we need to start the seam a little higher 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.610
 suture zipper with overlap on 510 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.169
 millimeters 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.280
 that more seam was not a hole 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.010
 we enclose at start-up from a lightning under 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.199
 foot and stick the needle into the fabric so that 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.550
 she was one millimeter away from the seam 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.520
 stitching lightning 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.430
 this will allow the fabric to close over the zipper 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.599
 no need to strive to get into exactly 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.169
 Well, we do not make a bar 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:23.199
 laying the line along the seam below the zipper 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.880
 something like this should work for you with 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.639
 on the front we only see 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.050
 lock needed 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.110
 now it only remains completely 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.479
 unclamp seam allowances from inside 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.539
 the seam is not ironed so as not to start at 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.520
 At the start of the sale there are special trays for 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.550
 in secret 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.300
 they differ in that at the base of the foot 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.400
 There is a hole for the teeth of the zipper 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.259
 It gets into their teeth bent CMI 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.020
 foot and served at an angle 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:54.620
 which naturally simplifies the process 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.620
 attaching 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:01.490
 to sew well secret zipper need 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:04.229
 to begin to sweep the incision under the zipper 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.169
 bang lightning 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:11.310
 scatter down the slit under the zipper and 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:15.449
 open the zipper itself pritach zipper with 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:18.120
 using the foot close to the tooth 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:21.750
 seam under the zipper with 1 horn 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.520
 paws now you learned quickly and 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.520
 I can carefully sew the secret
