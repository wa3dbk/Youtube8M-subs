 of the year with the ink came that did 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.539
 against the candle I also found that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 It was worth buying what I did. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.610

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.920
 made it into the vein that this product is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.050

 Good, it's very sweet, I think it's very sweet. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.859

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.930
