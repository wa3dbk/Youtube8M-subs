and that is the measurement of God man

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.299

the<00:00:32.940> scripture<00:00:33.390> tells<00:00:33.600> us<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.870> man

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
the scripture tells us that man

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.530 
the scripture tells us that man
basically<00:00:35.309> defines<00:00:35.670> success<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.270> way<00:00:36.360> he

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
basically defines success the way he

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.720 
basically defines success the way he
wants<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.170> God<00:00:37.350> has<00:00:37.649> his<00:00:38.010> definition<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
wants to but God has his definition of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.170 
wants to but God has his definition of
success<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.500> a<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.399> seems<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
success and a way that seems right to a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.700 
success and a way that seems right to a
man<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.480> isn't<00:00:43.320> right<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.739> God<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
man but isn't right with God and so we

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.680 
man but isn't right with God and so we
have<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.980> very<00:00:47.100> careful<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:48.270> did<00:00:48.510> make

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
have to be very careful we did make

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
have to be very careful we did make
mistakes<00:00:49.079> tonight<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:49.710> those<00:00:49.890> are<00:00:50.070> mistakes
