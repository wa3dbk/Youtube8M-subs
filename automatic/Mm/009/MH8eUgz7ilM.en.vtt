in my opinion one reason being is I if

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030 
in my opinion one reason being is I if
you<00:01:15.570> look<00:01:15.720> at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.900> tempest<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> crossbow

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you look at the tempest or the crossbow

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.850 
you look at the tempest or the crossbow
or<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.670> machine<00:01:18.180> gun<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> no<00:01:19.350> charge<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
or the machine gun there is no charge up

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.090 
or the machine gun there is no charge up
time<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.939> pre<00:01:21.450> aim<00:01:21.600> pow<00:01:22.140> preme<00:01:22.650> pal

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
time so it's just pre aim pow preme pal

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.490 
time so it's just pre aim pow preme pal
and<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.540> good<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.960> 1b<00:01:25.140> once

and it is really really good at 1b once
the<00:01:25.799> only<00:01:25.979> downside<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:26.970> gun<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the only downside to this gun it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.050

really bad at to be ones the slow reload
animation<00:01:30.270> makes<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.200> very<00:01:32.159> very

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
animation makes it kind of very very

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.240 
animation makes it kind of very very
difficult<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.210> win<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> 2v1<00:01:34.439> situation<00:01:35.130> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
difficult to win a 2v1 situation so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.710 
difficult to win a 2v1 situation so
that's<00:01:35.460> why<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.640> would<00:01:36.000> stick<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.509> number

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that's why I would stick this at number

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
that's why I would stick this at number
3<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> best<00:01:37.979> 1v1<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> game<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.689> can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
3 it is the best 1v1 in the game it can

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.109 
3 it is the best 1v1 in the game it can
also<00:01:39.960> here's<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> best<00:01:41.490> strength<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.030> my

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
also here's this best strength in my

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.030 
also here's this best strength in my
opinion<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.840> one-shot<00:01:43.110> kill<00:01:43.740> streaks

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
opinion is to can one-shot kill streaks

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.100 
opinion is to can one-shot kill streaks
if<00:01:44.280> there<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.820> wraith<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.570> area<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
if there is a wraith in the area you

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.649 
if there is a wraith in the area you
have<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.380> Annihilator<00:01:46.979> pull<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.210> put<00:01:48.630> your

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
have an Annihilator pull your put your

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
have an Annihilator pull your put your
trigger<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:49.710> crosshair<00:01:50.130> on<00:01:50.280> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
trigger or put your crosshair on that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.480 
trigger or put your crosshair on that
rate<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> one<00:01:51.540> shot<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.200> insane<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
rate and one shot it is insane and it is

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.910 
rate and one shot it is insane and it is
pretty<00:01:53.700> badass<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.450> that's<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.350> annihilators

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
pretty badass so that's the annihilators

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
pretty badass so that's the annihilators
true<00:01:56.250> strength<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.060> one-shot<00:01:57.270> kill

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
true strength is it can one-shot kill

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.030 
true strength is it can one-shot kill
streaks<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.229> think<00:01:58.439> that's<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.649> badass

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
streaks and I think that's really badass

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.660 
streaks and I think that's really badass
so<00:01:59.820> number<00:02:00.030> two<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.600> our<00:02:00.659> countdown<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
so number two on our countdown is the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.429 
so number two on our countdown is the

for a little bit and it was kind of

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820 
for a little bit and it was kind of
confusing<00:02:12.300> at<00:02:12.450> first<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.780> use<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.200> once<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
confusing at first to use but once you

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
confusing at first to use but once you
for<00:02:14.040> this<00:02:14.190> gun<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.000> insanely<00:02:15.570> insanely

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
for this gun it is insanely insanely

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
good for clearing out buildings and

is honestly amazing for getting those
double<00:02:25.290> kills<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.100> highly<00:02:26.400> suggest<00:02:26.670> using

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
double kills so I highly suggest using

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.670

pretty<00:02:43.170> upset<00:02:43.260> about<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.770> but<00:02:44.040> like<00:02:44.520> I<00:02:44.670> said

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
pretty upset about it but like I said

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
pretty upset about it but like I said
guys<00:02:45.090> The<00:02:45.540> Tempest<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.020> really<00:02:46.320> good<00:02:46.440> for

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
guys The Tempest is really good for

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.290 
guys The Tempest is really good for
clearing<00:02:46.920> out<00:02:47.040> buildings<00:02:47.400> good<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:47.940> tubing

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
clearing out buildings good for tubing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.940 
clearing out buildings good for tubing
ones<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.660> only<00:02:48.810> downside<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.590> gun<00:02:49.800> is

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
ones the only downside to this gun is

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.010 
ones the only downside to this gun is
that<00:02:50.520> when<00:02:50.730> there's<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.060> players<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.690> takes<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
that when there's two players it takes a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.180 
that when there's two players it takes a
while<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.410> second<00:02:52.709> player<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:52.890> die

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
while for the second player to die

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.949 
while for the second player to die
that's<00:02:53.850> why<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:54.030> kind<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> feel<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:54.630> it's

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that's why I kind of feel like it's

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.350 
that's why I kind of feel like it's
still<00:02:55.230> not<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.890> best<00:02:56.040> for<00:02:56.550> multiple<00:02:56.970> enemies

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
still not the best for multiple enemies

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
still not the best for multiple enemies
but<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.110> good<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.500> clearing<00:02:58.830> out

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
but it is good for clearing out

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.470 
but it is good for clearing out
buildings<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.550> that's<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.060> feel<00:03:00.330> like
