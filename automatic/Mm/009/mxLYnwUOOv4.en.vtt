00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
cars run a backup radio so you have a

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.640 
cars run a backup radio so you have a
problem<00:04:15.480> inside<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.960> car<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.290> think<00:04:16.470> it's

they're<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.450> aerodynamic<00:05:02.050> today<00:05:03.360> it's<00:05:04.360> a

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
they're so aerodynamic today it's a

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.600 
they're so aerodynamic today it's a
built<00:05:05.290> a<00:05:05.380> great<00:05:05.560> facility<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:06.280> it's<00:05:06.430> just

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
built a great facility here it's just

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.730 
built a great facility here it's just
like<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.850> cpp<00:05:07.300> it's<00:05:07.660> hard<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.170> run<00:05:08.380> side<00:05:08.710> by

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
like the cpp it's hard to run side by

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.770 
like the cpp it's hard to run side by
side<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.220> says<00:05:09.340> everybody<00:05:10.180> wants<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.540> be<00:05:10.630> on

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
side it says everybody wants to be on

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.240 
side it says everybody wants to be on
the<00:05:10.870> same<00:05:11.080> piece<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> real<00:05:11.650> estate<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.980> this

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
the same piece of real estate on this

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.400 
the same piece of real estate on this
racetrack<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:13.180> got<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:13.510> get<00:05:13.960> down<00:05:14.170> to<00:05:14.380> the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
racetrack you got to get down to the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.440 
racetrack you got to get down to the
bottom<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:15.130> cars<00:05:15.400> push<00:05:15.670> up<00:05:15.880> in<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.120> center

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
bottom the cars push up in the center

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.270 
bottom the cars push up in the center
and<00:05:16.630> everybody<00:05:17.500> wants<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.770> be<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.950> same<00:05:18.130> place

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
and everybody wants to be the same place

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.610 
and everybody wants to be the same place
so<00:05:18.610> it's<00:05:18.910> very<00:05:19.210> hard<00:05:19.510> to<00:05:19.540> run<00:05:19.750> side<00:05:20.050> by<00:05:20.080> side

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
so it's very hard to run side by side

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.460 
so it's very hard to run side by side
every<00:05:21.280> lap<00:05:21.510> let's<00:05:22.510> compare<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> banking<00:05:23.350> of

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
every lap let's compare the banking of

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.980 
every lap let's compare the banking of
this<00:05:23.650> racetrack<00:05:24.100> with<00:05:24.460> one<00:05:24.730> for<00:05:25.150> example<00:05:25.270> off
