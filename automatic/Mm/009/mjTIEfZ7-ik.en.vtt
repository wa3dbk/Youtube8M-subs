hi my name is Anna Hansen and today we
are<00:00:07.479> making<00:00:07.600> hokey-pokey<00:00:08.290> ice<00:00:08.889> cream<00:00:09.340> so

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
are making hokey-pokey ice cream so

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.329 
are making hokey-pokey ice cream so
first<00:00:10.750> of<00:00:10.929> all<00:00:11.070> glucose<00:00:12.599> 95<00:00:13.599> grams<00:00:13.990> and<00:00:14.499> then

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
first of all glucose 95 grams and then

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.859 
first of all glucose 95 grams and then
55<00:00:15.969> grams<00:00:16.330> of<00:00:16.980> golden<00:00:17.980> syrup<00:00:18.510> that's<00:00:19.510> going

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
55 grams of golden syrup that's going

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.970 
55 grams of golden syrup that's going
stove<00:00:21.150> yeah

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
stove yeah

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.349 
stove yeah
the<00:00:23.980> reason<00:00:24.250> I've<00:00:24.369> put<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.670> liquids<00:00:25.090> on<00:00:25.269> the

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
the reason I've put the liquids on the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.089 
the reason I've put the liquids on the
pot<00:00:25.599> first<00:00:25.929> it<00:00:26.500> just<00:00:26.710> makes<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.070> whole

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
pot first it just makes the whole

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.509 
pot first it just makes the whole
process<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.670> lot<00:00:28.000> easier<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:30.099> will<00:00:30.250> begin<00:00:30.460> to

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
process a lot easier they will begin to

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.760 
process a lot easier they will begin to
melt<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.330> then<00:00:31.779> I'm<00:00:31.929> putting<00:00:32.140> caster<00:00:32.740> sugar

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
melt and then I'm putting caster sugar

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.330 
melt and then I'm putting caster sugar
on<00:00:33.160> top<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.910> now<00:00:37.120> just<00:00:37.329> going<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.629> leave<00:00:37.809> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
on top I'm now just going to leave this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240

over a high heat until the ingredients

over a high heat until the ingredients
begin<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.180> melt<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.719> bubble<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:45.399> I'll<00:00:45.579> show

can<00:01:07.000> see<00:01:07.240> it's<00:01:07.450> all<00:01:07.660> starting<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:08.290> melt<00:01:08.530> I'm

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
can see it's all starting to melt I'm

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:16.200 
can see it's all starting to melt I'm
just<00:01:09.159> gonna<00:01:09.310> whisk<00:01:09.610> that<00:01:09.729> around<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.360> bit

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.090 

getting<00:01:17.020> even<00:01:17.380> consistency<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:23.530> leave<00:01:23.950> it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
getting even consistency just leave it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.590 
getting even consistency just leave it
the<00:01:24.190> game<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.850> give<00:01:28.030> it<00:01:28.120> a<00:01:28.150> little<00:01:28.270> whisk

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
the game and just give it a little whisk

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.840 
the game and just give it a little whisk
from<00:01:29.050> time<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.530> time<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:30.250> make<00:01:30.430> sure<00:01:30.460> it's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
from time to time to make sure it's

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.460 
from time to time to make sure it's
evenly<00:01:31.590> caramelizing<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:35.020> for<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.290> most

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
evenly caramelizing but for the most

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.130 
evenly caramelizing but for the most
part<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.830> can<00:01:35.979> just<00:01:36.010> let<00:01:36.310> it<00:01:36.430> boil<00:01:36.670> away<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
part you can just let it boil away the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.350 
part you can just let it boil away the
texture<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:39.130> caramel<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:39.790> beginning<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
texture of this caramel is beginning to

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.800 
texture of this caramel is beginning to
change

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
change

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.920 
change
there's<00:01:41.530> a<00:01:41.619> lot<00:01:41.800> more<00:01:41.979> bubbles<00:01:42.550> the<00:01:43.510> mixtures

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
there's a lot more bubbles the mixtures

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.130 
there's a lot more bubbles the mixtures
becoming<00:01:44.550> molten<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.850> liquids<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.810> sugars

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
becoming molten and liquids the sugars

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.190 
becoming molten and liquids the sugars
dissolved<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.450> now<00:01:49.600> I'm<00:01:49.750> going<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:49.990> start

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
dissolved so now I'm going to start

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.230 
dissolved so now I'm going to start
whisking<00:01:50.410> it<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.770> bit<00:01:50.920> more<00:01:51.130> because<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.880> want<00:01:51.970> to

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
whisking it a bit more because I want to

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.240 
whisking it a bit more because I want to
get<00:01:52.330> as<00:01:52.479> much<00:01:52.630> air<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.200> here<00:01:53.410> as<00:01:53.530> possible

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
get as much air and here as possible

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.210 
get as much air and here as possible
and<00:01:54.940> at<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.780> same<00:01:55.990> time<00:01:56.259> you<00:01:56.649> can<00:01:56.770> begin<00:01:56.920> to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
and at the same time you can begin to

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.249 
and at the same time you can begin to
smell<00:01:57.490> this<00:01:57.759> sugars<00:01:58.090> caramelizing<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:02.020> if

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
smell this sugars caramelizing so if

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.440 
smell this sugars caramelizing so if
you've<00:02:02.440> got<00:02:02.619> a<00:02:02.649> thermometer<00:02:03.280> at<00:02:03.399> home<00:02:03.610> you're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
you've got a thermometer at home you're

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.310 
you've got a thermometer at home you're
aiming<00:02:04.869> for<00:02:05.080> about<00:02:05.310> 140<00:02:06.310> degrees<00:02:06.960> 150<00:02:07.960> degrees

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
aiming for about 140 degrees 150 degrees

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.469 
aiming for about 140 degrees 150 degrees
Celsius<00:02:08.950> but<00:02:09.250> if<00:02:09.910> you<00:02:10.000> don't<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.450> a

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
Celsius but if you don't have a

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.540 
Celsius but if you don't have a
thermometer<00:02:10.720> it's<00:02:11.350> not<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> big<00:02:11.800> deal<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.280> just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
thermometer it's not a big deal you just

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.300 
thermometer it's not a big deal you just
need<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.880> be<00:02:13.030> smelling<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.290> aroma<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:15.070> when

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
need to be smelling the aroma and when

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.670 
need to be smelling the aroma and when
you<00:02:15.430> win<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:15.880> looking<00:02:16.209> at<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.420> color<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you win it and looking at the color so

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.280 
you win it and looking at the color so
as<00:02:18.150> basically<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> bubbles<00:02:19.660> are<00:02:19.840> starting<00:02:20.200> to

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
as basically the bubbles are starting to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.310 
as basically the bubbles are starting to
get<00:02:20.410> bigger<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:22.000> that's<00:02:22.840> we're<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.080> to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
get bigger and that's we're going to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.400 
get bigger and that's we're going to
smell<00:02:23.560> more<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.070> caramel<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:25.450> look

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
smell more like a caramel and look
