00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello my name is vladimir you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.210
 Watch the video review from the site irr.ru 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 and today I want to draw your attention to 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 new accessory even I would say the unit 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.250
 which will be useful to very many 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.710
 For anglers, this is a wireless sounder with 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.340
 Varyy data transfer is called 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.250
 varnishes leaker from fishfinder in general 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.599
 wireless careless wi-fi already 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.070
 for a long time are popular but 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 only woad decided to enter the market and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.380
 first of all take price at the echo sounder 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.129
 if you open the box we have 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.739
 instruction in English but if 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.390
 fall but we have then you will still 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.170
 instruction in Russian where everything is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.399
 easy enough translated 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.010
 itself directly to the sonar and postings 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.610
 in order to charge and built 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.090
 battery 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.699
 Now I want to tell you about how 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.799
 decks of work and pay special attention 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.510
 on top how to include the echo sounder in the first 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.640
 times because many have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.159
 problems and not everything is clear let's 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 to understand 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.610
 in order to turn on and serf first 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.110
 need to open it here 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.119
 the cover is easy to open there is also 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.000
 coin hole does not need any 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 screwdriver cover as you see properly 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.759
 rubberized you can not worry about 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.979
 that water gets inside 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.930
 Yakov charged as follows 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.909
 took care of where the cable is and just 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.619
 Connect to the computer is nothing complicated 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.090
 charging time to sunbathe specially 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.920
 light indication now I tell you it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.049
 I show here the blue robe if it works 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.530
 blue from cast it charges red 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.360
 all just turned on the echo sounder 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 now we need to firstly download 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.440
 attachments to the instructions on it will 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.300
 link all very easy to download 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.020
 application and then we turn on the most 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.990
 bathrobe go wi fi settings and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.870
 choose wolf net called she 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.930
 guts I will say right away that you first need 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.090
 will enter password 2 I will not speak 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.880
 but the designs also have a password therefore 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.560
 you can not worry about what your 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.660
 let's wirelessly connect the ceiling 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.640
 This is sometimes the way changes in 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.560
 settings and so we already connected to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.959
 my visit faynder 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.750
 and after that we need to run 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.020
 special application to 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.480
 you need to start working with the echo sounder 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.310
 today to chain closed sure that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.100
 many have a question and how much 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.110
 Enough echo sounder if it is fed but by a 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.300
 wolf I both somewhat we know pleased 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.830
 and organics process specifically for 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.880
 battery saving 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.030
 turn on if slave is in position 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.590
 turn on but it doesn't water the rooms don't 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.390
 closes and no signal 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.030
 transmitted only after debt ceiling 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.190
 will be in the water in 45 seconds we 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.769
 click start working and in mode 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.140
 real time in on our screen 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.330
 update this case the phone is almost 7 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.040
 information appears as you understand 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.260
 if the cold goes on in a static 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.080
 position as we are now in the glass teremok 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.140
 simply contact has closed 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.799
 information is not updated get 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.799
 for example from water to serf information 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.090
 also not updated as you see here 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.150
 there is a special eyelet 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.590
 echo sounder can be attached here 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.959
 fishing line and animals see which one 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.720
 bottom of the place where you want to fish on 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:52.180
 boat so let's see how everything 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.549
 would work for example on when 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.420
 we would be on a normal pond 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.200
 while fishing, press demo mode and 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.239
 please like this it will be 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.930
 look now let's take a look 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.220
 dwell on the technical 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.489
 characteristics 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.860
 The device recalls that the application 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.110
 Dima is working now so what 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.209
 can this and slave in the first this one 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.150
 what the game of the lot and the transmission distance 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.079
 signal 50 meters that is between your 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.100
 smartphone or tablet and between 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.340
 echo sounder should be no more than 10 meters 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.860
 100 on 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:32.910
 at 125 kilohertz 90 degrees is the angle 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.490
 ray which gives you holov about 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.460
 measurement manufacturers claim from 60 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.620
 centimeters to 45 meters here on this 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.940
 the depth of this echo sounder will be fine 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.770
 work from one charge full he 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.570
 It works for five hours, that is, if it 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.789
 is in the water then 5 hours it will be 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.770
 seamlessly transmit a signal with 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.930
 using wifi on your phone 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.080
 card phone can rather here than 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:01.030
 This echo sounder is charging too 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.979
 standard as I said about simple 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.389
 wires from us 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:09.939
 on the screen we can see quite 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.669
 a clear bottom structure it shows us 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.729
 presence of fish and also merit distance 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.099
 should at what depth is the fish 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.289
 Do not forget that the echo sounder still has 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.030
 the temperature is free 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.960
 space useful most important 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.629
 modern device on beam serf 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.719
 it's called la kill maker and this is 516 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.759
 remind that they released his fish finder 

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:36.039
 everything is extremely simple information on 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.349
 your smartphone's screen is not going to 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:41.139
 think you just need to go to the house 53 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.969
 beam on the computer then you 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.919
 will be a reliable device to 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.210
 check the bottom structure and select 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.580
 pretty accurate place 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.629
 that day you want to fish depending 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.960
 from what kind of fish 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:56.289
 I want you so I wish you night 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.879
 beams get exactly the stickers on 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:02.039
 really quite simple quite 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:02.039
 firmly and securely
