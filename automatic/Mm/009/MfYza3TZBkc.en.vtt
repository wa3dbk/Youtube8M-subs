00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.740
 it's lubin again 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.850
 I have to say hello and warmly 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.720
 invited 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.070
 / blog as I said about bees and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.179
 I have a couple of days already movie 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.189
 made there was the area 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.859
 In my opinion, too little food 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.560
 and there was also on the film every 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.089
 lots of rewrites or mails i 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.870
 Thank you for that and there was still 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.300
 very good suggestions on the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 fast could not implement and also 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 not wanted 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 for example, this thing with the carpet 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 I did not have any natural carpet 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.890
 cotton and any synthetic fibers 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 I liked not purely in the booty 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.790
 I'm a bit skeptical about that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.430
 then i phoned imker trade 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.910
 and the statement was clearly lining 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.220
 dough is the word can help and that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.770
 feed day as close as possible to that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.780
 alliance very simple matter 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.890
 everything else is pretty useless 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.509
 then I went to the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.960
 Fast a pack feeds worried 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:16.350
 So this is like plasticine welded 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.069
 in a plastic bag and that should now 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 on it but before we start 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:23.850
 a few more explanations to me 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.649
 I was given there yesterday 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 yes asked in the movie if the bees 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.999
 but already polls if that is not 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.670
 sufficient to supply the people no 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:35.999
 is not enough because even if both 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 blooms when we are under 17 degrees 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.530
 contains the willow to want but no 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.639
 Although nectar with the pollen can if 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.439
 I have the right reminder 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.850
 Although the youngsters will be able to do so 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.319
 but the larvae feed the bees 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.799
 even those can not do anything with nothing 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.450
 start there is the first point why 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.659
 I did come to this misere 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.429
 am misere how much I had from the club 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.499
 the information a box in there too 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.719
 Fill a box a canister feed 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.729
 syrup of course is a thing there 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.240
 3 storm network from the feed 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.560
 not from 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.029
 one simply assumes that the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.359
 Bees already collected fodder before 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.130
 had 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.750
 that would have to be estimated and have 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.390
 in previous movies has already said 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.580
 for laymen very difficult to estimate how 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
 a lot of food after the 3rd 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.120
 yes i dont know anyone about me 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.470
 No problem is hard to laugh 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180
 estimate how much food is still there 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.740
 in it is 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.840
 Therefore one can calculate how much 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.070
 still has to come because the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.070
 Information I got 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.700
 were 15 kilos dry matter forage for 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.510
 a stock and 22 to 24 kilo feed for 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.980
 two days 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.160
 the maybe also the reason why 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 Me there with the two days like mine 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 Looks like big problems starting from 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.550
 Of course, I could complete a lot 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.280
 leads then but then I would still have 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.230
 Feed in from before and that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.680
 Estimating falls next to enormous hard 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:57.120
 there is no experience in the pack 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.670
 are ten kilo 323 kilo I would like 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.100
 So I put it in pieces 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.530
 but we have to leave the film on it 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.550
 this food dough dries and then 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.420
 also does not shine anymore 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.310
 usable so schneider through then 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.400
 again longitudinally and sets has with 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.170
 the open side so on top 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.740
 the film stays over it then comes the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.720
 foil of the booty and the 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.510
 lid on it and that would have to 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.800
 I can not do anything more 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.290
 the bees are still needed 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.720
 humidity because to process that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.580
 I have to say our moisture 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.750
 leave then I hope instead of the somewhere 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.890
 find out here or I'll stand 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.120
 maybe a schippchen here 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.580
 today they are not flying 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.670
 he is too cold but it should be warmer 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.530
 then the suggestion will come to me 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.590
 So should this little folk 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.180
 can separate sitting on three days you 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.740
 meant to load in the bees 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.050
 but if they got through until now 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.820
 Actually, that does not really matter 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.820
 should be warmer from next week 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:59.040
 then those over amberg are like that and give 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.230
 Turn on us now if the whole five kilos 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.570
 are there two and a half kilo then 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.650
 we are here for the big folk first 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:11.310
 where the two days is we do 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.720
 half of it and then the one 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.820
 small portions and over again 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.650
 see if they accepted the feed 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.489
 or not 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.660
 and because the whole pack is too wide 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.940
 cut it again in the middle 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.120
 so that the flatter is so that there 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.990
 reinpasst 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.289
 otherwise I do not get it the war 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.440
 Cover not too easier said than 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.440
 done 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.400
 so we have two halves and the 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.180
 I try now somehow under it 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:57.210
 accommodate 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:59.100
 dati the cover goes on that nowhere you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.070
 now all relatively many problems for 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.410
 the people are all right but me 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.510
 I do not want to reproach myself, as I said 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:14.970
 leave I would not have anything even 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:20.599
 conceivable possible undertaken directly 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:23.160
 the book is so out of it 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.610
 so that should now be the now 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.970
 eat 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:33.330
 now comes the lid on it and 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:35.970
 see if that fits perfectly the whole 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.979
 here's something for the people 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.190
 ableger came too easily 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.190
 appeared 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.780
 By the way, I had asked how 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.450
 It takes a long time for the people to starve 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.590
 is and the statement was clear if no 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.490
 lining is there goes the ruckzuck 23 days 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.490
 they are dead 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.850
 that was a sting right in the eye or 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:18.000
 that was bad on the eye 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:20.690
 but put on the hat and the lining 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.690
 on it 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:37.240
 fits perfectly the rest feeds 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.240
 wrap up well again 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.960
 I have it again with this prey 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.800
 purely seen 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.639
 that is empty the shell lining have the 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.570
 taken with the others , it's not 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:57.650
 does it work is I understand this yes 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:59.690
 I always had to count quite apart 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.220
 is said of them of were in the bees 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.940
 I should not really be that big 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.770
 to worry about 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.240
 From next week is warmer weather 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.100
 announced the thing looks quite different 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.490
 out 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:13.100
 but I want my all of them here 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.150
 have done as much as possible that is the 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.949
 point of the matter 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.690
 who wants to know more who follow 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:19.970
 We want to get here someday 

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.280
 once come to our own honey 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.690
 are few left to subscribe to the channel 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.190
 there you can continue the whole thing 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.039
 pursue as miss no consequences 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.970
 as I said the link to subscribe 

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.860
 if I was a little bit the other day 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.270
 garden is still youtube channel rr 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.270
 Hunt so soon
