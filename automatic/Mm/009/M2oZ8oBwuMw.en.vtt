00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.210 
sunblock well I don't anymore it's very
much<00:04:17.570> subconscious<00:04:18.350> decisions<00:04:18.949> that<00:04:19.130> are

course in tongue blocking all of the
techniques<00:04:50.419> I<00:04:50.539> was<00:04:50.690> talking<00:04:50.990> about<00:04:51.050> where<00:04:51.320> you

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
techniques I was talking about where you

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.900 
techniques I was talking about where you
can't<00:04:51.650> get<00:04:51.710> away<00:04:51.830> from<00:04:51.979> using<00:04:52.430> your<00:04:52.700> tongue

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
can't get away from using your tongue

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.890 
can't get away from using your tongue
about<00:04:53.180> harmonica

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
about harmonica

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.370 
about harmonica
I<00:04:57.010> almost<00:04:58.010> every<00:04:58.760> single<00:04:58.970> time<00:04:59.270> 100%<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.200> time

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
I almost every single time 100% of time

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.020 
I almost every single time 100% of time
you<00:05:00.919> hear<00:05:01.130> me<00:05:01.250> playing<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:01.700> middle<00:05:01.789> of<00:05:01.970> the

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
you hear me playing the middle of the

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.770 
you hear me playing the middle of the
harp<00:05:02.240> without<00:05:03.110> bends<00:05:03.560> on<00:05:03.680> tongue<00:05:04.250> blocking

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
harp without bends on tongue blocking

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.089 
harp without bends on tongue blocking
and<00:05:05.780> when<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:05.960> move<00:05:06.200> my<00:05:06.320> way<00:05:06.470> down

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
and when I move my way down

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.909 
and when I move my way down
eventually<00:05:09.220> when<00:05:10.220> I<00:05:10.250> get<00:05:10.430> to<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.610> three<00:05:11.919> area

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
eventually when I get to the three area

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.040 
eventually when I get to the three area
that's<00:05:13.760> when<00:05:13.970> I'm<00:05:14.060> switching<00:05:14.450> over<00:05:14.539> to<00:05:14.720> tongue

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
that's when I'm switching over to tongue

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.089 
that's when I'm switching over to tongue
to<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.590> pucker

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
to the pucker

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:18.640 
to the pucker
so<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:16.550> is<00:05:16.729> my<00:05:16.910> approach<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.570> and<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:18.560> know

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
so that is my approach and and you know

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.690 
so that is my approach and and you know
the<00:05:18.770> high<00:05:18.919> end<00:05:19.160> with<00:05:20.919> all<00:05:21.919> that<00:05:22.190> stuff<00:05:22.490> the

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
the high end with all that stuff the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.700 
the high end with all that stuff the
first<00:05:22.880> position<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.570> blow<00:05:24.200> beds<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.650> all

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
first position and blow beds and all

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.420 
first position and blow beds and all
that<00:05:24.919> that's<00:05:25.330> puckering<00:05:26.330> for<00:05:26.630> me<00:05:27.280> so<00:05:28.280> that's

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
that that's puckering for me so that's

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.180 
that that's puckering for me so that's
how<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.669> use<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.090> I<00:05:29.450> feel<00:05:30.139> like<00:05:30.260> I<00:05:30.289> can<00:05:30.560> get<00:05:30.710> the

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
how I use it I feel like I can get the

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.390 
how I use it I feel like I can get the
tone<00:05:31.430> I<00:05:31.460> want<00:05:31.820> out<00:05:32.180> of<00:05:32.860> out<00:05:33.860> of<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.190> pucker

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
tone I want out of out of the pucker

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.820 
tone I want out of out of the pucker
method

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.620 

I<00:05:37.860> get<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.250> big<00:05:38.460> sound<00:05:38.760> by<00:05:38.940> opening<00:05:39.300> up<00:05:39.419> the

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
I get a big sound by opening up the

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.659 
I get a big sound by opening up the
interior<00:05:40.110> of<00:05:40.260> my<00:05:40.380> mouth<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.860> cavity<00:05:41.310> inside

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
interior of my mouth the cavity inside

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.000 
interior of my mouth the cavity inside
is<00:05:42.060> becoming<00:05:42.480> as<00:05:42.630> large<00:05:42.930> as<00:05:43.200> I<00:05:43.290> can<00:05:43.470> make<00:05:43.590> it

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
is becoming as large as I can make it

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.210 
is becoming as large as I can make it
it'll<00:05:44.850> be<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.150> throat<00:05:45.600> up<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:46.290> get<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.980> tone<00:05:47.190> I

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
it'll be the throat up to get the tone I

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.430 
it'll be the throat up to get the tone I
want<00:05:47.340> when<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.030> am<00:05:48.240> doing<00:05:48.510> the<00:05:48.780> punker<00:05:49.110> method

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
want when I am doing the punker method

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.580 
want when I am doing the punker method
so<00:05:49.860> that<00:05:49.889> is<00:05:50.190> my<00:05:50.340> take<00:05:50.520> on<00:05:51.139> puckering<00:05:52.139> versus

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
so that is my take on puckering versus

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.070 
so that is my take on puckering versus
tongue<00:05:52.830> blocking
