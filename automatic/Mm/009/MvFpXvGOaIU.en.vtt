in<00:00:00.260> this<00:00:01.260> video<00:00:01.589> I'm<00:00:02.190> gonna<00:00:02.340> discuss<00:00:02.429> the

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
in this video I'm gonna discuss the

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.560 
in this video I'm gonna discuss the
attributes<00:00:03.510> of<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.959> macro<00:00:04.440> flash<00:00:08.570> generally

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
attributes of the macro flash generally

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.509 
attributes of the macro flash generally
there<00:00:09.719> are<00:00:09.750> two<00:00:09.870> types<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.590> macro<00:00:10.980> flashes<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
there are two types of macro flashes a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.270 
there are two types of macro flashes a
ring<00:00:11.849> flash<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:13.080> dual<00:00:13.380> headed<00:00:13.710> or<00:00:13.950> twin

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
ring flash and a dual headed or twin

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.939 
ring flash and a dual headed or twin
light<00:00:14.519> flash<00:00:15.120> let's<00:00:16.049> talk<00:00:16.320> about<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.770> ring

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
light flash let's talk about the ring

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.939 
light flash let's talk about the ring
flash<00:00:17.279> first<00:00:20.240> well<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.359> general<00:00:21.600> ring<00:00:22.320> flashes

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
flash first well in general ring flashes

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.750 
flash first well in general ring flashes
produce<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.670> broad<00:00:24.000> even<00:00:24.810> light<00:00:25.050> across<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
produce a broad even light across the

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
produce a broad even light across the
subject<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.970> that's<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.420> because<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
subject and that's really because as you

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.330 
subject and that's really because as you
see<00:00:28.439> here<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:30.140> rings<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.619> light<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
see here they have rings of light and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
see here they have rings of light and
they're<00:00:32.610> generally<00:00:33.300> two<00:00:33.570> tubes<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.170> on<00:00:34.469> each

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
they're generally two tubes one on each

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.430 
they're generally two tubes one on each
side<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.820> flash<00:00:36.120> head<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.260> see

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
side of the flash head and you can see

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
side of the flash head and you can see
in<00:00:37.590> each<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.010> these<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
in each one of these they have that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.750 
in each one of these they have that
characteristic<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.920> tube<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.489> here

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
characteristic there's a tube right here

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260 
characteristic there's a tube right here
on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> Mets<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.570> either<00:00:42.719> side<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.910> it's<00:00:44.910> made

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
on the Mets on either side and it's made

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.389 
on the Mets on either side and it's made
to<00:00:45.510> create<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.930> broad<00:00:46.350> even<00:00:46.860> light<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.309> they're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to create a broad even light and they're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.889 
to create a broad even light and they're
generally<00:00:48.469> easier<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.860> learn<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.520> work<00:00:50.730> with

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
generally easier to learn to work with

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
generally easier to learn to work with
then<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.140> dual<00:00:52.350> headed<00:00:52.649> flashes<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.370> we'll

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
then the dual headed flashes and we'll

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.330 
then the dual headed flashes and we'll
get<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.059> those<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.289> minute<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:56.190> in

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
get into those in just a minute but in

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.150 
get into those in just a minute but in
general<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> broad<00:00:57.840> even<00:00:58.530> light<00:00:58.770> and

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
general they have a broad even light and

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.900 
general they have a broad even light and
they<00:00:59.430> produce<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.210> nice<00:01:00.420> soft<00:01:00.960> light<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.530> well

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
they produce a nice soft light as well

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.870 
they produce a nice soft light as well
on<00:01:03.019> the<00:01:04.019> lower<00:01:04.260> end<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.070> price<00:01:05.580> point

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
on the lower end of the price point

on the lower end of the price point
spectrum<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.810> ring<00:01:07.110> flashes<00:01:07.710> there's<00:01:07.950> an

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
spectrum with ring flashes there's an

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
spectrum with ring flashes there's an
offering<00:01:08.430> by<00:01:08.610> Sigma<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.390> very<00:01:09.689> popular

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
offering by Sigma that's very popular

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.910 
offering by Sigma that's very popular
and<00:01:10.760> it<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.110> less<00:01:13.350> control

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and it has a little bit less control

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
and it has a little bit less control
than<00:01:14.280> some<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> other<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.299> little<00:01:15.840> bit<00:01:15.960> more

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
than some of the other a little bit more

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
than some of the other a little bit more
expensive<00:01:16.590> offerings<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.549> I'm<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
expensive offerings that I'm going to

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.539 
expensive offerings that I'm going to
talk<00:01:18.030> about<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.220> can't

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
talk about in that you can't

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.859 
talk about in that you can't
independently<00:01:21.240> control<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.820> power<00:01:24.420> output

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
independently control the power output

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.100 
independently control the power output
from<00:01:25.470> side<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> side<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.430> either<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.420> flash

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
from side to side it's either the flash

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
from side to side it's either the flash
tube<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> one<00:01:28.890> side<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.520> or<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.509> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
tube on one side is on or off and you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.810 
tube on one side is on or off and you
can<00:01:31.290> turn<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.770> side<00:01:31.979> off<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.549> leave<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
can turn one side off and leave the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
can turn one side off and leave the
other<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.840> side<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> leave<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
other on or one side off and leave and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.460 
other on or one side off and leave and
turn<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> other<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:39.140> it<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
turn the other off on and so it is a

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.980 
turn the other off on and so it is a
very<00:01:40.920> popular<00:01:41.390> offering<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.570> produces<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
very popular offering and it produces a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.170 
very popular offering and it produces a
really<00:01:43.079> nice<00:01:43.590> light<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.670> has<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> little

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
really nice light but it has a little

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.859 
really nice light but it has a little
bit<00:01:45.420> less<00:01:45.810> control<00:01:47.299> if<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.810> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
bit less control if you want to have a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139 
bit less control if you want to have a
little<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.350> control<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.149> offerings

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
little more control there are offerings

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
little more control there are offerings
and<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.930> at<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> top<00:01:52.320> here

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
and you can see them at the top here

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.670 
and you can see them at the top here
this<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.159> by<00:01:53.369> Nissen<00:01:54.140> the<00:01:55.140> middle<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
this one is by Nissen the middle one is

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940 
this one is by Nissen the middle one is
by<00:01:55.860> canon<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> bottom<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> by<00:01:58.590> Metz

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
by canon and the bottom one is by Metz

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.459 
by canon and the bottom one is by Metz
the<00:01:59.280> Nissen<00:01:59.640> solution<00:02:00.329> works<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.930> Canon<00:02:01.350> or

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the Nissen solution works for Canon or

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.179 
the Nissen solution works for Canon or
Nikon<00:02:01.880> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.000> buy<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.630> either<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.229> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
Nikon you can buy one for either and you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700 
Nikon you can buy one for either and you
can<00:02:05.369> control<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.000> power<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.810> each<00:02:07.110> side

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
can control the power of each side

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
can control the power of each side
independently<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.149> not<00:02:09.270> only<00:02:09.569> turn

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
independently so you can not only turn

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
course that just works for Canon cameras

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.160 
course that just works for Canon cameras
and<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.670> can<00:02:23.819> do<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.060> same<00:02:24.300> thing<00:02:24.690> and<00:02:24.959> they

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
and you can do the same thing and they

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.930 
and you can do the same thing and they

both the Nissen and the Canon produce

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.440 
both the Nissen and the Canon produce
great<00:02:27.240> light<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> Met<00:02:29.250> solution<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.300> of

great light the Met solution is kind of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.290 
great light the Met solution is kind of
a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:31.080> bit<00:02:31.290> different<00:02:31.940> not<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
a little bit different not that it

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.660 
a little bit different not that it
produces<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> worst<00:02:34.680> quality<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.250> light<00:02:35.459> it

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
produces a worst quality of light it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
produces a worst quality of light it
produces<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> very<00:02:36.270> good<00:02:36.630> quality<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:37.050> light

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
produces a very good quality of light

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.949 
produces a very good quality of light
but<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.280> little<00:02:38.520> smaller<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.209> less<00:02:39.330> bulky

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
but it's a little smaller and less bulky

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.830 
but it's a little smaller and less bulky
because<00:02:40.140> there's<00:02:40.860> no<00:02:41.180> piece<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.420> goes<00:02:42.600> on

that's<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:05.010> feature<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.400> I<00:03:05.550> talked<00:03:05.880> about<00:03:06.030> in

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
that's a feature that I talked about in

that's a feature that I talked about in
a<00:03:07.110> previous<00:03:07.350> video<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.910> camera<00:03:09.120> bodies<00:03:09.690> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
a previous video on the camera bodies so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.590 
a previous video on the camera bodies so
you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.920> control<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> output<00:03:11.910> by<00:03:12.090> side<00:03:12.390> you

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
you can control the output by side you

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.870 
you can control the output by side you
can<00:03:12.720> even<00:03:12.870> swivel<00:03:13.380> the<00:03:13.500> flash<00:03:13.769> head<00:03:14.190> somewhat

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
can even swivel the flash head somewhat

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.170 
can even swivel the flash head somewhat
which<00:03:15.480> is<00:03:15.690> pretty<00:03:15.959> cool<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.560> provides<00:03:17.180> pretty

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.350 
solution for macro photography is called
a<00:03:27.720> twin<00:03:27.989> light<00:03:28.200> flash<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.940> course<00:03:30.180> it's

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
a twin light flash and of course it's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.880 
a twin light flash and of course it's
called<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.600> twin<00:03:30.840> light<00:03:31.019> flash<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:31.709> there

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
called a twin light flash because there

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.009 
called a twin light flash because there
are<00:03:32.010> two<00:03:32.190> flash<00:03:32.519> heads<00:03:32.850> like<00:03:33.060> you<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:33.720> in

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
are two flash heads like you see here in

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.710 
are two flash heads like you see here in
the<00:03:34.290> upper<00:03:34.410> part<00:03:34.769> this<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.160> nikon<00:03:36.120> solution

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the upper part this is a nikon solution

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720 
the upper part this is a nikon solution
and<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.049> is<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.890> bottom<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.310> canon

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and this is on the bottom a canon

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.990 
and this is on the bottom a canon
solution<00:03:39.269> they're<00:03:39.720> both<00:03:39.959> really<00:03:40.320> really<00:03:40.470> good

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
solution they're both really really good

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.630 
solution they're both really really good
flash<00:03:42.000> heads<00:03:42.329> i<00:03:42.450> would<00:03:42.630> say<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:44.220> twin

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
flash heads i would say that the twin

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.970 
flash heads i would say that the twin
light<00:03:44.880> solutions<00:03:45.570> are<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.380> people<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.829> are

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
light solutions are for people that are

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.069 
light solutions are for people that are
a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.070> more<00:03:47.310> comfortable<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.329> their

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
a little more comfortable with their

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.819 
a little more comfortable with their
camera<00:03:49.470> systems<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:50.070> general<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:51.829> because

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
camera systems in general and because

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:53.930 
camera systems in general and because
there's<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.160> more<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.579> them<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
there's a little more to them and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.430 
there's a little more to them and
there's<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.360> takes<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.780> little<00:03:54.989> bit<00:03:55.110> more

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
there's it takes a little bit more

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.740 
there's it takes a little bit more
practice<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.280> get<00:03:56.430> them<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:57.120> work<00:03:57.299> right<00:03:57.329> but

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
practice to get them to work right but

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.680 
practice to get them to work right but
they<00:03:57.870> have<00:03:58.049> much<00:03:58.380> finer<00:03:58.860> light<00:03:59.340> control<00:03:59.940> then

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
they have much finer light control then

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.460 
they have much finer light control then
then<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.829> ring<00:04:02.010> lights<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.329> one<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
then the ring lights do so one of the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.979 
then the ring lights do so one of the
things<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.890> they<00:04:05.040> have<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:06.570> really<00:04:06.840> likes

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
things that they have and really likes

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.270 
things that they have and really likes
can<00:04:07.380> have<00:04:07.560> this<00:04:07.769> too<00:04:08.209> but<00:04:09.209> it's<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:10.280> target

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
can have this too but it's a target

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340 
can have this too but it's a target
focused<00:04:11.880> light<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.420> see<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.840> in<00:04:13.140> these

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
focused light and you see that in these

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.039 
focused light and you see that in these
little<00:04:13.650> red<00:04:14.459> rings<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.420> i've<00:04:15.540> laid

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
little red rings here that i've laid

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.740 
little red rings here that i've laid
over<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.560> flash<00:04:16.950> heads<00:04:17.340> both<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.150> nikon<00:04:18.539> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
over the flash heads both the nikon and

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.930 
over the flash heads both the nikon and
the<00:04:18.900> canon<00:04:19.229> solution<00:04:19.680> have<00:04:19.859> them<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.700> can

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
the canon solution have them so you can

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.510 
the canon solution have them so you can
look<00:04:21.510> through<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.780> viewfinder<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.650> move<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
look through the viewfinder and move the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.110 
look through the viewfinder and move the
flash<00:04:23.820> heads<00:04:24.210> with<00:04:24.450> those<00:04:24.660> light

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
flash heads with those light

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120 
flash heads with those light
it's<00:04:25.240> on<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.690> you<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:25.930> see<00:04:26.199> exactly<00:04:26.680> where

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
it's on and you can see exactly where

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.730 
it's on and you can see exactly where
the<00:04:27.490> light<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.000> gonna<00:04:28.240> fall<00:04:28.630> on<00:04:28.930> your<00:04:29.139> subjects

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
the light is gonna fall on your subjects

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.680 
the light is gonna fall on your subjects
so<00:04:29.830> that's<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.520> helps<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:30.970> aim<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.540> light

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
so that's it helps you to aim the light

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.250 
so that's it helps you to aim the light
much<00:04:32.290> much<00:04:32.560> more<00:04:32.770> precisely<00:04:34.260> another

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
much much more precisely another

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.180 
much much more precisely another
component<00:04:35.740> is<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:38.080> flash<00:04:38.350> head<00:04:38.620> swivel

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
component is that the flash head swivel

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
component is that the flash head swivel
so<00:04:39.970> not<00:04:40.479> only<00:04:40.840> can<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.430> aim<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.729> lights<00:04:42.940> but

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
so not only can you aim the lights but

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.400 
so not only can you aim the lights but
as<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.540> do<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.229> can<00:04:44.380> swivel<00:04:44.800> them<00:04:46.410> you

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
as you do that you can swivel them you

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.379 
as you do that you can swivel them you
can<00:04:47.560> swivel<00:04:47.770> them<00:04:47.979> back<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.370> forth<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.760> to

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
can swivel them back and forth to to

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.240 
can swivel them back and forth to to
provide<00:04:49.690> light<00:04:50.020> control<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.919> can<00:04:51.040> move

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
provide light control and you can move

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.060 
provide light control and you can move
them<00:04:51.460> around<00:04:51.600> the<00:04:52.600> ring<00:04:52.870> as<00:04:53.260> you<00:04:53.500> care<00:04:53.770> to<00:04:53.919> do

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
them around the ring as you care to do

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.510 
them around the ring as you care to do
that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
that

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.110 
that
so<00:04:54.669> you<00:04:55.210> can<00:04:55.330> really<00:04:55.690> get<00:04:55.870> fine<00:04:56.290> fine<00:04:56.680> control

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
so you can really get fine fine control

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.240 
so you can really get fine fine control
the<00:04:58.120> other<00:04:58.270> thing<00:04:58.570> is<00:04:58.870> as<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.620> mentioned<00:04:59.710> on

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
the other thing is as I mentioned on

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.950 
the other thing is as I mentioned on
some<00:05:00.490> of<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.669> ring<00:05:01.120> light<00:05:01.330> offerings<00:05:01.810> you

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
some of the ring light offerings you

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.029 
some of the ring light offerings you
have<00:05:02.610> fine<00:05:03.610> independent<00:05:04.570> control<00:05:04.870> of<00:05:05.039> the

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
have fine independent control of the

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.219 
have fine independent control of the
output<00:05:06.639> on<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.120> flash<00:05:07.389> head<00:05:07.690> so<00:05:07.870> you<00:05:07.930> can<00:05:07.990> put

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
output on the flash head so you can put

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.800 
output on the flash head so you can put
one<00:05:08.440> in<00:05:08.470> Group<00:05:08.830> A<00:05:08.979> one<00:05:09.340> in<00:05:09.460> Group<00:05:09.699> B<00:05:09.729> for<00:05:10.660> either

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
one in Group A one in Group B for either

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.980 
one in Group A one in Group B for either
than<00:05:11.110> icon<00:05:11.470> or<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.740> Canon<00:05:11.979> solution<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:12.990> vary

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
than icon or the Canon solution and vary

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.010 
than icon or the Canon solution and vary
the<00:05:14.590> power<00:05:14.889> output<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.970> what<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.479> does<00:05:16.750> is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
the power output and what that does is

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.080 
the power output and what that does is
it<00:05:17.169> creates<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.620> little<00:05:17.770> bit<00:05:17.889> of<00:05:18.039> shadow<00:05:18.370> detail

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
it creates a little bit of shadow detail

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.740 
it creates a little bit of shadow detail
and<00:05:19.449> that<00:05:20.520> helps<00:05:21.520> provide<00:05:21.940> more<00:05:22.389> surface

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
and that helps provide more surface

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.260 
and that helps provide more surface
detail<00:05:23.440> of<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.130> tooth<00:05:24.340> material<00:05:24.940> that<00:05:25.150> you're

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
detail of the tooth material that you're

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.860 
detail of the tooth material that you're
trying<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.889> to<00:05:26.889> highlight<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:27.699> it<00:05:28.150> really<00:05:28.630> can

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
trying to to highlight so it really can

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.490 
trying to to highlight so it really can
be<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:29.080> finer<00:05:29.650> control<00:05:30.330> light<00:05:31.330> control<00:05:31.780> method

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
be a finer control light control method

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.980 
be a finer control light control method
to<00:05:32.680> use<00:05:32.830> a<00:05:32.889> twin<00:05:33.250> light<00:05:33.460> solution<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.300> little

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
to use a twin light solution a little

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.589 
to use a twin light solution a little
bit<00:05:35.169> more<00:05:35.380> advanced<00:05:36.010> a<00:05:36.190> little<00:05:36.880> bit<00:05:37.030> more<00:05:37.330> to

lighter it's just easier to maneuver and
handle<00:06:17.949> and<00:06:18.220> you'll<00:06:18.490> see<00:06:18.669> that<00:06:18.820> I<00:06:18.880> have<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.570> in

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
handle and you'll see that I have the in

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.760 
handle and you'll see that I have the in
this<00:06:20.020> illustration<00:06:20.800> or<00:06:21.220> this<00:06:21.400> image<00:06:21.580> the

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
this illustration or this image the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.500 
this illustration or this image the
cameras<00:06:23.770> on<00:06:24.010> camera<00:06:24.580> flash<00:06:24.729> popped<00:06:25.270> up

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
cameras on camera flash popped up

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.339 
cameras on camera flash popped up
because<00:06:26.380> that<00:06:26.590> can<00:06:26.800> either<00:06:27.010> be<00:06:27.190> powered<00:06:28.060> off

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
because that can either be powered off

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.770 
because that can either be powered off
to<00:06:29.349> a<00:06:29.380> point<00:06:29.710> where<00:06:30.099> it<00:06:30.729> just<00:06:30.970> provides<00:06:31.270> enough

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
to a point where it just provides enough

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.290 
to a point where it just provides enough
flash<00:06:32.110> to<00:06:33.010> fire<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.700> heads<00:06:33.969> and<00:06:34.240> not

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
flash to fire the heads and not

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.619 
flash to fire the heads and not
influence<00:06:34.870> the<00:06:34.990> image

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
influence the image

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.749 
influence the image
or<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.289> can<00:06:37.439> use<00:06:37.559> it<00:06:37.589> as<00:06:37.830> a<00:06:37.860> third<00:06:38.129> light<00:06:38.460> if

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 
or you can use it as a third light if

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.730 
or you can use it as a third light if
you<00:06:38.879> choose<00:06:39.149> to<00:06:39.360> do<00:06:39.509> that<00:06:39.539> so<00:06:40.020> there's<00:06:40.679> a

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
you choose to do that so there's a

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.249 
you choose to do that so there's a
couple<00:06:41.009> of<00:06:41.249> couple<00:06:42.119> of<00:06:42.179> benefits<00:06:42.360> to<00:06:42.929> the

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:43.259 
couple of couple of benefits to the

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.769 
couple of couple of benefits to the
nikons<00:06:43.860> solution<00:06:44.669> that<00:06:44.819> you<00:06:44.909> don't<00:06:45.119> have<00:06:45.360> with

00:06:45.769 --> 00:06:45.779 
nikons solution that you don't have with

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:47.949 
nikons solution that you don't have with
the<00:06:45.929> canon<00:06:46.319> solution<00:06:46.770> but<00:06:47.189> they<00:06:47.339> both<00:06:47.580> produce

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:47.959 
the canon solution but they both produce

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:55.909 
the canon solution but they both produce
great<00:06:48.959> great<00:06:49.409> light<00:06:54.289> the<00:06:55.289> next<00:06:55.499> thing<00:06:55.770> we're

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
great great light the next thing we're

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.459 
great great light the next thing we're
going<00:06:56.009> to<00:06:56.069> talk<00:06:56.279> about<00:06:56.659> are<00:06:57.659> my<00:06:58.020> dental
