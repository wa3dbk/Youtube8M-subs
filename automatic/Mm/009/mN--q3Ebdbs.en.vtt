point out something actually this is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.600 
point out something actually this is
very<00:00:31.380> interesting<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:31.949> interesting<00:00:32.369> chart

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
very interesting as an interesting chart

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.000 
very interesting as an interesting chart
here<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.559> old

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
here and this is actually old

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.880 
here and this is actually old
information<00:00:35.790> but<00:00:36.000> still<00:00:36.600> pertinent<00:00:37.380> it's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
information but still pertinent it's

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.440 
information but still pertinent it's
very<00:00:38.100> pertinent<00:00:38.460> because<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> look

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
very pertinent because you got to look

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.590 
very pertinent because you got to look
at<00:00:39.719> history<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.550> what's<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> happen

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
at history to see what's going to happen

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
at history to see what's going to happen
in<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.780> future<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.489> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
in the future it's it's a you know they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.970 
in the future it's it's a you know they
say<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.239> exact<00:00:45.690> perfect<00:00:46.320> correlation

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
say it's not exact perfect correlation

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.209 
say it's not exact perfect correlation
but<00:00:47.370> history<00:00:47.760> basically<00:00:48.000> does<00:00:48.420> rhyme<00:00:48.780> but

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
but history basically does rhyme but

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.750 
but history basically does rhyme but
this<00:00:50.219> looks<00:00:50.460> like<00:00:50.670> an<00:00:50.879> ironclad<00:00:51.180> principle

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
this looks like an ironclad principle

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.799 
this looks like an ironclad principle
you<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.149> looking<00:00:54.329> at<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> price

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
you know when you looking at the price

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.740 
you know when you looking at the price

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
oil was spiking you know it's not the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.940 
oil was spiking you know it's not the
fact<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.049> there's<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.650> war

that affects actual oil wells that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.219 
that affects actual oil wells that
actually<00:01:29.280> blows<00:01:29.640> up<00:01:29.909> oil<00:01:30.240> refineries<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
actually blows up oil refineries that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.550 
actually blows up oil refineries that
type<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> stuff<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> Gulf<00:01:32.670> War<00:01:33.079> go<00:01:34.079> maybe

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
type of stuff here the Gulf War go maybe

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140 
type of stuff here the Gulf War go maybe
people<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:34.920> didn't<00:01:35.310> notice<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.759> but

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
people just didn't notice this but

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.780 
people just didn't notice this but
that's<00:01:37.049> what<00:01:37.229> happened<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.040> oil<00:01:38.310> went<00:01:38.610> up

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
that's what happened the oil went up

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
that's what happened the oil went up
during<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> Gulf<00:01:39.509> War<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:41.420> 911<00:01:43.070> 11<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
during the Gulf War and 911 11 up so you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.760 
during the Gulf War and 911 11 up so you
know<00:01:47.299> what<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.450> saying<00:01:48.780> oh<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> actually

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
know what I'm saying oh is actually

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
know what I'm saying oh is actually
there's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.520> decent<00:01:51.200> correlation

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
there's a good decent correlation

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.399 
there's a good decent correlation
between<00:01:52.350> price<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.310> oil<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.880> gold<00:01:54.119> if<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:55.170> see

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
between price of oil and gold if you see

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.370 
between price of oil and gold if you see
tensions<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> Middle<00:01:56.700> East<00:01:57.000> and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
tensions going on in the Middle East and

tensions going on in the Middle East and
oils<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.950> up<00:01:59.070> due<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.310> those<00:01:59.610> tensions

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
oils going up due to those tensions

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020 
oils going up due to those tensions
you're<00:02:00.719> gonna<00:02:00.840> see<00:02:01.049> goal<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.439> go<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:02.520> there

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
you're gonna see goal to go up now there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
you're gonna see goal to go up now there
is<00:02:03.210> not<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> major<00:02:03.930> correlation<00:02:04.649> between

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
is not a major correlation between

silver and oil per se right but when oil
goes<00:02:10.140> up<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.830> very<00:02:11.069> hard<00:02:11.550> bull<00:02:11.879> room

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
goes up in a very hard bull room

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.540 
goes up in a very hard bull room
that's<00:02:13.420> when<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> correlation<00:02:14.650> tightens<00:02:15.340> up

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
that's when the correlation tightens up

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.490 
that's when the correlation tightens up
now<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.599> don't<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.200> such<00:02:17.440> a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
now I don't think this is such a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.070 
now I don't think this is such a
freaking<00:02:18.159> hairbrained<00:02:18.819> scenario<00:02:19.450> about<00:02:19.720> war

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
freaking hairbrained scenario about war

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.199 
freaking hairbrained scenario about war
in<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.379> Middle<00:02:20.590> East<00:02:20.769> because<00:02:21.040> well<00:02:22.000> first

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
in the Middle East because well first

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.890 
in the Middle East because well first
off<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.659> never<00:02:22.870> happened<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:23.500> far<00:02:23.769> because<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
off it never happened so far because of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.250 
off it never happened so far because of
Obama<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.459> he<00:02:27.459> his<00:02:27.819> policies<00:02:28.420> are<00:02:28.599> against

she's been raised in Iran so a lot of

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
has a very different policy than if you

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.420 
has a very different policy than if you
say<00:02:58.810> dick<00:02:59.140> cheney<00:02:59.470> was<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.890> office<00:03:00.040> dick

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
say dick cheney was in office dick

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.569 
say dick cheney was in office dick
cheney<00:03:00.730> was<00:03:00.849> in<00:03:01.120> office<00:03:02.129> forget<00:03:03.129> about<00:03:03.250> it

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
cheney was in office forget about it

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.699 
cheney was in office forget about it
there<00:03:03.730> were<00:03:03.790> already<00:03:03.910> been<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.239> war<00:03:04.569> years<00:03:05.319> ago

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
there were already been a war years ago

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.979 
there were already been a war years ago
but<00:03:06.700> what<00:03:07.000> i<00:03:07.030> think<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:07.510> going<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> possibly

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
but what i think is going to possibly

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.880 
but what i think is going to possibly
come<00:03:08.440> about<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.859> because<00:03:09.220> obama<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.890> running

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
come about is because obama is running

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.530 
come about is because obama is running
out<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.040> political<00:03:12.579> options<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.299> it<00:03:13.390> might<00:03:13.510> be

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
out of political options and it might be

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.900 
out of political options and it might be
the<00:03:13.750> old<00:03:13.930> eel<00:03:14.109> wag<00:03:14.410> did<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.950> know<00:03:15.069> wag<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.879> dog

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the old eel wag did you know wag the dog

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.479 
the old eel wag did you know wag the dog
the<00:03:16.390> tail<00:03:16.599> wags<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:17.109> dog<00:03:17.139> he'll<00:03:18.040> go<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.220> war

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
the tail wags the dog he'll go to war

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.280 
the tail wags the dog he'll go to war
because<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.090> know<00:03:19.209> in<00:03:19.329> other<00:03:19.450> words<00:03:19.660> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
because you know in other words the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.110 
because you know in other words the
people<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.709> are<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.919> neo-cons<00:03:21.489> have<00:03:21.849> want

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
people that are the neo-cons have want

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.089 
people that are the neo-cons have want
this<00:03:22.269> policy<00:03:22.780> Obama<00:03:23.109> might<00:03:23.380> go<00:03:23.590> along<00:03:23.859> with<00:03:24.069> it

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
this policy Obama might go along with it

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.599 
this policy Obama might go along with it
for<00:03:24.310> his<00:03:24.400> own<00:03:24.519> political<00:03:25.000> interest<00:03:25.569> hill<00:03:26.609> but

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
for his own political interest hill but

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.629 
for his own political interest hill but
you<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:27.819> my<00:03:28.000> point<00:03:28.329> is<00:03:28.510> on<00:03:28.980> war<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.370> price

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
you know my point is on war in the price

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.720 
you know my point is on war in the price
of<00:03:30.669> oil<00:03:31.169> it's<00:03:32.169> not<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.500> there's<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.400> war

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
of oil it's not that there's a war

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.789 
of oil it's not that there's a war
someplace<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.569> a<00:03:34.660> world<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.230> price<00:03:35.440> oil

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
someplace in a world in the price oil

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.800 
someplace in a world in the price oil
goes<00:03:36.069> up<00:03:36.099> you<00:03:36.730> know<00:03:36.849> it<00:03:37.090> has<00:03:37.209> nothing<00:03:37.419> to<00:03:37.630> do

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
goes up you know it has nothing to do

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.110 
goes up you know it has nothing to do
with<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:37.989> it<00:03:38.290> has<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.620> do<00:03:38.799> with<00:03:39.010> where<00:03:39.609> most<00:03:39.940> a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
with that it has to do with where most a

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.509 
with that it has to do with where most a
lot<00:03:40.329> of<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.630> oil<00:03:40.810> comes<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.380> but<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.280> know

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
lot of the oil comes from but you know

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.000 
lot of the oil comes from but you know
and<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.790> chart<00:03:43.150> doesn't<00:03:43.359> go<00:03:43.569> into<00:03:43.810> Libya<00:03:44.260> but

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and this chart doesn't go into Libya but

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.330 
and this chart doesn't go into Libya but
if<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.220> look<00:03:45.400> back<00:03:45.639> in<00:03:45.910> 2011<00:03:46.919> we<00:03:47.919> had<00:03:48.069> a<00:03:48.099> major

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
if you look back in 2011 we had a major

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.330 
if you look back in 2011 we had a major
spike<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.269> oil<00:03:49.569> prices<00:03:50.230> at<00:03:50.410> that<00:03:50.650> time<00:03:50.950> too

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
spike in the oil prices at that time too

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.370 
spike in the oil prices at that time too
and<00:03:51.700> that's<00:03:52.150> when<00:03:52.359> silver<00:03:52.810> ax<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.109> hit<00:03:53.260> its

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
and that's when silver ax you hit its

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.470 
and that's when silver ax you hit its
record<00:03:53.769> high<00:03:53.940> it's<00:03:54.940> not<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.209> perfect

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
record high it's not a perfect

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.509 
record high it's not a perfect
correlation<00:03:56.109> it's<00:03:56.739> not<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.190> perfect

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
correlation it's not a perfect

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.150 
correlation it's not a perfect
correlation<00:03:58.209> but<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.290> decent

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
correlation but it is a decent

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.580

understated<00:04:03.129> us<00:04:03.220> again<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:04.359> correlation

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
understated us again the correlation

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.860 
understated us again the correlation
between<00:04:05.200> oil<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:06.129> silver<00:04:06.609> gets<00:04:06.849> very<00:04:07.450> tight

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
between oil and silver gets very tight

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.009 
between oil and silver gets very tight
when<00:04:08.590> oil<00:04:08.859> goes<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.549> very<00:04:09.849> hard<00:04:10.299> bull<00:04:10.660> run

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
when oil goes in a very hard bull run

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.589 
when oil goes in a very hard bull run
it's<00:04:11.319> not<00:04:11.680> their<00:04:12.069> normal<00:04:12.609> times<00:04:12.669> isn't<00:04:13.269> not<00:04:13.569> a

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
it's not their normal times isn't not a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.930 
it's not their normal times isn't not a
good<00:04:13.870> correlation<00:04:14.139> but<00:04:14.949> when<00:04:15.099> oil<00:04:15.370> goes<00:04:15.669> in<00:04:15.849> a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
good correlation but when oil goes in a

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.560 
good correlation but when oil goes in a
very<00:04:16.150> hard<00:04:16.449> bull<00:04:16.690> run<00:04:17.099> gold<00:04:18.099> and<00:04:18.310> oil<00:04:18.489> fly<00:04:19.269> up

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
very hard bull run gold and oil fly up

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.959 
very hard bull run gold and oil fly up
left<00:04:19.989> gold<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.530> silver<00:04:20.890> fly<00:04:21.159> up<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:21.700> that's

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
left gold and silver fly up so that's

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.719 
left gold and silver fly up so that's
that's<00:04:22.270> something<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.840> watch<00:04:23.080> for<00:04:23.219> now<00:04:24.219> you

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
that's something to watch for now you

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.370 
that's something to watch for now you
win<00:04:24.940> as<00:04:25.120> well<00:04:25.330> go<00:04:25.479> in<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.719> bull<00:04:25.900> run

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
win as well go in the bull run

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.640 
win as well go in the bull run
just<00:04:27.220> look<00:04:27.400> at<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.640> wars<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.150> Middle<00:04:28.450> East

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
just look at the wars in the Middle East

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.590 
just look at the wars in the Middle East
not<00:04:29.650> talking<00:04:30.100> about<00:04:30.190> you<00:04:30.670> know<00:04:30.790> other<00:04:31.180> Wars

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
not talking about you know other Wars

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.270 
not talking about you know other Wars
and<00:04:31.960> everything<00:04:32.320> else<00:04:32.530> like<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:32.800> and

and everything else like that and
actually<00:04:33.580> if<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:33.910> look<00:04:33.940> back<00:04:34.360> all<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.170> way

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
actually if you look back all the way

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.840 
actually if you look back all the way
back<00:04:35.530> if<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.980> know<00:04:36.040> this<00:04:36.160> chart<00:04:36.430> doesn't<00:04:36.610> go

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
the Civil War what happened was oil

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.500 
the Civil War what happened was oil
spiked<00:04:49.480> about<00:04:50.410> 99<00:04:51.160> and<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.370> half<00:04:51.550> times<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.240> that

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
spiked about 99 and a half times in that

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.580 
spiked about 99 and a half times in that

period of time in real dollars and that
was<00:04:56.890> due<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.400> basically<00:04:58.150> oil<00:04:58.420> production

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
was due to basically oil production

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.220 
was due to basically oil production
domestically<00:04:59.260> being<00:04:59.920> interrupted<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.900> I'm

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
domestically being interrupted so I'm

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.870 
domestically being interrupted so I'm
going<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.440> say<00:05:02.620> this<00:05:02.650> if<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.460> war<00:05:03.670> in<00:05:03.820> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
going to say this if the war in the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.120 
going to say this if the war in the
Middle<00:05:04.120> East<00:05:04.330> actually<00:05:04.960> starts<00:05:05.320> getting<00:05:05.680> wire

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
Middle East actually starts getting wire

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.120 
Middle East actually starts getting wire
more<00:05:06.460> widespread<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.480> we<00:05:07.600> go<00:05:07.750> into<00:05:08.130> bigger

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
more widespread and we go into bigger

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.310 
more widespread and we go into bigger
more<00:05:09.520> widespread<00:05:09.820> Wars<00:05:10.540> where<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.200> know

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
more widespread Wars where you know

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.320 
more widespread Wars where you know
shipping<00:05:11.920> lanes<00:05:12.190> are<00:05:12.430> blocked<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:13.000> all<00:05:13.180> this

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
shipping lanes are blocked and all this

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.650 
shipping lanes are blocked and all this
kind<00:05:13.540> of<00:05:13.690> garbage<00:05:14.110> you<00:05:15.040> can<00:05:15.430> see<00:05:15.640> oil<00:05:15.880> go<00:05:16.360> up<00:05:16.510> to

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
kind of garbage you can see oil go up to

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.930 
kind of garbage you can see oil go up to
some<00:05:16.870> crazy<00:05:17.200> price<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.980> that<00:05:18.100> includes<00:05:18.580> gold

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
some crazy price and that includes gold

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.940 
some crazy price and that includes gold
and<00:05:19.180> silver<00:05:19.570> that's<00:05:20.170> where<00:05:20.410> you<00:05:20.500> might<00:05:20.710> see

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
and silver that's where you might see

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.110 
and silver that's where you might see
silver<00:05:21.400> go<00:05:21.550> up<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.300> an<00:05:22.480> insane<00:05:23.020> price<00:05:23.760> so<00:05:24.760> it's

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
silver go up to an insane price so it's

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.720 
silver go up to an insane price so it's
not<00:05:25.480> totally<00:05:25.960> out<00:05:25.990> of<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.350> realm<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.010> so

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
not totally out of the realm and so

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.910 
not totally out of the realm and so
there<00:05:28.660> is<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.840> correlation<00:05:29.290> between<00:05:29.590> the

looking at those spikes in the oil
prices<00:05:45.730> they<00:05:46.660> do<00:05:46.720> not<00:05:47.650> exactly<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:48.970> know

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
close to that you'll see the silver and

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.740 
close to that you'll see the silver and
gold<00:05:54.130> prices<00:05:54.460> where<00:05:54.790> murder<00:05:55.060> were<00:05:55.240> moving<00:05:55.630> up

spike<00:06:01.870> in<00:06:02.380> 2008<00:06:03.220> we<00:06:03.430> had<00:06:03.640> silver<00:06:04.420> at<00:06:04.690> an

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
spike in 2008 we had silver at an

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.870 
spike in 2008 we had silver at an
all-time<00:06:05.020> high<00:06:05.290> at<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:05.980> ear<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.640> then<00:06:06.760> it

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
all-time high at that ear and then it

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.310 
all-time high at that ear and then it
had<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.030> good<00:06:07.210> crashed<00:06:07.540> all<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:07.960> way<00:06:08.080> down

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
had a good crashed all the way down

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.950 
had a good crashed all the way down
again<00:06:08.760> it's<00:06:09.760> it's<00:06:10.090> like<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.630> same<00:06:10.930> thing

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
again it's it's like the same thing

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.360 
again it's it's like the same thing
occurred<00:06:11.620> with<00:06:11.860> silver<00:06:12.310> and<00:06:12.400> oil<00:06:12.700> in<00:06:13.230> 2008<00:06:14.370> so

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
occurred with silver and oil in 2008 so

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.060 
occurred with silver and oil in 2008 so
you<00:06:15.700> know<00:06:15.820> I<00:06:16.030> think<00:06:16.570> Obama's<00:06:17.350> options<00:06:17.800> on<00:06:17.950> it

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
you know I think Obama's options on it

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.310 
you know I think Obama's options on it
for<00:06:18.610> his<00:06:18.700> political<00:06:18.880> solo<00:06:19.510> survival<00:06:20.170> are<00:06:20.290> very

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
for his political solo survival are very

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.800 
for his political solo survival are very
slim<00:06:20.680> right<00:06:21.280> now<00:06:21.460> you<00:06:22.060> might<00:06:22.240> go<00:06:22.390> along<00:06:22.660> with

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
slim right now you might go along with

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.760 
slim right now you might go along with
the<00:06:22.900> neo-cons<00:06:23.440> so<00:06:24.570> just<00:06:25.570> you<00:06:26.230> know<00:06:26.350> hang<00:06:26.560> on

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
the neo-cons so just you know hang on

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.950 
the neo-cons so just you know hang on
its<00:06:26.980> periphery<00:06:27.670> solid<00:06:28.240> bet<00:06:28.450> did<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:28.780> have

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
its periphery solid bet did you have

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.300 
its periphery solid bet did you have
your<00:06:28.990> word<00:06:29.290> oil<00:06:29.530> there<00:06:29.770> is<00:06:29.920> a<00:06:29.950> major

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
your word oil there is a major

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.780 
your word oil there is a major
correlation<00:06:31.120> between<00:06:31.270> oil<00:06:31.780> silver<00:06:32.320> and<00:06:32.470> gold

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
correlation between oil silver and gold

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.760 
correlation between oil silver and gold
when<00:06:33.790> oil<00:06:34.120> goes<00:06:34.419> into<00:06:34.630> a<00:06:34.750> hard<00:06:35.020> bull<00:06:35.260> run<00:06:35.560> and

when oil goes into a hard bull run and

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.879 
when oil goes into a hard bull run and
usually<00:06:36.550> oil<00:06:36.760> goes<00:06:37.000> into<00:06:37.210> very<00:06:37.540> hard<00:06:37.870> bull<00:06:38.110> run

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
usually oil goes into very hard bull run

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.339 
usually oil goes into very hard bull run

Middle East and some some oil wells are
getting<00:06:44.169> blown<00:06:44.409> up<00:06:44.439> or<00:06:44.949> you<00:06:45.759> know<00:06:45.909> sea<00:06:46.629> lanes

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
getting blown up or you know sea lanes

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.689 
getting blown up or you know sea lanes
are<00:06:47.229> stopped<00:06:47.680> and<00:06:48.009> all<00:06:48.129> this<00:06:48.249> type<00:06:48.490> of<00:06:48.520> stuff

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
are stopped and all this type of stuff

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.820 
are stopped and all this type of stuff
and<00:06:49.090> oil<00:06:49.360> pipelines<00:06:49.900> are<00:06:50.080> being<00:06:50.319> blown<00:06:50.590> up

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830 
and oil pipelines are being blown up

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.899 
and oil pipelines are being blown up
you'll<00:06:51.789> see<00:06:52.029> oil<00:06:52.060> go<00:06:52.479> way<00:06:52.719> to<00:06:52.779> hell<00:06:52.990> up<00:06:53.199> so<00:06:53.949> it's

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:54.909 
you'll see oil go way to hell up so it's

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.480 
you'll see oil go way to hell up so it's
a<00:06:55.210> it's<00:06:55.569> not<00:06:55.779> really<00:06:56.050> a<00:06:56.349> guest<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.979> guess<00:06:57.219> is

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
a it's not really a guest the guess is

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.689 
a it's not really a guest the guess is
when<00:06:57.879> is<00:06:57.999> this<00:06:58.150> going<00:06:58.419> to<00:06:58.449> occur<00:06:58.860> but<00:06:59.860> and<00:07:00.610> I

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
when is this going to occur but and I

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:01.860 
when is this going to occur but and I
don't<00:07:00.879> think<00:07:01.029> it's<00:07:01.150> a<00:07:01.240> matter<00:07:01.389> of<00:07:01.509> if<00:07:01.719> it's

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
don't think it's a matter of if it's

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.540 
don't think it's a matter of if it's
going<00:07:02.080> to<00:07:02.169> occur<00:07:02.379> it's<00:07:02.590> you<00:07:02.680> got<00:07:02.860> matter<00:07:03.129> when

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
going to occur it's you got matter when

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.100 
going to occur it's you got matter when
it's<00:07:03.699> going<00:07:03.879> to<00:07:03.939> occur<00:07:04.210> and<00:07:04.539> looking<00:07:05.020> at

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
it's going to occur and looking at

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.390 
it's going to occur and looking at
what's<00:07:05.289> going<00:07:05.379> on<00:07:05.620> with<00:07:05.800> Bob<00:07:05.949> Alma

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
what's going on with Bob Alma

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.399 
what's going on with Bob Alma
politically<00:07:06.999> it<00:07:07.240> may<00:07:07.449> be<00:07:07.509> but<00:07:07.960> in<00:07:08.169> his
