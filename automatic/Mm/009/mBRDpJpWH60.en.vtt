 welcome to goal.com greg gotthelf 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
 nail manager every good one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.099
 continues in the series of videos on 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:24.779
 travel in boxing 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:25.199
 today we will see the boxing square 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.460
 English 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.170
 it is important to know how to move 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 in all directions before 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.260
 to do the square we will see an exercise 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420
 who will train you to move 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.290
 in the four directions 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 we will do what I call 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 the round trip so to the returns 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.050
 in the four directions 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.670
 we start with its battle position we will 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.760
 start with the front leg and go 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.530
 forward like this you need not 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.300
 not come back smaller than your 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.449
 fighting position agree and we are 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 light on the rebound then we'll go 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.949
 backward jean barrier towards 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.260
 the back okay I have my weight getting 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.640
 move with me when I do not stay 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.059
 like that forward is just the leg that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.070
 move my body moves with two there 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 we're going to train east to the right 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 this time the body moves 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.580
 with and ends with the left to 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.420
 left 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 now that you know been displaced 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.180
 in the four directions 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.830
 you will be able to start making cake 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.960
 so we had seen in the video 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.460
 previous on the circle that needed 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 never tighten your legs 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.240
 that's the same thing at the level of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.759
 square I'm going to move like in 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.810
 certainly but first on a straight line 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.610
 forward then to the right 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 purely laterally it's not joy 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.619
 get away are close together then 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.619
 rearward 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.790
 then to the mouth then what is 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.980
 important is to never be crossed his 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.700
 legs okay if I go to the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.760
 right 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 I'm not going to do that ok it's still 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.820
 engage in the direction with the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.750
 leg that corresponds ie if 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 I'm going to the right 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.830
 it's my right leg first I'm going 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.810
 left left leg first 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.030
 I'm going forward I drool 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 first play backward jean barrier 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:17.010
 first okay and so I'm going 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:18.180
 chain my square like those below 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 a waltz route to make them in the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:26.640
 sense we will continue Lent we will 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.210
 add a jobcross at each top of the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 careÃ¯ so jack ross jabbes cross of 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.440
 mans right now what that gives 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.660
 so I go on my square every time 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.960
 I stop I made my support jack ross 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.970
 I'm coming back I'm going to the other this match 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:46.860
 in front of jack cross so on 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.310
 it allows you to test your position 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.989
 if when you get to the top of the square 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.760
 you need to adjust your 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.650
 position you are not good for 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.989
 to strike is that your movements and 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.910
 not correct when you move for not 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.870
 to be caught in the fight at all 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.330
 when you need to be able to 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.860
 stop and hit of course you can 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.510
 do the linking you want in the 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.220
 square every time you arrive at 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.010
 top there I showed a jack ross 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.959
 it may be already frost hook it 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.940
 could be jazz and upscale ski recoil 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.170
 cross what you want to agree as 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.820
 that you can bring a little bit of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.220
 variety to exercise once you are 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.110
 in one home can complicate the exercise 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.520
 using round trips that we have 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.260
 seen at the beginning of the video that I like 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.709
 do these two round trips and on the 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:35.459
 third I move there there a two 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:40.880
 three then one two three years back 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.880
 1 2 3 and I chained 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.260
 once you are comfortable with the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.700
 back and forth in quarters and you 're going 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.090
 can add the sequences of 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.499
 point 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:15.870
