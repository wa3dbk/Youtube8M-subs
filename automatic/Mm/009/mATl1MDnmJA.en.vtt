00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 Candal or the body of the real fuselage 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.710
 because of day because he's used to 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.660
 see that the image of nocturnal and the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.950
 lights that warn of what there is to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 Sometimes it can be confusing you 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.890
 satellites planes but by day and gives me 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.420
 way and you can see it as from some 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.849
 way the material they would be 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.170
 reflective and the saint that is like that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.170
 it is a silver 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.450
 we have made a selection of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.219
 several sightings in the best only 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.200
 in this last quarter and already by 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.020
 lots to see I'll tell you that still 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 when you already on YouTube you had a success 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.649
 absolute after his years of 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.329
 creation 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.480
 when one looked and double back 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.579
 had to filter art information that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.880
 there was a lot of trash a lot of video 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.400
 mobile and everything else but 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.210
 in a stitch month and 30 some videos today 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.260
 day 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:11.230
 you count 45 50 per day per day in china 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.230
 chile because once again of chile 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.000
 this is January 14 beginning 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.160
 inaugurating this area ends the year 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.530
 2012 this was recorded in nothing in your 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.010
 frigate is not very noticeable maybe 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.110
 for many will say as it was very 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.570
 night and obviously the camera was not the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.000
 more optimal let's say to capture something like that 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.070
 and moves on the hill of Antofagasta 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.960
 the witnesses comment on his impression 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.680
 during the video let's say there are 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.710
 15 cars did not pass because the lights 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.260
 of a helicopter of an airplane are spotlights 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.480
 generally and the small lights are 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.730
 intermittent because the lights have 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.860
 a specific function that will warn 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.020
 around here and a plane is passing by is like 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.460
 reverse they call attention 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.650
 attention this car is retreating 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.230
 beware the lights of the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.030
 obviously how is it called 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.470
 is of another nature that as 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.120
 this involves one of the things that 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.000
 it also draws attention this sorry me 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.470
 I messed up all the previous the agent 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 orange 14 of my life look good 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.620
 it is attention this is in the usa after the 4 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.880
 June, 2012 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 from a condominium you see these three 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.470
 lights let's say they descend on the hill 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.900
 very similar to the phenomena that one 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.000
 you can assist in reading 51 as you 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.610
 you know, it would be completely justified 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 when you cross that you can suffer chain 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.470
 perpetual and some fines that are 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.390
 unpayable but obviously the people who 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.340
 he stays on the road he has recorded 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.870
 a number of similar phenomena that 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.210
 it seems that they are like exercises of 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.940
 test when we see that that here is 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.950
 when people say we are dealing with ships 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.010
 of intelligent beings that come from 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.930
 another side or they are right formations 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.940
 of ships of an advanced technology that 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.800
 even publicly they have not been released 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 for the common people passing by but 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
 does a number of pirouettes that 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.930
 clearly challenge let's say what the 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.940
 human technology in aeronautics arrives 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.380
 until now and that's why you recognize it 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.050
 but most of the times that one has 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.120
 seen something similar to that one of the 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.650
 images he was showing today says 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.090
 puig is complaining about having walked a machine 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.740
 that wins from having walked all soft 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.700
 prior to existence these phones 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.160
 that they record everything 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.379
 maybe I would have treasured a greater 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.890
 amount of evidence that would have had 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:28.800
 the technology so close to your hand now 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.450
 everyone who sees something can record it and 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.129
 there it is and that's why we in the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.510
 program we exhibit and in some way 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.400
 dismantling 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.720
 makes it worthy of study today 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.720
 we take advantage of our friend 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.769
 as well 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.500
 today he has seen something similar also 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.420
 in a direct way that I am 3 arrives 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.170
 also material of this nature should I 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.579
 confess that yes yes in the year 91 and 98 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.310
 I saw the same UFO twice 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.310
 towards the coast a luminous cylinder 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.250
 as a referee this is what happened to the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 people like that we are 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.250
 candal
