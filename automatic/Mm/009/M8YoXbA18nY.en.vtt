helmets<00:00:29.849> pretty<00:00:30.060> cool<00:00:30.269> looking<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.990> looks

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
helmets pretty cool looking it looks

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.440 
helmets pretty cool looking it looks
kind<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> viking<00:00:32.160> helmet<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.300> also

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
kind of like a viking helmet and it also

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.430 
kind of like a viking helmet and it also
provides<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.350> frost<00:00:35.100> damage<00:00:35.579> resistance

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
provides a frost damage resistance

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
provides a frost damage resistance
usually<00:00:37.440> frost<00:00:37.860> damage<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.700> any<00:00:38.940> type<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
usually frost damage or any type of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.340 
usually frost damage or any type of
resistance<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:41.120> not<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> helmet<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.110> that's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
resistance is not for a helmet so that's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.770 
resistance is not for a helmet so that's
what<00:00:43.590> makes<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.070> item<00:00:44.700> pretty<00:00:45.030> unique<00:00:45.329> also

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
what makes this item pretty unique also

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
what makes this item pretty unique also
the<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> awesome<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.489> that's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the look of it is awesome so that's

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.580 
the look of it is awesome so that's
another<00:00:48.390> reason<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> different

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
another reason there's a different

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.430 
another reason there's a different
helmet<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.610> labyrinth<00:00:51.210> iam

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
helmet that you can get in labyrinth iam

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.990 
helmet that you can get in labyrinth iam
that<00:00:52.440> actually<00:00:52.710> has<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> fire<00:00:53.160> resistance<00:00:53.820> but

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
that actually has a fire resistance but

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.479 
that actually has a fire resistance but
it's<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.510> cool<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.399> feel

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it's not as cool and I really don't feel

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.869 
it's not as cool and I really don't feel
like<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.760> back<00:00:56.910> into<00:00:57.210> labyrinthian<00:00:58.879> but

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
like going back into labyrinthian but

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.369 
like going back into labyrinthian but
you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.420> during<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.780> quest<00:01:00.960> anyway

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can get it during that quest anyway

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.479 
you can get it during that quest anyway
so<00:01:01.440> here's<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:04.220> solution<00:01:05.220> for<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so here's the the solution for the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.120 
so here's the the solution for the
puzzle<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.909> guess<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.510> read<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.979> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
puzzle I guess you can read how to do it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.620 
puzzle I guess you can read how to do it
in<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> book<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:09.119> kind<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.450> little

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
in the book and it's kind of a little

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.370 
in the book and it's kind of a little

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.789 
through this really quickly if you kind
of<00:01:45.090> speedrun<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.990> usually<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.770> for

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
of speedrun it like I usually do for

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.199 
but it didn't do much damage anyway so
here<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.470> another<00:02:10.860> puzzle<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> put

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
here is another puzzle you want to put

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
here is another puzzle you want to put
the<00:02:12.300> clown<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
the clown here

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.200 
the clown here
as<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.070> from<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.640> cloth<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.060> go

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
as you can see from the cloth if you go

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.230 
as you can see from the cloth if you go
under<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.510> miscellaneous<00:02:16.230> tab<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.940> do

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
under the miscellaneous tab you can do

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.700 
under the miscellaneous tab you can do
this<00:02:18.420> for<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.840> claws<00:02:19.020> they<00:02:19.320> actually

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
this for all the claws they actually

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.800 
this for all the claws they actually
have<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.130> solution<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.240> puzzle<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.630> them

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
have the solution to the puzzle on them

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.780 
have the solution to the puzzle on them
so<00:02:22.350> it<00:02:22.620> is<00:02:22.860> snake<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.290> then<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.250> eagle

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so it is snake and then it is a eagle

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.090 
so it is snake and then it is a eagle
and<00:02:27.000> butterfly<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> think<00:02:28.170> something<00:02:29.010> like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
and butterfly I think something like

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.420 
and butterfly I think something like
that<00:02:29.420> will<00:02:30.420> figure<00:02:30.570> we'll<00:02:30.840> see<00:02:31.020> here<00:02:31.430> actually

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
that will figure we'll see here actually

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.790 
that will figure we'll see here actually
it's<00:02:32.700> snake<00:02:32.910> wolf<00:02:33.150> butterfly<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.690> my<00:02:33.810> bed<00:02:33.960> and

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it's snake wolf butterfly in my bed and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.500 
it's snake wolf butterfly in my bed and
then<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.640> place<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.820> claw<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.300> there

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
then you just place the claw in there

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.680 
then you just place the claw in there
and<00:02:36.750> it'll<00:02:37.740> open<00:02:37.920> right<00:02:38.100> up<00:02:38.520> and<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.360> there<00:02:39.510> you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and it'll open right up and in there you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.590 
and it'll open right up and in there you
will<00:02:39.780> find<00:02:40.130> young<00:02:41.130> gall<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.790> basically<00:02:42.360> he's
