00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
people are using it it's used in the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.180 
people are using it it's used in the
public<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.360> go<00:00:36.510> pub<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.710> bit

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
public just if you go pub you little bit

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
public just if you go pub you little bit
ones<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.270> everyone's<00:00:39.780> using<00:00:39.960> its<00:00:40.200> intuitive

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ones to everyone's using its intuitive

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
ones to everyone's using its intuitive
because<00:00:40.829> all<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.190> heroes<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.670> closest

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
because all your heroes are the closest

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.100 
because all your heroes are the closest
to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> center<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.719> walls<00:00:42.899> go

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to the center in your walls go

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.450 
to the center in your walls go
everywhere<00:00:43.350> else<00:00:43.590> except<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> Center<00:00:44.280> path

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
everywhere else except the Center path

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.060 
everywhere else except the Center path
so<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.809> what<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:45.989> call<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.410> internally

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
so it's just what we call it internally

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.369 
so it's just what we call it internally
to<00:00:47.280> let<00:00:47.850> everyone<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.719> our<00:00:48.870> guild<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
to let everyone know in our guild and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.889 
to let everyone know in our guild and
then<00:00:49.590> they<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:49.980> we're<00:00:50.100> talking<00:00:50.129> about

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
then they know what we're talking about

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.029 
then they know what we're talking about
but<00:00:51.899> again<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> pretty<00:00:52.410> intuitive<00:00:52.860> base

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
but again it's a pretty intuitive base

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.520 
but again it's a pretty intuitive base
and<00:00:53.309> pretty<00:00:53.640> fun<00:00:53.850> retro<00:00:54.690> gorge<00:00:54.989> 2<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.260> pretty

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
crazy that everything gets all of this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.090 
crazy that everything gets all of this
you<00:01:28.110> phone<00:01:28.320> gets<00:01:28.500> everything<00:01:28.740> shooting

you phone gets everything shooting
flying<00:01:29.490> around<00:01:29.700> everywhere<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
flying around everywhere and that was a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.300 
flying around everywhere and that was a
super<00:01:31.140> fast<00:01:31.500> wave<00:01:31.770> this<00:01:31.920> would<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.189> been<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
super fast wave this would have been a

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.700 
super fast wave this would have been a
really<00:01:32.610> fast<00:01:32.939> clear<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.590> see

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
really fast clear that you can see

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.170 
really fast clear that you can see
there's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.009> pathing<00:01:35.670> thing<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.060> we

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
there's a little pathing thing so we

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
there's a little pathing thing so we
