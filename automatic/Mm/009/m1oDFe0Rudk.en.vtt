00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.090
 hello and best wishes from 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.700
 auckland i thought so when i got the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.570
 whole camera quatchi already take 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.930
 I also still have some point a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
 make video I do not know if that 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 but the microphone stands up to the wind 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.860
 we will see later or you 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.520
 just see reason to do so already 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.980
 seen 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.220
 I finally got a car yesterday 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.510
 bought the day before yesterday today 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.379
 Tuesday I'll show you just us 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.970
 why are we looking at the thing for 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.760
 which are on children or not 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.760
 toyota ahz theme 19 98 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.510
 So no camper will be the 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.730
 originally thought but well that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 Mistake with the car purchase therefore the show 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.750
 is dependent so called a so-called 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.370
 station wagon is 230,000 kilometers 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.930
 so ran for such a fighter 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.360
 still ok so not quite like that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.540
 bad also have cars with over 400 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.600
 or even a vw bulli with over 600,000 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.780
 seen 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.570
 so far so we could not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.070
 The door opened 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.730
 because I always think that you left 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.730
 the bike tour is 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.479
 I have made 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.440
 look in it looks like the whole 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.630
 So that techno mountains it is 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.009
 actually quite a lot of space comes 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.560
 me all he laid it involves 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.770
 You could also put two beds outside here 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.260
 made etat would be that as 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.489
 but could keep it for my purposes 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.489
 is a bed from behind 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.080
 and there you also see a tripod what I 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.489
 stupidly did not consider that that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.519
 here has excess length and that was why 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:39.310
 at the airport then quite expensive 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.959
 to take with me what I tied in the car 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.730
 because somehow forget 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.730
 i hope that it will be expensive i will that 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.050
 I tried to sell myself 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.370
 I got back to the car is one 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.980
 a lot of storage space someone can do this 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.799
 things were open there were things like that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.190
 sleeping bags in it and pillows and 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.239
 toilet paper green stuff can stop you 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.769
 close 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.860
 there could be all one more time 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.360
 open up here is again 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.590
 bin there is already a cool box 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.760
 in it without power connection I have to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.540
 let's see where to get along with what 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.620
 we are already pretty warm 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.450
 probably it's better if I am 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.170
 I still somehow a 12 volt 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.670
 connection hole or maybe even 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.790
 I have to look at power converter 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.660
 in bad weather you can get out of it 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.150
 also build a table together that he 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.470
 such a rod still there you could at 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.150
 bad weather in there but sit 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.540
 Let's hope that not so much 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.540
 bad weather gives you back 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.820
 the whole thing looks like a shelf 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.000
 already installed there is this station 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.989
 wagon also a number smaller 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.910
 which then no longer as a shelf inside 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.210
 me or pretty important because I too 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.180
 do not know how else without life and 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.110
 no matter in here the whole program here 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.210
 with gas cooker gas bottle water container 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.610
 because I actually drink you water 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.390
 not so good at all 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.160
 then I have a few 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.110
 Things bought here around the things too 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.230
 Organize like you, of course, completely 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.690
 important is not even better is none 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.030
 and things to eat 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.070
 and so I still live in the middle of it 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.540
 but it goes in the morning looking forward off 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.670
 that's why I have one more 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:34.920
 billions already bought and 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.920
 Camping was not in it and fine okay 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.060
 pans and so that was all in it and 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.500
 all the rubbish that so far 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.870
 car might be a few more 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.330
 images yet again I see here even 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.440
 right on the spot but learns with the gopro 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.100
 it's probably too far away 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.260
 that you could see that , I would 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.390
 say exactly se me 's se 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.080
 All right, I'm unbelievably incredible 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:12.530
 relieved that finally the thing 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.800
 with the car is because that was 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.400
 really stress like that for 45 days only 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.410
 disappointments no one simply no car 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.350
 If my father was there either 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.200
 scrap or said let go of the fingers 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:30.710
 from that 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.480
 or one online 1 found the types 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:38.360
 Called and then said a dealer 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.530
 or are you all stuck? 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.870
 a lot of skin in the evening of course 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.360
 out the evening is the tree of jana 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.120
 be ok that you keep the thing 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.250
 the next eight months 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:04.370
 yes in any case glad that now 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:05.590
 finally, by facilitating and have 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.090
 just no first goal 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.380
 A great way to go that is still 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.470
 some would now goes just 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:18.730
 really gone so far a lot 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:23.410
 to do so and a little tense like 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:30.070
 tomorrow then the first night in the cellar 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:32.740
 band a value that surprises there 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:40.120
 it is a small french block off and 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:41.620
 blog because even if you do not bridge like that 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.050
 Much has to read all this rubbish 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.790
 that you tell each other 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.790
 meet results of the day 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.250
 this is the motto of the day
