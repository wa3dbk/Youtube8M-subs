us yeah playing such a load down red

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.020 
us yeah playing such a load down red
tuned<00:01:50.080> for<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.230> gods<00:01:51.470> that's<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.610> song<00:01:52.850> we

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
tuned for the gods that's the song we

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.520 
tuned for the gods that's the song we
wrote<00:01:53.270> together<00:01:53.510> and<00:01:55.660> why<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:56.810> used<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.260> as<00:01:57.500> a

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
wrote together and why we used it as a

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.280 
wrote together and why we used it as a
first<00:01:57.920> song<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.460> think<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.820> was<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.810> one<00:02:00.020> that

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
first song I think it was the one that

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.820 
first song I think it was the one that
sounded<00:02:00.680> most<00:02:01.070> like<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:02.110> typical<00:02:03.110> Amon<00:02:03.740> Amarth

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
sounded most like a typical Amon Amarth

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.830 
sounded most like a typical Amon Amarth
song

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
song

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.889 
song
there<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.160> no<00:02:07.160> really<00:02:07.610> big<00:02:08.090> surprises

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
there is no really big surprises

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.619 
there is no really big surprises
it's<00:02:09.319> like<00:02:09.560> Kanna<00:02:10.039> what<00:02:10.280> people<00:02:11.060> could<00:02:11.209> expect

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
it's like Kanna what people could expect

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.830 
it's like Kanna what people could expect
so<00:02:12.050> it's<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> good<00:02:13.220> opener<00:02:13.370> it's<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.970> strong<00:02:14.540> song

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
so it's a good opener it's a strong song

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.119 
so it's a good opener it's a strong song
and<00:02:15.170> also<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.170> good<00:02:18.319> way<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.530> open<00:02:18.739> a<00:02:18.980> new

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
and also it's a good way to open a new

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.309
