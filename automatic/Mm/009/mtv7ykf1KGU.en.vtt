00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 welcome to my first 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.970
 let's play by farm simulator 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.929
 2013 I'm busy right now 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.929
 to squeeze straw bales 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.480
 But now that I'm the sprit 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.029
 out of the trek and there I have to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.029
 now for the first time to refuel fast 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 I still have three lanes now and if 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.390
 I still pressed it now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.050
 already 17 o'clock I have to be a bit 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 I quickly hanged the press 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:38.329
 we can do it now 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:41.989
 go up and fill up very comfortably 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.989
 we throw the barrow at times 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.800
 he is driving a bit badly now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.690
 I have a weight on the front but the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:10.850
 I have now left press 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.850
 a bit overweight at the front 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.570
 street free 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.570
 abdicate 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 petrol pump 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:13.390
 and then just fill up 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.200
 yes, I threshed yesterday and 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.670
 Today I am busy with my pressing 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.030
 and then of course that comes 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.920
 Charge the bale and drive away 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.400
 let's see if I record that too 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.590
 will 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.120
 I'm a bit out of exercise 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:34.090
 The ballads are about that I will 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.170
 probably the last episode or something 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.580
 then it will be on the market 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 and then we drive back to the press 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:48.330
 hang up the press and try again 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.330
 to press the last three lanes 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.540
 what do i imagine under my let's 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.920
 I wanted to play with you too 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.470
 just tell me so fast I will 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.260
 Not every job I do on the job 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.560
 I'll take care of that court automatically 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 I'll look that maybe two 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.800
 Doing videos in the week and me 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.480
 but more often games and me 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.970
 I only want to promise you one thing 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.709
 would like to do current videos 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.090
 means I will not record anything and 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.330
 then upload it piece by piece 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.790
 but my videos are really real 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.370
 up to date of the day and I will be too 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.230
 upload right after that and that's why 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.720
 it's not so many in my day 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.160
 me every day then again, I give 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.140
 I will not say anything if I am 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.080
 I am flying for hours or am 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.430
 rough construction that is not all too 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.980
 exciting then maybe I will 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.209
 make small music videos about it but 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.360
 Of course, then, let's play the let's play 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.570
 work on others and how did 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.920
 I'm in a good mood and of course you like it 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.110
 I want to have my head of course 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.700
 after you if you say you want more 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
 let's play offs then I'll have a look 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.540
 maybe I'll do the week more then 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.900
 and otherwise I would now very much like 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:14.700
 at 23 displays or you have to once 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:19.729
 the week so stay here 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.729
 waste it says zack there is everything 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.220
 well then throw the crate makes 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.170
 OK 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.000
 and let's go 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.660
 that works very well the last one 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.700
 three tracks 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.170
 a back to the late place so me 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.790
 I'll watch that in the week 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.260
 two to three high and if it is 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.930
 just single since me please not 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.350
 evil and otherwise you should say 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.760
 human i would like to see more of it 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.130
 can certainly be set up 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.090
 but that I address myself rather then 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:14.340
 after you and we can show you if 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.520
 you like what I'm doing here 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.740
 Just give me a thumbs up and 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.710
 leave me an abo da if you're new 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.790
 my channel side would be me, of course 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.950
 very pleased 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.730
 I see then, of course, that 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.630
 my videos are watched 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.150
 yes, if you give me that a little 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.980
 I would be supportive at the beginning 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.700
 then of course very grateful and would 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.440
 I am also very happy 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.180
 no i do not want to grow up 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.450
 or something else but me 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.670
 compare subscribers and so he with 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.730
 People who watch my videos like that 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.320
 motivation for not and therefore also mine 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.010
 promise that my videos always 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.140
 are up to date and that means stop 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.330
 simply that I just really accommodating 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.300
 and the same day still upload and 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.000
 not here I say eternal 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.500
 Pope and then to and 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.340
 to upload but really always 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.030
 Hot and then I put it 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.030
 just worth it 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.160
 and how long will the room go? 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:20.139
 I have made such a maximum 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.520
 ten minutes 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:27.889
 otherwise I'll take that upload 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.810
 just too long and the rest writes 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.419
 me just in the comments what me 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.330
 what you like to see could do differently 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.979
 would 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.789
 and for what I handle you once 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:40.160
 should show 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.349
 and then we can talk about it 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.259
 and then it certainly can 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:47.630
 and I'm here now 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.440
 finished with pressing that was now the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:53.750
 last track 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:56.990
 He wants to see if we will 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:07:00.130
 still fall off maybe we will come 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:06.550
 behind it somehow 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.550
 but we can do that away 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:14.350
 and that was it for then 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.979
 This time I do not have another one 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.979
 cereals more 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.109
 let's see 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:27.109
 probably still behind 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.540
 on 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:35.910
 pay slip on 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.490
 you could not somehow have the two 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.790
 push somehow I have it like that 

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.790
 in remembrance 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.070
 well that's what I'm going to do now 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.540
 still busy 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.420
 and yes, thank you first for 

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.370
 watch it and turn it on again 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.560
 at the next six play and as I said 

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.810
 Thumbs up writes me something in the 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.690
