I would like to talk a little bit today

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.870 
I would like to talk a little bit today
about<00:00:17.380> something<00:00:18.039> that<00:00:18.099> we<00:00:18.220> get<00:00:18.340> asked<00:00:18.550> a<00:00:18.730> lot

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
about something that we get asked a lot

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.480 
about something that we get asked a lot
about<00:00:18.939> and<00:00:19.450> that's<00:00:19.900> our<00:00:20.079> digital<00:00:20.410> pianos<00:00:20.829> and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
about and that's our digital pianos and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.339 
about and that's our digital pianos and
in<00:00:21.880> particular<00:00:22.029> I'd<00:00:22.599> like<00:00:22.630> to<00:00:22.869> talk<00:00:23.050> first

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
in particular I'd like to talk first

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.830 
in particular I'd like to talk first
about<00:00:23.680> our<00:00:23.920> ivory<00:00:24.220> feel<00:00:24.640> action<00:00:25.150> this<00:00:25.779> is

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
about our ivory feel action this is

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.330 
about our ivory feel action this is
something<00:00:26.289> in<00:00:26.349> Roland<00:00:26.650> introduced<00:00:27.010> just<00:00:27.220> a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
something in Roland introduced just a

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.490 
something in Roland introduced just a
few<00:00:27.519> years<00:00:27.730> ago<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.269> it<00:00:28.420> is<00:00:28.449> now<00:00:28.750> standard<00:00:29.410> on

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
few years ago and it is now standard on

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.769 
few years ago and it is now standard on
all<00:00:29.769> of<00:00:30.009> our<00:00:30.130> digital<00:00:30.279> pianos<00:00:30.939> it's<00:00:31.660> a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
all of our digital pianos it's a

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.960 
all of our digital pianos it's a
wonderful<00:00:32.500> wonderful<00:00:32.710> field<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.550> action

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
wonderful wonderful field of the action

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.479 
wonderful wonderful field of the action
and<00:00:34.180> it<00:00:34.780> replicates<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.650> feeling<00:00:36.010> of<00:00:36.100> ivory

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
and it replicates the feeling of ivory

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.460 
and it replicates the feeling of ivory
which<00:00:36.730> is<00:00:36.760> of<00:00:37.000> course<00:00:37.239> what<00:00:37.839> pianos<00:00:38.290> were

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
which is of course what pianos were

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.039 
which is of course what pianos were
originally<00:00:39.040> made<00:00:39.220> with<00:00:39.250> for<00:00:39.729> their<00:00:39.850> keys<00:00:40.059> the

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:41.049 
originally made with for their keys the

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.350 
originally made with for their keys the
reason<00:00:41.559> that<00:00:41.710> ivory<00:00:42.159> was<00:00:42.280> originally<00:00:42.820> used<00:00:43.030> is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
reason that ivory was originally used is

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.100 
reason that ivory was originally used is
because<00:00:44.019> it's<00:00:44.799> porous<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.570> therefore<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:46.900> was

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
because it's porous and therefore it was

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.600 
because it's porous and therefore it was
moisture-wicking<00:00:47.559> which<00:00:48.250> there<00:00:48.430> weren't<00:00:48.519> a

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
moisture-wicking which there weren't a

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.490 
moisture-wicking which there weren't a
lot<00:00:48.729> of<00:00:48.790> moisture<00:00:49.269> wicking<00:00:49.479> materials<00:00:50.170> back

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
lot of moisture wicking materials back

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.700 
lot of moisture wicking materials back
in<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.830> early<00:00:51.100> 1800s<00:00:51.839> now<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.260> advantage<00:00:53.619> of

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
in the early 1800s now the advantage of

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.710 
in the early 1800s now the advantage of
ivory<00:00:54.070> if<00:00:54.339> you<00:00:54.850> were<00:00:54.970> playing<00:00:55.269> in<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.540> none

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
ivory if you were playing in a none

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.329 
ivory if you were playing in a none
air-conditioned<00:00:56.350> concert<00:00:56.830> hall<00:00:57.040> and<00:00:57.250> your

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
air-conditioned concert hall and your

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.770 
air-conditioned concert hall and your
hands<00:00:57.670> were<00:00:57.760> sweating<00:00:58.059> your<00:00:58.269> fingers<00:00:58.659> are

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
hands were sweating your fingers are

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.929 
hands were sweating your fingers are
getting<00:00:58.900> slick<00:00:59.320> the<00:01:00.010> ivory<00:01:00.489> would<00:01:00.699> help

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:00.939 
getting slick the ivory would help

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:03.960 
getting slick the ivory would help
minimize<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.780> effects<00:01:02.080> of<00:01:02.320> that<00:01:02.580> but<00:01:03.580> in<00:01:03.790> the

minimize the effects of that but in the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.380 
minimize the effects of that but in the
mid-1920s<00:01:05.280> piano<00:01:06.280> manufacturers<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.270> lot

mid-1920s piano manufacturers for a lot
of<00:01:07.479> different<00:01:07.780> reasons<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.380> know

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
of different reasons you know

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
environmental starting to kill off the

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.190 
environmental starting to kill off the
sources<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.829> ivory<00:01:12.189> stopped<00:01:13.179> using<00:01:13.450> ivory<00:01:13.929> and

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
sources of ivory stopped using ivory and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.669 
sources of ivory stopped using ivory and
switched<00:01:14.829> to<00:01:15.490> using<00:01:15.520> wooden<00:01:16.149> keys<00:01:16.679> generally

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
switched to using wooden keys generally

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.520 
switched to using wooden keys generally
with<00:01:17.859> plastic<00:01:18.549> surfaces<00:01:19.210> these<00:01:19.990> keys<00:01:20.320> were

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
with plastic surfaces these keys were

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.429 
with plastic surfaces these keys were
more<00:01:20.740> slick<00:01:21.179> they<00:01:22.179> had<00:01:22.390> some<00:01:22.600> disadvantages

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
more slick they had some disadvantages

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.410 
more slick they had some disadvantages
in<00:01:23.619> fact<00:01:23.950> wooden<00:01:24.280> keys<00:01:24.490> inherently<00:01:25.179> have

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
in fact wooden keys inherently have

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.840 
in fact wooden keys inherently have
disadvantages<00:01:25.749> you<00:01:26.380> know<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.039> wooden<00:01:27.369> key<00:01:27.549> is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
disadvantages you know a wooden key is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.029

across<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.810> entire<00:01:41.049> keyboard<00:01:41.350> it's<00:01:42.100> one

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
across the entire keyboard it's one

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.179 
across the entire keyboard it's one
reason<00:01:42.579> that<00:01:42.999> piano<00:01:43.569> tuners<00:01:44.079> also<00:01:44.590> spend<00:01:45.130> time

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
reason that piano tuners also spend time

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.069 
reason that piano tuners also spend time
working<00:01:45.579> on<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.909> action<00:01:46.359> of<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.569> piano<00:01:46.869> from

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
working on the action of the piano from

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.349 
working on the action of the piano from
time<00:01:47.319> to<00:01:47.469> time<00:01:47.499> and<00:01:48.100> when<00:01:48.579> they<00:01:48.700> do<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.090> they

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
time to time and when they do so they

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.559 
time to time and when they do so they
use<00:01:49.960> little<00:01:50.530> action<00:01:51.130> weights<00:01:51.340> to<00:01:52.119> regulate

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
use little action weights to regulate

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.209 
use little action weights to regulate
the<00:01:52.689> piano<00:01:52.960> we'll<00:01:53.319> talk<00:01:53.499> about<00:01:53.649> that<00:01:53.889> more<00:01:53.950> in

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
the piano we'll talk about that more in

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.160 
the piano we'll talk about that more in
another<00:01:54.340> segment<00:01:54.729> in<00:01:54.999> just<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.240> minute<00:01:55.509> but

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
another segment in just a minute but

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.620 
another segment in just a minute but
back<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.619> ivory<00:01:57.009> field<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:58.090> reason<00:01:58.539> that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
back to the ivory field the reason that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.629 
back to the ivory field the reason that
Roland<00:01:59.170> came<00:01:59.319> up<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.710> ivory<00:01:59.950> field<00:02:00.399> is

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:00.639 
Roland came up with ivory field is

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:03.090 
Roland came up with ivory field is
because<00:02:01.389> we<00:02:01.509> wanted<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.929> best<00:02:02.100> possible

heat we test them very thoroughly to
make<00:02:27.700> sure<00:02:27.879> that<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.390> case<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:29.230> not

fantastic it's a slightly slightly
porous<00:02:38.620> surface<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.370> does<00:02:39.670> have<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:39.940> little<00:02:40.150> bit

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
porous surface it does have a little bit

porous surface it does have a little bit
of<00:02:40.420> grain<00:02:40.659> to<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.319> nice<00:02:41.530> thing<00:02:41.560> is<00:02:42.040> you
