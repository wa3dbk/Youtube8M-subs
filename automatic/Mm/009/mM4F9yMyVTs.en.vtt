00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.450
 this feeling example of the place in 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 where when a person has a dream 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.230
 bet on an absolute product 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.720
 quality does not need a lot of budget 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.300
 to make the business dream come true 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.740
 own because that product is going to go 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 attracting the clientele and going to do 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.980
 that the business you bet 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.440
 And if this flower Cafecito it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.039

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.039

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.800
 a lot of coffee is something cappuccino however 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.570

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000
 the days 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.030
 Not everyone but many told me that 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.260
 it was the best coffee in the city good is 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.300
 a joy to hear this 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.450
 we are striving 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.950
 as they are reinforcing good 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.110
 we work with very good producers 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.850
 that's where the true coffee starts 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.360
 we are not in the cafe here 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 same and the baristas do their job and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 it's history how it starts because you 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.100
 obviously you are not 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.650
 the Peruvian yes good today I am four 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.990
 fifth Peruvian man not my wife my children 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.050
 my bitch 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.930
 they are Peruvian and I am 15 years old 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.990
 here I am desert and you met his wife 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.140
 Peruvian here or here not here yes 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.479
 you came because the first one helped in a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.470
 Christian school in the major car very 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.439
 obama in 1997 after I met a group 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.720
 of producers and they thought that their 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.549
 coffee was better than its neighbors and if 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.320
 there was direct way out could 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:57.100
 have more income and they were right 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.020
 and began to support them with exports 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.509
 We knew that it will help them to treat 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.369
 part management and marketing more 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.040
 that everything does not connect to them we have 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.869
 exported from here and we had a 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.489
 exporting company when we are 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.860
 I was in that from 2000 to 2007 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.440
 that some friends were asking me where 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.480
 You drink the best coffee in Peru and I always 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.610
 I say in my laboratory 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.390
 then the laboratory already became 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.390
 a business
