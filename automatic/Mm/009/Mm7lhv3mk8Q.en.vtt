00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.609
 ah 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.260
 before 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.680
 hello friends we are in an environment 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.800
 different we 're not in the bush I'm 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 right now in the kitchen of my house 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.619
 welcome and I want to explain how 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 make a stove but not the famous one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.400
 cardboard ring that everyone is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.050
 doing and is fast and very good because 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.570
 things and practice them without another 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.970
 version that means cardboard because it uses 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.800
 cotton that in my opinion it turns on 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.710
 faster and it 's a lot more flame 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 consistent with more ease is 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 with me as it is done is very simple and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.740
 good that we like 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.250
 this time the container that I'm going to 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.260
 use is a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 a small tin can process it very 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 big is like the palm of your hand 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.500
 practically a little smaller you can 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.220
 do with larger or smaller 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.080
 but hey everyone, that to your liking is a 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.940
 good 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's a good measure also because for 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.570
 heat something like that fast the mountain 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 keep a little water and make yourself 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.110
 some noodles of these dehydrated or 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.390
 Successful as it is already good 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 the bigger it is the more it will weigh 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.630
 element and Mars will occupy in the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.450
 team then I think it 's this 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.000
 measure is a good measure in itself 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 if it has a much better cover in this case 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.530
 I do not have it, so what I do is a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.020
 another can stage with here and then 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.670
 put a gumdrop on top so that 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.009
 has sealed that nothing falls 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.570
 good and more elements clear is the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.490
 cotton I already said and a candle in this 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.220
 case the sail comes to me very well because 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.040
 more or less is the same of it 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.009
 diameter more or less then that 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.440
 would put it to the side and cut it to us 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.330
 that height because he knows that when melting 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.820
 this will then solidify and 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.520
 will therefore maintain that same volume or 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.110
 similar and do not waste so much so much 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.330
 paraffin candle end after what 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.539
 it's solid paraffin and what we're going to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.700
 to do is melt it and then with 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.090
 cotton mix everything and wait for 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.090
 cool 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.530
 great care 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.709
 this piece of duty we are going to do 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.709
 in smaller pieces 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.120
 to melt the whole candle we could 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.750
 use several methods we could 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.140
 directly in a pot to put 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.510
 fire and heat as it melts or 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.790
 even in a water bath we will look at the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.180
 big water and this up so that it 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.520
 melt I made it easier that I see is 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.960
 in a cup that does not have much esteem 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.800
 for putting all the paraffin inside with 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.580
 the arms all the candles and directly 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.740
 Mr. microwave 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.690
 and that he knocks it down 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.630
 and one time I got all 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.510
 candle sounds 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.510
 we go to the microwave in the center 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.489
 at full power and we put a couple of 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.489
 melodies 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.230
 and meanwhile the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.090
 microwave we prepare the can with 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.970
 cotton there is some concrete form or 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.800
 better to put it but not good if you 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.900
 you fix the cotton usually comes as in 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.820
 layers is worth the more crumbled 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.820
 be more open be much better 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.290
 neither nor very pressed everything now 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.000
 we started all the paraffin has been 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.220
 withdrawal has to flow for 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.450
 very well 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.870
 After a while we saw it 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.870
 watch out 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.820
 totally melted and good I put 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.430
 a surface here below for not 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.230
 stain in case something falls out with 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.530
 very careful we are pouring it 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.530
 inside 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.740
 we let it go filtering 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.920
 that go sucking well does not matter if it falls 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.920
 out nothing happens 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.969
 sucking and seems to have already reached the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.419
 stop 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:40.419
 well this already 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.730
 what you have to do is let cool 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.580
 appear a bit let it cool and the 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:50.920
 result comes to be something like this 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.620
 it's pink, he says with another guy 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.370
 of candle but good once dry for 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.470
 to use would be to scratch here well 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.569
 I do a little bit the fibers the fluff 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.689
 of cotton and volume descend 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.479
 to enjoy cooking and heating what 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:10.369
 we need to not have to wait for 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.740
 let it cool down let's do the 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.419
 try with this other I have seen and spent 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.709
 enough to lift the fibers and 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.709
 now just bring them a lighter 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.410
 that this takes a little the trowel 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:32.020
 and little by little I'm asking for size nothing 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.020
 ready to cook 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.629
 It takes a minute and a half like that and you see 

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:44.780
 that this takes super fast and looks at the 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:46.700
 less another way an alternative 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.260
 Baked cardboard burner 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.230
 discount to form we're going 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.320
 make us our little things 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:57.570
 better and I'm turning off already 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.860
 so it is saved for other times with the 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.790
 What we do is put it on top 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.790
 remove oxygen 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:09.139
 and he has said the usual thing that I hope that 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:12.849
 you liked to help and serve them 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.849
 see you in the next see you soon
