case<00:01:31.560> scenario<00:01:32.009> there's<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.369> region<00:01:32.850> chip<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
case scenario there's a region chip in

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.580 
case scenario there's a region chip in
the<00:01:33.960> form<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.740> nes<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.869> region<00:01:37.320> ship

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the form of this nes and the region ship

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
the form of this nes and the region ship
can<00:01:38.220> sometimes<00:01:38.640> cause<00:01:38.909> problems<00:01:39.509> with<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
can sometimes cause problems with the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 
can sometimes cause problems with the
blinking<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.439> all<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> need<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.790> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
blinking and all you need to do is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
blinking and all you need to do is
browned<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.020> board<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
browned it out on the board and that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.389 
browned it out on the board and that
usually<00:01:44.670> fixes<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.200> potentially<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.130> might

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
usually fixes it so potentially I might

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.820 
usually fixes it so potentially I might
just<00:01:47.579> need<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
just need to do that and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.090 
just need to do that and
make<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.980> video<00:01:49.220> mini<00:01:49.940> series<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.480> this<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.100> of

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
make a video mini series of this and of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.950 
make a video mini series of this and of
my<00:01:52.280> progress<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:53.000> I'm<00:01:53.210> gonna<00:01:53.420> plug<00:01:53.690> it<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:53.930> now

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
my progress so I'm gonna plug it in now

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
see how clean you can get it with just

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.830 
see how clean you can get it with just
an<00:03:43.190> eraser<00:03:43.700> because<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.090> doesn't<00:03:44.120> do<00:03:44.630> much

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
an eraser because it doesn't do much

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.860 
an eraser because it doesn't do much
damage<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.739> contact<00:03:46.220> points<00:03:46.610> and<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.720> gets

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
damage to the contact points and it gets

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:57.490 
damage to the contact points and it gets
a<00:03:47.989> lot<00:03:48.140> of<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.410> grime<00:03:48.739> off

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.300 
here a couple times and yeah it's pretty
filthy<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.780> I'm<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.199> gonna<00:04:28.320> go<00:04:28.770> ahead<00:04:29.190> and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
filthy so I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.680 
filthy so I'm just gonna go ahead and
erase<00:04:29.669> this<00:04:29.940> I<00:04:31.880> find<00:04:32.880> this<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.210> probably<00:04:33.449> the

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
erase this I find this is probably the

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.659 
erase this I find this is probably the
most<00:04:34.020> gentle<00:04:34.410> way<00:04:35.720> takes<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.840> little<00:04:36.990> longer

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
most gentle way takes a little longer

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.969 
most gentle way takes a little longer
there's<00:04:38.669> this<00:04:38.850> couple<00:04:39.030> swipes<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:40.710> the

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
there's this couple swipes with the

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.960 
there's this couple swipes with the
sandpaper<00:04:41.400> would<00:04:41.789> do<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:43.430> we<00:04:44.430> may<00:04:44.610> have<00:04:44.820> to

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
sandpaper would do it but we may have to

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.379 
sandpaper would do it but we may have to
do<00:04:45.120> that<00:04:45.330> too<00:04:46.370> but<00:04:47.370> this<00:04:47.550> will<00:04:47.760> usually<00:04:47.910> clear

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
do that too but this will usually clear

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.450 
do that too but this will usually clear
most<00:04:48.750> blinking<00:04:49.289> light<00:04:49.500> problems<00:04:50.070> because<00:04:50.430> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
most blinking light problems because a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.310 
most blinking light problems because a
lot<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.729> times<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.300> just<00:04:51.360> due<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.660> dirt<00:04:52.050> and

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
lot of times it's just due to dirt and

that<00:07:07.330> a<00:07:07.360> friend<00:07:07.750> of<00:07:07.810> mine<00:07:07.960> i<00:07:07.990> thought<00:07:08.229> was<00:07:08.380> very

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:08.590 
that a friend of mine i thought was very

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.260 
that a friend of mine i thought was very
very<00:07:08.800> broken<00:07:09.280> it<00:07:09.699> turns<00:07:09.910> out<00:07:10.030> it<00:07:10.150> was<00:07:10.240> just

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
very broken it turns out it was just

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.200 
very broken it turns out it was just
very<00:07:10.389> very<00:07:10.750> dirty<00:07:10.979> so<00:07:11.979> any<00:07:12.190> time<00:07:12.430> you<00:07:12.639> have<00:07:12.880> the

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
very very dirty so any time you have the

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.840 
very very dirty so any time you have the
red<00:07:13.449> power<00:07:13.990> light<00:07:14.320> blinking<00:07:14.860> it's<00:07:15.490> actually<00:07:15.669> a

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
red power light blinking it's actually a

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.200 
red power light blinking it's actually a
really<00:07:16.090> good<00:07:16.210> sign<00:07:17.070> even<00:07:18.070> if<00:07:18.220> the<00:07:18.849> screen<00:07:19.150> is

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:19.210 
really good sign even if the screen is

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.750 
really good sign even if the screen is
blinking<00:07:19.810> it<00:07:20.050> means<00:07:20.620> that<00:07:20.950> the<00:07:21.130> 72<00:07:21.580> pin

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760 
blinking it means that the 72 pin

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.700 
blinking it means that the 72 pin
connector<00:07:22.240> likely<00:07:23.080> just<00:07:23.229> needs<00:07:23.440> to<00:07:23.620> be

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710 
connector likely just needs to be

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.909 
connector likely just needs to be
cleaned<00:07:24.070> at<00:07:24.760> worst<00:07:25.450> the<00:07:26.110> pins<00:07:26.410> need<00:07:26.680> to<00:07:26.830> be

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 
cleaned at worst the pins need to be

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.510 
cleaned at worst the pins need to be
bent<00:07:27.160> back<00:07:27.370> and<00:07:28.919> otherwise<00:07:29.919> you<00:07:30.099> can<00:07:30.250> just<00:07:30.280> go
