big thanks to young the chief he found
the<00:00:19.439> first<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.550> second<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> i

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
the first one and the second one and i

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.099

found<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.630> last<00:00:21.840> egg<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.070> basically<00:00:24.050> how<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
found the last egg so basically how you

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.349 
found the last egg so basically how you
do<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.619> easter<00:00:26.039> egg<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> second

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
do this easter egg this is on the second

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
do this easter egg this is on the second
area<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.920> probably<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.789> any

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
area you can do this probably on any

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.299 
area you can do this probably on any
order<00:00:30.240> but<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:31.289> found<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.099> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
order but we found this one first so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.310 
order but we found this one first so
with<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.579> first<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.719> need<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> do<00:00:34.079> is

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
with it first so what you need to do is

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
with it first so what you need to do is
you<00:00:34.649> need<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.760> believe<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
you need to get on I believe this is the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.660 
you need to get on I believe this is the
right<00:00:36.690> side<00:00:37.110> from<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.070> come<00:00:38.399> from<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
right side from when you come from the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.209 
right side from when you come from the
barrier<00:00:39.000> hive<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> find<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.290> venom<00:00:40.800> X<00:00:40.980> egg

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
barrier hive and find the venom X egg

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.979 
barrier hive and find the venom X egg
that's<00:00:41.790> outside<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> map<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.629> shoot<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that's outside the map and shoot it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.340 
that's outside the map and shoot it
there<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.980> slow<00:00:44.010> motion<00:00:45.350> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
there you can see it in slow motion we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
there you can see it in slow motion we
haven't<00:00:46.680> confirmed<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.489> always<00:00:47.760> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
haven't confirmed it if it's always on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.020 
haven't confirmed it if it's always on
the<00:00:48.300> same<00:00:49.140> spot<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> good<00:00:50.820> reason

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the same spot but I have a good reason

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.540 
the same spot but I have a good reason
to<00:00:51.300> believe<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.379> will<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.770> always<00:00:53.070> on

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
to believe that if it will be always on

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
to believe that if it will be always on
the<00:00:54.030> same<00:00:54.210> spot<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.739> well<00:00:56.010> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the same spot as these two as well so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
the same spot as these two as well so
you<00:00:56.879> come<00:00:57.239> back<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:57.960> area<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
you come back to the first area or you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.240 
you come back to the first area or you
candide<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.120> first<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.600> anyway<00:01:01.250> on

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
candide do this just first but anyway on

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.660 
candide do this just first but anyway on
the<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> map<00:01:03.110> near<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.129> barrier

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the back of the map near and the barrier

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.840

you obviously did an easter egg is a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
you obviously did an easter egg is a
confirmation<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> what<00:01:40.409> this<00:01:40.560> does

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
confirmation of that and what this does

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.510

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
instincts combined in a way you will see

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
instincts combined in a way you will see
in<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.759> second<00:01:57.149> when<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.509> start<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> hive<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.380> we

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
in a second when we start the hive so we

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
in a second when we start the hive so we

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
wanted to start it straight away to see

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.389 
wanted to start it straight away to see
the<00:02:00.750> full<00:02:00.930> effect<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> timer<00:02:02.040> was

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the full effect because the timer was

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.940 
the full effect because the timer was
running<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.509> by<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> way<00:02:04.469> we<00:02:04.649> did<00:02:04.829> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
running out and by the way we did this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.560 
running out and by the way we did this
on<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.159> live<00:02:05.399> stream<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.000> didn't<00:02:06.210> look<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> up

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
on a live stream so we didn't look it up

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.290
