00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.820 

you<00:00:08.069> guys<00:00:08.220> welcome<00:00:08.550> back<00:00:08.580> MCA<00:00:09.330> here<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:09.900> finally

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
you guys welcome back MCA here I finally

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.299 
you guys welcome back MCA here I finally
got<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.309> work<00:00:11.750> I've<00:00:12.750> just<00:00:12.809> run<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> test<00:00:13.950> run

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
got it to work I've just run a test run

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.140 
got it to work I've just run a test run
and<00:00:14.610> had<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:16.049> hundred<00:00:16.320> percent<00:00:16.350> accuracy

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
and had one hundred percent accuracy

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.820 
and had one hundred percent accuracy
that's<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> only<00:00:18.539> miscellaneous<00:00:19.109> item<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that's the only miscellaneous item and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.509 
that's the only miscellaneous item and
every<00:00:20.039> other<00:00:20.250> item<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:20.970> its<00:00:21.210> proper<00:00:21.660> spot

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
every other item is in its proper spot

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:27.859 
every other item is in its proper spot
so<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.810> pretty<00:00:25.019> cool<00:00:26.480> when<00:00:27.480> we're<00:00:27.750> still

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
so that is pretty cool when we're still

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.019 
so that is pretty cool when we're still
using<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.410> hopper<00:00:28.800> pipeline<00:00:29.519> except<00:00:29.939> this

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
using the hopper pipeline except this

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.560 
using the hopper pipeline except this
time<00:00:30.210> I've<00:00:30.510> added<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.439> clock<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> top<00:00:32.579> looks

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
time I've added a clock to the top looks

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
time I've added a clock to the top looks
kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.020> messy<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.469> I'll<00:00:34.559> show<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
kind of messy but I'll show you what it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.700 
kind of messy but I'll show you what it
does<00:00:35.840> basically<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.410> doing<00:00:37.590> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
does basically what it's doing is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.639 
does basically what it's doing is
applying<00:00:38.040> power<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.820> alternate<00:00:39.360> hoppers<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
applying power to alternate hoppers so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.639 
applying power to alternate hoppers so
that<00:00:43.040> when<00:00:44.040> one<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> off<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:46.230> other<00:00:46.410> two

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that when one is off here the other two

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
that when one is off here the other two
on<00:00:46.829> either<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.460> or<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:50.120> that<00:00:51.120> way<00:00:51.270> when

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
on either side or on so that way when

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
on either side or on so that way when
materials<00:00:52.020> coming<00:00:52.289> through<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.670> this

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
materials coming through here when this

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.229 
materials coming through here when this
hopper<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> held<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.960> no<00:00:55.879> material<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.030> pass

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
hopper is held on no material can pass

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
hopper is held on no material can pass
through<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.260> fall<00:00:58.590> through<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.859> it

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
through it but it can fall through so it

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.439 
through it but it can fall through so it
locks<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.399> place<00:01:02.430> until<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> material<00:01:03.359> has

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
locks in place until the material has

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
locks in place until the material has
time<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> fall<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.350> if<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.769> needs<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.189> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
time to fall through if it needs to and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
time to fall through if it needs to and
then<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> moves<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.490> it's<00:01:08.810> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
then it moves on and it's kind of a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
then it moves on and it's kind of a
complicated<00:01:10.080> clock<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> monostable

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
complicated clock I have a monostable

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
complicated clock I have a monostable
circuit<00:01:12.570> set<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.979> like<00:01:14.520> eight

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
circuit set up here that's like eight

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.380 
circuit set up here that's like eight
tix<00:01:15.030> or<00:01:15.210> whatever<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.759> it's<00:01:17.759> running<00:01:18.060> into

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
tix or whatever and it's running into

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.370 
tix or whatever and it's running into
this<00:01:18.540> clock<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.280> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> notice<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.850> on

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
this clock and if you notice the on

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
this clock and if you notice the on
signal<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:23.100> shorter<00:01:23.759> than<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.299> signal

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
signal is is shorter than the off signal

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
signal is is shorter than the off signal
and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.920> inverted<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.420> at

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and then I just inverted that so that at

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
and then I just inverted that so that at
the<00:01:27.570> opposite<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.170> true<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> look

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the opposite is true and if you look

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.940 
the opposite is true and if you look
very<00:01:29.610> carefully<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.470> two<00:01:31.650> signals

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
very carefully at the the two signals

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.249 
very carefully at the the two signals
here<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> tell<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:32.970> for<00:01:33.869> their<00:01:33.990> brief

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
here you can tell that for their brief

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.179 
here you can tell that for their brief
second<00:01:34.710> both<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.950> then<00:01:37.950> one

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
second both of them are on and then one

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.800 
second both of them are on and then one
goes<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:38.970> they're<00:01:39.119> both<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.299> again

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
goes off and then they're both on again

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.120 
goes off and then they're both on again
and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> other<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.470> goes<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and then the other one goes off and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.590 
and then the other one goes off and
that's<00:01:41.310> important<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.150> want<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.329> hundreds

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's important if you want a hundreds

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.840 
that's important if you want a hundreds
of<00:01:42.630> accuracy<00:01:43.100> because<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> don't<00:01:44.610> have

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
of accuracy because if you don't have

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.249 
of accuracy because if you don't have
that<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.240> just<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> simple<00:01:45.810> clock

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that if you just have a simple clock

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.950 
that if you just have a simple clock
you'll<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.220> pretty<00:01:47.640> good<00:01:47.700> results<00:01:47.850> about<00:01:48.390> 80%

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you'll get pretty good results about 80%

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.929 
you'll get pretty good results about 80%
i<00:01:49.049> guess<00:01:49.790> but<00:01:50.790> each<00:01:51.149> time<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.380> switch

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
i guess but each time that they switch

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.690 
i guess but each time that they switch
this<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.090> goes<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.700> goes

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this one goes on and and this one goes

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
this one goes on and and this one goes
off<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.210> back<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.140> forth<00:01:58.439> each<00:01:58.890> time<00:01:59.250> that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
off and back and forth each time that

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
off and back and forth each time that
happens<00:01:59.909> there's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.299> chance<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:00.899> material<00:02:01.799> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
happens there's a chance for material to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.550 
happens there's a chance for material to
bleed<00:02:02.100> through<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.619> faster<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> clock<00:02:05.399> or

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
bleed through so the faster the clock or

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.609 
bleed through so the faster the clock or
the<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:08.270> The<00:02:09.270> Closer<00:02:09.570> this<00:02:09.960> is<00:02:10.170> together

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the more The Closer this is together

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.240 
the more The Closer this is together
whether<00:02:11.190> it's<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:12.170> buffer<00:02:13.170> period<00:02:13.680> of<00:02:13.920> more

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
whether it's not a buffer period of more

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.670 
whether it's not a buffer period of more
they're<00:02:14.370> both<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.960> more<00:02:16.200> bleed<00:02:16.440> you'll

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
they're both on the more bleed you'll

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.890 
they're both on the more bleed you'll
get<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> simple<00:02:19.280> one

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
get and this is with a simple one

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
get and this is with a simple one
repeater<00:02:21.900> clock<00:02:22.560> so<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.340> got<00:02:23.550> decent<00:02:24.240> results<00:02:24.690> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
repeater clock so I got decent results a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
repeater clock so I got decent results a
lot<00:02:25.230> better<00:02:25.380> than<00:02:25.710> before<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.310> sure<00:02:26.870> so

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
lot better than before for sure so

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.710 
lot better than before for sure so
that's<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.280> option<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.420> have

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
that's a one option to and you just have

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.610 
that's a one option to and you just have
alternate<00:02:31.500> torches<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:33.020> then<00:02:34.020> red

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
alternate torches and then and then red

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.650 
alternate torches and then and then red
zone<00:02:34.860> going<00:02:35.520> directly<00:02:35.910> into<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.240> other<00:02:36.360> ones

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
zone going directly into the other ones

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.370 
zone going directly into the other ones
so<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.500> easy<00:02:37.950> enough<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.250> do<00:02:38.430> but<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:40.140> is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
so that's easy enough to do but that is

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.770 
so that's easy enough to do but that is
how<00:02:40.830> you<00:02:40.890> want<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.820> get<00:02:42.120> percent

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
how you want how you get percent

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.440 
how you want how you get percent
accuracy<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:44.459> particular<00:02:44.760> model<00:02:45.090> if

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
accuracy with this particular model if

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.320 
accuracy with this particular model if
that's<00:02:45.690> what<00:02:45.840> you're<00:02:45.959> looking<00:02:45.990> for<00:02:46.580> so<00:02:47.580> thanks
