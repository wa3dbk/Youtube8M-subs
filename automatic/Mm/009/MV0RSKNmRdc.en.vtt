00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
quick read and yet again a chapter where

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.810 
quick read and yet again a chapter where
the<00:00:29.320> most<00:00:29.559> important<00:00:30.070> thing<00:00:30.250> that<00:00:30.460> happened

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
the most important thing that happened

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.149 
the most important thing that happened
in<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:30.969> chapter<00:00:31.210> happened<00:00:31.869> in<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.439> ending<00:00:32.890> so

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:33.159 
in the chapter happened in the ending so

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:34.950 
in the chapter happened in the ending so
it<00:00:33.309> just<00:00:33.610> seemed<00:00:34.000> as<00:00:34.269> if<00:00:34.300> the<00:00:34.420> rest<00:00:34.750> of<00:00:34.900> the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
it just seemed as if the rest of the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.889 
it just seemed as if the rest of the
chapter<00:00:35.170> was<00:00:35.949> a<00:00:35.980> non<00:00:36.430> readable<00:00:37.089> build-up<00:00:37.720> to

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
chapter was a non readable build-up to

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.509 
chapter was a non readable build-up to
the<00:00:38.079> ending<00:00:38.379> what<00:00:38.620> do<00:00:38.739> I<00:00:38.829> mean<00:00:39.010> by<00:00:39.070> non

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
the ending what do I mean by non

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.000 
the ending what do I mean by non
readable<00:00:40.000> build-up<00:00:40.479> basically<00:00:41.110> you<00:00:41.800> had

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
readable build-up basically you had

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.860 
readable build-up basically you had
absolutely<00:00:42.579> no<00:00:42.850> idea<00:00:43.000> that<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.479> ending<00:00:43.780> was

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
absolutely no idea that the ending was

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.329 
absolutely no idea that the ending was
going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.110> happen<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:44.470> was<00:00:44.530> something<00:00:45.309> that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
going to happen it was something that

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.100 
going to happen it was something that
wasn't<00:00:45.670> foreshadowed<00:00:46.420> therefore<00:00:46.780> wasn't

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
wasn't foreshadowed therefore wasn't

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.270 
wasn't foreshadowed therefore wasn't
something<00:00:47.290> that<00:00:47.409> you<00:00:47.559> can<00:00:47.710> protect<00:00:48.070> or

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
something that you can protect or

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.560 
something that you can protect or
something<00:00:48.519> you<00:00:48.579> could<00:00:48.699> get<00:00:48.820> hyped<00:00:49.030> about<00:00:49.210> it

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
something you could get hyped about it

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.639 
something you could get hyped about it
just<00:00:49.780> happened<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.500> her<00:00:50.590> ending<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.250> said<00:00:51.460> oh

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
just happened to her ending you said oh

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.250 
just happened to her ending you said oh
and<00:00:53.649> then<00:00:54.519> in<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.789> chapter<00:00:55.000> ended<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.600> that's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
and then in the chapter ended and that's

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.139 
and then in the chapter ended and that's
what<00:00:56.410> blaze<00:00:56.589> has<00:00:56.679> been<00:00:56.859> doing<00:00:57.100> for<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.030> very

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
what blaze has been doing for a very

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.459 
what blaze has been doing for a very
long<00:00:58.629> time<00:00:59.219> however<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.690> chapter<00:01:02.050> wasn't<00:01:02.350> too

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
long time however the chapter wasn't too

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.340 
long time however the chapter wasn't too
bad<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:03.760> see<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.119> my<00:01:04.239> OD<00:01:04.539> has<00:01:04.690> a<00:01:04.720> new<00:01:05.050> device

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
bad we see that my OD has a new device

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.649 
bad we see that my OD has a new device
and<00:01:05.679> a<00:01:06.100> device<00:01:06.429> allows<00:01:06.820> them<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.000> manipulate

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
and a device allows them to manipulate

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.080 
and a device allows them to manipulate
reishi<00:01:07.960> for<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.800> certain<00:01:09.159> amount<00:01:09.190> of<00:01:09.490> time<00:01:09.700> and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
reishi for a certain amount of time and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.270 
reishi for a certain amount of time and
it<00:01:10.300> can<00:01:10.420> freely<00:01:10.780> manipulate<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.830> time<00:01:12.100> it

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
it can freely manipulate the time it

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.249 
it can freely manipulate the time it
takes<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.030> device<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.810> manipulate

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
takes for the device to manipulate

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.320 
takes for the device to manipulate
duration<00:01:15.100> so<00:01:15.190> therefore<00:01:15.610> he<00:01:15.640> is<00:01:15.850> a<00:01:15.909> really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
duration so therefore he is a really

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.029 
duration so therefore he is a really
really<00:01:16.479> bad<00:01:16.869> matchup<00:01:17.319> against<00:01:17.560> bambietta

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
really bad matchup against bambietta

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.969 
really bad matchup against bambietta
then<00:01:18.970> at<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.210> very<00:01:19.240> end<00:01:19.509> like<00:01:20.439> I<00:01:20.470> was<00:01:20.649> talking

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
then at the very end like I was talking

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.200 
then at the very end like I was talking
about<00:01:21.040> before<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:22.299> see<00:01:22.950> alessandro<00:01:24.210> charlotte

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
about before we see alessandro charlotte

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.880 
about before we see alessandro charlotte
Sadducee<00:01:25.689> i<00:01:26.079> believe<00:01:26.560> that's<00:01:26.740> how<00:01:26.799> you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.060 
pronounce name and loopy all in zombie
form<00:01:30.579> which<00:01:31.000> therefore<00:01:31.350> confirms<00:01:32.350> why<00:01:32.590> my<00:01:32.799> UT

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
form which therefore confirms why my UT

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.399 
form which therefore confirms why my UT

this chapter the rest is just a little

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.399 
this chapter the rest is just a little
bit<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.200> combat<00:02:02.680> between<00:02:03.549> my<00:02:03.759> UT<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.409> yourself

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
bit of combat between my UT and yourself

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.230 
bit of combat between my UT and yourself
and<00:02:05.649> nothing<00:02:06.369> really<00:02:06.579> else<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.969> talk<00:02:07.180> about

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
besides the fact that yourself brought

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.539 
besides the fact that yourself brought
back<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:10.179> lot<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.929> fodder<00:02:11.500> Shinigami<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.459> we

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
back a lot of fodder Shinigami that we
