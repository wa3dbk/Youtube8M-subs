we're<00:01:04.410> going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> review<00:01:04.920> earlier<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.970> my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
we're going to review earlier in my

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
we're going to review earlier in my
earlier<00:01:06.630> part<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> video<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> saw<00:01:07.560> how

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
earlier part of the video you saw how

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730 
earlier part of the video you saw how
thin<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.820> nice<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
thin and nice it is and this is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940 
thin and nice it is and this is
basically<00:01:10.950> poor-man's<00:01:11.820> tell<00:01:12.479> Adamo<00:01:13.020> which

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
basically poor-man's tell Adamo which

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
basically poor-man's tell Adamo which
was<00:01:14.340> made<00:01:15.030> basically<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.960> computer<00:01:16.320> against

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
was made basically to computer against

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.060 
was made basically to computer against
the<00:01:16.860> portability<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.970> MacBook<00:01:18.509> Air<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the portability of MacBook Air so this

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.550 
the portability of MacBook Air so this
comes<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:20.970> fraction<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.690> the<00:01:21.840> cost<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
comes at a fraction of the cost and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.430 
comes at a fraction of the cost and
gives<00:01:23.160> you<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.610> portability<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> very

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
gives you all that portability and very

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.359 
gives you all that portability and very
cool<00:01:25.649> design<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.039> Adamo<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:27.030> known<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.630> so

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
cool design that Adamo is known for so

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.190 
cool design that Adamo is known for so
exterior<00:01:29.369> wise<00:01:29.580> you<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.869> know<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
exterior wise you have the you know the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.310 
exterior wise you have the you know the
brushed<00:01:31.830> aluminum<00:01:32.330> construction<00:01:33.330> but<00:01:34.170> it's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
brushed aluminum construction but it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
brushed aluminum construction but it's
not<00:01:34.470> unibody<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:35.729> Apple<00:01:36.180> MacBook<00:01:36.780> Pros

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
not unibody like the Apple MacBook Pros

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.190 
not unibody like the Apple MacBook Pros
so<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.399> know<00:01:38.490> don't<00:01:38.700> expect<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.869> doesn't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so you know don't expect that it doesn't

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.950 
so you know don't expect that it doesn't
feel<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:41.119> think<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.510> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.810> say<00:01:42.900> too

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
feel I think I don't want to say too

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.050 
feel I think I don't want to say too
flimsy<00:01:43.350> because<00:01:43.650> it's<00:01:43.920> not<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.820> solid

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
flimsy because it's not it's very solid

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.830 
flimsy because it's not it's very solid
but<00:01:45.900> it's<00:01:46.080> not<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.619> sturdy<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.820> MacBook<00:01:48.720> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
but it's not as sturdy as MacBook you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
but it's not as sturdy as MacBook you
don't<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.380> out<00:01:49.560> feeling<00:01:49.979> what<00:01:50.400> I<00:01:50.430> like

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
don't get that out feeling what I like

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
don't get that out feeling what I like
about<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.090> laptop<00:01:52.049> either<00:01:52.409> I'm<00:01:52.650> speaking

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
about this laptop either I'm speaking

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
about this laptop either I'm speaking
super<00:01:53.490> fast<00:01:53.759> because<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.810> 10-minute<00:01:55.259> limit

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
super fast because the 10-minute limit

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.730 
super fast because the 10-minute limit
is<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.689> realize<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.990> comes<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.320> lot<00:01:58.560> quicker

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
is just I realize it comes a lot quicker

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.730 
is just I realize it comes a lot quicker
than<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.100> think<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.479> hinges<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.080> very

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
than I think so the hinges are very

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
than I think so the hinges are very
nicely<00:02:02.009> engineered<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.439> lid

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
nicely engineered so that as the lid

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.060 
nicely engineered so that as the lid
goes<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:05.580> down<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.500> provides<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.710> very

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
goes up and down it provides a very

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.449 
goes up and down it provides a very
solid<00:02:08.729> platform<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.570> thus<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.799> lid<00:02:11.070> flex

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
solid platform and thus the the lid flex

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.170 
solid platform and thus the the lid flex
is<00:02:11.880> not<00:02:12.720> as<00:02:13.010> pronounced<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.220> pretty<00:02:14.640> solid<00:02:14.850> I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
is not as pronounced it's pretty solid I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.090 
is not as pronounced it's pretty solid I
