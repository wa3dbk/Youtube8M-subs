row on the fence just waiting for us and
then<00:00:52.269> I<00:00:52.360> decided<00:00:52.720> to<00:00:52.930> try<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.170> feed<00:00:53.470> some

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then I decided to try to feed some

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.200 
then I decided to try to feed some
myself

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.540 

I<00:01:00.300> didn't<00:01:01.079> expect<00:01:01.170> such<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.710> language<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
I didn't expect such the language and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:16.380 
I didn't expect such the language and
even<00:01:02.790> have<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:02.969> birds<00:01:03.270> landing<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.080> arm

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.960 

it<00:01:17.200> seems<00:01:17.470> like<00:01:17.710> every<00:01:18.130> few<00:01:18.340> seconds<00:01:18.820> another

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
it seems like every few seconds another

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.030 
it seems like every few seconds another
was<00:01:19.450> trying<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> fly<00:01:20.050> up<00:01:20.260> with<00:01:20.440> me<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.680> land<00:01:20.860> on

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
my arm to get some of the food that I

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.870 
my arm to get some of the food that I
was<00:01:22.690> offering<00:01:23.200> seems<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.190> wasn't<00:01:24.400> passing

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
was offering seems like I wasn't passing

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.820 
was offering seems like I wasn't passing
it<00:01:24.970> out<00:01:25.060> quick<00:01:25.390> enough<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:25.869> that<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.590> birds

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
it out quick enough so that the birds

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.710 
it out quick enough so that the birds
had<00:01:27.010> to<00:01:27.100> be<00:01:27.190> brave<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.490> come<00:01:27.940> up<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.270> land<00:01:28.510> on

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
had to be brave and come up and land on

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.539 
had to be brave and come up and land on
me

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:48.810 

you're<00:01:37.060> gonna<00:01:37.210> go<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.450> my<00:01:37.659> arm

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.550 

things<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:50.000> notice<00:01:50.330> is<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.750> birds<00:01:50.990> were

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
things I notice is that the birds were

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.310 
things I notice is that the birds were
quite<00:01:51.860> sharp<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.640> often<00:01:53.630> got<00:01:53.750> into<00:01:53.990> arguments

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
quite sharp I often got into arguments

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.469 
quite sharp I often got into arguments
over<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.860> food<00:01:55.159> there's<00:01:55.850> always<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.270> bigger

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
over the food there's always the bigger

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.200 
over the food there's always the bigger
stronger<00:01:57.440> and<00:01:57.710> better<00:01:58.280> looking<00:01:58.729> birds<00:01:58.970> that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
stronger and better looking birds that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.990 
stronger and better looking birds that
seem<00:01:59.450> to<00:01:59.570> win<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.869> arguments<00:02:00.380> at<00:02:01.159> times<00:02:01.520> like

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
seem to win the arguments at times like

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.700 
seem to win the arguments at times like
this<00:02:02.210> I<00:02:02.479> had<00:02:02.659> two<00:02:02.900> birds<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.440> my<00:02:03.680> arm<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.130> time

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
this I had two birds on my arm at a time

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.680 
this I had two birds on my arm at a time
kept<00:02:06.710> flying<00:02:07.009> up<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.520> me<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:08.060> seems<00:02:08.390> like<00:02:08.569> I

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
kept flying up on me and it seems like I

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.800 
kept flying up on me and it seems like I
was<00:02:08.720> never<00:02:08.989> without<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.789> bird<00:02:10.789> on<00:02:11.090> my<00:02:11.120> arm<00:02:11.480> and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
was never without a bird on my arm and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.130 
was never without a bird on my arm and
it<00:02:11.989> couldn't<00:02:12.230> be<00:02:12.319> left<00:02:12.500> alone<00:02:12.739> for<00:02:13.010> too<00:02:13.220> long

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
it couldn't be left alone for too long

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.990 
it couldn't be left alone for too long
so<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.200> just<00:02:15.410> sat<00:02:15.590> down<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.310> bench<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.940> just

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
so I just sat down on the bench and just

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.720 
so I just sat down on the bench and just
tried<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.480> relax<00:02:18.459> occasionally<00:02:19.459> would<00:02:19.550> walk

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
tried to relax occasionally would walk

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940 
tried to relax occasionally would walk
over<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> tree<00:02:20.510> which<00:02:21.410> would<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.709> full<00:02:21.920> of

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
over to a tree which would be full of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.190 
over to a tree which would be full of
cockys<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.790> offer<00:02:23.180> them<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.510> bit<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.810> eat<00:02:23.959> they

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
cockys and offer them a bit to eat they

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.860

were<00:02:24.260> very<00:02:24.530> friendly<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:26.300> didn't<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.720> any

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
were very friendly and didn't have any

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.850 
were very friendly and didn't have any
problem<00:02:27.350> with<00:02:27.590> me<00:02:28.310> handing<00:02:28.700> them<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.060> food

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.380 

as<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:33.980> looked<00:02:34.190> around<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.670> other<00:02:34.790> trees<00:02:35.150> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
as I looked around to the other trees I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.759 
as I looked around to the other trees I
could<00:02:35.540> see<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.959> cockys<00:02:36.380> were<00:02:36.500> very

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
could see that the cockys were very

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.759 
could see that the cockys were very
playful<00:02:37.570> they<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:38.930> there<00:02:39.140> swinging<00:02:39.650> from

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
playful they just be there swinging from
