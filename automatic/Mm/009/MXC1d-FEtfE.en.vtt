00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:13.889
 is the most is a recipe that has all the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.740
 practically all or should be 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.740
 have in all brazilian bars or 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 Be it is not complicated but make the eyes 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 It's not that simple 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 looks easy but it's not the mass of the eyes 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.010
 it's true the dough cooked in the pan 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 before it ends in the fry 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.399
 start by putting a cup in a pan 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
 50 grams of butter and leave the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 butter melt 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 This recipe is incredible. 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.050
 people searched a lot and she does 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.949
 exactly the eyes that we like 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 which is the risoles with plenty of filling and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 a little crunchy and good dough 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 wet because I hate eyes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.909
 hard dough that the dough is almost raw 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.909
 inside and when it is full dry 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.289
 that sadness when milk get 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:31.479
 turn off the fire and add a 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:33.609
 cup of wheat flour and mix with 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.670
 a wooden spoon and here comes another question 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.679
 always say that the point of mass when 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.479
 pan unsalted 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.939
 I'm just using a pan 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:47.409
 nonsense she was not giving much anymore 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:53.140
 time then this point for me is not a 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:56.020
 day I leave the 15 minutes there until leaving 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.630
 well that smell of flour 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.959
 raw and moving to the floor 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.890
 forming ball and going by 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.509
 every pot over low heat until 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.899
 turn the fire on again had not forgotten 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.120
 to tie it then make a flour and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.930
 stirred the fire again because it wants to 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.930
 flour will cook 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.770
 thing that does that part 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.010
 You're going to ovar the dough is very important. 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.800
 and it is this great difference of mass 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.750
 because we already did another kind of 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.420
 with that same March revenue only that the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.330
 I'm not and put it straight to 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.350
 cool then it gets brittle 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:47.930
 why why why it is to develop 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.570
 group exactly how many did she club 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.550
 will develop so it will get more 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.180
 will be much better for 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.870
 after working mass 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.170
 she'll be hot but we are 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.519
 cooks with calloused hands and not 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.610
 it matters 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.920
 in it the one you are moving forward but the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.070
 Our hot fight was to steal people. 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:17.620
 follow the same thing 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:22.790
 yes it had the same mass of thigh 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.519
 even full of pussy also exactly 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.030
 saves but she looks good, makes a 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:33.860
 ball and film and in the refrigerator or not 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.290
 need that way left out 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.390
 giving a rest while doing the eng 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.239
 and if I found it basic that's fine 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.310
 like which recipe I 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.930
 it strange because it is very similar to the 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.780
 standard filling just not put 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:53.870
 cinnamon but it's basically the same idea 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.850
 some good onion wheels add 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 to gift chopped 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.920
 the accused a weight of shredded chicken 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.480
 This want to learn shell chicken do 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.480
 a broth here 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.290
 in my taco the braised taco in the chicken 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:13.620
 shredded and added a can of tomato 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.450
 peeled and also adds a pepper 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.600
 finger here I'm using with 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.359
 seeds made so no problem 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.419
 I'll add the broth and find 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.360
 cooking a little tomato and all 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.610
 world was a pretty eye when 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.590
 franco, it's already old and the sauce 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.250
 have thicker season with salt 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.620
 and then makes a mixture of 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.669
 potato starch and milk fair play a 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.340
 Goal ash also used in corn starch 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.669
 here I am using a teaspoon to 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.370
 two teaspoons of milk mixture and 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:59.880
 put in the pan to finish put 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:05:01.410
 quite its very meaning 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.169
 important that it is cold to be able to 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.210
 close your eyes and saw the recipe said 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.830
 It seems simple but it needs to be very 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.849
 love and eager to eat with 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.740
 eyes take the dough open it with a roll 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.560
 in flour well the workbench does not have 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.940
 problem in flour and then you get the 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:29.310
 size of reservations and have the eyes I 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:30.599
 I'm using a rabbit that is caught in the 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.419
 hands-on 

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.120
 boot a little of the stuffing did not enter 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:39.180
 little stuffing and then it's just 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.800
 press the bordinha that glue is 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.199
 some difficulty may pass a little 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.120
 of water on the edge but has not yet 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.120
 and then just press 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.889
 there is something else there are other things 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:59.250
 various ways to deface the episode 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.229
 we did with an egg and company in 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.349
 high cassava flour 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.430
 the egg thread flour and water and flour 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:10.110
 screw thread 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.990
 so with the egg it forms a layer one 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.449
 with a larger tie and with the 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.000
 water becomes a phishing technique and 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.800
 and crispy we loved this 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:30.360
 secret of talking to the water and with a 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:32.069
 to cassava flour from or to 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.729
 pass in the water and then pass through the flour 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:39.599
 threaded and made quite look I could 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:42.210
 see are until golden on both sides 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:44.190
 pretty handsome is turning them in front of 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:47.210
 few the canal was too large for not 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.909
 to lower the temperature too much it does not 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:54.509
 full of incredible fat recipe 

00:06:50.909 --> 00:07:00.620
 Incredible incredible incredible is not equal to 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:07:07.400
 another kick on duty but it's so good 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:07.400
 then tests at home and then with us 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.930
 and writing
