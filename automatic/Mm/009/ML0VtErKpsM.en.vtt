00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 in particular the aunt around 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.329
 guys these colors can be if 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.129
 can be applied on the sentono 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.110
 but also on other vehicles so there is no 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 worry if you don't have your surroundings but 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.250
 I think they are fine on the axis 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.650
 around but not better they feel beautiful 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.540
 girls start over and if these colors 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.000
 you like me saw me immediately leave a 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.010
 nice video and the guys we see each other in 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 end video indeed I will always be the one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.410
 who spoke he had then oh well let's leave 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 to stay 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 let's start with the video right away 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.960
 any santos custom is once 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 that you are on the poor balance you have to 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 go on painting you have to go on 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.500
 metallic and you have to put it like 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 main coloring black 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.710
 after which he must make the choices super 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.929
 and you have to put lime green 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.389
 I recommend the bertelÃ  nor but you can 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:22.889
 put any other green color 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:25.200
 but the green rai 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:27.030
 in short, it's cooler the car becomes 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.069
 more pussy I do n't know for those who love it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.079
 afterwards as a secondary color you have to 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:32.909
 also put the lime green and like 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.090
 color to the wheels green rai 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.079
 so all lime green lemon ok 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.249
 never mind 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.679
 and in any case the result is kids 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.149
 this is what the car really is 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.929
 awesome because it's really a lot but 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.549
 very cool there is a color that 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.170
 mirrors and black but then as a background 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.100
 also holds a funny species is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.069
 best 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.569
 I like to stay definitely then I don't know 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.340
 to you 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.009
 so guys this is the first color 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.829
 now let's move on to the second color like 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.529
 according to colors I found this purple 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.020
 this violet, however, that is intertwined with 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:09.869
 three blue that really becomes a thing 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.800
 only thing cool because blue andrea 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.990
 let's say highlight 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.570
 in the curves in the car instead of two the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 room is the color of the car guys me 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.970
 really like this color so much 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.290
 I don't know why but he asked me for a bang 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.940
 sincerely repeats I don't know why but 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.790
 it is however a unique color 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.620
 let's immediately see how it is created 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.660
 this color first of all you have to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.610
 go on metallic paint and 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.660
 you have to put light purple with me 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.490
 main color 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.160
 after which he had to go to pearlescent 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.210
 emit deep blue not for this the 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.010
 blue that reflects the curves and then you have to 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.870
 go on secondary coloring and 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.030
 you have to put light purple 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.640
 again so as to give a single color 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.380
 to the car and after like the colors of the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.990
 car rims you have to put the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.390
 purple charter that is not called purple 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.700
 clear but always purple like that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.440
 via that the clear one is however the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.780
 result will be like this 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.410
 really did show something first 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.480
 only 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.790
 now let's move on to the third color here 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.520
 here this is the sort of red but yes 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.450
 called purple and I don't understand why but it is 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480
 red 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.120
 I don't really know this color is unique 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
 since I have a red that intertwines 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.610
 he too with pink 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.959
 I don't know how it looks and this is spectacular 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.850
 color according to me 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.380
 we begin to create this color you have to 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.860
 go state shook put like 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.030
 main coloring the purple which 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.040
 the species of red, however, is called 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.520
 purple I do not know why oh well it's called 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.440
 door 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.180
 let's say that after he has to tend on 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.750
 pearlescent and you have to put it like 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.760
 pearlescent pink and pink that will go 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.110
 we say to change intonation to 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.989
 purple that will be less so 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.970
 red but not so much pink and then how 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.950
 secondary color you have to put the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.660
 red formula so let's say to enter 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.430
 both in the categories of purple in both 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.860
 in the rose category 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.020
 and so it mixes a little more and changes 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.970
 also shades a little to the car and instead 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.290
 as coloring of red circles 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.850
 caramelized 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.380
 this will be the result of the car 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.239
 what you have seen before 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.790
 practically well we move to the fourth e 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.320
 last coloring you have to go up 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.130
 metallic put the color 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.169
 main as deep blue is already of 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.720
 its the color is so cool then you have to 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.450
 go on pearlescent and you never have to 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.610
 the ice white to reflect 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.800
 to light up more 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.360
 let's say the car's curves and after that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.860
 you have to go to the secondary color e 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.570
 you have to put blue again 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.350
 deep to give a single color 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.020
 instead of the car as the color of the wheels 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.460
 you have to put bright blues on this one 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.650
 dot guys the result will be this e 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.770
 I think this is the coolest color 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.110
 according to me because you will also see of 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.420
