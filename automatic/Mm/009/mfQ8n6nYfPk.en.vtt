test<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.170> cosmetic<00:02:37.130> at<00:02:37.400> all<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> I'm<00:02:38.870> thinking

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
test the cosmetic at all so I'm thinking

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.940 
test the cosmetic at all so I'm thinking
right<00:02:39.850> okay<00:02:40.960> we're<00:02:41.960> putting<00:02:42.290> these<00:02:42.410> products

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
right okay we're putting these products

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.840 
right okay we're putting these products
on<00:02:43.070> our<00:02:43.160> skin<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> our<00:02:44.930> skin<00:02:45.350> is<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.800> largest

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
on our skin and our skin is the largest

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.000 
on our skin and our skin is the largest
organ<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:47.060> our<00:02:47.420> body<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:48.020> whatever<00:02:48.410> we<00:02:48.590> put<00:02:48.830> on

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
organ of our body so whatever we put on

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.280 
organ of our body so whatever we put on
it<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.460> just<00:02:49.520> absorbs<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.990> particular

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
it it just absorbs that particular

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.780 
it it just absorbs that particular
product<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:53.030> I'm<00:02:53.120> thinking<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:55.250> put<00:02:55.490> this<00:02:55.520> on

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
product so I'm thinking if I put this on

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.320 
product so I'm thinking if I put this on
my<00:02:56.000> skin<00:02:56.450> and<00:02:56.950> this<00:02:57.950> product<00:02:58.400> has<00:02:58.610> toxic
