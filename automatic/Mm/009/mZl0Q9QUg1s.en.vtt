that enchilada sauce now you might have

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.290 
that enchilada sauce now you might have
thought<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.640> sauce<00:05:37.820> was<00:05:38.000> going<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.180> make

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
thought that the sauce was going to make

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.320 
thought that the sauce was going to make
it<00:05:38.420> too<00:05:38.690> juicy<00:05:39.310> but<00:05:40.310> remember<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.670> corn<00:05:41.000> tamale

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
it too juicy but remember a corn tamale

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.860 
it too juicy but remember a corn tamale
is<00:05:42.190> typically<00:05:43.190> soft<00:05:43.640> as<00:05:43.970> well<00:05:44.180> kind<00:05:44.660> of<00:05:44.750> a

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
is typically soft as well kind of a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.800 
is typically soft as well kind of a
creamy<00:05:45.230> texture<00:05:45.650> so<00:05:46.340> this<00:05:46.910> extra<00:05:47.390> sauce<00:05:47.570> or

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
creamy texture so this extra sauce or

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.270 
creamy texture so this extra sauce or
the<00:05:47.870> chicken<00:05:48.080> will<00:05:48.320> permeate<00:05:48.770> down<00:05:49.010> in<00:05:49.160> that

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
the chicken will permeate down in that

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.520 
the chicken will permeate down in that
cornbread<00:05:49.669> to<00:05:50.390> better<00:05:50.660> approximate<00:05:51.080> the

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
cornbread to better approximate the

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.200 
cornbread to better approximate the
texture<00:05:51.980> of<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.310> tamales<00:05:52.700> that<00:05:52.730> we're<00:05:53.000> trying

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
texture of the tamales that we're trying

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.360 
texture of the tamales that we're trying
to<00:05:53.390> make<00:05:53.540> so<00:05:54.440> it's<00:05:54.650> going<00:05:54.770> to<00:05:54.860> be<00:05:54.919> fine

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
to make so it's going to be fine

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.030 
to make so it's going to be fine
so<00:05:55.850> also<00:05:56.360> having<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.110> corn<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.560> beans<00:05:57.590> in

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
so also having the corn and the beans in

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.060 
so also having the corn and the beans in
between

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
between

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.460 
between
from<00:05:59.640> it<00:06:00.180> allows<00:06:00.660> the<00:06:00.900> cornbread<00:06:01.230> to<00:06:01.320> get

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
from it allows the cornbread to get

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.940 
from it allows the cornbread to get
juicier<00:06:02.040> but<00:06:02.730> not<00:06:02.940> all<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:03.570> out<00:06:03.720> mushy<00:06:04.530> okay

juicier but not all and out mushy okay

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.740 
juicier but not all and out mushy okay
because<00:06:05.040> we<00:06:05.160> don't<00:06:05.280> want<00:06:05.400> that<00:06:05.490> either<00:06:05.750> then
