powder<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.509> let's<00:01:45.689> try<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:45.960> out<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
powder so let's try this out so if I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.050 
powder so let's try this out so if I
fire<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.659> cow<00:01:49.490> didn't<00:01:50.490> quite<00:01:50.579> work<00:01:50.790> it's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
fire it that cow didn't quite work it's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.899 
fire it that cow didn't quite work it's

gold<00:02:29.690> ingots<00:02:30.050> testing<00:02:30.440> out<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.710> this<00:02:30.830> slime

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
gold ingots testing out on this slime

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.510 
gold ingots testing out on this slime
that's<00:02:33.620> pretty<00:02:33.830> cool<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.100> like<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.220> shotgun

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
we'll go test this out on a creep test

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.030 
we'll go test this out on a creep test
down<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.070> slime<00:02:49.370> over<00:02:49.670> here<00:02:51.820> Boosh<00:02:54.040> that

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
down this slime over here Boosh that

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.540 
leave that your piston and you to iron
ingots<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.980> let's<00:03:46.130> test<00:03:46.340> this<00:03:46.430> bad<00:03:46.580> boy<00:03:46.640> out

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
ingots so let's test this bad boy out

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.380 
ingots so let's test this bad boy out
previous<00:03:49.550> destruction<00:03:50.030> with<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.180> rocket

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
little SMG yeah quite like that and then

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.500 
little SMG yeah quite like that and then
the<00:04:01.190> next<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.489> we<00:04:01.610> have<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.030> Obsidian
