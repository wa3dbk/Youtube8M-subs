00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I do not like T18 for many reasons. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 First of all, he has a very strong armor. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Some tanks even with gold even have problems to break through. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Secondly, it is very fast. He can easily take the hill at Mines. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 Thirdly, it has two great works to choose from. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Either 64/45 or howitzer 38/175. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 A howitzer can take off most of the tanks he fights at once. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 It's the KV-1S of the second tier. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 They play it or monkeys who heard that the tank is OP (and it is) ... 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 ... and they think that by playing it they will suddenly get a skill and start winning. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 And you, man, get tired, for example T1E6, because even nooba must be killed, and it is not easy. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Either green and blue want to roll on low tiers, and then you have broken up. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Something broke on the hardware after installation 0.8.8. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 In each of the previous versions of the client, and I have all from 0.7.2 up ... 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 ... when entering the sniper view the viewfinder is off the screen. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 I do not know how to solve it. Maybe it will help uninstalling 0.8.8, but I do not want to do it. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Meanwhile, we see an old friend, kubakabana90 ... 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 ... which trolls on low tiers. Let's troll. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
