the mistakes they make early on is they

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.949 
the mistakes they make early on is they
put<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.700> ice<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.209> bigger<00:03:12.360> bag<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.870> then

trial-and-error we have discovered it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.339 
trial-and-error we have discovered it's
just<00:03:19.380> easier<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.630> go<00:03:21.630> ahead<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.140> put<00:03:22.260> the

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
just easier to go ahead and put the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.110 
really icy you know it's not as do you
get<00:05:40.860> a<00:05:40.890> bit<00:05:41.100> of<00:05:41.190> a<00:05:41.280> vanilla<00:05:41.580> taste<00:05:41.880> to<00:05:42.090> it

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
get a bit of a vanilla taste to it

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.880 
get a bit of a vanilla taste to it
because<00:05:42.450> yeah<00:05:42.660> we<00:05:42.870> added<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.380> vanilla<00:05:43.680> that's

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
because yeah we added the vanilla that's

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.320 
because yeah we added the vanilla that's
not<00:05:44.190> really<00:05:44.400> in<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.520> recipe<00:05:44.910> that<00:05:45.060> was<00:05:45.180> our

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
not really in the recipe that was our

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.650 
not really in the recipe that was our
deal

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
deal

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:55.160 
deal
yeah<00:05:45.840> I<00:05:45.870> think<00:05:46.020> we<00:05:46.320> had<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:53.960> little<00:05:54.960> bit<00:05:55.110> more

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
yeah I think we had a little bit more

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.680 
yeah I think we had a little bit more
Mountain<00:05:55.560> Dew<00:05:55.650> yeah<00:05:55.950> if<00:05:56.310> we<00:05:57.000> have<00:05:57.270> more<00:05:57.480> time

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
Mountain Dew yeah if we have more time

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.690 
Mountain Dew yeah if we have more time
to<00:05:57.870> make<00:05:57.930> it<00:05:58.290> that<00:05:59.160> would<00:05:59.310> have<00:05:59.400> been<00:05:59.490> the<00:05:59.580> way

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
to make it that would have been the way

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.060 
to make it that would have been the way
to<00:05:59.760> do<00:05:59.970> it<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.270> if<00:06:01.230> you<00:06:01.410> leave<00:06:01.620> the<00:06:01.770> Mountain

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
to do it and if you leave the Mountain

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.250 
to do it and if you leave the Mountain
Dew<00:06:02.220> out<00:06:02.430> if<00:06:02.850> you<00:06:03.060> just<00:06:03.090> put<00:06:03.480> the<00:06:03.510> vanilla<00:06:03.810> and

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
Dew out if you just put the vanilla and

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.770 
Dew out if you just put the vanilla and
the<00:06:04.350> sugar<00:06:04.620> in<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.640> mixing<00:06:06.060> time<00:06:06.240> is<00:06:06.420> really<00:06:06.660> a

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
the sugar in the mixing time is really a

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.780 
the sugar in the mixing time is really a
lot<00:06:07.290> shorter<00:06:07.590> it's<00:06:07.890> about<00:06:08.010> four<00:06:08.370> minutes<00:06:08.580> of

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:08.790 
lot shorter it's about four minutes of

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.580 
lot shorter it's about four minutes of
you<00:06:08.910> shaking<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.450> but<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.720> Mountain<00:06:10.260> Dew<00:06:10.380> made

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
you shaking it but the Mountain Dew made

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.800 
you shaking it but the Mountain Dew made
it<00:06:10.740> made<00:06:11.610> us<00:06:11.760> shake<00:06:11.970> it<00:06:12.090> for<00:06:12.240> like<00:06:12.360> an<00:06:12.510> extra

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
it made us shake it for like an extra

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.910 
it made us shake it for like an extra
three<00:06:13.050> or<00:06:13.140> four<00:06:13.320> minutes<00:06:13.590> for<00:06:13.770> whatever

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
three or four minutes for whatever

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.400 
three or four minutes for whatever
reason<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.430> creates<00:06:14.790> more<00:06:14.970> work<00:06:15.210> alright

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
reason that creates more work alright

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.110 
reason that creates more work alright
