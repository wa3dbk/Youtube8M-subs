00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
using a submersible pump however is the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
using a submersible pump however is the
entire<00:00:39.450> thing<00:00:39.809> does<00:00:40.110> actually<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.829> into<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
entire thing does actually go into the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
entire thing does actually go into the
tank<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:42.030> means<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.540> every<00:00:42.930> little<00:00:43.079> bit<00:00:43.350> of

tank that means that every little bit of
heat<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> pump<00:00:44.370> produces<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
heat that the pump produces is going to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.709 
heat that the pump produces is going to
be<00:00:45.989> dispersed<00:00:46.500> into<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.980> tank<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:48.120> compiled

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
be dispersed into the tank this compiled

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.540 
be dispersed into the tank this compiled
with<00:00:49.050> some<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.649> other<00:00:49.800> equipment<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.309> tank

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
with some of the other equipment of tank

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
with some of the other equipment of tank
could<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> difference<00:00:51.719> between<00:00:51.809> having

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
could be the difference between having

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
could be the difference between having
to<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> chiller<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:54.090> being<00:00:54.300> able<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
to have a chiller or just being able to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.779 
to have a chiller or just being able to
cool<00:00:54.750> your<00:00:54.930> tank<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.379> fans<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.980> personally

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
cool your tank with fans I personally

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
cool your tank with fans I personally
try<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> avoid<00:00:57.449> using<00:00:57.750> chillers<00:00:58.320> whenever

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
try to avoid using chillers whenever

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.590 
try to avoid using chillers whenever
possible<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.670> they're<00:00:59.850> expensive<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
possible because they're expensive to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290 
possible because they're expensive to
purchase<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.289> well<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.649> operate<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.399> frankly

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
purchase as well as operate and frankly

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.090 
purchase as well as operate and frankly
they're<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.080> piece<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.409> equipment

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
they're just one more piece of equipment

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.160 
they're just one more piece of equipment
that<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.369> fail<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.000> system<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.990> how<00:01:07.110> does

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that can fail on my system so how does

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
that can fail on my system so how does
an<00:01:07.350> external<00:01:07.830> pump<00:01:08.040> any<00:01:08.250> different<00:01:08.640> well

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
an external pump any different well

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
an external pump any different well
there's<00:01:09.630> three<00:01:09.840> major<00:01:10.080> differences<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
there's three major differences the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609 
there's three major differences the
first<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.060> obviously<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.960> pump<00:01:13.380> motor

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
first one is obviously the pump motor

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
first one is obviously the pump motor
isn't<00:01:14.070> inside<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.909> tank<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> vast<00:01:16.110> majority

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
isn't inside the tank so a vast majority

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.740 
isn't inside the tank so a vast majority
of<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> heat<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.549> produced<00:01:18.030> by<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.420> motor

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
of the heat that's produced by the motor

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.289 
of the heat that's produced by the motor
will<00:01:19.380> disperse<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> air<00:01:20.520> rather<00:01:21.119> than

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
will disperse into the air rather than

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.870 
will disperse into the air rather than
into<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.840> tank<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.860> motor<00:01:23.070> casing<00:01:23.400> on

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
into your tank the motor casing on

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
into your tank the motor casing on
external<00:01:24.540> pumps<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> japanese'<00:01:25.799> walky

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
external pumps like this japanese' walky

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.880 
external pumps like this japanese' walky
are<00:01:26.580> typically<00:01:27.240> made<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> aluminum<00:01:28.200> which

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
are typically made out of aluminum which

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.280 
are typically made out of aluminum which
conducts<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.820> disperses<00:01:30.479> heat<00:01:30.720> much<00:01:31.020> better

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
conducts and disperses heat much better

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.039 
conducts and disperses heat much better
than<00:01:31.560> plastic<00:01:32.130> they<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:32.759> have<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> fan<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
than plastic they also have a fan on the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.679 
than plastic they also have a fan on the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
back to disperse the heat the result is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
back to disperse the heat the result is
a<00:01:36.720> very<00:01:36.990> cool<00:01:37.290> running<00:01:37.710> pump<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.280> fact<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a very cool running pump in fact it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.330 
a very cool running pump in fact it's
just<00:01:39.600> barely<00:01:39.900> warmed<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.650> touch<00:01:40.890> while<00:01:41.189> in

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just barely warmed the touch while in

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.149 
just barely warmed the touch while in
operation<00:01:41.960> lastly<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> good<00:01:43.409> external<00:01:43.920> pump

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
operation lastly on a good external pump

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.700 
operation lastly on a good external pump
we're<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:45.840> robust<00:01:46.409> head

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
we're going to have a very robust head

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.609 
we're going to have a very robust head
this<00:01:47.340> one's<00:01:47.640> actually<00:01:47.970> bolted<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
this one's actually bolted on this is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380 
this one's actually bolted on this is
pretty<00:01:49.829> important<00:01:50.340> because<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.970> pump<00:01:51.210> is

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
pretty important because the pump is

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.840 
pretty important because the pump is
going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.229> run<00:01:52.439> externally<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.670> don't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
going to be run externally and we don't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
want to have any cracks or leaks so it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
want to have any cracks or leaks so it's
pretty<00:01:56.399> easy<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.880> say<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.600> brand<00:01:57.960> or

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
pretty easy to say that one brand or

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
pretty easy to say that one brand or
type<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.680> pump<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.130> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> add<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.820> heat

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
type of pump is going to add more heat

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.969 
type of pump is going to add more heat
to<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> tank<00:02:00.540> than<00:02:00.750> another<00:02:01.049> however<00:02:01.740> I

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
to the tank than another however I

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.100 
to the tank than another however I
wanted<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> demonstrate<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:03.329> big<00:02:03.570> an<00:02:03.689> impact

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
wanted to demonstrate how big an impact

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.859 
wanted to demonstrate how big an impact
this<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.850> took<00:02:06.030> two<00:02:06.540> twelve

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
this really can be so we took two twelve

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.839 
this really can be so we took two twelve
hundred<00:02:07.049> gallon<00:02:07.439> per<00:02:07.560> hour<00:02:07.590> pump<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.489> we

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
hundred gallon per hour pump and we

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.699 
hundred gallon per hour pump and we
added<00:02:09.179> them<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.509> separate<00:02:10.020> five-gallon

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
added them to separate five-gallon

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.730 
added them to separate five-gallon
buckets<00:02:11.129> full<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.640> 79<00:02:12.390> degree<00:02:12.780> water<00:02:13.020> for

three hours in that three hours the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.260 
three hours in that three hours the
Iraqi<00:02:16.770> raised<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> temperature<00:02:17.580> about<00:02:17.850> seven

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
Iraqi raised the temperature about seven

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.080 
Iraqi raised the temperature about seven
degrees<00:02:18.590> whereas<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.860> submersible<00:02:20.820> mag

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
degrees whereas the submersible mag

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.990

rising<00:02:24.630> as<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.500> can<00:02:25.620> see<00:02:25.800> there's<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.100> pretty

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
rising as you can see there's a pretty

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.490 
rising as you can see there's a pretty
substantial<00:02:26.490> difference<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.080> some<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
substantial difference so some of you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.350 
substantial difference so some of you
are<00:02:28.590> probably<00:02:28.740> saying<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> yourself<00:02:29.370> well<00:02:30.210> the

are probably saying to yourself well the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
are probably saying to yourself well the

mag drive is an external pump as well

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.990 
mag drive is an external pump as well
isn't<00:02:32.610> it

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
isn't it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.720 
isn't it
what<00:02:33.690> kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.110> people<00:02:34.830> certainly<00:02:35.190> use<00:02:35.430> them

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
what kind of people certainly use them

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.210 
what kind of people certainly use them
as<00:02:36.030> external<00:02:36.660> pumps<00:02:36.990> all<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> time<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:38.040> does

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
as external pumps all the time it does

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.070 
as external pumps all the time it does
say<00:02:38.490> on<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.760> package<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.840> used

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
say on the package that it can be used

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.350 
say on the package that it can be used
that<00:02:40.260> way<00:02:40.320> however<00:02:41.310> what<00:02:41.640> I'd<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.150> call

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that way however what I'd like to call

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.080 
that way however what I'd like to call
it<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.720> submersible<00:02:43.500> pump<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:44.580> can<00:02:44.850> be

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it is a submersible pump that can be

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.720 
it is a submersible pump that can be
used<00:02:45.450> as<00:02:45.510> an<00:02:45.570> external<00:02:45.960> pump<00:02:46.350> if<00:02:46.620> need<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
used as an external pump if need be the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.490 
used as an external pump if need be the
reason<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.150> say<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.660> because<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.170> believe

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
reason I say that is because I believe

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.200 
reason I say that is because I believe
it's<00:02:49.680> missing<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> three<00:02:50.430> things<00:02:50.670> that<00:02:50.910> make

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
it's missing the three things that make

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.660 
it's missing the three things that make
a<00:02:51.240> really<00:02:51.750> good<00:02:51.900> external<00:02:52.440> pump<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.490> outer

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
a really good external pump the outer

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.730 
a really good external pump the outer
shell<00:02:54.090> on<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.600> motor<00:02:54.840> is<00:02:55.140> made<00:02:55.560> out<00:02:55.710> of

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
shell on the motor is made out of

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.040 
shell on the motor is made out of
plastic<00:02:56.070> rather<00:02:56.610> than<00:02:56.910> aluminum<00:02:57.390> it's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
plastic rather than aluminum it's

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.440 
plastic rather than aluminum it's
relying<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.770> passive<00:02:59.370> cooling<00:02:59.580> rather<00:03:00.150> than<00:03:00.420> a

fan and the head of the pump and seals
aren't<00:03:04.350> exactly<00:03:04.800> what<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.070> would<00:03:05.280> call<00:03:05.430> robust

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
aren't exactly what I would call robust

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.080 
aren't exactly what I would call robust
in<00:03:06.380> fact<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> set<00:03:08.640> this<00:03:08.790> one<00:03:08.850> up

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
in fact I was going to set this one up

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.090 
in fact I was going to set this one up
externally<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.020> run<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.320> same<00:03:10.560> heat<00:03:10.830> test

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
externally and run the same heat test

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.250 
externally and run the same heat test
however<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.270> I<00:03:12.300> was<00:03:12.480> screwing<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.960> fitting

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
however when I was screwing the fitting

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.800 
however when I was screwing the fitting
in<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.680> screwed<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.160> in<00:03:14.280> too<00:03:14.460> far<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.450> crack

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
in I screwed it in too far and I crack

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660 
in I screwed it in too far and I crack
the<00:03:15.840> pump<00:03:16.320> head<00:03:16.560> all<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:16.890> way<00:03:16.920> down<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.430> side

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
the pump head all the way down the side

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.510 
the pump head all the way down the side
this<00:03:18.480> would<00:03:18.660> be<00:03:18.750> virtually<00:03:18.990> impossible<00:03:19.520> with

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
this would be virtually impossible with

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.630 
this would be virtually impossible with
most<00:03:20.790> quality<00:03:21.390> external<00:03:22.230> only<00:03:22.560> pumps<00:03:22.950> so

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
most quality external only pumps so

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.490 
most quality external only pumps so
which<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.030> should<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.330> choose<00:03:24.360> well<00:03:25.350> there

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
which one should you choose well there

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
which one should you choose well there
isn't<00:03:25.590> really<00:03:25.800> a<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.190> or<00:03:26.340> wrong<00:03:26.370> answer

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
isn't really a right or wrong answer

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.640 
isn't really a right or wrong answer
here<00:03:27.150> because<00:03:27.300> both<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.840> them<00:03:28.170> have<00:03:28.230> been
