00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
not a great sight he might have been the

not a great sight he might have been the
one<00:00:38.950> delivering<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.580> blow<00:00:39.790> but<00:00:40.780> as<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:40.990> person

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
one delivering the blow but as a person

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.020 
one delivering the blow but as a person
you<00:00:41.650> just<00:00:41.680> don't<00:00:42.160> want<00:00:42.370> to<00:00:42.490> see<00:00:42.670> that<00:00:42.850> happen

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
you just don't want to see that happen

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.260 
you just don't want to see that happen
to<00:00:43.240> a<00:00:43.420> batsman<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:45.190> one<00:00:45.400> to<00:00:45.820> get<00:00:45.970> away<00:00:46.210> from

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
to a batsman first one to get away from

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.790 
to a batsman first one to get away from
the<00:00:46.660> action

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.550 

yeah<00:00:52.400> you're<00:00:52.610> right<00:00:52.760> it's<00:00:52.970> it's<00:00:53.630> a<00:00:53.810> nasty<00:00:54.320> blow

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
yeah you're right it's it's a nasty blow

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.640 
yeah you're right it's it's a nasty blow
and<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.820> think<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.180> got<00:00:56.540> him<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:57.170> that<00:00:57.350> gap

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
and I think it got him in that gap

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.550 
and I think it got him in that gap
between<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.000> eye<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.470> and<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.910> nose

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:02.560 
between the eye and and the nose

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.930 
between the eye and and the nose
possibly<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.710> cheekbone<00:01:04.220> I'm<00:01:04.339> not<00:01:04.520> too<00:01:04.699> sure

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
possibly the cheekbone I'm not too sure

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.390 
possibly the cheekbone I'm not too sure
but<00:01:04.970> it<00:01:05.510> was<00:01:05.690> the<00:01:05.810> third<00:01:06.140> bouncer<00:01:06.770> from<00:01:06.950> Lasith

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
but it was the third bouncer from Lasith

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.420 
but it was the third bouncer from Lasith
Malinga<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.120> young<00:01:08.900> Russo<00:01:09.500> obviously<00:01:10.220> was

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
Malinga and young Russo obviously was

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.270 
Malinga and young Russo obviously was
late<00:01:10.820> in<00:01:11.120> reacting<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.720> that<00:01:11.870> length<00:01:13.570> missed

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
late in reacting to that length missed

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280 
late in reacting to that length missed
it<00:01:16.280> missed<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.760> grille<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.810> helmet<00:01:18.170> as

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
well that was nasty and that's so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.620 
well that was nasty and that's so
unfortunate<00:01:25.479> it's<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:26.660> tricky<00:01:28.330> when<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.420> get

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630

unfortunate it's so tricky when you get
the<00:01:29.810> grille<00:01:30.110> in<00:01:30.320> place<00:01:30.590> because<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:32.360> tried<00:01:32.600> to

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660
