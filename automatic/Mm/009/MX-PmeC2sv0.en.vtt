hey guys today our makeup review
flabulous<00:00:12.940> unit<00:00:13.809> this<00:00:14.769> one

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
flabulous unit this one

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.529 
flabulous unit this one
but<00:00:15.419> from<00:00:15.690> hubba<00:00:16.049> King<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:17.550> before<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.420> go

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
but from hubba King and before we go

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
but from hubba King and before we go
into<00:00:18.720> what<00:00:19.109> comes<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:19.830> box<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
into what comes in this little box I

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.069 
into what comes in this little box I
will<00:00:21.090> say<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.140> s<00:00:23.060> unit<00:00:24.079> there's

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
will say that this is the s unit there's

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.460 
will say that this is the s unit there's
two<00:00:25.380> units<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:25.980> there<00:00:26.869> the<00:00:27.869> first<00:00:28.110> one<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
two units out there the first one and

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.069 
two units out there the first one and
then<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.739> new<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.460> called

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
then the new one called

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:37.850 
then the new one called
say<00:00:31.079> QX<00:00:31.460> s<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:34.079> difference<00:00:34.610> is<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.840> X<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.739> at

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
say QX s the difference is that X and at

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.389 
say QX s the difference is that X and at
the<00:00:37.950> S<00:00:38.100> unit<00:00:39.289> can<00:00:40.289> use<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> satellite<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the S unit can use a satellite that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.490 
the S unit can use a satellite that
means<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.149> need<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.500> full-blown

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
means you don't need a full-blown

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
means you don't need a full-blown
receiver<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:45.390> actually<00:00:45.980> connect<00:00:46.980> your

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
receiver to actually connect your

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.479 
receiver to actually connect your
airplane<00:00:47.630> I<00:00:48.630> would<00:00:49.320> only<00:00:49.530> recommend<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.250> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
airplane I would only recommend that on

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.090 
airplane I would only recommend that on
like<00:00:51.120> helicopters<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> 450<00:00:52.440> or<00:00:52.800> smaller

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
like helicopters on a 450 or smaller

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
like helicopters on a 450 or smaller
than<00:00:53.310> that<00:00:53.550> if<00:00:53.790> you<00:00:53.970> go<00:00:54.120> back<00:00:54.149> bigger<00:00:54.780> than

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
than that if you go back bigger than

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
than that if you go back bigger than
that<00:00:55.200> I<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.920> still<00:00:56.130> used<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.940> full

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that I would still used the full

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
that I would still used the full
receiver<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.110> have<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> option<00:00:58.560> anyway

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
receiver but you have the option anyway

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.450 
receiver but you have the option anyway
and<00:00:59.340> also<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:00.630> software<00:01:01.140> supports<00:01:01.920> quad

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and also the new software supports quad

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.090 
and also the new software supports quad
copters<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:02.989> helicopter<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.199> airplanes

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
copters and helicopter or airplanes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.910 
copters and helicopter or airplanes
haven't<00:01:05.820> tried<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.299> yet<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:07.380> from<00:01:07.710> what

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
haven't tried that out yet but from what

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150 
I mounted it up on one of my nitrous but
just<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.270> aware<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.840> will<00:02:40.020> need<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> buy

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
just be aware that you will need to buy

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.390 
just be aware that you will need to buy
that<00:02:41.510> you<00:02:42.510> also<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.560> box<00:02:43.940> get<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:47.010> USB

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
that you also in this box get the USB

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.110 
that you also in this box get the USB
connector<00:02:48.150> which<00:02:49.160> seems<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> nice<00:02:50.730> thing

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
connector which seems like a nice thing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.960 
connector which seems like a nice thing
that<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.570> included<00:02:52.520> it's<00:02:53.520> only<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.790> few

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that this is included it's only a few

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.500 
that this is included it's only a few
bucks<00:02:54.209> but<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.650> problem<00:02:56.160> is<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:57.270> end

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
bucks but the problem is that if you end

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.920 
bucks but the problem is that if you end
up<00:02:57.660> having<00:02:57.720> more<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:59.130> these<00:02:59.400> units<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.690> also

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
up having more of these units you also

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.440 
up having more of these units you also
end<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.530> with<00:03:01.740> a<00:03:01.950> lot<00:03:02.160> of<00:03:02.280> things<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:06.150> first

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
end up with a lot of things the first

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.130 
end up with a lot of things the first
ones<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.440> bought<00:03:08.000> was<00:03:09.000> not<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.360> S<00:03:09.480> unit<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.050> I

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
ones I bought was not the S unit and I

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.800 
ones I bought was not the S unit and I
did<00:03:10.530> not<00:03:10.739> have<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.190> included<00:03:12.090> with<00:03:12.570> those

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
did not have this included with those

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.830 
did not have this included with those
but<00:03:13.170> after<00:03:13.860> that<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.040> bought<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> lot<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.700> s<00:03:15.330> units

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
but after that I bought a lot of s units

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.050 
but after that I bought a lot of s units
and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.410> now<00:03:16.890> as<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.670> three<00:03:17.880> of

button<00:04:14.970> can<00:04:15.600> be<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.750> little<00:04:15.959> difficult<00:04:16.140> to

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
button can be a little difficult to

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.650 
button can be a little difficult to
actually<00:04:16.890> touch<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.120> need<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
actually touch but you need that in the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.479 
actually touch but you need that in the
setup<00:04:18.840> period<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.709> it's<00:04:19.890> nothing<00:04:20.220> you're

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
setup period so it's nothing you're

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.380 
setup period so it's nothing you're
going<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:21.530> need<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.560> new<00:04:22.830> everyday<00:04:23.100> basis<00:04:24.440> but

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
going to need a new everyday basis but

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.740 
going to need a new everyday basis but
the<00:04:27.390> thing<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:28.669> of<00:04:29.669> course<00:04:29.760> you<00:04:30.000> have<00:04:30.180> you

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
the thing is that of course you have you

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.810 
the thing is that of course you have you
have<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.380> do<00:04:31.470> not<00:04:31.560> include<00:04:31.979> in<00:04:32.100> any<00:04:32.160> CD<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.729> you

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
have you do not include in any CD so you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.190 
have you do not include in any CD so you
have<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.060> download<00:04:33.270> all<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.780> firmware<00:04:34.020> and

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
have to download all the firmware and

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.589 
have to download all the firmware and

it<00:04:36.840> changed<00:04:37.140> so<00:04:37.260> often<00:04:37.620> that

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
it changed so often that

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.340 
it changed so often that
it's<00:04:38.340> fine<00:04:38.580> with<00:04:38.790> me<00:04:38.820> that<00:04:39.120> we<00:04:39.570> have<00:04:40.110> to<00:04:40.140> do

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
it's fine with me that we have to do

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.590 
it's fine with me that we have to do
that

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
with the transmitter wouldn't recommend

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.230

that<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:56.880> too<00:04:57.060> much<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.540> hassle

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
that that is just too much of a hassle

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.060 
that that is just too much of a hassle

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.510 
but the software itself is actually
pretty<00:05:02.670> nice<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:04.650> will<00:05:04.890> guide<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.460> through

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
pretty nice it will guide you through

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.150 
pretty nice it will guide you through
the<00:05:06.030> whole<00:05:06.180> process<00:05:06.650> if<00:05:07.650> anybody<00:05:08.070> is

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
the whole process if anybody is

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.190 
the whole process if anybody is
interesting<00:05:08.670> I<00:05:08.850> will<00:05:08.990> definitely<00:05:09.990> make<00:05:10.140> a

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
interesting I will definitely make a

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.020 
interesting I will definitely make a
little<00:05:10.410> video<00:05:10.620> showing<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.250> how<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.520> set<00:05:11.880> it

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
little video showing you how to set it

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.490 
little video showing you how to set it
up<00:05:12.150> under<00:05:12.570> in<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.170> software<00:05:14.900> some<00:05:15.900> are<00:05:16.050> some

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
up under in the software some are some

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.850 
up under in the software some are some
people<00:05:16.860> are<00:05:16.980> having<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.250> little<00:05:17.340> problem<00:05:17.640> with

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
people are having a little problem with

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.910 
people are having a little problem with
with<00:05:19.860> having<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:21.230> software<00:05:22.230> connect<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.800> the

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
with having the software connect to the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.320 
with having the software connect to the
unit<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:24.500> never<00:05:25.500> had<00:05:25.740> that<00:05:25.770> problem<00:05:26.160> so<00:05:26.730> I<00:05:27.060> don't

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
unit I never had that problem so I don't

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.780 
unit I never had that problem so I don't
know<00:05:27.420> why<00:05:29.330> but<00:05:30.770> having<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:31.890> connect<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.640> the

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
know why but having it connect with the

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.310 
know why but having it connect with the
satellite<00:05:33.300> if<00:05:33.540> you're<00:05:33.660> only<00:05:33.840> using<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
satellite if you're only using the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.760 
satellite if you're only using the
satellite<00:05:34.500> which<00:05:34.860> are<00:05:35.040> doing<00:05:35.310> one<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.520> my<00:05:35.640> 450s

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
satellite which are doing one of my 450s

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.130 
satellite which are doing one of my 450s
is<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:38.610> bit<00:05:38.850> of<00:05:38.970> a<00:05:39.090> hassle<00:05:39.270> depending<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:39.990> what

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
is a bit of a hassle depending on what

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.070 
is a bit of a hassle depending on what
kind<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.470> satellite<00:05:40.740> you're<00:05:41.040> using<00:05:41.600> but<00:05:42.600> your

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
kind of satellite you're using but your

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.230 
kind of satellite you're using but your
modern<00:05:43.350> welcome<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.860> ask<00:05:44.040> me<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.280> will<00:05:44.430> help<00:05:45.030> you

modern welcome to ask me I will help you

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.730 
modern welcome to ask me I will help you
all<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.660> can<00:05:45.960> I<00:05:46.170> have<00:05:46.350> been<00:05:46.500> playing

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
all that I can I have been playing

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.830 
all that I can I have been playing
around<00:05:47.010> with<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.220> a<00:05:47.370> little

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
around with it a little

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.440 
around with it a little
but<00:05:49.830> again<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.310> software's<00:05:50.670> are<00:05:50.880> nice<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
but again the software's are nice and

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.850 
but again the software's are nice and
you<00:05:51.570> can<00:05:51.720> update<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.170> firmware<00:05:52.380> with<00:05:52.740> the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
you can update the firmware with the

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.340 
you can update the firmware with the
software<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:56.520> you<00:05:56.940> have<00:05:57.600> to<00:05:57.810> talk<00:05:58.020> about<00:05:58.140> the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
software and you have to talk about the

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.760 
software and you have to talk about the
price<00:05:58.590> this<00:05:58.830> is<00:05:58.940> super<00:05:59.940> cheap<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.930> think<00:06:01.680> you

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
price this is super cheap I think you

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.590 
price this is super cheap I think you
can<00:06:01.890> get<00:06:02.040> about<00:06:02.130> like<00:06:02.430> four<00:06:02.820> or<00:06:02.970> five<00:06:03.210> of<00:06:03.419> these

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
can get about like four or five of these

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.490 
can get about like four or five of these
compared<00:06:04.169> to<00:06:04.380> one<00:06:04.590> beast<00:06:05.370> X<00:06:05.700> I<00:06:06.380> wouldn't<00:06:07.380> say

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
compared to one beast X I wouldn't say

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.830 
compared to one beast X I wouldn't say
it's<00:06:07.650> better<00:06:07.890> than<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.250> beast<00:06:08.430> X<00:06:08.640> I<00:06:09.090> still

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
it's better than the beast X I still

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.320 
it's better than the beast X I still
think<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:10.260> beast<00:06:10.500> X<00:06:10.800> is<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.130> little<00:06:11.610> more<00:06:14.330> what

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
think the beast X is a little more what

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.130 
think the beast X is a little more what
you<00:06:15.450> call<00:06:15.660> it<00:06:15.870> it<00:06:16.790> when<00:06:17.790> it's<00:06:17.940> windy<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.600> beast

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
you call it it when it's windy the beast

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.200 
you call it it when it's windy the beast
x<00:06:19.350> handles<00:06:19.800> to<00:06:19.919> win<00:06:20.100> better<00:06:20.370> than<00:06:20.700> this<00:06:20.850> unit

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
x handles to win better than this unit

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.120 
x handles to win better than this unit
it<00:06:21.630> might<00:06:21.840> be<00:06:21.990> some<00:06:22.200> of<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.470> settings<00:06:22.980> i

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
it might be some of the settings i

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.520 
it might be some of the settings i
haven't<00:06:23.400> played<00:06:23.490> completely<00:06:24.410> haven't<00:06:25.410> set

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
haven't played completely haven't set

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.040 
haven't played completely haven't set
them<00:06:25.680> up<00:06:25.770> completely<00:06:26.310> right<00:06:26.490> yet<00:06:26.760> there<00:06:27.630> is<00:06:27.750> a

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
them up completely right yet there is a

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.270 
them up completely right yet there is a
lot<00:06:28.290> of<00:06:28.410> settings<00:06:28.620> but<00:06:29.360> from<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.480> price<00:06:30.750> of<00:06:30.990> it

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
lot of settings but from the price of it

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.909 
lot of settings but from the price of it
it<00:06:32.280> is<00:06:32.760> definitely<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:33.600> super<00:06:34.169> unit<00:06:34.590> and<00:06:34.740> I<00:06:34.830> have

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
it is definitely a super unit and I have

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.909 
it is definitely a super unit and I have
seen<00:06:35.130> people<00:06:35.160> flying<00:06:35.730> insane<00:06:36.540> 3d<00:06:37.080> with<00:06:37.680> this

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
seen people flying insane 3d with this

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.159 
seen people flying insane 3d with this
unit<00:06:38.280> so<00:06:38.550> they<00:06:39.000> are<00:06:39.120> able<00:06:39.270> to<00:06:39.419> handle<00:06:39.720> it

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
unit so they are able to handle it

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:43.909 
unit so they are able to handle it
despite<00:06:41.100> the<00:06:41.970> low<00:06:42.120> price<00:06:42.150> tag

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
despite the low price tag

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.230 
despite the low price tag
so<00:06:44.789> is<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.919> compared<00:06:46.919> to<00:06:47.039> a<00:06:47.069> normal<00:06:47.460> gyro<00:06:47.969> of

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
so is it compared to a normal gyro of

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.239 
so is it compared to a normal gyro of
course<00:06:48.539> the<00:06:48.719> flabulous<00:06:48.990> unit<00:06:49.919> is<00:06:49.979> a<00:06:50.039> little

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:50.249 
course the flabulous unit is a little

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:53.659 
course the flabulous unit is a little
more<00:06:50.370> trickier<00:06:50.879> to<00:06:50.909> set<00:06:51.300> up<00:06:52.099> but<00:06:53.099> you<00:06:53.580> know

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
more trickier to set up but you know

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.640 
more trickier to set up but you know
that<00:06:54.120> goes<00:06:54.389> for<00:06:54.629> all<00:06:56.270> units<00:06:57.270> but<00:06:57.960> again

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
that goes for all units but again

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.369 
that goes for all units but again
compared<00:06:59.249> to<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.460> piece<00:06:59.639> Tech's<00:07:00.169> well<00:07:01.169> sure

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:01.379 
compared to the piece Tech's well sure

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.159 
compared to the piece Tech's well sure
I'm<00:07:01.499> going<00:07:01.680> to<00:07:01.770> buy<00:07:01.949> more<00:07:02.279> of<00:07:02.340> these<00:07:02.749> off<00:07:03.749> off

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
I'm going to buy more of these off off

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.540 
I'm going to buy more of these off off
the<00:07:04.229> piece<00:07:04.560> takes<00:07:04.770> I<00:07:04.949> think<00:07:05.159> I<00:07:05.249> will<00:07:05.370> stick

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
the piece takes I think I will stick

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.730 
the piece takes I think I will stick
with<00:07:05.610> these<00:07:05.909> for<00:07:06.120> a<00:07:06.180> while<00:07:06.389> and<00:07:06.870> maybe<00:07:07.259> later

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
with these for a while and maybe later

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.040 
with these for a while and maybe later
on<00:07:07.919> try<00:07:08.370> some<00:07:08.610> of<00:07:08.729> the<00:07:08.849> more<00:07:08.999> expensive<00:07:09.360> units

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
on try some of the more expensive units

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.529 
on try some of the more expensive units
like<00:07:10.949> the<00:07:11.129> new<00:07:11.249> brain<00:07:11.580> unit<00:07:11.969> that<00:07:12.060> comes<00:07:12.330> out

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:12.539 
like the new brain unit that comes out
