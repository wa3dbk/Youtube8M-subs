whether<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.489> should<00:02:21.549> go<00:02:21.909> as<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.900> film<00:02:23.170> version

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
whether I should go as the film version

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.649 
whether I should go as the film version
which<00:02:24.069> has<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.310> little<00:02:24.640> bit<00:02:24.700> more<00:02:24.760> recognizable

I'll be the Russian really hardcore and

I'll be the Russian really hardcore and

ghost game version and I kind of bottled

ghost game version and I kind of bottled
out<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.280> went<00:02:30.430> for<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.670> film<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.069> was<00:02:33.370> in

out and went for the film for I was in
I<00:02:34.379> don't<00:02:34.980> seem<00:02:35.129> to<00:02:35.159> be<00:02:35.249> getting<00:02:35.400> anywhere

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I don't seem to be getting anywhere

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.869 
I don't seem to be getting anywhere
really<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.980> might<00:02:38.370> need<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.579> go<00:02:38.700> for<00:02:38.849> a

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
really but I might need to go for a

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.479 
really but I might need to go for a
little<00:02:39.030> sit-down<00:02:39.739> one<00:02:40.739> of<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.920> things<00:02:41.159> that's

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
little sit-down one of the things that's

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.160 
little sit-down one of the things that's
a<00:02:41.639> real<00:02:41.819> struggle<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.239> game<00:02:42.450> developers<00:02:42.810> it's

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
a real struggle for game developers it's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.500 
a real struggle for game developers it's
fitting<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.159> those<00:02:44.280> assets<00:02:44.730> into<00:02:44.969> memory

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
fitting all of those assets into memory

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440 
fitting all of those assets into memory
and<00:02:45.749> onto<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.200> DVDs<00:02:46.909> what<00:02:47.909> we've<00:02:48.060> done<00:02:48.239> is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
and onto the DVDs what we've done is

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
and onto the DVDs what we've done is
developed<00:02:48.480> some<00:02:49.170> compression<00:02:49.650> routines<00:02:50.159> that

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
developed some compression routines that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.119 
developed some compression routines that
squashes<00:02:51.060> down<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.659> data<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.069> will

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
squashes down the data so that it will

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.309 
squashes down the data so that it will
fit<00:02:53.519> in<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.969> available<00:02:54.420> memory<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:55.200> we've

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
fit in the available memory and we've

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.770 
fit in the available memory and we've
done<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.709> with<00:02:56.069> animations<00:02:57.030> which<00:02:57.359> take<00:02:57.629> up

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
done this with animations which take up

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.690 
done this with animations which take up
huge<00:02:58.170> amounts<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.709> memory<00:02:58.889> uncompressed

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
huge amounts of memory uncompressed

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.909 
huge amounts of memory uncompressed
we've<00:03:00.510> done<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.719> with<00:03:00.810> textures<00:03:01.409> which<00:03:01.680> are

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
we've done it with textures which are

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.369 
we've done it with textures which are
the<00:03:02.159> sort<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.430> beautiful<00:03:03.209> pictures<00:03:03.989> that<00:03:04.019> go

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
the sort of beautiful pictures that go

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.649 
the sort of beautiful pictures that go
onto<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.829> meshes<00:03:05.159> that<00:03:05.189> we<00:03:05.430> create<00:03:05.819> in<00:03:06.120> an

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
onto the meshes that we create in an

onto the meshes that we create in an
animation<00:03:07.079> which<00:03:07.709> is<00:03:07.739> basically<00:03:08.340> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
animation which is basically the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.800 
animation which is basically the
movement<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.030> character<00:03:09.329> around<00:03:09.689> the

movement of the character around the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.809 
movement of the character around the
world<00:03:10.049> we've<00:03:10.560> managed<00:03:10.859> to<00:03:10.919> squeeze<00:03:11.430> those

world we've managed to squeeze those
down<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:12.959> 1%<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:14.069> their<00:03:14.459> original<00:03:14.669> size

out of combat drama is important and
