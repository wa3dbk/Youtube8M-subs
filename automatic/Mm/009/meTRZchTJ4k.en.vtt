don't want that strap to be falling in
front<00:01:29.020> of<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.320> weapon<00:01:29.470> in<00:01:29.770> front<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.100> lens

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
so it's great idea to have the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.380 
so it's great idea to have the
quick-release<00:01:34.330> if<00:01:35.259> we<00:01:35.440> look<00:01:35.619> at<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.979> actual

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
quick-release if we look at the actual

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.670

quick-release really easy just to plug

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.250 
quick-release really easy just to plug
it<00:01:38.830> in<00:01:38.920> like<00:01:39.190> so<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.700> then<00:01:40.330> as<00:01:40.510> I<00:01:40.720> said<00:01:40.780> with

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
it in like so and then as I said with

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.039 
it in like so and then as I said with
that<00:01:41.290> cushioning<00:01:42.070> neoprene<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.210> means<00:01:43.600> that

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
that cushioning neoprene it means that

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:45.810 
that cushioning neoprene it means that
the<00:01:44.170> thing<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.500> nice<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.130> comfortable<00:01:45.340> around

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
the thing is nice and comfortable around

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.340 
the thing is nice and comfortable around
your<00:01:46.000> neck<00:01:46.150> you've<00:01:46.510> got<00:01:46.630> that<00:01:46.750> bit<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:47.020> spring

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
your neck you've got that bit of spring

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.080 
your neck you've got that bit of spring
in<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> that<00:01:47.770> those<00:01:47.890> rigid<00:01:48.369> straps<00:01:48.670> don't<00:01:48.909> have

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
in it that those rigid straps don't have

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.429 
in it that those rigid straps don't have
so<00:01:49.270> even<00:01:49.510> when<00:01:49.630> you've<00:01:49.720> got<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.900> heavy<00:01:50.080> camera

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
so even when you've got a heavy camera

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.440 
so even when you've got a heavy camera
and<00:01:50.650> heavy<00:01:50.770> lens<00:01:51.040> this<00:01:51.580> makes<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.270> more

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
and heavy lens this makes it more

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.890 
and heavy lens this makes it more
comfortable<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:54.040> let's<00:01:54.400> have<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.580> look<00:01:54.670> at

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.259 
so there's another type of bag that I've
started<00:03:14.169> using<00:03:14.379> and<00:03:15.040> that<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.760> Lowepro

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
started using and that is the Lowepro

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.300 
started using and that is the Lowepro
slingshots<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:17.169> this<00:03:17.349> is<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.590> medium-sized

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
slingshots now this is the medium-sized

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.879 
slingshots now this is the medium-sized
slingshot<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.389> it's<00:03:19.629> similar<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.349> a<00:03:20.379> backpack

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
slingshot and it's similar to a backpack

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.009 
slingshot and it's similar to a backpack
bag<00:03:21.159> and<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:22.030> also<00:03:22.239> has<00:03:22.629> about<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.989> same

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
bag and it also has about the same

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.839 
bag and it also has about the same
amount<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.560> room<00:03:23.739> as<00:03:23.919> that<00:03:24.069> one<00:03:24.250> but<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.609> works

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
amount of room as that one but it works

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.610 
amount of room as that one but it works
slightly<00:03:25.239> differently<00:03:25.780> let<00:03:26.019> me<00:03:26.109> show<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.349> how

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
slightly differently let me show you how

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.800 
slightly differently let me show you how
basically<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:27.909> could<00:03:28.060> put<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.359> bag<00:03:28.540> over

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
basically you could put the bag over

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.289 
basically you could put the bag over
your<00:03:28.959> shoulder<00:03:29.379> like<00:03:29.409> so<00:03:29.859> and<00:03:30.579> then<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.150> bring

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
your shoulder like so and then you bring

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.140 
your shoulder like so and then you bring
the<00:03:31.480> belt<00:03:32.079> buckle<00:03:32.349> around<00:03:32.829> which<00:03:33.519> just<00:03:34.060> gives

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
the belt buckle around which just gives

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.149 
the belt buckle around which just gives
you<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.419> extra<00:03:34.569> bit<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.900> support<00:03:34.989> and<00:03:35.739> then

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
you that extra bit of support and then

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.759 
you that extra bit of support and then
you've<00:03:36.699> got<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.150> backpack<00:03:37.690> style<00:03:37.989> bag<00:03:38.290> but

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
you've got a backpack style bag but

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.619 
you've got a backpack style bag but
what's<00:03:38.949> different<00:03:39.430> about<00:03:39.489> these<00:03:39.879> is<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.510> if

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
what's different about these is that if

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.990 
what's different about these is that if
you<00:03:40.750> unbuckle<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.500> here<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.280> can<00:03:42.310> just<00:03:42.609> sling

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
you unbuckle it here you can just sling

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.879 
you unbuckle it here you can just sling
it<00:03:43.120> around<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.659> this<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.500> it<00:03:44.620> means<00:03:44.769> that

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
it around like this and it means that

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.890 
it around like this and it means that
you<00:03:45.040> can<00:03:45.190> still<00:03:45.400> access<00:03:46.090> your<00:03:46.269> camera<00:03:46.870> gear

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
you can still access your camera gear

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.839 
you can still access your camera gear
and<00:03:47.260> your<00:03:47.409> lenses<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.010> bits<00:03:48.159> and<00:03:48.340> pieces<00:03:48.519> from

and your lenses and bits and pieces from

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.939 
and your lenses and bits and pieces from
the<00:03:49.269> top<00:03:49.479> there<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.319> means<00:03:50.440> you<00:03:50.560> can<00:03:50.799> take
