00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hi, how are you? I'll talk a lot today. 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.970
 interesting is the model direction 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.320
 many people have difficulty making 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
 model direction 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.920
 It really is a little complicated to talk. 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 in this direction 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.480
 For those who do not have it, I'll go 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.750
 give some tips are not rules are 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.189
 some tips so that you can is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.220
 to direct is when they are 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.650
 Photographic models right is easier 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 photograph who is a professional model and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 yes it 's fact 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 so for those who are not very professional 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 It's good if you follow some tips 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.340
 The first tip you have to have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 what do you have to do? 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.219
 You need to search image is 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.829
 so we are a photographer and we are people 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 need to have a database of images then 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.620
 search the internet order of photos of 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 colleagues that you will have options will 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.690
 can only get the wife right on time 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 that you are directing a 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 So it's not up to you to copy the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.299
 same pose kills as his colleague did 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 from that position there you can achieve 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.680
 bring many other things 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.409
 The interesting thing is that you can pass 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.420
 trust the person who is being 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.950
 photographed for what she expects of you 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.240
 You can steer her to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.400
 can take good photos so do 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.600
 search and feed images 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.610
 Stock Photos 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.220
 so if you can do this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.650
 you can decorate some 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.110
 poses and is from these leaves 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.299
 decorated I do not know if they can transform 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.240
 they in other positions 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.700
 there is then a change of head look 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.579
 or boot up down with simple 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.250
 movement of the hand to the mouth in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.710
 place of the body is already enough pro 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 I have sat down with the new position, 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 also interact with a model with the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.280
 external subject software has to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 interacting with the environment facilitates 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.350
 if it is not external photography has been 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.140
 studio you can give any object 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.810
 for the person to hold because she 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.660
 out of the head that feeling that she 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.690
 need to hold onto something that does not 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.240
 your hand is you you're not loose 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.670
 so it's one of these tips 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.530
 you can use to facilitate the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.520
 life your life when it comes to 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.160
 direct the model so you need 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.370
 pass confidence showing you know right 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.030
 do is this direction there at the time 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.400

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.680
 good appetite photographed more 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 spontaneously try to put together a script 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.820
 Imaging tell a story 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.200
 Our goal is to tell a story 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.280
 so if you already have a script it is 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.440

 then you need to have a script is 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.120
 problem so that you can move 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.280

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.940

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:16.350
 or lack of the right model and make a 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.420
 creative way using 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.620
