then you have the installation wizard

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.900 
then you have the installation wizard
that's<00:01:53.340> going<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.580> pop<00:01:53.760> up<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:56.310> wait<00:01:56.520> until

that's going to pop up just wait until

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.570 
that's going to pop up just wait until
the<00:01:57.150> installation<00:01:57.240> has<00:01:57.720> prepared<00:01:58.080> itself<00:01:58.580> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
the installation has prepared itself and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.050 
the installation has prepared itself and
then<00:02:00.030> all<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.420> do<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:01.880> follow<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
the default installation directory so

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.780 
the default installation directory so
click<00:02:12.810> Next<00:02:13.440> you<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.890> change<00:02:14.130> if<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.459> want<00:02:14.550> to

okay now that the installation for JDK

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.240 
okay now that the installation for JDK
is<00:02:52.850> finished<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.990> to<00:02:54.170> ask<00:02:54.350> you<00:02:54.680> to

one-time port the runtime portion of
java<00:03:05.120> software<00:03:05.560> which<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.980> all<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.370> need<00:03:07.520> to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
java software which is all you need to

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.410 
java software which is all you need to
run<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.030> your<00:03:08.060> web<00:03:08.300> browser<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.270> the

run in your web browser so this is the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.980 
run in your web browser so this is the
default<00:03:11.780> directory<00:03:12.530> for<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.160> installation

default directory for the installation

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.970 
default directory for the installation
we're<00:03:14.990> going<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.140> leave<00:03:15.350> it<00:03:15.470> like<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.650> again

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
we're going to leave it like that again

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.160 
we're going to leave it like that again
if<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:16.520> want<00:03:16.850> to<00:03:17.000> change<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.450> simply<00:03:17.900> click<00:03:18.080> on

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
if you want to change it simply click on

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:26.580 
if you want to change it simply click on
change<00:03:18.760> click<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.940> next

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.589 

so<00:03:27.220> again<00:03:27.550> just<00:03:27.580> wait<00:03:28.120> until<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
so again just wait until the

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:54.399 
so again just wait until the
installation<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.260> finished

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.479 

okay<00:03:55.409> so<00:03:55.739> now<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.920> you've<00:03:56.310> actually

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
okay so now that you've actually

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.839 
okay so now that you've actually
finished<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.269> installation<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:59.340> can<00:03:59.519> access

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
finished the installation you can access

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.270 
finished the installation you can access
the<00:04:00.000> tutorials<00:04:00.569> documentation<00:04:01.110> by<00:04:01.950> clicking

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
the tutorials documentation by clicking

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.979 
the tutorials documentation by clicking
next<00:04:02.370> steps<00:04:02.670> we're<00:04:03.150> not<00:04:03.269> going<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.780> so

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
next steps we're not going to do that so

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.509 
next steps we're not going to do that so
just<00:04:04.019> simply<00:04:04.530> click<00:04:04.799> on<00:04:04.950> close<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:07.430> there<00:04:08.430> you

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
just simply click on close and there you

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:08.990 
just simply click on close and there you
have<00:04:08.579> it

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
have it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.009 
have it
you've<00:04:09.629> just<00:04:09.959> installed<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.680> Java<00:04:11.220> JDK

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.529 

so<00:04:18.650> now<00:04:19.039> that<00:04:19.099> we've<00:04:19.400> installed<00:04:19.549> Java<00:04:20.120> JDK

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
so now that we've installed Java JDK

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.680 
so now that we've installed Java JDK
which<00:04:21.139> is<00:04:21.410> essentially<00:04:22.069> a<00:04:22.280> compiler<00:04:23.000> for

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
which is essentially a compiler for

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.659 
which is essentially a compiler for
those<00:04:24.110> who<00:04:24.289> don't<00:04:24.500> know<00:04:24.590> what<00:04:24.979> a<00:04:25.099> compiler<00:04:25.550> is

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
those who don't know what a compiler is

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.629 
those who don't know what a compiler is
it's<00:04:26.180> basically<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.870> kind<00:04:27.259> of<00:04:27.319> translator<00:04:27.919> that

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
it's basically a kind of translator that

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.120 
it's basically a kind of translator that
lets<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.000> translate<00:04:29.569> code<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.919> can

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
lets you translate code that you can

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.510 
lets you translate code that you can
understand<00:04:31.580> into<00:04:32.210> code<00:04:32.569> that<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:33.650> computer

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
understand into code that the computer

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.909 
understand into code that the computer
can<00:04:34.819> understand<00:04:35.210> so<00:04:36.199> anyway<00:04:36.470> we're<00:04:36.740> going<00:04:36.860> to

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
can understand so anyway we're going to

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.820 
can understand so anyway we're going to
try<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.759> test<00:04:38.060> Java<00:04:38.870> JDK<00:04:39.229> we're<00:04:39.530> going<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.710> run

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
try and test Java JDK we're going to run

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.070 
try and test Java JDK we're going to run
it<00:04:39.979> see<00:04:40.310> if<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.490> works<00:04:40.699> so<00:04:41.479> this<00:04:41.750> we're<00:04:41.960> going

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
it see if it works so this we're going

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.230 
it see if it works so this we're going
to<00:04:42.139> click<00:04:42.289> on<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.500> Start<00:04:42.770> menu<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.210> in<00:04:44.210> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
you wish for Windows so here we're going

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.100 
you wish for Windows so here we're going
to<00:05:00.020> type<00:05:00.229> Java<00:05:00.770> C<00:05:01.699> press<00:05:02.599> ENTER<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.020> your
