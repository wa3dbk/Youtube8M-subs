castle<00:01:05.339> we've<00:01:05.640> got<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.229> cannon<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.439> we've

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
castle we've got the cannon there we've

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
castle we've got the cannon there we've
got<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.890> archer<00:01:08.189> towers<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.700> pretty<00:01:09.270> much<00:01:09.420> if

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
got the archer towers and pretty much if

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
got the archer towers and pretty much if
you<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> defenses<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:12.000> reach

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
you look at all the defenses they reach

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
you look at all the defenses they reach
to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> edge<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> map<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:13.950> hard

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to the edge of the map so it's very hard

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
to the edge of the map so it's very hard
to<00:01:14.340> law<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.659> base<00:01:15.960> hour<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.830> pretty

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to law on this base hour if it's pretty

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340 
to law on this base hour if it's pretty
difficult<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.000> law<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.020> quite

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
difficult you can law but it is quite

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.149 
difficult you can law but it is quite
difficult<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.150> get<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> clear<00:01:22.020> spot<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.770> kill

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
difficult to get a clear spot to kill

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
difficult to get a clear spot to kill
the<00:01:23.310> clan<00:01:23.520> castle<00:01:24.000> troops<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.780> let's<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.080> a
