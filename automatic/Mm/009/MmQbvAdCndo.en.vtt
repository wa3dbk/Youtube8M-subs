00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.890
 I've worked everything more with this grand 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.770
 with the gas cylinder 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.570
 and that that did not go well and I understood 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.519
 none of it I have renewed everything 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.880
 new ones 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 burner and everything on it every now and then 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 not yet think what is here anyway 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 what is the problem then 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.369
 I'm going to those guys 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.570
 connect the gas hose and then I go 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.570
 show what the problem is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
 turn the nut with a devious one 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.399
 tears 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.399
 in the gas 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 to do 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.000
 he sings, he has a connection 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.750
 a non-return valve 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.079
 quickly open that tap 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.329
 then that check valve will work and then 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:26.179
 no more gas comes out that is before 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:28.189
 the snake has a slice on the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.119
 gas escapes too hard 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.579
 now it has a check valve and then with it 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.140
 then he doesn't do it anymore so as me 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:46.939
 open one very quickly then I would 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 show that he doesn't do those snakes 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:58.399
 is doing reasonably well now and if you do 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.530
 the tap slowly turns on then it is 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.610
 He has no problems with that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.899
 he emptied and now I have it 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.789
 as also to be doing well now but 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.340
 The point is if you take it too fast 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.109
 open here that the tap of that 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.410
 gas bottle debits 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:20.739
 then he has no more power on the op 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.739
 the flame
