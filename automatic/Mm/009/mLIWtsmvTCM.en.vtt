12th<00:00:37.400> fret<00:00:37.490> on<00:00:37.580> the<00:00:37.700> D<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:39.820> fifth<00:00:40.820> fifth<00:00:41.330> fret

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
12th fret on the D and fifth fifth fret

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.470 
12th fret on the D and fifth fifth fret
on<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.660> E<00:00:42.020> string<00:00:42.970> you<00:00:43.970> can<00:00:44.090> use<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.240> for

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
on the E string you can use it for

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.280 
on the E string you can use it for
things<00:00:44.570> like<00:00:44.720> this

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.440 

so<00:00:52.950> it<00:00:53.010> gives<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> nice<00:00:53.490> strong<00:00:53.850> bottom<00:00:54.150> on

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
so it gives you a nice strong bottom on

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.630 
so it gives you a nice strong bottom on
your<00:00:54.630> on<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:54.990> D<00:00:55.230> string<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.250> probably

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
your on your D string you probably

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
your on your D string you probably
already<00:00:56.790> use<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.350> another<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.500> called

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
already use that another one is called

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.460 
already use that another one is called

to<00:01:01.560> drop<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.890> high<00:01:02.610> E<00:01:02.670> down<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.150> D<00:01:03.360> and<00:01:07.730> my<00:01:08.730> B

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
to drop my high E down to a D and my B

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.550 
to drop my high E down to a D and my B
drops<00:01:09.270> down<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.480> an<00:01:09.690> A

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.710 

you<00:01:16.189> can<00:01:16.340> use<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.549> for<00:01:16.850> things<00:01:16.939> like<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.210> do<00:01:17.689> in

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
you can use it for things like I do in

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:29.500 
you can use it for things like I do in
the<00:01:17.869> intro

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.530 

one<00:01:30.320> more<00:01:30.500> fairly<00:01:30.770> common<00:01:31.220> tuning<00:01:32.150> it's

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
one more fairly common tuning it's

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.000 
one more fairly common tuning it's
actually<00:01:32.870> less<00:01:33.020> popular<00:01:33.440> than<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:33.680> used<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:33.950> be

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
actually less popular than it used to be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.330 
actually less popular than it used to be
is<00:01:34.310> an<00:01:35.180> open<00:01:35.570> D<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:36.350> means<00:01:36.560> it's<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.100> D

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
is an open D and that means it's the D

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.240 
is an open D and that means it's the D
chord<00:01:37.930> played<00:01:38.930> with<00:01:39.260> all<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.590> strings<00:01:39.890> open

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
chord played with all the strings open

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.630 
chord played with all the strings open
so<00:01:40.810> that's<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.960> D<00:01:42.170> there<00:01:42.500> it's<00:01:43.250> really<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.580> great

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
so that's a D there it's really a great

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.370 
so that's a D there it's really a great
tuning<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.480> you<00:01:44.540> know<00:01:45.250> harmonics<00:01:47.380> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
tuning for you know harmonics and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.980 
tuning for you know harmonics and
whatever<00:01:49.250> whatever<00:01:49.610> fret<00:01:50.180> you<00:01:50.300> fret<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:50.900> a

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
whatever whatever fret you fret just a

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.760 
whatever whatever fret you fret just a
straight<00:01:51.260> bar

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.260 

it's<00:01:59.770> really<00:02:00.040> great<00:02:00.250> for<00:02:00.310> four<00:02:01.030> finger

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
it's really great for four finger

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's really great for four finger
picking<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.860> finger<00:02:03.340> picking<00:02:03.520> with<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:03.970> slide

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
picking and finger picking with a slide

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.380 
picking and finger picking with a slide
so<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.080> know

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.520 

has<00:02:09.960> a<00:02:09.990> lot<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.319> options<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.130> open<00:02:11.460> D<00:02:12.410> there<00:02:13.410> are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
has a lot of options so open D there are

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
has a lot of options so open D there are
many<00:02:13.709> other<00:02:13.920> altered<00:02:14.430> tunings<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.630> we

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
many other altered tunings and that we

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.390 
many other altered tunings and that we
could<00:02:16.260> make<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> whole<00:02:16.709> series<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.190> lessons

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
could make a whole series of lessons

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.699 
could make a whole series of lessons
just<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.050> find<00:02:19.319> them<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.530> lots

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
just on that you can find them in lots

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.710 
just on that you can find them in lots
of<00:02:19.860> places<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.030> great<00:02:21.270> thing<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.510> do

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of places and a really great thing to do

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
of places and a really great thing to do
is<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> create<00:02:22.620> your<00:02:22.650> own<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.220> don't<00:02:23.520> be

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
is to create your own just don't be

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.470 
is to create your own just don't be
limited<00:02:24.860> just<00:02:25.860> start<00:02:26.120> changing<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> string

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
limited just start changing the string

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.700 
limited just start changing the string
notes<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.520> have<00:02:29.520> fun
