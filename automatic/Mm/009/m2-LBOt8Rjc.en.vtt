00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.369
 Hi darling, we came to issue number 9 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.550
 see the statement in a city thousand 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.850
 inhabitants were interviewed 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:40.320
 respect to their relations with banks 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:46.559
 a and b 2 thousand respondents 250 were 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:52.589
 only bank account holders at 480 were 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.120
 bank account holders and 720 were 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:01.330
 account holders of only one banks deficit 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.280
 and the rest were not 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:10.120
 no two banks about this 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.340
 research is correct to state that the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:20.799
 probability of 12 respondents who 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:27.490
 are number 9 to be a registrant of the two 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:37.270
 banks is greater than 0.27 the wrong we go 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:39.790
 the solution solution let's go 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.810
 represents represent the diagram of 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.580
 comes from this situation 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.510
 see the king diagram 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:55.020
 this table represents this 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:59.440
 represents a thousand inhabitants we have here thousand 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:04.510
 inhabitants thousand inhabitants 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:11.470
 this set represents the set of 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:13.989
 bank account holders here are on the right 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.250
 represents the set of account holders 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.250
 from bank b 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:28.680
 the question says two interviewees that in 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.970
 450 were bank account holders only from 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.960
 450 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 the bank to this means that only the 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:45.340
 bank the flames 450 account holders want 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 say here you have 450 account holders is 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.780
 of following were bank account holders 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.340
 big 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:59.980
 so here in china the 480 of bank b720 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.870
 were only one of these 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 banks 720 were account holders only 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.190
 one of these banks 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.870
 that means you had at 720 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:20.070
 account holders only from bank a or only 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:24.630
 of bank b if only of bank a were 450 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:33.150
 for 720 only of good eating 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.150
 we would have 720 minus 450 would have 270 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.090
 we have 270 account holders only from bank b 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.019
 we returned 480 was the bank account holders 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.080
 B 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:57.610
 all this here represents 480 480 but already 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:01.989
 there are 230 here only of b and the total of b 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.660
 I have 480 270 I'm just unb 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.269
 So how much is in haia and b? 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:14.860
 respectively to eb 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:21.580
 here would be 480 minus 270 then on a and b 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:26.800
 210 210 account holders are 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:33.510
 accountants simultaneously from a &amp; b to 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.870
 I add up by adding 450 plus 210 more 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.020
 270 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.760
 We're going to find 930 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.050
 so we have here 930 but it's a thousand 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.110
 population 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.930
 So where is it? 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.790
 in 70 that are missing the seven are 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.460
 outside these sets 70 account holders 70 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.620
 people are not account holders neither day nor 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.890
 from b 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:05.630
 the question was the probability of being 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:12.530
 of the two banks is greater than 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:16.730
 0.29 calculate the probability of a the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:20.420
 following the infinite sample space 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:27.380
 because we have a thousand thousand inhabitants 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:29.890
 inhabitants and all inhabitants have the 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.420
 same chance of being selected here 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.450
 sample space is finite and that 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.090
 likely to find the probability 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.950
 just divide the number of houses 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.340
 favorable figures on the number of 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:47.030
 possible cases 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.060
 are one thousand inhabitants 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:55.270
 carlos favorable I want the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:59.750
 accounts of the two banks which are 210 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:05.990
 we will have 210 out of a thousand if we can 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:14.150
 simplify you have 21 out of 100 and 21 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:29.450
 in 0.21 and 0.21 is higher is higher 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:32.180
 which 0.7 answer right answer right 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:38.830
 the probability of being an accountant of the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.830
 two banks is greater than zero comma 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:51.170
 2000 would answer this certain right 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.360
 this was question number 9 

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.310
 I hope you have accompanied the 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.760
 cesp speaking of sets 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.510
 good luck and let's go to the next question 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.510
 good luck
