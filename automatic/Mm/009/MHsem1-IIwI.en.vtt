00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.670
 yesterday was fire Wednesday and I can not wait to arrive Wednesday from 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.010
 ashes is not that I am the enemy of the carnival 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.190
 I even played in common the same blocks as the previous ones so far 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.440
 and on Tuesday of carnival so I will speak with knowledge of the cause and 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.400
 reveal some truths that I found behind the was the carnival ' 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.160
 the first of them the carnival 'is a genuinely Brazilian party 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.070
 the carnatal talc we know him he appeared in europe during the Victorian era 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.539
 and spread throughout the world adapting to other cultures according to 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.490
 false truth is a popular party 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.500
 hardly her 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.330
 The 'Circus Business' Carnival 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.340
 let the cabs say it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.720
 private parties and the beloved Abbots called passports of the 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.249
 joy and who does not have the money to hire the colored rupee 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.530
 they also have no right to be happy 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.290
 and here in the paraiba do not celebrate the forecasts very different 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.770
 Most of the lyrical blocks cost public power and no 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.900
 Saturday in montreal time amuse the people just because the carnival is a party 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.439
 millions of reais are paid to artists 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.330
 here and there to secure the circus there is a miserable 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.850
 They do not even have a coupon on the table. 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.130
 many things today my turn at the carnival one of them is ova good music 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.710
 keep silent 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.270
 positive moments like the wonder woman's melody 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.790
 and the like that I do not use or quote 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 I get outraged when I see the amount of ambulances 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.490
 available at a carnival parade is to attend the drunks on duty and 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.960
 worth by forgetfulness in fights and break-breaking 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 Where are these same ambulances? 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.280
 when a mother needs to have a sick child when a worker is in 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.990
 part bound when the endorsement of the interior 'needs to 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.020
 submit mission im 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630
 I revolted 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.090
 that the police are here 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.349
 I think of parties to ensure order during carnival 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.819
 and day to day lack of security for the citizen of good 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.409
 exercise the simple right to come and go 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.600
 but the carnival ' 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.819
 It's a wonderful party. 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.099
 they even say it spins the economy that small traders can 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.099
 sell only the cans without surprises kemp 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.090
 if these parents of the family for the carnival bc wants to sell and to live 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.579
 bird the rest of the year the mutual 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.590
 the carnavalsaiba profit 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.050
 carbon is the owner of an electric trio and for one of the few 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.139
 Bahian artists are no longer just damages 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.169
 Someone has already stopped to calculate how much the state spends until it succeeds victims 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.209
 of accidents caused by drunken revelers 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.810
 how many millions are paid in death benefits 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.619
 or disability resulting from such accidents 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.479
 how much the public power disburses body curettage procedures that many 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.219
 young people to submit after an unprotected carnival 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.809
 which generated an unwanted pregnancy 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.189
 and that's not to mention the amount of cites 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.839
 that are transmitted during the party 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:17.999
 everything is permitted 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:20.999
 I even think the carnival was good already. 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:22.980
 it was in the days of old
