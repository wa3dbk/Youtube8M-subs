 santa cruz colony at one hour from 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.210
 curitiba 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.780
 on arrival we are already faced with something 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.870
 different women from using 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.449
 dresses long old costumes and this is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.699
 just the beginning of our time travel to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.650
 community lives as if it were in the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.650
 early 19th century 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.360
 nice france welcomes us curious and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.940
 her mother with a more arduous way of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 young man makes us a request to come down 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 below I will contemplate her grandfather is the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.420
 Colony pastor and all the elements 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 he can only record with permission 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 local 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.690
 When he sees us, he looks suspicious but 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.960
 if we only take few and with an accent 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.350
 the pastor already counts a good part of the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 trajectory and ugly country route on 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:12.510
 last pass and has the six 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:14.760
 countries announced to speak of prof 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.759
 all in the colony are descendants of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:26.189
 Russians among them only speak this language 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:32.250
 from small it was once my son and 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:38.130
 censorship was 543 was the first language 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.729
 that you learned to speak and then which 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.240
 You talk more about rock and Brazilian. 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.530
 You talk where and when you're not in the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.610
 school only speaks the bone which is more 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 difficult a golden goal in the whole colony 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.229
 follows strictly the Catholic religion 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.420
 and the first difference is already 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.090
 counting days and months in the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.450
 calendar while we are in the year 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.569
 in 2010 they are already in seven thousand and 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.360
 five hundred and eighteen years because of 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.670
 customs the people are very closed afraid 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
 to be criticized for the way he lives 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.680
 early the children already face this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.170
 they study in the city and deal with the 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.720
 prejudice of others but before the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.620
 lack of respect they open and tastes good 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.830
 what to do 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.049
 anahÃ­ ignores the girl is 11 years old and 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.280
 Remember that soon you'll be looking for 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.069
 of a husband 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.160
 usually marry early with 14 and 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.329

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400
 other diseases 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.440
 This is why migration is great among 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.569
 the world's communities say they do not 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.879
 can marry different religion 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.560
 Can you pass our religion? 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.140
 but you have to go first to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.140
 then marry you and the party of 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.260

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:10.109

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.139
 here in the colony itself is a kind of 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.910
 fruit juice which then goes through a 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.680
 fermentation process 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.970
 This one was made from plum 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.769
 Look how sweet it is. 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.190
 but cheating saw why the dosage 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.569
 of alcohol is almost 25% 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.290
 started working, I'm going to stop here 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:42.120

 head scarf can only leave home 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.470
 with him 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.430
 they are still unmarried braids in the 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.799
 tresses 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.470
 men since they were little 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.510
 belt tied every second Monday 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.230
 religion serves to separate the 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.409
 clean body that is said 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.950
 rhyme of the dirty part that is 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:17.400
 beard or think of cutting into the bible am 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.630
 and catholic said it is can not enter 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.459
 scissors in his beard 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.919
 This is the home of one of the families 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.220
 live here in the colony a simple house 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.380
 on the wall pictures with embroidery here on the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:34.150
 I sing a small altar all adorned 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.080
 They all make a couch here, but in the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.080
 bookcase 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.320
 Look, there's no television for the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.560
 Orthodox religion is forbidden to watch 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.840
 television but many confess that it has 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.130
 a hidden home have television 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.070
 at home but before they can not 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:57.039
 watch television 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.229
 it seems that not Maria herself knows about 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.360
 difficulties in living the tradition of 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.669
 days that you do not believe that she 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.310
 It will last as long as you think 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.120
 will be the future of these customs of 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.120
 you 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.250
 I do not know how to tell you, I do not know how to tell you, but I 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.800
 I think it will not go far. 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.169
 are so many different customs that 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.450
 journalist diego donnelly registered in 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.849
 a book he knew in the colony and what 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.160
 certainly will not forget a 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.310
 a colony that tries to keep its customs and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.030
 century culture in the 21st century in a 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.910
 a globalized contemporary is something 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.099
 unusual and the strength of culture 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.860
 from generation to generation is something 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:44.800
 only we practically here in the parana 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.450
 but still there are those who believe and 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.479
 to keep one of the few communities 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.180
 that there are still in Brazil the 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.569
 Elizabeth is already a promise you think 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:06:00.569
 bad all this 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:01.800
 it's not cool to shadow keep stone stayed 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.259
 even for us 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:12.450
 I know that if ever a good mood and 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:16.150
 our custom the gaucho team 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:21.840
 is proof that not everything is lost 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:21.840
 xinane the law logo 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.890
