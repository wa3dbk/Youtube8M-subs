00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 study the great authors of the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.450
 French language and above all you will have the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.650
 opportunity to express or tell 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.460
 stories 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.650
 3 go so bad are this year is the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 next is null of my life listen is 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.509
 On Saturday I ate a pizza and pil before 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.980
 he was tired on Sunday not 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.230
 I was asking for a poem in Alexandrian verses 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.680
 I asked them to tell me their end of 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.680
 week 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.620
 on Saturday I went to study at home 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.410
 Raphael High I took a look at the house 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.840
 when a smell caught my attention 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.930
 unmistakable smell of the class woman 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.090
 half 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 it does not shock you that a student of 16 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.340
 years write something like that does not shock me 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 you have a tone the pair is a 7 teases 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.970
 of his partner and the mother of his 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 companion back to the normal home of 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.920
 the normal family helps back to race 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.320
 you have opted for the marked parody 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.330
 the difficult thing is to approach the characters 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.280
 because you have gone to the present is a 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.280
 way to stay in the house 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.700
 I do not know what you're trying to teach her 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.399
 literature 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.670
 you just need to ask you a question what 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.670
 will happen 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.500
 I see making love but if they are 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.320
 fiction characters 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.930
 is becoming more and more credible and every time 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.910
 more dangerous has been too far 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.070
 you encouraged me to continue with this but 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.650
 forget it race will continue to write about 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.860
 them this will end badly I feel this 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.100
 it ends badly 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.790
 humiliated my son in public the layers 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.830
 to correct your exercise between manipulate 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.250
 you want to teach literature but he 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.250
 it gives an energy 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.590
 I'm looking for an ending an end to 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.620
 Mr. German 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.520
