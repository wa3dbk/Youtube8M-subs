00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello everyone how good in this video 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.060
 I'm going to tell you how to maintain the 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.370
 make-up all day long 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.429
 tricks that we can follow and especially 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.670
 I have put together eight tricks for 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:19.310
 comment and good to know a little 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.400
 how after leaving home once 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.560
 make up if we are going back late or if 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.130
 we do not want the makeup to go away 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.190
 falling throughout the day or that is left 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.790
 bad or remain remains as we can 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.580
 help this does not happen then I'm going to 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.830
 start by saying that it depends on knees 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.590
 that we arrive we will have to take 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.600
 some things or others in the toiletry bag 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 bag is worth I am very supportive of 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.180
 carry a bag inside the bag 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.880
 day of diary one day that will come out all 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.370
 the day does not matter because always 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.630
 minimum matÃ­as that we carry maybe this way 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.220
 that we have to touch up what we 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.830
 we need at some point 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.980
 regular on the way to play at the base of 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.590
 makeup whatever then I would be 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.330
 supporter of taking a bag and putting 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.990
 all the things that I am going to tell you 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.900
 Now the first one if we wear our eyes 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 makeup if we wear a makeup 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.740
 that we have put some kind of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.830
 eyeliner either on the line in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 water in the line from inside the eye is worth 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.040
 or outside if we have marked it with pencil is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 normal pencil because this black for example 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.479
 or brown or the one you want is worth and what 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.910
 we have marked with pencil to catch the same 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.820
 pencil and put it in the bag because 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.000
 because not all pencils on the market 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.759
 for many hours and after a few 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.729
 hours one hour two hours three hours 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.420
 that are we can notice that this 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.780
 area is getting stained or falling 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.509
 the product then if it's black you see 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.940
 very much that is falling down I do not know is a 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.690
 color more clearly because maybe you do not notice 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 so much 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:11.880
 but when it's black you see leftovers and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:14.970
 see the white area of the zone 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.530
 water line then if it's in the part 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.870
 above we have delineated the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.180
 upper lashes for the same thing 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.400
 we can put in the toiletry and retouch 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.500
 us in case we see that we are going 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.740
 clarifying that we need it because it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 the product is going, that would be the 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.120
 first product that I would take in a 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.600
 bag to make the makeup 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.760
 endure all day after the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.680
 next thing that I would take would be 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.110
 the shadows that we used in the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.000
 makeup maybe not all because 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.160
 maybe there has been some shadow that is 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.110
 it goes a little bit because it can look worse and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.740
 other than not for example if you put a 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.170
 shadow on the outside because maybe that 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.270
 shadow stays more there and the one that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.100
 see that he is losing is a little the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.940
 that the one that we are putting in the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.280
 eyelid mobile 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.030
 then I would take those shadows if the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.330
 we have loose or if it is a for example 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.430
 a trio like this one of three shadows and 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.069
 we have used these three shades or two 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.500
 of them we can catch the same 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.020
 trio and so we have everything controlled 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 not so to say we have the three 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.800
 shadows that we have used for 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.819
 make up if we need some 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.850
 type of retouch after the next 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.850
 trick would be to use long products 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.430
 duration if we are going to be out many 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.560
 hours for example the foundation 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.790
 a long-lasting foundation 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.880
 of those 18 hours of which are a 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.970
 makeup foundation that 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.280
 apart from what lasts from what 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.370
 you look good with that base that you are 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.670
 comfortable that is not prickly 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.210
 because otherwise there was something normal before 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.640
 in that at that time but with getting 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.230
 especially a base that will last us 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.290
 in the time that we are going to be out 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.480
 because yes we can fix it with 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.820
 with powders compact powders or powders 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.170
 loose that in this case the most comfortable 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.329
 they would be compact powders but the finish 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.370
 Well, if it's a long-term base 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.320
 it will be much better than if it is a very 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.360
 light that the hours we will not have no 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.230
 we will have practically coverage 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.250
 I will have gone 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:38.130
 apart if you use headliner 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.130
 example of these like this kind 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.740
 of bottle because they are also long 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.430
 duration that are waterproof that we 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.300
 are going to last all day and that that 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.740
 we have to remove it from retouching 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.450
 after the next trick would be to carry 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.790
 as I was telling you now compact powders 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.460
 especially compact because if they are 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.200
 loose are not half as comfortable as 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.320
 they are the compact ones especially if 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.720
 we have to take it in a bag in the 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.810
 Bag in the bag and carry 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.670
 apply a kabuki brush that I think 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.530
 that are much more manageable and how they are 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.320
 much smaller for example as 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.430
 this one that I have of lers this is very 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 very dense and very if you wear this you do not 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.080
 occupies nothing in the vanity case and you already have a 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.420
 brush and so we do not have to catch by 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.310
 example one of these that this is not there 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.670
 who put it in a toilet bag and 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.919
 Maybe he takes bad form or something like that 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:41.349
 it is not very practical 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.839
 then take a blusher the 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:47.080
 Blusher we have applied if 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:49.869
 at hours it is also going away and as 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.300
 We will take our high brush with 

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:54.520
 kim well we will also take advantage of 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.789
 use it with rouge although it is not 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.729
 just like a bevelled brush but we 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.309
 can do the job at that moment 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.319
 and then take the lipstick we have 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:08.580
 that we have put ourselves in the way that 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:11.169
 let's take a stand and take a 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.599
 skewer a mini brush of these 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.729
 labial so tiny that there I 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.330
 I have one but now I can not find it 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.550
 I know where the emitted but will serve 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:25.300
 because there are lipsticks that are too 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.580
 creamy and if we try to put 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.409
 during the day without having a 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.749
 mirror by hand 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.639
 or whatever or just directly 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:36.939
 the bar maybe we left and we 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.029
 it costs more effort to have it 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:42.819
 have put it wrong that I did not catch a 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:44.649
 brush and applying as the 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.529
 let's go needing no without loading the 

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:48.099
 lip 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:51.979
 and finally I would also tell you that 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:54.589
 you use after applying the water 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:59.149
 oatmeal pulverized well the truth 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:07:00.739
 quite far because it wets and use it 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.919
 after applying all the makeup 

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:08.479
 because this helps to fix it and it will last you 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:11.389
 more time if it fits of that he thought is 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:13.129
 that would last you then nothing this would be 

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:16.489
 all the tricks that I have for 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:19.779
 keep the makeup there at bay and 

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:19.779
 I hope I have served you
