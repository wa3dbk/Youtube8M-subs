 bandage in the background see in the background 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.660
 so-called read areas crisis 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.370
 the potato is over one 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.970
 either subsequently via energy 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.740
 sort by 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.360
 where the highest honor is made 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.280
 After the passengers in the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 Washing machine after the washing machine too 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.720
 back by advising where the potatoes 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.500
 once again hand to quality 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.420
 will be read 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.680
 after this area comes the potato 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.229
 directly into production 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.009
 we are here in the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.920
 production area next to me 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.240
 matthias 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.040
 We have a question from a customer 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.840
 get and that would like vienna 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.910
 Know why McDonald's the best 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.220
 fries and what our secret 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.470
 ingredients so to the secret ingredients 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.530
 Unfortunately I have to disappoint you 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.440
 no secret ingredient it is pure only the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.510
 good potato from Austria and the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.280
 attention to detail in production 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.989
 and if we already have the production 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.580
 Talk about how it works like us now 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.810
 that made a potato a fries 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.000
 the potatoes are after the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 Preparation in production peeled 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.510
 what happens to a steamboat and 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.190
 then washed again afterwards 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 the first control step takes place 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.820
 an optical sorting before the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.299
 potato then to the cutting system 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.480
 come 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.340
 the cutting works so that the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.530
 Potatoes in a pool of water 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.760
 about 80 90 km / h are accelerated 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.070
 shot through such knives 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.980
 will be after the cut then 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.840
 sorted for the time being get bigger 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.180
 small pieces the short pieces off 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.610
 sorted according to the progress 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.790
 the fries blocked and dried before 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.709
 before they are fried 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.000
 frying is the same oil in 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.799
 use that also in the restaurants 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.840
 that means a pure one 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.150
 vegetable oil one rad 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.099
 sunflower oil blend is in connection 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.599
 is still flash frozen and then is 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.870
 that 's what it' s already done for the 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.549
 Packaging palettes loses 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.890
 then the chips in the 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.110
 deep storage and are after form or 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.459
 brought from neuburg 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.560
