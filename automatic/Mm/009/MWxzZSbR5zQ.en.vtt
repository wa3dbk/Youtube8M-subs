00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:24.720 

sigh<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:15.020> taking<00:01:15.410> so<00:01:15.440> long

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:24.730 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:45.840 

hi<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:34.220> here<00:01:34.520> we<00:01:34.670> go<00:01:43.780> here<00:01:44.780> we<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:45.170> the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
hi so here we go here we have the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.700 
hi so here we go here we have the
controller<00:01:47.020> was<00:01:48.020> really<00:01:48.650> I<00:01:49.010> think<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.790> speaker

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
controller was really I think a speaker

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.110 
controller was really I think a speaker
so<00:01:53.350> you'll<00:01:54.350> play<00:01:54.530> your<00:01:54.620> DVS<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.280> like<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.479> I

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
so you'll play your DVS and like this I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.760 
so you'll play your DVS and like this I
guess<00:01:59.120> it's<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.630> speaker<00:01:59.900> or<00:02:00.080> something<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
guess it's a speaker or something I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:11.890 
guess it's a speaker or something I
don't<00:02:01.160> know<00:02:02.260> but<00:02:03.260> yeah<00:02:03.520> pretty<00:02:04.520> cool<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:11.660> we
