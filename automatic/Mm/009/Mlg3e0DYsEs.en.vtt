00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
this modification is a rapid strike CS

this modification is a rapid strike CS
18<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.649> have<00:01:01.399> drastically<00:01:02.089> minimized<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:03.019> by

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
18 I have drastically minimized it by

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.280 
18 I have drastically minimized it by
cutting<00:01:03.829> off<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.129> front<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:05.210> cutting<00:01:06.140> off

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
cutting off the front and cutting off

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.399 
cutting off the front and cutting off
the<00:01:06.470> entire<00:01:06.800> rail<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.690> decided<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.960> keep<00:01:09.140> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
the entire rail I decided to keep the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.770 
the entire rail I decided to keep the
stock<00:01:09.800> because<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.670> makes<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.030> look<00:01:11.119> very<00:01:11.479> cool

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
stock because it makes it look very cool

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.340 
stock because it makes it look very cool
I<00:01:12.220> designed<00:01:13.220> this<00:01:13.369> gun<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.909> look<00:01:14.090> like<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.630> SMG

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
I designed this gun to look like the SMG

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.830 
I designed this gun to look like the SMG
from<00:01:15.740> halo<00:01:16.159> because<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:17.119> thought<00:01:17.390> it<00:01:17.570> kind<00:01:17.720> of

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
from halo because I thought it kind of

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.590 
from halo because I thought it kind of
looks<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.350> SMG<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.729> I'll<00:01:20.119> go<00:01:20.330> over<00:01:20.360> all

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
looks like the SMG so I'll go over all

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.050 
looks like the SMG so I'll go over all
of<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.020> internal<00:01:21.590> modifications<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.789> then

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
of the internal modifications and then

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.910 
of the internal modifications and then
go<00:01:23.300> over<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.660> paint<00:01:23.990> job<00:01:24.259> for<00:01:24.800> the

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
go over the paint job for the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.940 
go over the paint job for the
modifications<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:26.119> have<00:01:26.600> done<00:01:26.869> some<00:01:27.440> standard

also upgraded the motors I'm using RM
twos<00:01:49.970> with<00:01:50.390> this<00:01:50.569> gun

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
twos with this gun

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.169 
twos with this gun
I<00:01:51.110> bought<00:01:51.649> quite<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.950> few<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.399> them<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
I bought quite a few of them and I

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.669 
I bought quite a few of them and I
wasn't<00:01:53.390> sure<00:01:53.660> if<00:01:53.810> I'm<00:01:53.899> gonna<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.289> them<00:01:54.470> but

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
wasn't sure if I'm gonna like them but

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:55.900 
wasn't sure if I'm gonna like them but
I'm<00:01:54.770> very<00:01:54.979> happy<00:01:55.220> with<00:01:55.520> their<00:01:55.670> performance

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
I'm very happy with their performance

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.809 
I'm very happy with their performance
and<00:01:56.509> they're<00:01:56.959> shooting<00:01:57.410> really<00:01:57.590> hard<00:01:57.890> those

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
and they're shooting really hard those

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.609 
and they're shooting really hard those
are<00:01:58.849> the<00:01:59.149> internal<00:01:59.720> modifications<00:02:00.380> the

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
are the internal modifications the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.710 
are the internal modifications the
external<00:02:01.280> modifications<00:02:01.940> are<00:02:02.209> quite

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
external modifications are quite

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.070 
external modifications are quite
apparent<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.319> did<00:02:03.890> minimize<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.000> I<00:02:05.780> cut

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
apparent I did minimize this and I cut

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.889 
apparent I did minimize this and I cut
off<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.229> rail<00:02:06.679> and<00:02:06.979> it's<00:02:07.489> very<00:02:07.759> smooth<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.539> as

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
off the rail and it's very smooth and as

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.749 
off the rail and it's very smooth and as
you<00:02:09.080> can<00:02:09.200> see<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.530> internals<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.340> exposed

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
you can see the internals are exposed

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.030 
you can see the internals are exposed
and<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.150> think<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:11.569> really<00:02:11.840> cool<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:12.860> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and I think that's really cool because I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.210 
and I think that's really cool because I
just<00:02:13.370> love<00:02:13.610> to<00:02:13.819> see<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.209> internals<00:02:15.069> some<00:02:16.069> of

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
just love to see the internals some of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.010 
just love to see the internals some of
you<00:02:16.370> might<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.730> saying<00:02:17.000> that<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.569> motor<00:02:17.900> is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
you might be saying that the motor is

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.100 
you might be saying that the motor is
exposed<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.950> yes<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.520> true<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.180> you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
exposed and yes that's true and you

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.199 
exposed and yes that's true and you
could<00:02:21.349> damage<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.950> if<00:02:22.160> you<00:02:22.310> impact<00:02:22.849> it<00:02:23.060> or

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
could damage it if you impact it or

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.420 
could damage it if you impact it or
something<00:02:23.629> so<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.470> should<00:02:24.800> be<00:02:24.920> very<00:02:24.950> careful

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
something so you should be very careful

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.410 
something so you should be very careful
when<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.330> are<00:02:26.360> using<00:02:26.959> this<00:02:27.230> gun<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.910> also<00:02:28.910> cut

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
when you are using this gun I also cut

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.720 
when you are using this gun I also cut
off<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.810> front<00:02:30.110> of<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> rapid<00:02:30.980> strike<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.550> I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
off the front of the rapid strike and I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.270 
off the front of the rapid strike and I
filled<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.300> with<00:02:32.480> epoxy<00:02:32.959> buddy<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.709> then<00:02:34.250> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
filled it with epoxy buddy and then I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.190 
filled it with epoxy buddy and then I
just<00:02:34.610> slopped<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.300> my<00:02:35.420> belt<00:02:35.660> sander<00:02:36.170> and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
just slopped that on my belt sander and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.250 
just slopped that on my belt sander and
smoothing<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.220> out<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.670> tried<00:02:38.629> to<00:02:38.780> use<00:02:38.959> as

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
smoothing it out I tried to use as

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
smoothing it out I tried to use as
little<00:02:39.470> orange<00:02:39.920> as<00:02:40.160> possible<00:02:40.730> because<00:02:40.879> I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
little orange as possible because I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.759 
little orange as possible because I
don't<00:02:41.330> orange<00:02:41.660> doesn't<00:02:42.050> look<00:02:42.200> very<00:02:42.230> good<00:02:42.470> with

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
don't orange doesn't look very good with

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.210 
don't orange doesn't look very good with
this<00:02:42.950> gun<00:02:43.190> but<00:02:43.519> is<00:02:44.410> safer<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.860> some

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
this gun but is safer to have some

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.000 
this gun but is safer to have some
orange<00:02:46.489> because<00:02:47.180> if<00:02:47.510> someone<00:02:47.900> walks<00:02:48.200> out<00:02:48.470> with

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
orange because if someone walks out with

paint found at autozone automotive shops

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.030 
paint found at autozone automotive shops
then<00:03:05.660> I<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.990> dry<00:03:06.170> brushed<00:03:06.500> over<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.890> with<00:03:07.010> a

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
then I just dry brushed over it with a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.520 
then I just dry brushed over it with a
steel<00:03:07.340> dry<00:03:07.670> brushing<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.330> didn't<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:09.350> any

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
steel dry brushing I didn't do any

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.040 
steel dry brushing I didn't do any
detailing<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.580> wanted<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.060> to<00:03:11.300> look<00:03:11.450> very

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
detailing and I wanted it to look very

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.890 
detailing and I wanted it to look very
rugged<00:03:12.950> because<00:03:13.790> that's<00:03:14.120> how<00:03:14.300> all<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.720> guns

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
rugged because that's how all the guns

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.770 
rugged because that's how all the guns
look<00:03:15.170> from<00:03:15.380> havel<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.970> usually<00:03:16.970> don't<00:03:17.270> do<00:03:17.510> one

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
look from havel I usually don't do one

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.780 
look from havel I usually don't do one
color<00:03:17.990> paint<00:03:18.350> jobs<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.070> I<00:03:19.130> think<00:03:19.460> this<00:03:19.580> one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
color paint jobs but I think this one

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.000 
color paint jobs but I think this one
turned<00:03:20.000> out<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.420> nicely<00:03:20.690> so<00:03:21.080> those<00:03:21.830> are

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
turned out really nicely so those are

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.700 
turned out really nicely so those are
all<00:03:22.160> the<00:03:22.400> paints<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.380> modification<00:03:24.380> so

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
all the paints and the modification so

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:37.120 
all the paints and the modification so
now<00:03:24.980> I'll<00:03:25.430> show<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:26.060> firing

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.030 

a<00:03:37.720> unique<00:03:38.720> feature<00:03:38.780> about<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.620> minimization

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
a unique feature about this minimization

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.270 
a unique feature about this minimization
is<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.270> clip<00:03:41.690> is<00:03:41.870> exposed<00:03:42.530> so<00:03:42.860> if<00:03:43.070> you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
is that the clip is exposed so if you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.700 
is that the clip is exposed so if you
scavenge<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.270> you<00:03:44.570> find<00:03:44.870> darts<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> floor

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
scavenge and you find darts on the floor

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.490 
scavenge and you find darts on the floor
you<00:03:46.370> can<00:03:46.400> load<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.300> like<00:03:47.840> an<00:03:48.050> internal

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
you can load it like an internal

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.530 
you can load it like an internal
magazine<00:03:48.800> kind<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.490> like<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.760> Magnus<00:03:50.300> and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
magazine kind of like the Magnus and

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.590 
magazine kind of like the Magnus and
you're<00:03:51.440> still<00:03:51.770> in<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.980> firing<00:03:52.460> position<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:53.330> if

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
you're still in a firing position so if

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.050 
you're still in a firing position so if
someone<00:03:54.380> comes<00:03:54.620> at<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.370> can<00:03:55.550> just<00:03:55.820> shoot

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
someone comes at you you can just shoot

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.620 
someone comes at you you can just shoot
them<00:03:56.300> as<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:58.310> can<00:03:58.370> see<00:03:58.730> this<00:03:58.910> gun<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.300> shooting

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
them as you can see this gun is shooting

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.020 
them as you can see this gun is shooting
really<00:04:00.200> really<00:04:00.530> well<00:04:00.740> and<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:01.550> primarily

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
really really well and that's primarily

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.290 
really really well and that's primarily
because<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.230> voltage<00:04:03.740> increase<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:05.270> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
because of the voltage increase but the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.840 
because of the voltage increase but the
upgraded<00:04:06.140> motors<00:04:06.500> are<00:04:06.800> definitely<00:04:07.520> helping

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
upgraded motors are definitely helping

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.880 
upgraded motors are definitely helping
it<00:04:07.970> shoot<00:04:08.210> much<00:04:08.420> harder<00:04:08.870> than<00:04:08.990> stock<00:04:09.380> so

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
it shoot much harder than stock so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.810 
it shoot much harder than stock so
that's<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.340> video<00:04:10.730> on<00:04:11.060> my<00:04:11.690> halo<00:04:12.200> SMG<00:04:12.980> replica

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
that's the video on my halo SMG replica

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.010 
that's the video on my halo SMG replica
I<00:04:14.060> hope<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.720> enjoyed<00:04:15.080> thanks<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.650> watching
