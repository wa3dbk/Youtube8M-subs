00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
miss it one more time so the way that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.460 
miss it one more time so the way that
this<00:01:05.760> triggers<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.630> has<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.110> kind<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
this triggers is it has this kind of

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
hidden sliding scale you can see that

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
hidden sliding scale you can see that
moving<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.170> both<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.770> trigger

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
moving there so that is both the trigger

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.649 
moving there so that is both the trigger
and<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.049> release<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.560> bring<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.890> back<00:01:17.659> closed

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
and the release to bring it back closed

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.719 
and the release to bring it back closed
so<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> push<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:22.549> triggers<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
so just to push up and that triggers the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:08.380 
tip up right Carrie only let me show you
what<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> looks<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> pocket

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.180 

so<00:02:09.229> that's<00:02:09.380> what<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.619> looks<00:02:09.770> like<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.069> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
so that's what it looks like in the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.220 
so that's what it looks like in the
pocket<00:02:10.580> my<00:02:11.060> only<00:02:11.240> suggestion<00:02:11.690> would<00:02:12.020> be<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
pocket my only suggestion would be to

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.960 
pocket my only suggestion would be to
use<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.770> lanyard<00:02:13.069> hole<00:02:13.370> go<00:02:13.640> ahead<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.880> put

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
use this lanyard hole go ahead and put

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.580 
use this lanyard hole go ahead and put
yourself<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.330> lanyard<00:02:14.569> on<00:02:14.840> there<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.500> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
yourself a lanyard on there so that it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.140 
yourself a lanyard on there so that it
makes<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.950> little<00:02:16.160> easier<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.670> draw<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.000> your

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
makes it a little easier to draw to your

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.020 
makes it a little easier to draw to your
pocket<00:02:17.740> so<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.800> don't<00:02:18.950> automatically<00:02:19.490> fire

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
pocket so you don't automatically fire

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.360 
pocket so you don't automatically fire
that<00:02:20.270> off<00:02:20.450> because<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:21.410> isn't<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.709> safety<00:02:22.190> on

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
that off because there isn't a safety on

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.449 
that off because there isn't a safety on
it<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:26.660> far<00:02:26.900> as<00:02:27.140> grip<00:02:27.500> goes<00:02:27.770> has<00:02:28.190> some<00:02:28.370> nice

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
it as far as grip goes has some nice

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.030 
it as far as grip goes has some nice
finger<00:02:28.850> coils<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.230> see<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.500> handle

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
finger coils and you can see the handle

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.100 
finger coils and you can see the handle
is<00:02:31.160> relatively<00:02:31.670> thick<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.660> definitely

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
is relatively thick so you definitely

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.140 
is relatively thick so you definitely
have<00:02:33.380> something<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.830> grab<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.250> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
have something to grab on to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930 
have something to grab on to
but<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.569> twist<00:02:38.200> by<00:02:38.950> Smith<00:02:39.400> &amp;<00:02:39.610> Wesson

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
but that is the twist by Smith &amp; Wesson

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.600 
but that is the twist by Smith &amp; Wesson
