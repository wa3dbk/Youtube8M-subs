but there is another animal that we've
been<00:01:37.920> finding<00:01:38.219> during<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.789> study<00:01:39.060> called

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
been finding during this study called

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.749 
been finding during this study called
the<00:01:40.049> blue<00:01:40.229> crab<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:41.039> is<00:01:41.069> actually<00:01:41.610> what

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the blue crab which is actually what

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
the blue crab which is actually what
these<00:01:41.939> traps<00:01:42.329> are<00:01:42.539> designed<00:01:54.079> what<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
these traps are designed what is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.179 
these traps are designed what is
successfully<00:01:56.280> captured<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.599> that<00:01:58.189> beautiful

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
successfully captured is that beautiful

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
successfully captured is that beautiful
little<00:01:59.310> blue<00:01:59.549> crab<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.599> which

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
little blue crab right here which

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.279 
little blue crab right here which
appears<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> quick<00:02:03.360> glance<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:04.110> be

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
appears and at just a quick glance to be

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.180 
appears and at just a quick glance to be
legal<00:02:05.159> size<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:06.240> derelict<00:02:07.020> pots<00:02:07.380> aren't<00:02:07.829> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
legal size so derelict pots aren't just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.120 
legal size so derelict pots aren't just
a<00:02:08.310> problem<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.289> bycatch<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.890> blue

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
a problem for bycatch like this blue

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.670 
a problem for bycatch like this blue
crab<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.489> we've<00:02:12.209> caught<00:02:12.540> flounder<00:02:13.200> only<00:02:13.530> and

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
crab and we've caught flounder only and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.430 
crab and we've caught flounder only and
found<00:02:13.950> flounder<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.599> found<00:02:15.870> diamondback

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
found flounder and we found diamondback

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.150 
found flounder and we found diamondback
terrapins

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
terrapins

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.120 
terrapins
but<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:19.110> should<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.680> interest<00:02:19.829> to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
but what it should be of interest to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.280 
but what it should be of interest to
crabbers<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> fact<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.510> these<00:02:21.720> derelict

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
crabbers is the fact that these derelict

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.550 
crabbers is the fact that these derelict
pots<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.980> trapping<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.329> animals<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.290> they

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
pots are trapping the animals that they

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.500 
pots are trapping the animals that they
are<00:02:25.739> trying<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.220> collect<00:02:26.519> for<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.120> fishery

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
are trying to collect for the fishery

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.539 
are trying to collect for the fishery
which<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.500> North<00:02:28.739> Carolina<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
which in North Carolina is a

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.680 
which in North Carolina is a
multi-million<00:02:30.389> dollar<00:02:30.420> industry<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:32.690> we'll

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
multi-million dollar industry so we'll

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.629 
multi-million dollar industry so we'll
extract<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.620> crab<00:02:34.889> release<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:35.579> into

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:35.639 
extract this crab release it back into

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.440 
extract this crab release it back into
the<00:02:35.970> water

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the water

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.140 
the water
we'll<00:02:36.660> discard<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.769> trap<00:02:38.130> properly<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
we'll discard this trap properly and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.280 
we'll discard this trap properly and
move<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> next<00:02:40.620> one<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.870> for<00:02:42.870> now<00:02:42.989> I'm

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
move on to the next one so for now I'm

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.180
