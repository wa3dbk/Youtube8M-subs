00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.459
 no I don't have it that you see where even more often experienced that thor 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.369
 and for the outside world the drivers 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.829
 the power at 6 pm 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 that can put down the results and listen 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.589
 respect for as opponents 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.589
 it is not that we are with 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.640
 may you may have us but the power 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 I don't want him by his side 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.570
 in the final 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.920
 the race in the competition 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 the perpetrator 9 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 overtake and not in an interview in the last match 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.740
 now I also turn my head that your legs 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.740
 the Dutchman was hit anyway 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.140
 or I play a real-time player with two points 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.420
 because sometimes I play differently 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.420
 I have I have been two so far 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.110
 The jury is not always there to watch you can play zombies 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.100
 and if you are smart 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.220
 then the juvenile court ansa 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.220
 the structure of the team 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.100
 that is always a hateful thing to me like the players 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.380
 he says that the EBITDA for the lower house has been achieved 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.550
 Always do that at the loss of Gorssel exam material 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.750
 the players with injuries 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.750
 then that is always an aaa rating 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.570
 j 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.560
 well late but I expect that should be heard 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.460
 the players who do not have the n va have for this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 keep the team together 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.450
 and his team 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.190
 they value this team tactically 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.819
 also no question that you guard that well 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.889
 I don't expect that 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.889
 because we are on 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.399
 the broadcaster is famous 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.919
 that cannot be ignored is also that a few days expected that unilever team on 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.729
 take a look we don't have a third party messiah that you would first 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.509
 being able 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.649
 Voorburg an orthodontist 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:34.829
 we must have 3 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.829
 only chance of success 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.679
 we are no more 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.679
 take a tap thanks to the team 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.859
 well i have it 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:51.939
 rick some things 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.719
 those on the issuance policy yesterday during training yes but what I always do I do 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.349
 always players five years 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.239
 opposition 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.939
 and there could also be an option to sing 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.569
 playing with an initiative law says I'm not out on the market yet 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.889
 but we make our country anyway
