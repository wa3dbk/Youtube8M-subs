00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
basically some sort of a foam but it is

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.380 
basically some sort of a foam but it is
pre-cut<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.650> your<00:01:09.310> design<00:01:09.759> is<00:01:10.090> already

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
pre-cut and your design is already

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.139 
pre-cut and your design is already
pre-cut<00:01:11.290> and<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:12.250> need<00:01:12.670> one<00:01:12.909> of<00:01:13.000> these

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
pre-cut and you you need one of these

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.090 
pre-cut and you you need one of these
little<00:01:13.329> tools<00:01:13.689> right<00:01:14.049> here<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.590> see<00:01:14.770> how<00:01:14.890> it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
little tools right here and see how it's

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.819 
little tools right here and see how it's
kind<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.520> cut<00:01:15.729> in<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.200> all<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.500> have<00:01:17.680> to

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.060 
kind of cut in here and all you have to
do<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.549> basically<00:01:19.049> push<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.380> fabric<00:01:20.619> in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
do is basically push the fabric in

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.609 
do is basically push the fabric in
between<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> cuts<00:01:22.060> I'm<00:01:22.329> not<00:01:23.079> kidding<00:01:23.439> you

between the cuts I'm not kidding you

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.840 
between the cuts I'm not kidding you
it's<00:01:23.890> that<00:01:24.369> easy

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
it's that easy

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.080

pieces have little lines in the patterns

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.229 
pieces have little lines in the patterns
and<00:03:09.010> what<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.459> want<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.730> do<00:03:09.820> is<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.030> want<00:03:10.209> to

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
cut that because that is what's going to

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.690 
cut that because that is what's going to
help<00:03:12.580> bend<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.510> fabric<00:03:13.750> around<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:15.040> shape<00:03:15.280> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
help bend the fabric around the shape so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.509 
help bend the fabric around the shape so
now<00:03:16.330> it's<00:03:16.690> just<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:17.260> quilt<00:03:17.650> by<00:03:17.769> number<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.340> it's

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
now it's just a quilt by number and it's

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.620 
now it's just a quilt by number and it's
super<00:03:18.850> easy<00:03:18.970> to<00:03:19.239> do<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.810> we'll<00:03:20.470> do<00:03:21.060> number<00:03:22.060> 35

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
super easy to do so we'll do number 35

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.920 
super easy to do so we'll do number 35
and<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.980> way<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.400> we're<00:03:24.700> number<00:03:24.880> 35<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.660> is

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
and the way I know we're number 35 is is

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.600 
and the way I know we're number 35 is is
because<00:03:26.200> I'm<00:03:26.320> following<00:03:26.560> my<00:03:26.950> legend<00:03:27.400> right
