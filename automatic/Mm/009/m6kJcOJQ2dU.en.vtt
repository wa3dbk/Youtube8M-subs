00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.020 
actually I think so let's say I want
something<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.390> color<00:02:30.830> hit<00:02:31.830> okay<00:02:35.030> wait

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
something like this color hit okay wait

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.480 
something like this color hit okay wait
for<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.570> now<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.770> car<00:02:38.010> actually

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
for it and now it's this car actually

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.050 
for it and now it's this car actually
it's<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> very<00:02:39.060> nice<00:02:40.550> setting<00:02:41.550> because<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.910> can

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
it's a very nice setting because you can

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.030 
it's a very nice setting because you can
choose<00:02:42.240> custom<00:02:42.660> colors<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.230> know<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.470> basic

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
choose custom colors I know it's basic

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520 
choose custom colors I know it's basic
however<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.540> gives<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.960> actually<00:02:46.290> quite<00:02:46.500> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
however it gives you actually quite a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.440 
however it gives you actually quite a
bit<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.800> color<00:02:47.520> scheme<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.120> can<00:02:48.240> choose

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
bit of color scheme so you can choose

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.660 
bit of color scheme so you can choose
from<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.320> I'm<00:02:49.710> gonna<00:02:49.920> change<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670

default<00:02:50.850> blue<00:02:53.210> hit<00:02:54.210> okay<00:02:58.250> as<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.670> see

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
Klondike freecell and many others so you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.380 
Klondike freecell and many others so you
don't<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.560> even<00:03:10.830> choose<00:03:11.160> that<00:03:11.370> many<00:03:11.610> you

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
don't have to even choose that many you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.350 
don't have to even choose that many you
can<00:03:12.950> basically<00:03:13.950> choose<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.700> game<00:03:14.850> save<00:03:15.210> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
can basically choose the game save the

automatically<00:03:20.240> obviously<00:03:21.240> hence<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.810> title

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
automatically obviously hence the title
