00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.140
 hello everyone today we decided with the team 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.500
 go hiking village beeches 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.280
 here is an encore liked the treatment 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.280
 and your locality 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.250
 now 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.880
 now we will drop the finder new and layer up 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.570
 look at camps 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.570
 at the wedding long 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.700
 you came here at night it's on 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.760
 I already see him on 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.530
 all icons 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.250
 so how would we 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.860
 and guests are organist 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.480
 I met him in the morning looking for now 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.290
 we will go on to choose a place for 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.290
 of our camp 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920
 currency 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.560
 I am generally cool 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.070
 and will also cost player 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.070
 pancakes are dangerous 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.000
 zander 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.370
 let's go look for a new camp site 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.960
 from say cookies are very big 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.730
 English mountains then why so much water 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.300
 this where we went there the dam was 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.590
 a member 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.260
 Collagen turns out there that regulates 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.599
 there is more less common dam we opened 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.870
 we think and therefore such a large flow 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:49.489
 such a sound of water but this place but not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.489
 fits so we go look further 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.730
 it seems to be a good glade for 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.230
 camp now go down and check 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.310
 I have to go down now very difficult 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.310
 descent without 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.640
 and quietly though exhale sleep 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.550
 I saw loud I think it's better 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.550
 than here 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.159
 you have almost climbed the branches 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.090
 this is surely an easy trust 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.250
 It looks winds spacer rack options 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.780
 you 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.780
 the fastest hall for this plot is up to 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.780
 us 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:29.039
 Now we are going to camp and today 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.009
 we will go home now we see 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.030
 tights targeted precisely those on which 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.030
 ate kindergarten 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.279
 dollar 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.279
 but 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.680
 now 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:10.799
 now we go back no loss all 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.799
 group complete create 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.760
 hot lunch is not free 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.380
 they are extremely a lot of your legs to help badly
