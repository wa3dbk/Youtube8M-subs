00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.380
 [music] 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.880
 [music] 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 guys all hello think not one 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.509
 watched all sorts of movies 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.340
 American and saw there such a machine 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.140
 which destroys the paper meaning you 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.439
 thrust the paper he cuts it all and 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.960
 turns little bumazhechki and something 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.449
 I sat in the evening once chose the goods 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.180
 which can be shown and then thought 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.280
 there may have been such a machine in china 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.680
 I found it on the store Tanya case 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.479
 written 23 dollars to be honest I no longer 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.159
 I remember even how much it costs a link to 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:49.089
 this machine will be a description 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:51.940
 let's see what a miracle it is 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.890
 and can now and test how she 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.010
 it works because it is interesting interesting 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 Then on the principle was quickly not 15 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:16.590
 somewhere this envelope is cut here it is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.510
 here it is a mini machine shorter paper 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.040
 destroyers 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.070
 so from what the masses work four 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.080
 batteries or adapter hope adapter 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.790
 will we have it or not now is shorter 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.620
 let's see it like this now 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:42.100
 such a gadget become a new store 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:43.990
 open here it is the machine itself and on the block 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.730
 power supply probably not 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:52.790
 although there is no lace there is yusbi 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.590
 cord you set my eyes 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:01.400
 we will get it herself already 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.880
 so we have a container where actually 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.550
 will all paper be 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:14.030
 falling out there is lace instruction on 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:20.720
 English so batteries here they have 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:23.810
 how to open us does not open that alpi 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.790
 come to the rescue fingertip 4 pieces 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:31.520
 batteries one-two-three-four to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.209
 or as understood there is a bundle so 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.280
 here or we have a set and 90 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.530
 here is the adapter 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.200
 I'll try it all now through 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.350
 powerbank to show you it will pull 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 or not pull turn on turn it off 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 Something I do not know what kind of mode can 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.930
 unscrews in the return line can not be thrust 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.800
 ties can not be thrust two sheets 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.760
 cannot be thrust 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.230
 these say no choice gate how are they 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.680
 paper clips and do not put your hands 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.920
 cool stuff like that for a long time 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.650
 hope to work normally 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.840
 so now I take a piece of paper trying this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.720
 business and you guys are the whole thing 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:26.000
 show so guys through power banks 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.410
 it's all connected it works now 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.840
 Wait 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.989
 or does not work may need a piece of paper 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.360
 shove it shorter here it will be 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.489
 I took a couple not from the declaration of old 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.720
 so we will now try to to to to at 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.709
 this time everything works 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.849
 so as you see the piece of paper and put therefore 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:55.660
 probably need to like this now try 2 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:04:02.890
 the fig itself here it is cool there is 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:05.010
 the case so that beeps and beeps no and so 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.829
 there is such a thing 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.370
 probably need to continue to scroll it somehow 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:15.879
 and here still climbs it there 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.510
 shorter turn off and let's want if 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:24.389
 such a subject rushed we will sit down 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.389
 on destroy paper insert 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:37.510
 I squeezed that there is a weak motor 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:41.620
 so some shit about yourself 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.110
 all the same, the return was to be milled 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.590
 we somehow Che you did not get it, see 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:54.010
 how cuts cool motor would be stronger 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:58.710
 here can powerbank not pull 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:07.810
 though come on come on 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:11.580
 destroyed with overclocking, let me think 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:16.320
 thick piece of paper so all the same 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.320
 guys own a fig yourself 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.140
 let's go 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:31.340
 I ate everything, but here we have such 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:37.160
 here are the petals now I want to try 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:39.680
 take it so take it from us here it is 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.750
 declarations are not just one leaflet 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:52.450
 like that in half and think fit 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:57.580
 easy and another topic let's go 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:06:02.390
 as you can see everything ok as you see everything ok 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:06.230
 we all get these papers here 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.419
 it turns out such a reworked 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.510
 by the way cuts it into very small pieces 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.360
 therefore on on these nothing is no longer 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:18.410
 dismantle though it is as you see bad 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.400
 cut right now there are yes pieces 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:26.030
 glued, that is, without cutting to the end 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:28.100
 so finding which pieces it works but 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.590
 need one piece that is two 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.010
 leaflet will not work shorter if you 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.700
 nothing to do batteries as you can see 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.710
 are needed 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:40.970
 can be used via usb can 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.130
 connect to a laptop here and in short you can 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.140
 so that sit on come off to 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:48.800
 laptop can connect powerbank here 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:51.380
 I connected the force just to throw to if 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.390
 you have yusbi and sit shorter here 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.460
 do cool stuff like that 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.390
 the thing is really important that she 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:02.000
 I am glad I can work, in principle, this 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.900
 piece destroy all put her in 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.570
 kit 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.760
 collect back is going to very 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.810
 quickly as you can see become or in half 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:18.710
 the process has begun 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:30.010
 goodbye so it's like that 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:34.400
 good bye bye bye all guys 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:37.389
 oh backward climbed like headlights 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:40.100
 let's make everything shorter here with us 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:42.260
 reworked all the guys all thanks 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.669
 awesome machine if you want yourself so 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.919
 the link will be in the description 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:49.150
 subscribe to the channel put the likes to 

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.150
 new meetings yet bye
