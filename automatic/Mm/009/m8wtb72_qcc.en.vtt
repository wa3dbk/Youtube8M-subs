00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 This is a new hp introductory video 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.500
 50g flight 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.170
 I'm doing with the videos that the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 monster using the player who is the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.960
 first of them 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:25.160
 The first subject we 're going to deal with 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 on the face of the calculator the one 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.170
 As you can see everything says the resident 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.390
 had and why did I decide to go 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.540
 putting him explaining how it works 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:44.370
 one how you identify the home screen 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.020
 hp because it has received many 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.360
 comments from people who do not have 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:54.059
 following the example and generally 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 this problem is related to the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.340
 hp configuration 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.109
 Whenever you go do something 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.280
 foot operation 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.770
 check the first how are the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.479
 Settings that you can have you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
 some tips you looking at a screen 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.310
 initial 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 so here in this first line he is 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.280
 demonstrates some options related to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 configuration does not mean that we 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 we are at home 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.119
 we work in a year I have other 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.220
 use options so I can 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:34.470
 working in grades it will appear as 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:39.479
 of gray and I can work in golds 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.619
 then it will write that a circle 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.740
 complete 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 It has 400 degrees so you have to 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.270
 be careful about this setting 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.609
 while you are using 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.950
 because the value will give different and 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.909
 Some functions only work in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.670
 determine the settings 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.200
 ac x yz is means that we are 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.069
 working on a Cartesian kaka plan or 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.289
 rectangular 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:12.170
 the other way of viewing and would have a r 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.560
 sign of less than oz would be 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 Solar cut or cylindrical or else 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.760
 it would display that as a re2 signal 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.790
 signs of better and younger would be 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.489
 related to spherical coordinates 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.140
 then each of the bodies you are 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.049
 Do you have a profile like this? 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.940
 configuration is to tell you 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:40.190
 working with real numbers have been 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.250
 be in complexes and x is means that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.019
 the default variable you are 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.769
 using the title may replace the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.400
 italian 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:52.310
 Let's use some function you that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.650
 solve for the variable to simplify 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.549
 the calculation then it will consider that the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.459
 x is to evaluate the standard is this someone here 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:07.190
 they mean working in the 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.510
 algorithm and not in rtpn is that I go 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.590
 show soon 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.190
 as you change these settings and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.349
 here he shows you where you are where 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.310
 that these variables are saved if they are saved 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:24.310
 and here are the least I will not go 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:34.400
 explain all - at this point in time 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.840
 are some other discussion explains 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.290
 that serves each one of them 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.270
 the menu you enter here in the mod 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.770
 so this is where you change those 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.040
 options here said then how I was 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.750
 talking to the radio for years if you choose 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.450
 You choose the shows here that white. 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.450
 want to change year and these boys here 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.110
 means these keys down here 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.420
 select the shows 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:01.550
 so you can put in beans or 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:05.000
 radio show 's golden years is one that 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.140
 cancels the xyz 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.060
 he will change with respect to this one 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:18.560
 thing the coordinate system here 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.540
 so I cry the popular or hopefully 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.430
 also has the format of the number 1 eu 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:29.660
 I like working with the training in 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.940
 engineering with 3 values ​​here 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.590
 You will do it will make 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.790
 the fans are displayed in a 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:46.460
 different format with an example here 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:51.370
 3.5 places 3.5 times 10 to 0 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.370
 if I put 0.05 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.200
 with 50 times 10 -3 personally to 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.520
 anyone who has allergies will use 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.080
 in this format and the rpm module and I already 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.900
 time I will not teach the next time 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:14.110
 video will treat this kind of 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.640
 Calculator has some configuration 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:23.350
 other options here that I will not enter 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:27.100
 at that moment and then this is the screen 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:29.280
 weeks of htc until the next 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.280
 video
