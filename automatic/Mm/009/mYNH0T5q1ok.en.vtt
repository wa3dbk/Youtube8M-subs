meant<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:05.240> 64<00:01:06.240> kilometers<00:01:07.140> squared<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
meant to be 64 kilometers squared and

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.520 
meant to be 64 kilometers squared and
you'll<00:01:08.880> be<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.240> island<00:01:09.630> called<00:01:10.229> odd

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
you'll be on this island called odd

you'll be on this island called odd
Skellig<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:12.049> believe<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> main<00:01:13.530> island

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
Skellig I believe that's the main island

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.120 
Skellig I believe that's the main island
you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> seen<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> witcher<00:01:15.479> 3

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.469 
you know if you seen the witcher 3
gameplay<00:01:17.130> footage<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.670> e3<00:01:17.850> i'm<00:01:18.150> guessing

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
gameplay footage from e3 i'm guessing

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
gameplay footage from e3 i'm guessing
that's<00:01:18.810> where<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> takes<00:01:19.380> place<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:20.490> that's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that's where it takes place but that's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.350 
that's where it takes place but that's
massive<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> massive<00:01:22.340> well<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:23.520> we

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
massive that is massive well that's we

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.550 
massive that is massive well that's we
really<00:01:25.080> big<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.619> an<00:01:25.770> area<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:27.060> i'm<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.500> sure

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
really big for an area but i'm not sure

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.880 
really big for an area but i'm not sure
how<00:01:29.100> big<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.909> i<00:01:30.150> might<00:01:30.890> because

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
how big it is because i might because

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.660 
how big it is because i might because
i'm<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.939> completely<00:01:33.210> sure<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.509> i<00:01:33.780> think

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
i'm not completely sure but i think

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
i'm not completely sure but i think
there<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:37.500> game<00:01:37.799> worlds<00:01:38.130> bigger

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
there are some some game worlds bigger

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.719 
there are some some game worlds bigger
than<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.850> i'm<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.240> sure<00:01:39.900> exactly<00:01:40.020> because

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
than that i'm not sure exactly because

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.639 
than that i'm not sure exactly because
um<00:01:41.729> i'll<00:01:42.630> literally<00:01:43.020> off<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> top<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.560> head

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
um i'll literally off the top of my head

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.350 
um i'll literally off the top of my head
i<00:01:43.799> can't<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.490> anything<00:01:45.799> bigger<00:01:46.799> than<00:01:47.360> 64

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
i can't think of anything bigger than 64

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.770 
i can't think of anything bigger than 64
kilometers<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.990> know<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.350> any<00:01:50.340> way

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
kilometers but I know there are any way

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.469 
kilometers but I know there are any way
yeah<00:01:51.780> that's<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.439> really<00:01:52.710> big<00:01:53.040> size<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.360> if

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
yeah that's a really big size and if

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
yeah that's a really big size and if
they've<00:01:54.720> got<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> amount<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.280> detail

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
they've got and the amount of detail

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
they've got and the amount of detail
they<00:01:56.909> packed<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:58.110> gameplay<00:01:58.350> footage<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
they packed into the gameplay footage of

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.550 
they packed into the gameplay footage of
just<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.369> area<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.030> they<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.079> like

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
just one area if they can do that like

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.550 
just one area if they can do that like
everywhere<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> 64<00:02:03.000> kilometers<00:02:03.450> squared

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
everywhere in the 64 kilometers squared

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.889 
everywhere in the 64 kilometers squared
that<00:02:04.560> would<00:02:04.649> be<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> very<00:02:05.280> very<00:02:05.939> amazing<00:02:06.689> game

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
that would be a very very amazing game

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
it might be a rubbish port but i'm

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.150 
it might be a rubbish port but i'm
hoping<00:03:24.690> it's<00:03:24.959> not<00:03:25.019> I'm<00:03:25.530> hoping<00:03:26.010> they're
