these freaks okay yeah I've not one or

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.010 
these freaks okay yeah I've not one or
two<00:01:33.689> possible<00:01:34.500> reasons<00:01:34.909> what<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.240> cost

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
two possible reasons what the cost

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.679 
two possible reasons what the cost
yeah<00:01:37.380> i<00:01:37.409> knowing<00:01:37.799> beeping<00:01:38.220> glitch<00:01:38.549> has<00:01:39.390> been

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
yeah i knowing beeping glitch has been

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.710 
yeah i knowing beeping glitch has been
showing<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.530> mum<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> island<00:01:41.720> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
showing up and mum was on the island and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.340 
showing up and mum was on the island and
then<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:44.780> first<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.930> all<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
then know that first of all is that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
then know that first of all is that
perhaps<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.759> side<00:01:48.030> effect<00:01:48.479> from<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
perhaps it's some side effect from the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.660 
perhaps it's some side effect from the
new<00:01:49.890> version<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.909> fraps<00:01:51.270> three<00:01:51.869> points<00:01:52.290> 2.0

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
new version of fraps three points 2.0

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.520 
new version of fraps three points 2.0
and<00:01:55.300> although<00:01:55.420> under<00:01:56.170> normal<00:01:57.159> footage<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
and although under normal footage that

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.469 
and although under normal footage that
beeping<00:01:59.800> sound<00:01:59.950> doesn't<00:02:00.400> appear<00:02:00.880> only<00:02:01.120> when<00:02:01.420> I

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
beeping sound doesn't appear only when I

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.520 
beeping sound doesn't appear only when I
combine<00:02:01.810> in<00:02:02.680> my<00:02:02.860> gameplay<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:03.550> footage<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:05.380> it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
combine in my gameplay and footage so it

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.859 
combine in my gameplay and footage so it
might<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.800> something<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.550> my<00:02:06.790> video<00:02:07.330> program

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
might be something with my video program

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.919 
might be something with my video program
Corvo<00:02:08.289> video<00:02:08.679> studio<00:02:09.130> but<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.330> far<00:02:10.539> I've<00:02:10.690> never

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
Corvo video studio but so far I've never

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.699 
Corvo video studio but so far I've never
found<00:02:11.370> encountered<00:02:12.370> one<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.880> such<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> problem

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
found encountered one in such a problem

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.290 
found encountered one in such a problem
certain<00:02:14.709> man<00:02:15.070> cleats<00:02:17.160> but<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.220> other<00:02:18.970> thing

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
certain man cleats but the other thing

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.449 
certain man cleats but the other thing
that's<00:02:19.480> different<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.739> there's<00:02:21.370> going

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
that's different is that there's going

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.510 
that's different is that there's going
to<00:02:21.670> be<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.850> cinematic<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:23.260> might<00:02:23.739> be<00:02:24.040> what

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
to be a cinematic that's might be what

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.550 
to be a cinematic that's might be what
costs<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.180> problem<00:02:25.630> when<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.870> combine<00:02:26.170> stuff

should get a minor amount of ease about
one<00:04:00.129> point<00:04:00.400> I<00:04:00.640> believe<00:04:01.019> from<00:04:02.019> killing<00:04:02.860> an

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
one point I believe from killing an

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.300 
one point I believe from killing an
entire<00:04:04.060> squad<00:04:04.660> because<00:04:05.140> they<00:04:05.349> should<00:04:06.129> get

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
entire squad because they should get

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.289 
entire squad because they should get
suspicious<00:04:06.940> of<00:04:07.090> their<00:04:07.629> agents<00:04:08.200> not<00:04:08.409> returning

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
suspicious of their agents not returning

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.000 
suspicious of their agents not returning
what<00:04:10.299> are<00:04:10.450> these<00:04:10.540> guys<00:04:10.750> panicking<00:04:11.349> about<00:04:11.440> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
what are these guys panicking about the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.189 
what are these guys panicking about the
Freak<00:04:12.250> itself<00:04:13.799> panic<00:04:14.799> by<00:04:14.950> violence<00:04:16.859> violence

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
Freak itself panic by violence violence

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.659 
Freak itself panic by violence violence
so<00:04:20.199> they're<00:04:20.530> going<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.160> they<00:04:21.280> don't<00:04:21.489> get

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
so they're going so they don't get

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.790 
so they're going so they don't get
freaked<00:04:22.030> out<00:04:22.210> by<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.720> freaking<00:04:23.199> themselves

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
freaked out by the freaking themselves

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.650 
freaked out by the freaking themselves
huh<00:04:25.500> okay<00:04:29.669> let's<00:04:30.669> see<00:04:30.850> smama<00:04:31.150> still<00:04:31.479> around

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
huh okay let's see smama still around

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.010 
huh okay let's see smama still around
yes<00:04:35.250> then<00:04:36.250> we'll<00:04:36.430> get<00:04:36.610> to<00:04:36.789> see<00:04:37.030> how<00:04:37.210> a<00:04:37.240> freak

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
yes then we'll get to see how a freak

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.469 
yes then we'll get to see how a freak
matches<00:04:38.590> up<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:39.039> a<00:04:39.070> super<00:04:39.520> agents<00:04:39.970> more<00:04:40.300> at

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
matches up to a super agents more at

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:43.980 
matches up to a super agents more at
least<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.780> lowest<00:04:41.139> super<00:04:41.440> agent<00:04:42.389> if<00:04:43.389> numbnuts

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
least the lowest super agent if numbnuts

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.710 
least the lowest super agent if numbnuts
doesn't<00:04:44.500> wander<00:04:45.160> around<00:04:45.460> away<00:04:46.240> from<00:04:46.450> them<00:04:46.599> oh

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
there's another group of investigators

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.129 
there's another group of investigators
seems<00:04:51.430> like<00:04:51.610> I've<00:04:51.789> got<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.000> bit<00:04:52.360> of<00:04:52.389> heats<00:04:52.840> with

seems like I've got a bit of heats with

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.050 
seems like I've got a bit of heats with
Sabre<00:04:53.610> because<00:04:54.610> of<00:04:54.729> the<00:04:54.820> size<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.660> this<00:04:55.780> group

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
Sabre because of the size of this group

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.870

and more heats bring smart and you know
kinds<00:05:01.300> of<00:05:01.389> agents<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:01.960> bigger<00:05:02.200> groups<00:05:02.560> of

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
kinds of agents and bigger groups of

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.020 
kinds of agents and bigger groups of
course<00:05:04.830> now<00:05:05.830> we've<00:05:06.220> got<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> deserter

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
course now we've got a deserter

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.409

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
now the Freak is attached slower than

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.450 
now the Freak is attached slower than
most<00:05:19.479> agents<00:05:20.139> it<00:05:20.200> seems

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.510 

okay<00:05:24.460> there<00:05:24.850> anything<00:05:25.300> else<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.840> can<00:05:25.900> do<00:05:26.370> at<00:05:27.370> the
