it's very literal because otherwise you

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.220 
it's very literal because otherwise you
can<00:02:29.640> get<00:02:29.760> lost<00:02:29.820> in<00:02:30.180> translation<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.989> want<00:02:31.170> to

twice<00:02:39.090> they're<00:02:39.420> always<00:02:39.540> gonna<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.080> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
twice they're always gonna be like a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.430 
twice they're always gonna be like a
little<00:02:40.380> bit<00:02:40.590> different<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:42.290> don't<00:02:43.290> think

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
little bit different I don't think

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
there's many places in the world that

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.259 
there's many places in the world that
can<00:02:45.690> mimic<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:46.410> piece<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.130> denim<00:02:47.370> or<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> t-shirt

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
can mimic a piece of denim or a t-shirt

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.810 
can mimic a piece of denim or a t-shirt
that<00:02:48.480> comes<00:02:48.810> out<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.110> LA<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:50.160> dominate<00:02:50.670> in

that comes out of LA we dominate in

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.900 
that comes out of LA we dominate in
those<00:02:51.239> two<00:02:51.450> categories

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
those two categories

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
a unique way and it's very validating to

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.980 
a unique way and it's very validating to
find<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.670> GQ<00:03:05.700> thought<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.570> same

like<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.150> real<00:03:39.870> it's<00:03:40.200> not<00:03:40.470> watered<00:03:40.830> down<00:03:40.860> we

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
like it's real it's not watered down we

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.940 
like it's real it's not watered down we
don't<00:03:41.459> we're<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.090> trying<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.420> ourselves
