00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.100
 hello to all and do not master it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.510
 found for a little special video 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.359
 to announce you simply 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 and although I'm finally partners to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.630
 youtube you may have noticed 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the thumbnails that started to 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 to swarm a little bit everywhere on but 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 my different videos and you know 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.210
 obviously being a partner 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
 certainly gives an advantage I do not think 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.789
 especially to money of course since 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 you can imagine with so little rim 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.170
 of view I do not do myself specially 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 a lot of money 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.060
 it's not specifically to that that I 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.880
 thought 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.020
 by requesting a youtube partnership 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.780
 which interests me especially in this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.060
 partnership well it's the different 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.949
 features we offer for 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.400
 a little bit to make your life easier for 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.990
 make life easier for youtube hours you 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 may have already experienced this situation 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.570
 with a new bear and the terminals and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 you may have noticed that nothing 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 had not changed in their way of doing 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.950
 videos, well I'll be the same 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 simply youtube partnership 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.700
 as I told you let me 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.020
 just to have some 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.330
 features besides what they me 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 will make life a little easier and then 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 who can help me simply 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.130
 extend my channel to expand its content 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.350
 is to be to extend also the scope of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.330
 videos 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.550
 so be aware that nothing will change 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.369
 in my way of making videos 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.860
 I will always suggest the same thing 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.050
 than before at best then if you know it 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.210
 I changed my configuration recently 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.920
 so I can play a lot more 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.710
 easily and then turn 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.930
 videos much more easily 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.420
 and as I promised I obviously 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.989
 will make a video of the editing of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.370
 the computer since you've been 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.430
 many asked me 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.200
 so here I am 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.079
 I tell you at the next door 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.349
 you well the video of the editing will arrive 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.670
 within a very short time 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.450
 come on me I'm not telling you the next 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.690
