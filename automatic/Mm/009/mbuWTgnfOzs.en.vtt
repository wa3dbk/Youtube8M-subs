00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
might say you know what a 4G network

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.060 
might say you know what a 4G network
might<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.539> well<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.229> course<00:01:04.260> that's<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:05.010> to

might do well of course that's going to
be<00:01:05.189> beneficial<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.180> iphone<00:01:06.650> even

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
be beneficial to the new iphone even

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
be beneficial to the new iphone even
though<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> might<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.670> long<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.210> say

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
than half of what we think might happen

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
than half of what we think might happen
and<00:01:21.299> i<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:21.840> thought<00:01:22.020> i<00:01:22.049> would<00:01:22.140> share<00:01:22.439> with

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
2011 year so with that says sources say

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.270 
2011 year so with that says sources say
that<00:01:57.780> Apple<00:01:58.320> will<00:01:58.469> wait<00:01:58.680> until<00:01:58.860> verizon

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
that Apple will wait until verizon

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120 
that Apple will wait until verizon
launchers<00:01:59.939> their<00:02:00.119> 4g<00:02:00.750> networks<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.799> next

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
launchers their 4g networks then next

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.179 
launchers their 4g networks then next
june<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.299> following<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> new<00:02:04.380> iphone<00:02:04.829> 4

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
june the following of the new iphone 4

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.429 
june the following of the new iphone 4
will<00:02:05.640> run<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:05.909> verizon<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> carrier<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
will run on verizon as a carrier for the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.979 
will run on verizon as a carrier for the
iphone<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> does<00:02:08.369> make<00:02:08.610> sense<00:02:08.720> some<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
iphone so it does make sense some of you

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.390 
iphone so it does make sense some of you
might<00:02:10.140> say<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.440> know<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.770> might<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.220> make

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
might say you know it might not make

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
might say you know it might not make
sense<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:12.090> if

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
sense but if if

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.600 
sense but if if
is<00:02:13.230> actually<00:02:13.620> thinking<00:02:13.980> about<00:02:14.010> doing<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> I

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
is actually thinking about doing that I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.100 
is actually thinking about doing that I
think<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.120> would<00:02:15.210> be<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.450> best<00:02:15.480> way<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.900> go

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
think that would be the best way to go

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.860 
think that would be the best way to go
so<00:02:16.560> Apple<00:02:17.160> we<00:02:17.370> might<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.270> some<00:02:18.600> things

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
so Apple we might think have some things

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.110 
so Apple we might think have some things
in<00:02:19.050> mind<00:02:19.110> regarding<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.010> new<00:02:20.160> iphone<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.880> come

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
in mind regarding the new iphone to come

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.870 
in mind regarding the new iphone to come
as<00:02:21.930> Verizon<00:02:22.500> launches<00:02:22.920> their<00:02:23.100> 4g<00:02:23.490> networks

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
as Verizon launches their 4g networks

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.730 
as Verizon launches their 4g networks
maybe<00:02:24.090> Apple<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.870> wants<00:02:25.170> their<00:02:25.320> next

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
maybe Apple actually wants their next

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.100 
maybe Apple actually wants their next
phone<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.520> following<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> iphone<00:02:27.600> 4<00:02:27.900> to

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
phone the following of the iphone 4 to

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.830 
phone the following of the iphone 4 to
run<00:02:28.350> on<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.710> 4G<00:02:29.130> networks<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.510> know<00:02:30.600> possibly

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
run on the 4G networks you know possibly

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.600 
run on the 4G networks you know possibly
it<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.320> be<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> great<00:02:31.710> thing<00:02:31.980> first<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.520> all

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
it will be a great thing first of all

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.150 
it will be a great thing first of all

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
not as beneficial as they think so
