00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.270 
gonna spend that much money on my
eyebrows<00:01:41.700> I'll<00:01:42.210> spend<00:01:42.659> money<00:01:43.229> on<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.799> higher

on<00:01:44.490> makeup<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.210> just<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.570> from<00:01:45.780> our<00:01:45.899> arrows

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
on makeup but just not from our arrows
just<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.210> really

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just because I don't think it's really

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.090

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
pencils and then I just started getting

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.009 
pencils and then I just started getting
these<00:02:16.879> because<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.329> was<00:02:17.450> looking<00:02:17.689> for<00:02:17.840> like<00:02:17.959> a

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
these because I was looking for like a

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.420 
these because I was looking for like a
cheap<00:02:18.290> alternative<00:02:18.439> for<00:02:19.069> something<00:02:19.310> I've

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430

been using these for a while so I don't

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.089 
been using these for a while so I don't
remember<00:02:21.049> when<00:02:21.799> I<00:02:21.829> switched<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.579> this<00:02:22.819> but<00:02:23.150> I

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099

use this for underneath my eyebrows to
kind<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:19.940> define<00:03:20.630> them<00:03:40.989> what<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.020> like<00:03:42.200> about

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
kind of define them what I like about

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.650 
kind of define them what I like about
this<00:03:42.410> one<00:03:42.709> in<00:03:43.310> particular<00:03:43.459> better<00:03:44.360> than<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
this one in particular better than the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.510 
this one in particular better than the
black<00:03:44.870> one<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.410> this<00:03:45.680> one<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:45.950> almost

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
black one is that this one is almost

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.820 
black one is that this one is almost
more<00:03:46.730> waxy<00:03:47.420> than<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.720> black<00:03:47.870> one<00:03:48.050> is<00:03:48.170> like

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
more waxy than the black one is like

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.650 
more waxy than the black one is like
when<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.100> apply<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.489> one<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:50.000> my<00:03:50.090> eyebrows<00:03:50.450> it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
when I apply this one to my eyebrows it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.600 
when I apply this one to my eyebrows it
makes<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.170> hair<00:03:51.350> stay<00:03:51.830> in<00:03:51.950> place<00:03:52.190> but<00:03:52.400> if<00:03:52.520> I

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
makes the hair stay in place but if I

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.979 
makes the hair stay in place but if I
were<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.940> just<00:03:53.270> apply<00:03:53.480> the<00:03:53.600> block<00:03:53.810> when

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
were to just apply the block when

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.440 
were to just apply the block when
tabares<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.670> wouldn't<00:03:55.670> I<00:03:55.850> don't<00:03:56.209> know<00:03:56.300> it's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
tabares it wouldn't I don't know it's

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.180 
tabares it wouldn't I don't know it's
hard<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.690> explain<00:03:56.900> this<00:03:57.560> one's<00:03:57.800> a<00:03:57.890> lot<00:03:58.070> more

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
hard to explain this one's a lot more

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.400 
hard to explain this one's a lot more
waxy<00:03:58.790> because<00:03:59.150> even<00:03:59.420> when<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.570> sharpen<00:04:00.320> this

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
waxy because even when I sharpen this

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.949 
waxy because even when I sharpen this
pencil<00:04:00.800> it<00:04:00.950> sharpens<00:04:01.310> a<00:04:01.370> lot<00:04:01.550> easier<00:04:01.790> this<00:04:02.600> one

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
pencil it sharpens a lot easier this one

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.830 
pencil it sharpens a lot easier this one
tends<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.530> melt<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.010> break<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.730> lot<00:04:05.090> more<00:04:05.300> so

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
tends to melt and break a lot more so

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.720 
tends to melt and break a lot more so
I'm<00:04:06.200> not<00:04:06.410> sure<00:04:06.770> they're<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.130> mean<00:04:07.250> they're<00:04:07.430> the

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
I'm not sure they're I mean they're the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.539
