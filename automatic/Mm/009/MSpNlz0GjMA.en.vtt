00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.070
 hello everybody today let's see how 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.440
 make a vase of using one 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.330
 plastic bottle 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.170
 I will use the same technique used 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:27.280
 for this video that I leave on 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:30.360
 as an ashtray rises with a latina 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.360
 start right away 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:43.330
 I make a hole and follow the edge of the 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:01:00.670
 my label to cut say the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 as accurate as possible straight and time to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:14.740
 new label and that's what 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.710
 we get now I have to cut the lines 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.280
 verticals that are all of the same 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.280
 thickness 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.369
 and I do an inch and a half 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.400
 as you can see I'm helping you with one with 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.970
 a team with a ruler goes also goes 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.970
 well but fine 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:18.770
 I made my first wide tongue 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.110
 one centimeter and a half 8 centimeters long 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.480
 and now I do the same thing precisely 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.090
 for the whole edge of my bottle 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.820
 now that I have cut my stripes there is 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.220
 a more or less straight but do flip 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.220
 the bottle is at the end 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:52.270
 forming a so we say a sun and I go 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:58.360
 to crush well a little we would always have 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:03.000
 pressed and crushes well I also help 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:06.960
 precisely by raising the various strips 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.960
 this is what you have to get 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.410
 good but from April the first language is the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.640
 fold in this way making it pass 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:29.140
 above the two strips to his 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:35.800
 right and then the photo step in the catch 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:38.260
 photo in this way the folded I have 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.160
 skipped two strips and I did it 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 pass under the third the same thing 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.630
 I do with that next jump two 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.630
 Stripes 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.819
 was passed under 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.980
 in this way 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:05.129
 same thing with the one after i go to 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:10.680
 pass it by skipping only one 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:20.669
 strip and from here, however, only knows the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:26.130
 same passed under and fold remember 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:30.900
 to bend well and to joke e 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.820
 I continue like this until I finish the tour ed 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.490
 here the final result did not come to me 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.550
 perfect but still enough 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 nice I put myself on facebook anyway 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.680
 also a photo with the summary of the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.870
 steps to follow to have then 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.270
 precisely this effect 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.990
 now I'm going to color it using 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.580
 of cans 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.860
 as you can see I also applied the 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.680
 lace using simple 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.260
 vinyl glue to block the ends 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.220
 or colored with a large can 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:06.000
 lines my bottle and now i go with 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:10.310
 of the spray glue to cover the part 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.919
 upper then pour into the micro 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.919
 flakes like these have an ice effect 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.760
 this is the final result I wear 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.750
 as always the photos of the object you 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.940
 eliminated and used in this case vi 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.950
 I always invite my page now 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.830
 facebook to stay days anyway 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.600
 maybe even exchange opinions or 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.800
 however also some photos on yours 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.390
 projects 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.890
 I greet you and thank you for having seen 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.240
 this video that I hope as always there 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.240
 be useful to the next hello
