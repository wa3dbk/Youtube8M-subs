 and six months later on 22 October 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.249
 1991 was the happiest day of all 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.249

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.980

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.180
 I visited like once or twice a week 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.089
 and whenever he came he bought pizza from 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.040
 domino's when I was about a year old 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.589
 in the shower and I slipped and opened my 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.280

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.829
 tear at school I always 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.680

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.790
 It was the scar of a girl I liked a lot 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.589
 play outside to the marbles secretly 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.059
 I loved all that because 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:03.110
 he ran very fast and always won 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.970
 when we play the little cars when 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.549
 in kindergarten and my mom put me to ballet 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.549

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.799
 going every year my whole family were going to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.689
 san felipe and they were the best days of 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.090
 year as I wish we had never 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.400
 stopped going in the second degree one 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.770
 competition in my escort school 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.259
 and I had to be the standard bearer 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.100
 that was what everyone wanted to be, because I 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.259
 offers life and we win and also in 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.420
 second grade I entered the catechism and the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.299
 instructor did not want me to be 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.369
 there because he said that I know very girl 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.710
 but I stayed when I finished that degree 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.729
 my sister Karen mom and I moved to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.069

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.319
 also to see my dad would 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.329
 I spoke at the beginning but they are nothing 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.630
 interested in what I had to say 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.549
 so stop calling and he never called 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.530
 when I entered the school in reverse of 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.869
 california instead of entering fourth 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.099
 I entered the fifth grade because 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.259
 he was very smart 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.360
 it is not true after the day I was born 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.489
 I did not speak English so the school 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.899
 It was a bit difficult at first because 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.720
 all spoke English and very few 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.880
 they spoke Spanish my teacher was very very 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 Linda was American and is called months-

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.049
 read I loved my glasses because 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 had a pink line around the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.519
 sixth grade framework between a team of 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.140
 football was called that álex and klose de 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.480

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 my favorites but I never Tigo days 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.400
 because they always put me in defense 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 time again and mom did not want it to come out 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.600
 because they called me I did not have a hat like that 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.790
 I got dizzy a bag of groceries in the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.850
 head and let me go out with my cousins ​​to 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.770
 playing in the snow in seventh grade I 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.750
 Remove the lenses because my mom bought 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.430
 contact lenses I remember that a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.260
 partner made fun of me because my 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.970
 daughters are very very thick and dark 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.640
 He never has taken me because I had 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.290
 lenses so I would cover them in terms of 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.209

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.980
 I hated my teeth were a lot of bows and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.630
 I always covered my mouth when I laughed 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.310
 so nobody would see them then the 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.620

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.690

 very sad and I cried a lot very much 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.580
 because I was not going to see all my 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.190

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.019

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.130
 second hand store 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.019

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.690
 bald my mom did not like the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.250
 idea but I respect my decision one day 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 you were the author of my sister and I 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.800
 I went to YouTube and saw that I already had videos 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.050

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.360
 is that it does too but that I do not know 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.610

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.920
 I did blog, I really liked the idea 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.380
 because I saw a lot of books in 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.080
 youtube and so we started but not me 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.000

 daily blogs again and we started them 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.350
 do in English again but we gave ourselves 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.090
 account that would be better in Spanish already 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.250
 that our family spoke in Spanish 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.560
