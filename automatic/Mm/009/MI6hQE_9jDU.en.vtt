00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 good afternoon have the users of the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 latin android community in this video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.099
 tutorial I'll show you as a router 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 the samsung galaxy s3 team of the form 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.630
 easier and step by step the first thing that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 let's verify is that this team does not 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.070
 is not a root user yet as 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.780
 you can see the super user is not 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.610
 find installed 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.220
 you can verify that it is not installed 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.390
 the second thing we have to do what 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.000
 first thing we should do is 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.920
 download the files and have them in 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.800
 our pc the files I will leave 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.740
 at the bottom of this video in the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.110
 section information then 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.809
 we're going to turn off the computer and we're going to 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.280
 turn on in download mode seems to 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.380
 turning on the computer in download mode is 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.150
 volume down the home button and 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.300
 the power button let's hope that 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.900
 turn off completely now we are going to 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.129
 let's try to turn it on ok let's go 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.940
 give volume up which is the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 option to continue 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.050
 let's connect it to the usb cable so that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.050
 have connection to the pc 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.240
 how can you see the computer what 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280
 detected I'm going to leave it here aside 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.470
 so you can see the moment of 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 installation what is going to go 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.580
 what is updated as well as the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.690
 download let's open or ding 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.690
 we are going to execute it 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.540
 ok the first thing we have to have 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.910
 careful when reviewing odin is that the the 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.020
 little box that says repartition and a 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.020
 little bit of zoom please 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.340
 you are not selected the only thing that we are going 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 to have selected is the option that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.370
 says auto reboot and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.030
 efe point recipe in those two plus no 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.400
 we are going to go to the option pda we do 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.550
 click and we'll look in this where 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.470
 we have our file which we are going to 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.980
 use to root the computer in this case 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.720
 I have it here as you can see that cf 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:13.720
 rup samsung galaxy s3 that is that axis that 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.540
 3 or what are we going to open and how can you 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.850
 see the file path is already 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.920
 is here specific and we 're going 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.870
 to do more but give it to start 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.970
 This is a very fast process to last 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.090
 10 seconds or so as you can 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.090
 see up here is almost ready says 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.520
 that is already ready that and says to retire 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.490
 the cable as you can see here there is a 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.620
 exclamation mark red and 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.420
 we see that he is installing something like 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.700
 we can see here is updating 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.310
 as well 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.879
 the computer recovery which is very 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.959
 good since from here we can do 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:54.390
 this box or we can make a 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.069
 saved from our archives in case 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.110
 we want to recover it at some time and 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.180
 we can also restore from here and 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.130
 install roms directly from the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.170
 team as we can see it says it was 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.819
 updating the android device 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.430
 how to wait a moment for the team 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.129
 start 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.319
 ok let's see ya start now let's 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.790
 enter the menu to see if the icon is already 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.800
 What is the name right now? 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.900
 Super user 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.560
 looking for it here here as we can see 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.990
 here is the cwmy the superuser that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.540
 it is this one that is here we open it and it 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.330
 we say that if we want to update it and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.180
 it will be ready and we have the equipment 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.860
 rooted and we will quickly enter the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.510
 recovery so they can see what will be 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.270
 a different way than they have 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.580
 you in your original equipment 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.580
 let's wait for the team here to turn off 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.710
 ok now to start the recovery mode 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.150
 the volume up the home button 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.150
 and the power button 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.800
 ok as you can see already this recovery is 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.500
 different than the original equipment 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.060
 since we can backup or restore 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.860
 what is this option that is here that 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.200
 comes first, the second the 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.500
 fifth option this is here goes with 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.870
 to the rector and it's a recovery that yes 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.170
 protects against sudden death in the 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.380
 next video I'll explain how 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.230
 update this recovery and how to install 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.210
 the room from the recovery that we just 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.360
 to install but we already know that we have 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.580
 the team perfectly rooted good 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.160
 this is the video tutorial of how 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.700
 root the samsung galaxy s3 see you later 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.700
