now that hot dry air goes up the tower

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.840 
now that hot dry air goes up the tower
until<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.380> hits<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.710> top<00:00:37.890> where<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.460> add<00:00:38.610> in

then<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> air<00:00:41.850> rushes<00:00:42.510> down<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:42.960> speeds

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
then the air rushes down at speeds

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.740 
then the air rushes down at speeds
upwards<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.980> 50<00:00:44.399> miles<00:00:44.610> per<00:00:44.760> hour<00:00:44.910> till<00:00:45.660> it

which<00:01:07.500> sounds<00:01:07.860> pretty<00:01:08.100> radical<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> ask

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
which sounds pretty radical if you ask

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.570 
which sounds pretty radical if you ask
me<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:10.110> most<00:01:10.320> effective<00:01:10.770> part<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> turbine

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
me the most effective part of a turbine

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.969 
me the most effective part of a turbine
blade<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.330> tip<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> Makani<00:01:13.470> airborne

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
blade is the tip so the Makani airborne

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
blade is the tip so the Makani airborne
wind<00:01:14.250> turbine<00:01:14.670> travels<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> vertical

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
now of course this doesn't mean we

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
now of course this doesn't mean we
should<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.090> abandon<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:58.110> traditional<00:01:58.770> wind

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
harvesting strategies we just have to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.780 
harvesting strategies we just have to

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
make them smarter which is what

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.459 
make them smarter which is what

companies like GE are doing you see

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.480 
companies like GE are doing you see
they're<00:02:04.619> adding<00:02:04.979> sin
