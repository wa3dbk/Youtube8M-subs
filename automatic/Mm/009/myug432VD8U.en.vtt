light<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.780> much<00:02:47.019> larger<00:02:47.590> spread<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.280> one

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
light so much larger spread this one

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.360 
light so much larger spread this one
gives<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.180> job<00:02:49.420> done<00:02:49.689> makes<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.379> light<00:02:51.040> at<00:02:51.340> night

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370

really really cool so this one's going

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.119 
really really cool so this one's going
to<00:02:55.090> have<00:02:55.299> our<00:02:55.480> first<00:02:55.720> setting<00:02:56.200> which<00:02:56.829> will<00:02:56.980> be

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
to have our first setting which will be

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:58.860 
to have our first setting which will be
our<00:02:57.159> overdrive<00:02:58.000> which<00:02:58.239> will<00:02:58.390> have<00:02:58.480> three<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
our overdrive which will have three and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.349 
our overdrive which will have three and
a<00:02:58.900> half<00:02:58.930> hours<00:02:59.439> then<00:03:00.129> lap<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.849> next<00:03:01.180> setting

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
a half hours then lap the next setting

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.869 
a half hours then lap the next setting
which<00:03:01.659> will<00:03:01.810> be<00:03:01.959> our<00:03:01.989> after<00:03:02.620> six<00:03:02.950> hours<00:03:03.099> are

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
which will be our after six hours are

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.210 
which will be our after six hours are
medium<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.930> 11<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:05.530> then<00:03:05.769> we'll<00:03:05.950> have<00:03:06.069> our

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
medium for 11 and then we'll have our

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.460 
medium for 11 and then we'll have our
low<00:03:06.459> setting<00:03:06.879> which<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.180> run<00:03:07.329> 21<00:03:07.900> hours<00:03:08.230> and

low setting which will run 21 hours and

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.530 
low setting which will run 21 hours and
then<00:03:08.590> our<00:03:08.709> flash<00:03:08.980> setting<00:03:09.400> which<00:03:09.909> will<00:03:10.090> run<00:03:10.209> 20

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
then our flash setting which will run 20

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.899 
then our flash setting which will run 20
hours<00:03:10.930> works<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.799> really<00:03:12.040> really<00:03:12.159> well<00:03:12.459> a

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
hours works out really really well a

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.110 
hours works out really really well a
battery<00:03:13.540> pack<00:03:13.780> also<00:03:14.230> with<00:03:14.590> an<00:03:14.739> extender<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.459> we

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
battery pack also with an extender so we

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.879 
battery pack also with an extender so we
can<00:03:16.269> run<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.659> battery<00:03:17.079> pack<00:03:17.109> in<00:03:17.409> our<00:03:17.500> pocket

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
can run the battery pack in our pocket

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.559 
can run the battery pack in our pocket
as<00:03:18.099> well<00:03:18.129> as<00:03:18.340> having<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.639> light<00:03:18.849> but<00:03:19.420> I'm

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
as well as having a light but I'm

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.479 
as well as having a light but I'm
mounted<00:03:19.959> alright<00:03:20.230> helmet<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.829> it<00:03:21.069> also<00:03:21.220> gives

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
mounted alright helmet and it also gives

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.099 
mounted alright helmet and it also gives
us<00:03:21.639> a<00:03:21.730> lot<00:03:21.849> of<00:03:21.909> mounting<00:03:22.329> options<00:03:22.689> as<00:03:22.810> far<00:03:22.840> as

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
us a lot of mounting options as far as

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.470 
us a lot of mounting options as far as
mounting<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:24.280> battery<00:03:24.760> pack<00:03:24.939> on<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.209> frame

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
mounting that battery pack on the frame

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:37.319 
mounting that battery pack on the frame
is<00:03:25.689> almost<00:03:25.900> like<00:03:35.699> all<00:03:36.699> right<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:36.940> guess<00:03:37.150> that's

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
is almost like all right I guess that's

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.240 
is almost like all right I guess that's
the<00:03:37.389> end<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.599> our<00:03:37.690> time<00:03:37.870> today<00:03:38.079> guys<00:03:38.379> so<00:03:39.129> we

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
the end of our time today guys so we
