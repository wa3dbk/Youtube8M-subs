if<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.180> have<00:05:09.270> trouble<00:05:09.660> finding<00:05:09.840> pine<00:05:10.260> watch

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
if you have trouble finding pine watch

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.610 
if you have trouble finding pine watch
it's<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.220> to<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.490> west<00:05:11.730> of<00:05:12.110> Kelvin<00:05:13.110> which<00:05:13.590> is

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
it's just to the west of Kelvin which is

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.070 
it's just to the west of Kelvin which is
a<00:05:13.800> city<00:05:14.160> in<00:05:14.490> which<00:05:14.910> you<00:05:15.150> almost<00:05:15.389> get<00:05:15.630> executed

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
a city in which you almost get executed

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.280 
a city in which you almost get executed
in<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.440> intro<00:05:17.300> so<00:05:18.300> it's<00:05:18.510> not<00:05:18.660> very<00:05:18.810> far<00:05:19.020> from

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
in in intro so it's not very far from

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.570 
in in intro so it's not very far from
there<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:20.370> should<00:05:20.550> be<00:05:20.639> pretty<00:05:20.790> easy<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.090> find

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
there it should be pretty easy to find

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:28.580 
there it should be pretty easy to find
and<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:25.080> try<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.520> give<00:05:26.520> megive<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:27.000> map<00:05:27.590> my

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
and I try to give megive the map my

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.129 
and I try to give megive the map my
studies<00:05:29.070> recordings<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.750> can<00:05:30.900> find<00:05:31.080> the

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
studies recordings so you can find the

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.640 
studies recordings so you can find the
places<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.500> bit<00:05:31.650> easier<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:34.139> next<00:05:34.169> place<00:05:34.620> is

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
places a bit easier the next place is

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.110 
places a bit easier the next place is
