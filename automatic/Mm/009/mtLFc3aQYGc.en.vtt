00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.240
 with the toy story 3 game there are 3 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.019
 woody rodeo missions that do not 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.880
 I can spend good the first mission is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.880
 to kick a person for a cactus 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.590
 ah 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.490
 As they saw , the mission was not taken away. 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.320
 done a thousand times and the mission is not removed 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.070
 the other mission is to hit the ball 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.070
 against citizens 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.680
 and the same thing does not take away the mission in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.660

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.660
 top of the mine and make the best time 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.600
