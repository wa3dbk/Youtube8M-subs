00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.120
 Autumn arrives and from the woods more 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.830
 leafy telepizza brings you a 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.660
 selection of the best mushrooms in the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.370
 new seasonal telepizza telepizza 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.390
 the secret is in the mass 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.490
 did you see that punch 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.170
 it's a bit disappointing for us 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.689
 the second part since we have made a 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.789
 first part of good I think we've 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.560
 made a first part for how to 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.789
 be able to overtake in the scoreboard of the is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.989
 true that the sporting up to a minimum 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.250
 they were the second part 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.190
 in any case I think that in the first 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:44.620
 deducted upper part of clothing 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.620
 soft and the air 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.480
 makes a great first experience for 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.480
 my 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.940
 it is true that equal to the players 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.500
 I still do not know you so much and go 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.360
 passing the games and the days we will go 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
 improving he continues to know him better and 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.840
 you have achieved better results 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.840
 we will gradually improve 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:22.630
 if they are instructed on the road mount 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.000
 Everest or because of one with war 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.920
 it is true that with respect to the equipment of 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.750
 for example the last game we have not 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.939
 changed too much but it 's normal 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.950
 I need time I need workouts 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.210
 with the players and then there's also 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.000
 to say that we were missing four 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.049
 determining players and then that 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.520
 it was a bit of effectively for 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.689
 us but I'm very happy with the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.140
 attitude that have shown all my 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.140
 players 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:53.020
 and not water waters and well I'm happy 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.689
 with the point we have worked hard to 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.490
 to be able to win today we wanted to win was 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.140
 our goal but in the end seen the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.470
 party we can say that it is a point 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.470
 fair 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:10.299
 yes king for the atlantic or metroid king 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.190
 well I must say that it is true that no 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.360
 we have made many changes in this 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.250
 first match we wanted to give 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.829
 continuity to the eleven that won the athletic 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.780
 madrid during this first week of 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.970
 workouts I tried to work a 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.459
 little basic things and in turn tell them 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.870
 I hope they face the future but 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.100
 it is true that we have to continue 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.810
 working that the next weeks 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.440
 We will continue to work hard in the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.850
 training 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.270
 to be able to continue to improve and achieve 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.270
 good results 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.160
 like the mons
