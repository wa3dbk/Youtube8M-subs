00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.609
 just to explain why I knew

 Penneteau knee should certainly you 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.270
 muddy waters and question but 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.530
 what is that it's a 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.210
 humorous manga alan and its causes

 right now you see gto it's a manga 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.350
 humorous but frankly he told me 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.180
 make a lot of laughter I discovered 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.810
 he made me super proud we must you 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.030
 read the story transferred to a high school 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.650
 privately llosa early discovers that the dormitory 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.670
 of his establishment does not propose 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.710
 evening catering 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.630
 hungry the latter is heading then will want 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.510
 supermarkets to buy a bento 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.650
 to finally fall unconscious 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.960
 unconscious sees art and conscious 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.630
 a few minutes later indoors 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.600
 from the store and finish his evening at 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.370
 carling on the pedals sorry for his 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.070
 exit you can not remember 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.530
 events of the bei and made the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 knowledge of this theme an elder of 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.920
 his high school which advised him against 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 strongly to return to the supermarket 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.729
 however do not understand the origin of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.979
 these warnings the latter and enters at 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.780
 again the same evening for finally and 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.659
 discover the reason for his previous 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 fainting indeed he finds himself 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.629
 that the place is in truth the theater 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.950
 merciless clashes between 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.239
 different customers looking to get 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.489
 bento at half price 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.170
 the young teenager then understands that 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.489
 if he wants to complete them correctly 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.170
 spring the stomach will have to learn to 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.760
 fight to win his benneau 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.080
 in clear it's a manga 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.730
 funny whores have been traced you have 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.080
 well understood in fact a supermarket where 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.189
 it is not painted in one 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.480
 many times beat solid for 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.709
 half price bento 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.819
 we are in clear him he has some 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.080
 low income because he lives all 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.190
 alone so he needs to feed himself 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.300
 and bento for those who do not know 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.550
 these are small trays you see 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.710
 with kind of rice or bio za of two 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.320
 years ago there is often a small omelette 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.740
 there are beans of fried chicken 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 salmon or even shrimp free 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.690
 cherry tomatoes finally he 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 a lot in my coffee so percent 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.210
 after that I know but I know 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.280
 those of the coffee manga we according to don in 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.690
 the animated benneau is not the same 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.040
 stuff that has a lot of stuff chelous ago 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.320
 lots of stuff that left in the air 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.970
 super good my guy it's my 40 nibble 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.110
 ideas the day I go to Japan you 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.610
 have to see exactly what am I 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.020
 I'm going to eat, you see, but frankly 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.910
 I really laugh 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.310
 the story is wacky it's wacky 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.600
 but it's funny it's funny there is 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.280
 not really history in fact but 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.130
 it's they have reasons to fight 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.020
 who are these sick stuff that's it 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.070
 makes me laugh kind of him after he has 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.630
 a name I do not tell you why nor 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.850
 how are you after when you're fighting 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.280
 well you you become a wolf or base 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.290
 we are a dog so this canton is a 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.459
 shit to take well missed so this is it 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.750
 that happens most of the time they 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.370
 are strong in combat and who come to 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.870
 get the same fingers half price he 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.880
 will each be present their own nickname 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.970
 I'll have these laac labels one by one 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.950
 the frozen osce and witch or 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.780
 ice cream so on took place in 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850
 others it's wizard and it's 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.780
 the perverse manga so you'll understand 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.600
 why but the real reason is 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.040
 really stupid it's his share of nothing his 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.300
 nickname but it's super funny 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.440
 frankly it made me laugh a lot 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.600
 it's animated so I advise you 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.260
 a lot of watching after what I 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.340
 can say is that there is no 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.380
 a lot of things to say because you 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.790
 have missed humorous so there is no 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.019
 real debate on that typed it 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.090
 just a tap a good bar like 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.830
 nice pitfall started as murder 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.480
 classroom you're kidding a good shot 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.340
 of pub that's good it's what 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.690
 just that but frankly it's huge 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.850
 the way that turned me made me 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.320
 to laugh a lot you see that first manga 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.730
 which is based on the food I like you 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.220
 I am known who dares to mahfoud wars 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.410
 I do not like you see but here I am 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.459
 I do not like it I like it I looked 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.709
 this is lately what there are pts and 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.690
 3 not even a week of this one 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.820
 week all ages and watched I finished 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.840
 at home the same evening that I have 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.140
 so much that makes history it was 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.990
 huge 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.919
 good now to go to the notes for 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.479
 what are stories there are none 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.919
 really good but it's funny 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.210
 we will put at 15 because frankly 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.100
 it's really funny it's very 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.510
 humorous that's what I like it 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.740
 that makes me who liked me in 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.180
 this year but that I think it you 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.810
 will please too I loved watching you 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.289
 benneteau after with respect to the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.110
 design 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:46.250
 I think it's a manga 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.040
 to the old cellars not even account and this 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.420
 that he came out that wen stuff also have 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.050
 on a shonen that no I do not know at all 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.720
 when did she come out I 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.670
 could not really tell you but 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.530
 the dozens it's going that's it going on or 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.910
 it goes after gmail and baston them 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.260
 fighting at his super art app I 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.030
 wanted to fight it's super well done 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.280
 did not make it to the one piece at the 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.820
 naruto no no it's a style it's a 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.130
 clean style 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.020
 but it's really own character and 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.820
 that's what's really super stylish 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.470
 afterwards for what is low attitude of the 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.730
 character my character in himself even he 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.900
 has not a cut of illness does not have a 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.190
 sick character he just wants 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.860
 to eat is the reason 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.720
 he wants to eat the guy wants the evening get 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.270
 fill up the belly for the next day be 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.970
 at the cleat to eat again 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.380
 we lose that's pretty much the story 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.090
 so the rather stylish character tastes good 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.010
 we're going to say pretty stylish he's fine 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.090
 is normal we will say 1.12 because 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.320
 when he types he is really funny 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.670
 contribute low it is funny at the beginning 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.460
 because he often gets screwed 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.170
 that that made me laugh a lot so 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.760
 so this manga break was rather 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.890
 short dresses ndaw is not even five 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.970
 minutes you really see very short everything 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.020
 case I hope that will have given you 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.430
 want to look frankly I you 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.750
 advise if you like them if you 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.760
 like to laugh on manga and bat 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.930
 watch it get better we do nothing after 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.730
 it did not make me laugh so much because I was 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.260
 the gto it's a metronome but hey it's 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.060
 still funny facts in short guys 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.080
 it is true that at Aix I leave you I 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.700
 wanted to wear you well 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.700
