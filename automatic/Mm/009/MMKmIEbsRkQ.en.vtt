it<00:05:25.560> now<00:05:25.740> that's<00:05:26.160> one<00:05:26.610> example<00:05:26.790> but<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:27.750> is

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
it now that's one example but that is

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.480 
it now that's one example but that is
fear<00:05:28.230> of<00:05:28.260> success<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.800> I'd<00:05:28.920> be<00:05:29.160> honest<00:05:29.370> with

you when I have dug and dug and dug into

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.770 
you when I have dug and dug and dug into
people's<00:05:31.950> psyche<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.580> find<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.330> for<00:05:33.540> some

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
people's psyche I find that for some

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.200 
people's psyche I find that for some
reason<00:05:33.810> they<00:05:34.410> fear<00:05:34.860> what's<00:05:35.370> on<00:05:35.580> the<00:05:35.700> other<00:05:35.730> end

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
reason they fear what's on the other end

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.940

of<00:05:36.540> the<00:05:36.720> weight<00:05:36.900> loss<00:05:37.110> not<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.590> weight<00:05:37.740> loss

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
of the weight loss not the weight loss

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.490 
of the weight loss not the weight loss
itself<00:05:38.370> but<00:05:38.820> what<00:05:38.970> it<00:05:39.090> means<00:05:39.540> and<00:05:40.169> what<00:05:40.320> it'll

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
itself but what it means and what it'll

it will have on the other side sometimes

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.280 
it will have on the other side sometimes
in<00:05:45.120> a<00:05:45.210> lot<00:05:45.390> of<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.570> time<00:05:45.750> most<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.230> time

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
in a lot of the time most of the time

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.490 
in a lot of the time most of the time
they're<00:05:47.130> not<00:05:47.160> even<00:05:47.520> aware<00:05:47.640> of<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.660> so<00:05:49.260> once

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
they're not even aware of it so once

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.930 
they're not even aware of it so once
they're<00:05:49.680> made<00:05:49.800> aware<00:05:50.100> of<00:05:50.160> it<00:05:50.370> then<00:05:50.610> they<00:05:50.760> have

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
they're made aware of it then they have

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.430 
they're made aware of it then they have
a<00:05:50.970> decision<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.480> make<00:05:51.510> and<00:05:51.750> a<00:05:51.810> choice<00:05:52.080> can<00:05:52.410> be

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
a decision to make and a choice can be

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.850 
a decision to make and a choice can be

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
made with armed with that knowledge but

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.380 
made with armed with that knowledge but
before<00:05:56.220> then<00:05:56.400> they're<00:05:56.820> just<00:05:57.030> spinning<00:05:57.300> their

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
before then they're just spinning their

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.150 
before then they're just spinning their
wheels<00:05:57.450> and<00:05:57.840> they're<00:05:58.230> missing<00:05:58.440> just<00:05:58.860> enough

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
wheels and they're missing just enough

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.980

of<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.669> key<00:05:59.850> things<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.390> keep<00:06:00.570> them<00:06:00.840> right

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
of the key things to keep them right

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.880 
of the key things to keep them right
where<00:06:01.110> they're<00:06:01.230> at<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.470> that's<00:06:01.590> going<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.770> go

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
where they're at and that's going to go

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:02.970 
where they're at and that's going to go
on<00:06:02.040> forever
