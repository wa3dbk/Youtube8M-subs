alright<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.389> leaf<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.290> found<00:00:04.620> on

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
alright this is a leaf that I found on

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.700 
alright this is a leaf that I found on
my<00:00:04.859> front<00:00:05.759> step<00:00:07.130> and<00:00:08.130> I<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.700> using<00:00:08.970> leaves

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
my front step and I like using leaves

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.070 
my front step and I like using leaves
for<00:00:10.710> people<00:00:12.019> with<00:00:13.019> their<00:00:13.200> first<00:00:13.410> paintings

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
for people with their first paintings

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.800 
for people with their first paintings
it's<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.490> simple<00:00:17.490> shape<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.029> there<00:00:18.420> isn't<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it's a simple shape but there isn't a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.790 
it's a simple shape but there isn't a
dimensional<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.100> know<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.580> shortening<00:00:21.060> and

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
dimensional you know for shortening and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.720 
dimensional you know for shortening and
that<00:00:22.800> type<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> issue<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.340> can<00:00:26.490> draw<00:00:26.699> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
that type of issue and you can draw it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
that type of issue and you can draw it
wrong<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.810> still<00:00:28.050> looks<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> leaf<00:00:28.740> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
wrong and it still looks like a leaf and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.439 
wrong and it still looks like a leaf and
this<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.429> important<00:00:30.119> when<00:00:30.300> you're

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this is very important when you're

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.020 
this is very important when you're
learning<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.840> paint<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:32.040> work<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.399> subjects

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
learning to paint is to work on subjects

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
learning to paint is to work on subjects
where<00:00:33.510> perfect<00:00:33.809> drawing<00:00:34.260> doesn't<00:00:34.530> matter<00:00:35.030> so

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
where perfect drawing doesn't matter so

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
where perfect drawing doesn't matter so
you<00:00:36.600> don't<00:00:36.809> want<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.200> do<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> painting<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
you don't want to do a painting of a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.479 
you don't want to do a painting of a
person<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:39.059> for<00:00:39.420> example<00:00:39.510> that's

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
person you know for example that's

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.450 
person you know for example that's
that's<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.610> mistake<00:00:44.149> this<00:00:45.149> leaf<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.660> drew<00:00:45.989> is

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
that's a mistake this leaf I drew is

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.569 
that's a mistake this leaf I drew is
fairly<00:00:47.460> accurate<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.270> one<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:49.530> thin<00:00:50.430> on

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
fairly accurate that one it's thin on

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.750 
fairly accurate that one it's thin on
top<00:00:50.690> too<00:00:51.690> big<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> bottom<00:00:52.760> it's

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
top too big on the bottom it's

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330 
top too big on the bottom it's
asymmetrical<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.899> comes<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> odd

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
asymmetrical it comes in here to odd

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.410 
asymmetrical it comes in here to odd
point<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.719> doesn't<00:00:58.020> matter<00:00:58.260> that's<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
point and it doesn't matter that's the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.709 
point and it doesn't matter that's the
that's<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.629> beauty<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> I'll<00:01:03.510> draw

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that's the beauty of this so I'll draw

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.590 
that's the beauty of this so I'll draw
one<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.559> can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.640> drawing<00:01:06.740> and

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
one more as you can see the drawing and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:20.920 
one more as you can see the drawing and
that'll<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.780> whoops<00:01:10.549> center<00:01:11.549> thing

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.040 

so<00:01:23.530> I'm<00:01:24.530> drawing<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.340> with<00:01:25.610> some<00:01:25.940> care<00:01:29.050> you

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
so I'm drawing this with some care you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.750 
so I'm drawing this with some care you
know<00:01:30.170> I'm<00:01:30.260> looking<00:01:30.620> at<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.950> leaf<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.520> this

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
know I'm looking at the leaf and this

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.880 
know I'm looking at the leaf and this
one<00:01:32.000> I'm<00:01:32.090> going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.300> deliberately<00:01:32.870> make<00:01:33.170> too

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
one I'm going to deliberately make too

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:43.120 
one I'm going to deliberately make too
skinny<00:01:35.650> just<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.800> make<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.160> point<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:42.920> is

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
skinny just to make the point so this is

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.160 
skinny just to make the point so this is
like<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.910> wine<00:01:44.360> bottle<00:01:44.810> demonstration<00:01:47.170> this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
like the wine bottle demonstration this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.760 
like the wine bottle demonstration this
is<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> very<00:01:48.410> confident<00:01:49.280> drawing<00:01:49.670> it's<00:01:50.770> drawn

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
is a very confident drawing it's drawn

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.150 
is a very confident drawing it's drawn
with<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.010> permanent<00:01:52.340> pen<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.649> that's<00:01:54.649> catching

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
with a permanent pen and that's catching

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:01.770 
with a permanent pen and that's catching
trying<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.740> sneak<00:01:57.740> up<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.220> perfect<00:01:59.020> drawing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
trying to sneak up on a perfect drawing

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.660 
trying to sneak up on a perfect drawing
but<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:02.869> I've<00:02:03.020> got<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> very<00:02:05.200> strong<00:02:06.280> line<00:02:07.280> to

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
but now I've got a very strong line to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.010 
but now I've got a very strong line to
paint<00:02:07.910> up<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.290> and<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:10.489> makes<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.630> painting

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
paint up to and that makes the painting

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.170 
paint up to and that makes the painting
part<00:02:12.230> much<00:02:12.500> easier<00:02:13.100> put<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.820> couple<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.090> days

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
part much easier put it a couple of days

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.880 
part much easier put it a couple of days
smell<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.930> looks<00:02:15.110> like<00:02:15.350> a<00:02:15.410> leaf<00:02:17.890> this

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
smell so that looks like a leaf this

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.580 
smell so that looks like a leaf this
brush<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.130> half-inch<00:02:23.590> synthetic

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
brush is a it's a half-inch synthetic

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
people to do is paint everything but the

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.550 
people to do is paint everything but the
leaf<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:53.630> sometimes<00:02:54.630> called<00:02:54.900> painting

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
leaf this is sometimes called painting

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.420 
leaf this is sometimes called painting
the<00:02:55.680> negative<00:02:56.130> space<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:58.769> what<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:59.160> allows

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the negative space but what this allows

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.809 
the negative space but what this allows
me<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.760> do<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:01.370> experiment<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:07.610> paint<00:03:08.610> I

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
me to do is experiment with the paint I

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.890 
me to do is experiment with the paint I
get<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> sense<00:03:09.900> for<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:12.060> know<00:03:12.209> what's<00:03:12.630> too<00:03:12.870> much

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
get a sense for you know what's too much

get a sense for you know what's too much
water<00:03:13.380> too<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:15.319> is<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.590> going<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.920> run<00:03:17.160> or

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.320 

entry<00:05:54.030> about<00:05:54.060> today

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:07.720 

November<00:06:00.800> twelfth<00:06:01.800> I<00:06:02.250> think

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.960 

then<00:06:08.730> the<00:06:08.850> next<00:06:09.000> thing<00:06:09.180> we<00:06:09.450> do<00:06:09.690> after<00:06:10.290> we've

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
then the next thing we do after we've

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.690 
then the next thing we do after we've
done<00:06:11.970> some<00:06:12.590> practice<00:06:13.590> with<00:06:13.710> negative<00:06:14.340> space

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
done some practice with negative space

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.090 
done some practice with negative space
is<00:06:15.000> move<00:06:15.270> into<00:06:15.600> positive<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.920> that's<00:06:19.920> just

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
is move into positive and that's just

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.240 
is move into positive and that's just
reversing<00:06:20.790> this<00:06:21.000> but<00:06:21.560> again<00:06:22.560> choosing<00:06:23.160> a

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
reversing this but again choosing a

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:30.830 
reversing this but again choosing a
subject<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.940> leave<00:06:24.650> where<00:06:25.650> you<00:06:25.860> really<00:06:29.840> can't

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
subject to leave where you really can't

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.730 
subject to leave where you really can't
go<00:06:31.020> too<00:06:31.080> wrong<00:06:32.900> even<00:06:33.900> if<00:06:33.960> use<00:06:34.200> really<00:06:34.410> wrong

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
go too wrong even if use really wrong

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.640 
go too wrong even if use really wrong
colors<00:06:35.160> I<00:06:35.310> go<00:06:35.520> through<00:06:35.820> and<00:06:36.030> see<00:06:36.440> what<00:06:37.440> some

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
colors I go through and see what some

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.780 
colors I go through and see what some
lavender<00:06:38.280> does<00:06:38.520> are<00:06:39.000> not<00:06:39.270> lavender<00:06:39.810> lilac

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.790 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.860 

that's<00:06:44.790> pretty<00:06:45.090> yucky<00:06:47.780> but<00:06:48.780> now<00:06:48.960> I<00:06:48.990> know

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
that's pretty yucky but now I know

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.800 
that's pretty yucky but now I know
actually<00:06:51.870> that's<00:06:52.020> kind<00:06:52.230> of<00:06:52.320> a<00:06:52.440> pretty<00:06:52.680> gray
