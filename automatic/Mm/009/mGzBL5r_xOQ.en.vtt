00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.170
 Hi guys, how are you? I 'm fine with you today. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.760
 here for you 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.010
 this beautiful case yes this is a case and 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.790
 the most interested is that a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.879
 recycled materials you will love the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.260
 is an idea of a case made with a 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.290
 pet bottle 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.430
 you already know that just use the 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.340
 imagination 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.370
 You can wear any fabric you like 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.070
 use the theme you want and can even 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.520
 also paint the pet bottle 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.950
 let's get to know the materials 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.470
 I'm going to use a bottle of these. 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.920
 small one bottle of water 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.180
 mine is even wet 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.210
 I'm going to wear a fabric that's going to be like that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.610
 you can too. 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.369
 choose the size you want me 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.300
 I chose these that I love, I love them. 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:29.270
 this fabric and to the measurement of the fabric will be 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.119
 the size of your technical bottle to 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.350
 The bottle you'll choose is just 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.630
 so I'll use a ribbon to make 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.700
 Finishing hot glue a pair of scissors 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.979
 We 'll need a stiletto too. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.560
 to cut the bottle 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.380
 What we're going to do first is going to be measuring 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.390
 our bottle with a pen to 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.319
 know the size that we will make a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.039
 case 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:02:00.369
 Let's cut the bottle, here I go. 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.369
 cut with a stylus very carefully 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.500
 and the bottle will stay like this forever 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 stay a few breasts so it's interesting 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.380
 sometimes sandpaper 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.790
 Now we're going to prepare the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.820
 fabric 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.860
 We are going to spend a life inside the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 fabric we are going to cut here more or less 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.200
 a size that would go through the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.680
 Whoever gives it to us later 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.980
 we make a ribbon my ribbon has to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.160
 thus remain inside the fabric and is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.160
 important that she has to slip 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.920
 in the fabric 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.740
 In this case I'll paste you can 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.700
 to do a sewing can sew I go 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.250
 paste here's how O'll go slowly 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.830
 I take care not to glue 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.190
 pick up on tape because mirror on tape 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.140
 it will stick and will not give 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.650
 slide to an important thing not 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.500
 had tape from inside the cloth as I did 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.390
 because otherwise it will give a lot 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.630
 work to put the tape on the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.630
 again 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.069
 and then you will have to do everything from 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.069
 brand new as I did 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.250
 so here is the right part I went 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:30.760
 pasting and went well using the tape to 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:39.190
 it does not stick together with the fabric is there 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:43.170
 The tip for you I am passing the glue and 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.170
 I'll pull the tape later. 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.820
 and now you have my tape already in 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.500
 of the fabric 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.750
 now we're going to make the finishes and 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.020
 I'm going to glue here in this part of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.300
 down so you will not be at risk of 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.240
 the fabric and will give the finish 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.070
 this part will be left on one side 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.280
 from inside the bottle 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:19.459
 I'll do the same thing from the sides too. 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.610
 and here for you to see how it was 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:25.070
 the side of my fabric I passed the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.320
 glued and folded with the finish 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.900
 perfect in 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.880
 Now that the fabric is ready, it's just 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.490
 paste into the pet bottle 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.270
 Let's pass the hot glue is that in the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.270
 bottle 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.289
 we will apply the fabric tighten and 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:55.289
 We waited a little while to dry and so 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.289
 Let's do it all over the bottle. 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.120
 now we need to finish 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.740
 in this lower part where we put 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.050
 the fabric 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:22.340
 the finishing is simple just get the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:26.110
 and paste on top of the fabric already 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.120
 Let's get a nice finish. 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.860
 and now we have our booth 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.099
 ready 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.919
 now just put the pens here 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.620
 here inside 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:43.610
 so and now let's take a ballast here 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:47.509
 Let's squeeze just pull our ribbon. 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:52.250
 and just give a bow and we already have a 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:56.560
 very different case and way with fabric 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.560
 with the theme of the way you want it 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.110
 Look how cute it was I loved it. 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.210
 I really enjoyed the two are very 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.639
 simple and very cool 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.220
 You can paint this part of the 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:19.700
 Pet bottle can paint pink color 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:23.350
 yellow any cure would look like too 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:26.540
 very cool even if you found 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.600
 like it if you like then do not forget 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.620
 still let lilic leave us 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.500
