00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.370
 this game is not yet available in google 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.480

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.980
 and so let's look at this game and 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.650
 make her first sight 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.100
 first review because more is not yet 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 where you won't see this toy and so 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.670
 4 missions are waiting for us first mission 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.239
 it's called day 1 2 night of fear 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.980
 third mission day 2 and 4 mission night 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.950
 stylishly available in this version only 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 the first two missions they are very strong 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.280
 differ from each other and so i 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.539
 I suggest you go through the whole first day and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 play a little bit on the night of fear 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.190
 click the first day and as you see 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.410
 here it is even written that this game 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.930
 for internal use for now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 but now you will see make sure 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 toy is very high quality and through 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.969
 a week or less you will want 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.640
 already play it yourself so the first thing 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.369
 we are waiting for this note on the door going to 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 which we can read it and so but 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.439
 here in this version analog a little bit why 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.630
 it disappears from note but you can 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.479
 pick up that angle and read this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.970
 a note to us is addressed here then 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 that we are very glad that we came here but 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 this house lost a child and now we 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 need to solve all the riddles that are in 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 this house is happening and so what awaits us 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.110
 waiting for us here is such a healthy cool 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.329
 mansion there is even a second floor and 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 let's probably go there right away and 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.670
 let's go i just know why you need to go there 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.220
 go so we'll go there like this 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.560
 there is enough justified here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.930
 scary are very good 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.960
 sound effect scary floor squeak 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.649
 gnashing some screams children's songs 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.079
 there are even developers here 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.740
 cooked a mannequin appeared 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.320
 incomprehensible but then disappeared but it's just 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.490
 so that's intimidated to that is not yet 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.390
 scary the worst will be after 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.060
 especially when night falls and so here 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.880
 here's how you see there is a corridor 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.860
 some haze we are not allowed there but 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.170
 for this, our hero has 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.840
 also the second way 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.060
 Of view , by the way, the song started 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.240
 little girl i'm very scared 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.430
 and creeps and as I said 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.920
 our hero has two views clicking here 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.470
 we get the magic on this button 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.380
 vision as you see here is magical 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.420
 the wall that does not allow us and even when 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.520
 this sight we see a note on the wall 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.460
 which we do not see with ordinary sight 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.030
 come to this note and here we are 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:57.200
 written by the task of a living person type in 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.240
 this house wow supposedly lives here 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.970
 girl or rather, and probably the soul 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.240
 but this girl lost her doll and us 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.880
 to get into this corridor 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.220
 you need to find this doll before we 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.390
 look for dolls in this scary house this 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.910
 the corridor we pass unfortunately we can not 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:20.240
 let's go look for the doll 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.100
 I hope no one will eat us on the way but 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.850
 principle here on the first day 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.330
 in fact no one can eat you though 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.070
 everything is possible and here oh mummy you are 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.190
 see water for some reason so dramatically 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:37.250
 got up and straight at all scares me this 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.740
 them about she disappeared that is, there are either glitches 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.560
 any really some very 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.460
 scary magic in this house this happens 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.860
 very scary probably such an effect 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.500
 I have only seen water in one 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:55.100
 from movies on this thriller horror films 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.200
 where the guest lived in the hotel in which you are there 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.810
 there was a picture with a sea of â€‹â€‹lines suddenly this 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.930
 the picture broke and knocked out of it 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.790
 just a whole flurry of water and so where are we 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.760
 hit we hit some narrow 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.560
 the corridor so for the turn I think us 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.140
 anyway you need to go into this turn 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.209
 because anything is here waiting for us 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.040
 something started to play very scary on 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.680
 the piano that we have here let's 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.530
 look around management in principle 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.900
 convenient enough so here we have nothing 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.960
 not something so let's turn on 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.530
 sight both she and while sight here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.870
 there is a doll let's take it 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.660
 picked up the kitchens doll and appeared 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.000
 some evil just satanic laugh 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.250
 let's better turn off this sight to me with 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.830
 it somehow more frightening the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.550
 better go with ordinary sight and nothing 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 afraid so what's left for us 1 doll 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.380
 found that we can do the task 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:59.520
 open this passage and go to 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.460
 second mission that is hitting the corridor we 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.970
 dive into the night and there we will wait 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:10.200
 already real horror that you will see 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.090
 already very soon and so 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.010
 it remains to pass only the corridor 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.970
 turn left and hope for this time 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.860
 no one has time to eat us yet i'm not 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.650
 I hope thatâ€™s one hundred percent sure 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.690
 percent toy let's talk about 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.180
 toy graphics as you noticed here 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.060
 good enough quality all 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.950
 well drawn by the way 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.710
 the developers of this game is nobody 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.620
 other than the development team who 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.590
 made the game light i think the game light you 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.630
 Loved it and therefore you will want 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.870
 play new data creation 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.380
 developers and evaluate it yourself so we 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:54.310
 ended up in some room at night 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.250
 for some reason, 015 is not 014 is not 016 and 015 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.160
 there is some blood on the wall 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.560
 imprints of marks and hands and let's 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.010
 let's see maybe the view will help us 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.130
 ode blood disappeared but a note appeared 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.620
 so they write to us here again exactly the same 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.080
 the note for some reason disappears but fails 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.740
 somehow you can tune in to 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.080
 read it well, in general here we write the 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.560
 that if we want to survive in this house 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.720
 we need to find 3 caskets and 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.090
 until we distinguish these three boxes 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.510
 next we pass it 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:34.260
 but here we are already waiting for real horror 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.200
 let's try to turn right so 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.300
 here is very dark scary nothing 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.260
 let's see let's turn on the magic vision 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.850
 because when it is turned on somewhat 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.190
 better probably lizma runs after us 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.470
 some red man was i'm afraid 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.320
 let's turn this vision off better 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:55.470
 we have exactly the congress and catch sight too 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:57.450
 turn off now I really 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.540
 really scary especially when i saw 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.510
 this guy in some 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.300
 red more precisely in some red 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:07.530
 latex latex suit and here we are 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.800
 like someone killed 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.840
 but it still t with unfortunately we can 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.450
 come back in the investigation and again 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.690
 play this mission in general what's my 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:21.750
 the verdict is a great game great action 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.150
 rather a great horror in which I think 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.460
 you want to play for anyone and you 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.490
 you can do it already on the next one 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.490
 a week
