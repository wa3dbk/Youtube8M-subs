00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:11.959
 outside technical definition Tteyuu not I'm acidosis say a hard is 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.539
 I'm trying to use this paper 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:23.039
 I agree that the pH has dropped, but I'm saying I'm alkaline 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:28.679
 Well, for example , if it's a problem that you can use it with a thin foot, you can solve it 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.550
 Tteyuu I edition or born 3000 form 6 is a character I respiratory function happens to but is 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.790
 I'm not able was the only topic is When asked a detailed idea of the cat 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:41.399
 For example, it is unbearable to hydrogen tea pots 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.030
 It is a fact that breathing is promoted, and then you become a writing brush 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.310
 Well screw 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:51.400
 If you get kidney failure 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:52.090
 Well , because that hydrogen and build up acidity, so breathing will be promoted again 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.220
 To 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 Well it's a not referred to it this is it in fact this page is and say what it 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.330
 There is a problem with the definition of par, so it 's called papern. 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:09.080
 7.4 It is a stout-hearted but I believe everyone 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:14.090
 The pair Te bought and 7.4 and Kanehachi 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.550
 For example, there is a lock, but if the numbers are fixed, measure something 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.260
 It is where you are 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.440
 In your Zonchi Is that the I mean to define the What everyone is Hey hard 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.520
 Ika I like that pco 2 for example 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.620
 I think you can understand if you write po 2 or something famous like this 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.400
 is not it 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:38.230
 This o 2 oxygen co2 is what I symbols from I copy if there is the I mean grinded coal dioxide 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.540
 It's an abbreviation 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.550
 Actually , it is a curve p, which means concentration and pressure, so something like this 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 I'm measuring a lot of quantity , I hope it is 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:56.000
 When the net is say what I this one it is and say ph 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 It is understood the Tteyuu's Kaiserslautern measure the I Oh concentration is the hydrogen ion'll So hydrogen ion 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.830
 Right 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.980
 That's why it's about 4 or 7 or 8 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.540
 I know that I am measuring the abundance of water 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:13.290
 It is the abundance of fisheries So in what 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:21.420
 In fact , when you think of whether it will be a measure, there is a definition of a favor, a favor or something 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:22.620
 Fu Tteyuu'll define and produce a substance that releases hydrogen ions in the When You're substance say 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 It is decided to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.650
 Since the in accumulating it's favor is When the accumulated hydrogen ion 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:35.340
 Because it leans to human body acidity 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:40.170
 Anyway, I'm going to metabolic acidosis, and the compensatory effect works on that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.030
 It is that such respiratory spit out in favor of it is to promote 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.650
 That's why I actually said that when I say where I am learning 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.250
 Well yeah 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:55.330
 The definition for hydrogen is for junior high school students and then the definition for this proposal is because it is the skin of high school so we 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 I am learning Acidosis Alkalosis 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.250
 It is said that the world of nursing is, in fact, it is this It is necessary to go through a series of relays 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.180
 If you want to understand 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.600
 It's from Chiba Minori day I can not understand without reviewing 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.319
 But what does furniture do here 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.670
 Know a judgment date of a commonplace that contains it is after graduating from high school 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:25.909
 It's because I know if I can ride something or something, so I'm getting sick 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.159
 Another vocal hate to business is expanded so say at the time of war tilts less than or equal to the or alkaline 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:33.090
 I will say that 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:36.480
 It is a junior high school when it changes the way of saying that is how important revenge is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.920
 It is the following is creeping of important or high school say large time 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.920
 I think you understood 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.260
 by the way
