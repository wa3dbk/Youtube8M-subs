how<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> pressure<00:01:58.290> cooker<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.860> think

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
how to use a pressure cooker I think

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.429 
how to use a pressure cooker I think
they're<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.670> useful<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.329> cut<00:02:00.570> down<00:02:00.750> on<00:02:00.960> hours

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
they're so useful to cut down on hours

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.200 
they're so useful to cut down on hours
of<00:02:01.619> cooking<00:02:02.070> beans<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.700> meats
