00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.970
 artistic 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:16.070
 asq I am 26 years old I am from caracas I have 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:18.140
 10 years painting and it's been a little 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.860
 strange and basic I leave it and it is that what 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.890
 I took it back two years ago 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.260
 it's like he grabs something more force and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.630
 plus the studies that I have obtained during 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.860
 all this time because I healed more what 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.979
 what I do and with the technique maybe 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.010
 things are a little more nourished 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.239
 what do I have a little more concepts 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.780
 putting also come as easier 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.780
 from the people 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 or not 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.480
 but not 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.149
 this part 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.070
 how 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.240
 the cliché of the graffiti artist is the letters 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.490
 but I'm not interested in doing many 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.649
 lyrics I prefer to express something more 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.500
 figurative that is also easier to 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.350
 out because I really understand 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.329
 I do not do it for myself because it's me 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.549
 I like to share what I do the 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.110
 bunnies good first they approach and 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.630
 appointments because I find them fun and 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.509
 I also said that I am a girl 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.600
 it's also like an identification stamp 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.950
 with the example of one of them but 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.469
 after knowing it by analyzing it better 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.119
 I have an argument behind them that 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:10.069
 How do we get like the rapids? 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.690
 but he has them as he is with everything is one 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.180
 but they do it hard but with hysterical 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.599
 with the ones with the reverse I want is that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.519
 people like you feel that you saw something 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:25.709
 different degree that decreases first 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.230
 do I draw the time that I have like that 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:30.950
 a mania what 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.370
 grab fast thanks 0.1 is more finite 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.310
 and I begin to give the trifles Melo 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.420
 they are super perfect I really 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.530
 I paint anything that I draw 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.140
 9 I put exquisite and I have a lot 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.319
 little cartoons were respected has grown and 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.190
 it's a task I do not like it to be 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.080
 larger than two by two smaller 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.430
 I liked in giant formats in others 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.500
 make big statements like more 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 happy because they always have spaces 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.130
 to do more things I would like 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.500
 study for the walls because obvious 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.819
 fast and good you can also use a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.740
 little bit of rubber paint for 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.810
 save the flyer 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.810
 that for logistics to the expensive 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.730
 state 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.530
 public spaces we have access 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.050
 direct with people and people see it and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.820
 he lives it day by day and went through there 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.400
 times they ignore you and it's not that common 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.690
 What of your minutes? 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.030
 instead the gallery the people I'm going to 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:38.180
 look for those in the gallery has its 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.460
 load and disassemble the most gray text there 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.270
 certain people who do not 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.270
 it came to me 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.560
 pints investor and the tripod the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.960
 idea of ​​how to sponsor it 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.860
 so good the fs guys me 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.730
 contacted and I have to talk to him 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.730
 national is a reality 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.400
 that there was none but it's called 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.500
 street art and it must have worked if there 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.880
 people that an agent of the earth with 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.730
 reference point to see what what 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.520
 is happening outside and same 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.860
 people from abroad are also the 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.110
 many also seems to me that 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.060
 let the street art grow with a 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.160
 movement stronger and more encompassing 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.830
 spaces apart from the street and that 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.510
 guys can sometimes eat to say that 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.170
 they are so passionate that it really is my 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.120
 hobby is living is that they stop 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.820
 feel so big every time 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.940
 come out something and start to perfect 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.700
 more what they do and do not be conformists 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.500
 study and practice and not what 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.620
 do formal because it tries to figure 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.120
 in the matter 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.120
 of art think
