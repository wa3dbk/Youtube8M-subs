00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 at monster, the stars were like 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.310
 swimmerin mirna jukic kicker ivica 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
 vastic the beachvolley clemens 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 doppler and alex horst or the babies 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.580
 Father Stephan pit comes alex peya 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.009
 right from the beginning, well under pressure 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 the team chef called Herbert Prohaska 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.119
 almost impossible instruction was that he 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.529
 bad loser is and we have 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 trying to implement what you do 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.580
 at least not lose that he 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.470
 the sport is happy as apps struggled 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.710
 Clemens Trimmel turned out honestly 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.930
 as a super thrower alex antonitsch 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.070
 highest use only beachflag alex 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.579
 Horst quarreled with his 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.579
 chance evaluation 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.750
 at the first turn like something older 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.699
 laying goalie on the chest shot 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.620
 to democratize at the time 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.360
 but so slowly but allstars 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.370
 wacker clemens doppler 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
 increases to top forms, even if 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 it after the two times 20 minutes with 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 calls that a bit more difficult that 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.739
 knowing the board to recognize where we are 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.049
 So while at the beach volleyball against 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.180
 holland 7 is a bit at the end 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.009
 but more so that is have 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.720
 was underestimated even if you are an athlete 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.340
 underestimated the television to watch out 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.619
 but really good off I really had 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.220
 so easy off you from further afield 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.020
 engaged but she tells you the same but 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.060
 that was annoying was another sport 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.610
 most50 would have other eyes 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.649
 but there you could be so it would be nothing 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.960
 For me it was more leisurely davis 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.729
 cup captain stefan koubek at all 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.289
 The motto I run right into the cover 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.289
 I do not have to go back 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.260
 So it was true if you were so 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.200
 You can be economical 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.580
 move and if you see there is behind 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.160
 nothing more to be hoped times must 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.980
 without the women team how can coach 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.140
 quique riegler and mirna jukic gave 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.960
 everything and makes every case much more 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.030
 elegance into the game out that gates 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.040
 Well, who believes there was already one 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.080
 Deal with the Torleuten if the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.460
 shoot girls then take that 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.190
 not quite so accurate 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.990
 now the meetings are over and you 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.240
 have to do so and only three steps 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.590
 and once you have the ball caught 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.990
 then you can still operate on me 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.930
 but you have to throw and yes not so 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.459
 like in basketball and yes and I have 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.560
 all the time thinking about it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.970
 Do not go wrong with me 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 At my team she is not with me 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.390
 and I think that was the problem is 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.040
 just how he should play on it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.710
 maybe she's better then 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.850
 is working 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.320
 sometimes take cover 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.660
 connection has any there 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.430
 give instructions yes once he has 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:41.850
 the two said they survived the two 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.950
 Namely, Klara does not explain in advance 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.660
 tosters gave boris take the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.820
 necessary support and ivica vastic 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:53.540
 turned out to be in the attack as true 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:55.500
 Handballs that's in the blood 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.900
 actually on a Croatian 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.030
 national team spectators the way and 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.130
 Join in and you can do that too 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.620
 implement without being big now 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.800
 play only at seven meters, so to speak 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.720
 had the roosters would be problems there was 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.830
 I have to overburden coal so far 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.480
 outside so big and 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.460
 I threw a room for the first time 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.770
 So apparently it is not like that 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.780
 simply should have thrown faster 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.180
 I also think that Schlecker would have 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.400
 certainly with the snow gone 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.470
 and gives the snow of absolutely right 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.060
 a light all-star convincing 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.180
 Final minute was from the referee 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.680
 do not punish anything good 21 at the end 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.630
 21 the finish of the team boss and in 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.850
 considering that in the player 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.770
 have called for meetings in them and 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.880
 I would have a defeat personally 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.340
 took 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 so you can draw with the draw 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.400
 all cases are very satisfied 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.620
 Highly deserved giants catch all allstars 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.150
 First , what are there really celebrities 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.830
 Sport sizes have agreed and believe 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.500
 I should get the event though 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.840
 He was fun and never again 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.280
 will be invited to correct well if 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.280
 the video has also come back
