yellow this is a cream formula I went in
with<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.960> obvious<00:00:28.380> way<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:28.890> have<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
that off on the neck of the bottle and

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.090 
that off on the neck of the bottle and
then<00:00:34.050> try<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.410> thin<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.340> bit

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
then try to thin it out a little bit

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.260 
then try to thin it out a little bit
then<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.520> orangish<00:00:39.450> red<00:00:39.780> color<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.460> then<00:00:41.910> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
then an orangish red color and then just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
then an orangish red color and then just
a<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.719> further<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.860> another

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
a little bit further down do another

a little bit further down do another
four<00:00:44.520> brush<00:00:44.789> strokes<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.450> then<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:45.840> it

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
four brush strokes and then that's it

four brush strokes and then that's it
for<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> back<00:00:46.590> feathers<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.430> pretty

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
for the back feathers so it's pretty

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
and just kind of making a circle at the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.749 
and just kind of making a circle at the
base<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.290> nail<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.130> use<00:01:17.310> acrylic

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
base of the nail you can use acrylic

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.450 
base of the nail you can use acrylic
paint<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.240> would<00:01:18.360> actually<00:01:18.720> dry<00:01:18.930> faster<00:01:19.530> for

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
paint that would actually dry faster for

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
paint that would actually dry faster for
sure<00:01:20.540> but<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> ton<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> colors<00:01:22.740> for<00:01:22.920> nail

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
sure but I have a ton of colors for nail

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
sure but I have a ton of colors for nail
polish<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.549> thought<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> might<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:24.150> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
polish so I thought I might as well just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
polish so I thought I might as well just
use<00:01:24.659> those<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.890> kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.159> pouncing

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
use those so I'm just kind of pouncing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.039 
use those so I'm just kind of pouncing
it<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:26.970> down<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> create<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.630> circle<00:01:30.049> do

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it up and down to create a circle do

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
it up and down to create a circle do
that<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.380> all<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.130> also<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that on all of them it would also be I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.039 
that on all of them it would also be I
think<00:01:33.119> almost<00:01:33.299> much<00:01:33.659> cuter<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:35.130> accent

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
think almost much cuter as an accent

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.569 
think almost much cuter as an accent
situation<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.350> instead<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.770> having<00:01:37.979> turkeys

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
situation so instead of having turkeys

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.219 
situation so instead of having turkeys
on<00:01:38.729> every<00:01:38.970> hand<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.049> one

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on every hand you can just do it on one

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.350 
on every hand you can just do it on one
