right<00:00:23.880> there<00:00:26.269> I<00:00:27.269> guess<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.810> got<00:00:27.960> nervous<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
landed in a heater and he died so that's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
landed in a heater and he died so that's
sad<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.829> upset<00:00:59.219> since<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.120> pretty

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
sad and I'm upset since he was pretty

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.969 
sad and I'm upset since he was pretty
