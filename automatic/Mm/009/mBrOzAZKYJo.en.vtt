here<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.410> about<00:02:01.650> there<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.120> from<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
here to about there and then from the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.170 
here to about there and then from the
corner<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.920> corner<00:02:04.950> up<00:02:05.310> along<00:02:05.580> here<00:02:05.610> around

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
corner the corner up along here around

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
corner the corner up along here around
the<00:02:06.270> edge<00:02:06.360> table<00:02:06.660> out<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.110> I've

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
the edge table out there and I've

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.080 
the edge table out there and I've
actually<00:02:07.320> left<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> hole<00:02:08.879> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
actually left there's a bit of a hole in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780 
actually left there's a bit of a hole in
the<00:02:09.179> front<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.629> can<00:02:09.810> see<00:02:10.400> and<00:02:11.400> left<00:02:11.610> that

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the front as you can see and left that

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.250 
the front as you can see and left that
down<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> front<00:02:12.239> because<00:02:12.660> when<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:12.840> made<00:02:13.110> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
down the front because when I made this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.780 
down the front because when I made this
thing<00:02:13.470> actually<00:02:13.830> made<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.220> thing<00:02:14.459> inside

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
thing actually made this thing inside

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.630 
thing actually made this thing inside
out<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.500> can<00:02:16.650> do<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.860> proper<00:02:17.069> stitching<00:02:17.519> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
out so I can do the proper stitching on

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.400 
out so I can do the proper stitching on
the<00:02:17.760> inside<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:19.379> this<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.920> actually

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the inside and this is actually

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.390 
the inside and this is actually
naturally<00:02:22.410> sort<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.739> see<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:25.220> fishing<00:02:26.220> line

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
naturally sort of see the fishing line

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.180 
naturally sort of see the fishing line
that<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.640> used<00:02:26.879> it's<00:02:27.870> about<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.379> think

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
that I used it's about I think

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.089 
that I used it's about I think
commemorates<00:02:29.670> about<00:02:29.819> 15<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.390> 16<00:02:30.569> kilo<00:02:31.260> fishing

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
commemorates about 15 or 16 kilo fishing

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.309 
commemorates about 15 or 16 kilo fishing
line<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.489> about<00:02:32.730> 30<00:02:33.090> or<00:02:33.269> 32<00:02:33.540> pen<00:02:33.930> fishing

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
line it's about 30 or 32 pen fishing

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.720 
line it's about 30 or 32 pen fishing
line<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.659> I<00:02:36.689> use<00:02:37.310> to<00:02:38.310> stitch<00:02:38.549> it<00:02:38.579> all

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
line and what I use to stitch it all

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.250 
line and what I use to stitch it all
together<00:02:38.849> with<00:02:39.269> I<00:02:39.299> used<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.689> do<00:02:39.810> two<00:02:39.930> great<00:02:40.109> big

needles<00:02:41.700> almost<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.569> 2<00:02:42.750> or<00:02:42.840> 3<00:02:43.019> inches

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
needles almost you know 2 or 3 inches

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.649 
needles almost you know 2 or 3 inches
long<00:02:43.439> about<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.829> long<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.239> about<00:02:45.420> 2<00:02:45.629> or

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
long about that long and it's about 2 or

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.770 
long about that long and it's about 2 or
3<00:02:45.750> millimeters<00:02:46.140> round<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.269> sit<00:02:48.480> down<00:02:48.629> my

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
3 millimeters round and I sit down my

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
3 millimeters round and I sit down my
hand-stitched<00:02:49.230> thing<00:02:49.439> like<00:02:49.590> chopped<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.519> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
hand-stitched thing like chopped off the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610 
hand-stitched thing like chopped off the
excess<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.629> hole<00:02:51.959> through<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
excess and with that hole through the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.640 
excess and with that hole through the
center<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:53.510> managed<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.569> push<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.379> all<00:02:55.470> around

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
center I managed to push it all around

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.830 
center I managed to push it all around
so<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.010> actually<00:02:56.280> inside<00:02:56.549> out<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:56.970> even

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
so I was actually inside out so even

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.720 
so I was actually inside out so even
that<00:02:57.959> sits<00:02:58.170> here<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.349> this<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.829> he<00:02:59.340> set<00:02:59.549> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that sits here like this and he set the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.940 
that sits here like this and he set the
right<00:02:59.849> way<00:03:00.030> around<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.829> didn't<00:03:01.829> actually

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
right way around I didn't actually

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
right way around I didn't actually
stitch<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.790> actually<00:03:02.970> stitch<00:03:03.390> it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
stitch it like that actually stitch it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.800 
stitch it like that actually stitch it
up<00:03:03.629> from<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.930> inside<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.540> see

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
up from the inside and you can see

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.920 
up from the inside and you can see
they're<00:03:06.959> just<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:08.299> seriously<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.629> if<00:03:09.810> you

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
they're just like seriously like if you

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.330 
they're just like seriously like if you
can<00:03:10.109> sort<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.409> see<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.769> some<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.099> join

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
can sort of see that some of the join

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.030 
can sort of see that some of the join
marks<00:03:11.810> across<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:13.079> where<00:03:13.200> my<00:03:13.349> thumb<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.650> like

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
marks across here where my thumb is like

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.879 
marks across here where my thumb is like
you're<00:03:14.639> doing<00:03:14.790> pretty<00:03:14.849> good<00:03:15.769> it's<00:03:16.769> actually

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
you're doing pretty good it's actually

come<00:03:17.250> together<00:03:17.430> quite<00:03:17.760> well<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.000> didn't<00:03:18.359> do

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
come together quite well I didn't do

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.690 
come together quite well I didn't do
tiny<00:03:19.409> little<00:03:19.500> stitching's<00:03:20.099> either<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.459> thought

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
tiny little stitching's either I thought

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.759 
tiny little stitching's either I thought
there<00:03:21.480> might<00:03:21.599> be<00:03:21.629> fancy<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.290> actually<00:03:22.620> did

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
there might be fancy this actually did

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.160 
there might be fancy this actually did
my<00:03:22.889> my<00:03:23.549> gaps<00:03:23.849> for<00:03:24.090> my<00:03:24.209> stitches<00:03:24.569> per<00:03:24.780> bit<00:03:24.989> 1

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
my my gaps for my stitches per bit 1

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.559 
my my gaps for my stitches per bit 1
inch<00:03:25.319> apart<00:03:25.939> it's<00:03:26.939> actually<00:03:27.209> turned<00:03:27.450> out

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
inch apart it's actually turned out

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.440
