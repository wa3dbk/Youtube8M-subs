this<00:00:01.970> here's<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.090> liqui<00:00:03.360> matic<00:00:03.659> converter<00:00:04.080> I

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
this here's the liqui matic converter I

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.560 
this here's the liqui matic converter I
have<00:00:04.670> the<00:00:06.200> mine<00:00:07.200> got<00:00:07.470> cut<00:00:08.400> off<00:00:08.429> somehow<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.210> I

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
have the mine got cut off somehow and I

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:31.490 
have the mine got cut off somehow and I
could<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.950> how<00:00:11.130> you<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:29.990> take<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> off

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
could with this how you do take this off

could with this how you do take this off
so<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.430> okay<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> want

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
so you have a little okay then you want

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.799 
so you have a little okay then you want
to<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.320> something<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:38.100> something<00:00:38.670> flat<00:00:38.969> cuz

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to get something like something flat cuz

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
to get something like something flat cuz
there<00:00:40.020> should<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.350> two<00:00:40.620> divots<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.250> right

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
there should be two divots one right

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
there should be two divots one right
here<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> here<00:00:43.260> on<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.469> other

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
here there one on it here on the other

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.950 
here there one on it here on the other
side<00:00:43.879> so<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.120> using<00:00:45.270> these<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
side so I'm just using these just to

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.940 
side so I'm just using these just to
show<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.850> you're<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.950> then

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
show you you're gonna go like this then

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.970 
show you you're gonna go like this then
you<00:00:50.039> twist<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.700> off<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.440> should<00:00:52.649> loosen

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you twist it off and you should loosen

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
you twist it off and you should loosen
it<00:00:53.570> then<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.840> loosens<00:00:55.199> off<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.340> watch<00:00:57.300> out

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
it then this loosens off and watch out

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
it then this loosens off and watch out
because<00:00:57.719> there's<00:00:57.930> gonna<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> boil<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.219> there

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because there's gonna be a boil in there

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
oil to let that come out and then

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
oil to let that come out and then
there's<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.570> an<00:01:09.840> allen<00:01:10.200> head<00:01:10.350> screw

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
there's gonna be an allen head screw

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
there's gonna be an allen head screw
inside<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> there<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> take<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> allen<00:01:15.210> head

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
inside of there so take the allen head

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.859 
inside of there so take the allen head
screw<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.470> then<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> flat<00:01:18.600> blade

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
screw and then I just have a flat blade

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.090 
screw and then I just have a flat blade
but<00:01:19.170> yeah<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.920> comes<00:01:20.159> out<00:01:20.460> while<00:01:20.880> wha<00:01:21.320> that<00:01:22.320> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
but yeah it comes out while wha that it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.810 
but yeah it comes out while wha that it
should<00:01:23.369> come<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.659> right

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
should come out and if you do that right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.480 
should come out and if you do that right
and<00:01:26.820> once<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:28.409> once<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.280> out

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and once it's that's once this is out

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.990 
and once it's that's once this is out
right<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:32.310> should<00:01:32.579> still<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:32.820> on

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
right here then it should still be on

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.289 
right here then it should still be on
your<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.240> pad<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.040> would<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.490> usually

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
your go pad and then I would I usually

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.440 
your go pad and then I would I usually
hit<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.780> part<00:01:37.320> which<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.909> back<00:01:39.090> box

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
hit this part which is in the back box

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.740 
hit this part which is in the back box
you<00:01:40.380> know<00:01:40.500> connected<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.220> frame<00:01:41.750> just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you know connected to your frame just

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
you know connected to your frame just
hit<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> hammer<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.799> couple<00:01:44.640> times

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
hit it with a hammer a couple times

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.620 
hit it with a hammer a couple times
right<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> base<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.090> then<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.479> can

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right here at the base and then you can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.910 
right here at the base and then you can
like<00:01:48.750> turn<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> engine<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.649> keep

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like turn the engine and just keep

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.870 
like turn the engine and just keep
hitting<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> hammer

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
hitting it with the hammer

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.840 
hitting it with the hammer
not<00:01:51.119> too<00:01:51.570> hard<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.110> hard<00:01:52.439> enough<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:53.490> pop<00:01:53.700> it

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
not too hard but hard enough to pop it

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
not too hard but hard enough to pop it
off<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.799> should<00:01:56.250> eventually<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
off and then it should eventually just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.730 
off and then it should eventually just
pop<00:01:57.329> off<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.290> slide<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> out

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
pop off and you can just slide it out

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.520 
pop off and you can just slide it out
and<00:01:59.750> yep<00:02:00.750> that's<00:02:01.200> pretty<00:02:01.710> much<00:02:01.860> how<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.399> it
