00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.260 
that's what we actually have in here
right<00:01:17.090> now

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
right now

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.770 
right now
now<00:01:18.050> we<00:01:18.380> also<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:18.890> half<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.759> cup<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.240> warm

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
now we also have half a cup of that warm

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.780 
now we also have half a cup of that warm
water<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:21.470> were<00:01:21.619> talking<00:01:21.890> about<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:22.729> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
water that we were talking about now the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.370 
water that we were talking about now the
reason<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:23.240> do<00:01:23.329> this<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.509> this<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.900> creating<00:01:24.320> a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
reason we do this is this is creating a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.990 
reason we do this is this is creating a
proof<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.979> this<00:01:25.100> is<00:01:25.220> gonna<00:01:25.310> be<00:01:25.520> what<00:01:25.670> allows

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
proof and this is gonna be what allows

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.910 
proof and this is gonna be what allows
our<00:01:26.299> dough<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.540> rise<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.500> we're<00:01:27.650> gonna<00:01:27.740> be

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
our dough to rise so we're gonna be

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.460 
our dough to rise so we're gonna be
stirring<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.549> into<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.360> warm<00:01:29.540> water<00:01:32.470> once

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
stirring this into the warm water once

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.109 
stirring this into the warm water once
you've<00:01:33.619> given<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:34.040> stir<00:01:34.369> we're<00:01:34.790> gonna<00:01:34.880> set

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
you've given it a stir we're gonna set

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.510 
you've given it a stir we're gonna set
it<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.329> the<00:01:35.450> side<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:36.200> then<00:01:36.950> we're<00:01:37.130> gonna<00:01:37.280> talk

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
it to the side and then we're gonna talk

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.639 
it to the side and then we're gonna talk
a<00:01:37.549> little<00:01:37.790> bit<00:01:38.000> about<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:38.299> flour<00:01:38.689> now<00:01:39.409> we

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
cooking for one maybe even two it's a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.590 
cooking for one maybe even two it's a
great<00:01:49.100> idea<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.579> either<00:01:49.729> move<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.060> rest<00:01:50.420> of

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
great idea to either move the rest of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.030 
great idea to either move the rest of
the<00:01:50.689> dough<00:01:50.810> into<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.229> fridge<00:01:51.500> after<00:01:51.710> we've

the dough into the fridge after we've
completed<00:01:52.460> this<00:01:52.670> step<00:01:52.790> or<00:01:53.060> freeze<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.630> for

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
completed this step or freeze it for

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.020 
completed this step or freeze it for
another<00:01:54.079> use<00:01:54.350> now<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.310> lot<00:01:55.579> of<00:01:55.670> people<00:01:55.850> also

to use my microwave if I'm not gonna
have<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.060> use<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.360> because<00:04:23.449> it's<00:04:23.780> warm<00:04:24.110> and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
have to use it because it's warm and

have to use it because it's warm and
it's<00:04:24.440> damp<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:24.830> that's<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.160> type<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.430> climate

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
it's damp and that's the type of climate

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.550 
it's damp and that's the type of climate
we<00:04:25.849> want<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.150> dough<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.389> rise<00:04:26.599> in<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.440> I'm

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
we want this dough to rise in so I'm

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.960 
we want this dough to rise in so I'm
gonna<00:04:27.740> go<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.130> pop<00:04:28.340> it<00:04:30.699> in<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:33.229> our<00:04:33.320> microwave

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
gonna go and pop it in to our microwave

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.640 
gonna go and pop it in to our microwave
now<00:04:34.970> it's<00:04:35.150> gonna<00:04:35.270> have<00:04:35.479> to<00:04:35.599> rise<00:04:35.750> for<00:04:35.990> one<00:04:36.380> hour

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
now it's gonna have to rise for one hour

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.890 
now it's gonna have to rise for one hour
so<00:04:37.130> just<00:04:37.160> leave<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.789> alone<00:04:37.849> and<00:04:38.090> after<00:04:38.719> now

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
so just leave it alone and after now

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.000 
so just leave it alone and after now
we're<00:04:39.110> going<00:04:39.229> to<00:04:39.289> show<00:04:39.469> you<00:04:39.500> how<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.770> finish

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
we're going to show you how to finish

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.040 
we're going to show you how to finish
prepping<00:04:40.190> your<00:04:40.430> dough<00:04:40.610> we've<00:04:41.330> just<00:04:41.690> taken<00:04:41.810> our

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
prepping your dough we've just taken our

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.480 
prepping your dough we've just taken our
dough<00:04:42.200> out<00:04:42.500> of<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.800> microwave<00:04:43.130> where<00:04:43.340> it's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
dough out of the microwave where it's

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.900 
dough out of the microwave where it's
just<00:04:43.610> been

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
just been

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.490 
just been
rusting<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.480> let<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.780> dough<00:04:44.900> rise<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
rusting to let the dough rise and the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.530 
rusting to let the dough rise and the
next<00:04:45.830> step<00:04:45.980> is<00:04:46.100> preheating<00:04:46.640> our<00:04:46.730> oven<00:04:46.790> we're

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
next step is preheating our oven we're

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.660 
next step is preheating our oven we're
gonna<00:04:47.600> be<00:04:47.810> preheating<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.620> to<00:04:48.830> 500<00:04:49.100> degrees

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
gonna be preheating it to 500 degrees

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.520 
gonna be preheating it to 500 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.420> adding<00:04:51.020> our<00:04:51.140> baking<00:04:51.500> sheet

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
Fahrenheit and adding our baking sheet

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.530 
Fahrenheit and adding our baking sheet
so<00:04:51.740> it<00:04:52.010> can<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.220> nice<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.700> hot<00:04:52.850> as<00:04:53.000> well<00:04:53.210> and

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
so it can get nice and hot as well and

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.230
