00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950

a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:40.030> bit<00:02:40.209> below<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.690> rocker<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.820> think

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
a little bit below the rocker I think

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.199 
a little bit below the rocker I think
it'll<00:02:42.940> be<00:02:43.120> all<00:02:43.239> right<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:45.519> then<00:02:45.670> back<00:02:45.910> there's

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
it'll be all right and then back there's

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.509 
it'll be all right and then back there's
will<00:02:46.600> turn<00:02:47.380> up<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.769> go<00:02:47.890> through<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.220> bed<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
will turn up and go through the bed to

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.830 
will turn up and go through the bed to

was trying to make a quiet good flow and

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.380 
was trying to make a quiet good flow and
exhausting<00:02:59.290> his<00:02:59.800> method<00:03:00.670> would<00:03:00.790> start<00:03:01.120> big

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
exhausting his method would start big

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.229 
exhausting his method would start big
and<00:03:01.920> work<00:03:02.920> your<00:03:03.040> way<00:03:03.100> smaller<00:03:03.610> when<00:03:03.820> he<00:03:03.910> got<00:03:04.060> to

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
and work your way smaller when he got to

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.380 
and work your way smaller when he got to
the<00:03:04.360> back<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.320> I'm<00:03:06.280> starting<00:03:06.640> small<00:03:06.970> and

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the back so I'm starting small and
