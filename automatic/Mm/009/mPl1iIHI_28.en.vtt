00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
is Shimano added the size is here and it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.150

I mean just so that you can sort of get
an<00:00:26.430> idea<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:26.910> big<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.900> thing

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
an idea of how big it is this thing

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.200 
an idea of how big it is this thing
holds<00:00:28.380> nine<00:00:28.590> hundred<00:00:28.949> yards<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> 65<00:00:29.880> pound

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.530 
hand I mean it's just enormous holds a
ton<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> line<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.820> manual<00:01:41.820> bail

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
ton of line it's got the manual bail

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
ton of line it's got the manual bail
there<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> got<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> trip<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:44.460> yourself

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there so you got a trip it over yourself

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810 
there so you got a trip it over yourself
and<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:46.439> weighs<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.490> thirty

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
and the weighs in at just about thirty

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.460

four<00:01:48.060> point<00:01:48.360> nine<00:01:48.540> ounces<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.229> actually

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
four point nine ounces so it's actually

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.870 
four point nine ounces so it's actually
not<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.770> heavy<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.250> size<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.579> reel<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
not that heavy for this size of reel you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.069 
not that heavy for this size of reel you
know<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> real<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.780> hold

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
know you think of a real it hold
