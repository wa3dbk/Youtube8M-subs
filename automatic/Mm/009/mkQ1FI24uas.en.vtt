00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 Huub Stevens stepped after 2 hours of training 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.319
 satisfied from the field the first 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.210
 session is over 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 despite the fact that there are three lessons 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.980
 have fallen 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.029
 cora kromkamp and such a case 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.760
 this morning edison mendez is also there 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.000
 come who suffered a muscle rupture 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.980
 has June 10 at the international against 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.269
 Argentina 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.349
 we were not aware of that and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.000
 we get used to it this morning 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.489
 and that is a pity 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.100
 of course without a large group 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.070
 the money is then nice to have such a big one 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.780
 group have been like the Germans who 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 need a wide angle but i think 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.450
 that group actually a little too big 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.020
 I would much rather go to a man or 425 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.940
 you and then always go again 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.329
 again to do with injuries due to that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.460
 is logical but 425 people I think 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.469
 that is better than with those behind penny 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.940
 people on the field and then there is 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.649
 was still in the situation which 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.320
 this morning in an interview 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.049
 want to get away from psv i just got 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 times I have spoken and is of has 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.520
 I did not know that he was gone 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.950
 he doesn't want those words with me 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.460
 I used two conversations now 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.220
 lined 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.880
 there was this morning and that was two weeks 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.710
 ago and in those conversations here I had 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.390
 I have a positive impression on him 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 made clear there is no guarantees 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.020
 can give but that is actually not possible 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.060
 trainer all over the world this is em wat 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.100
 easier if you have evidence to speak with 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 and one kind at all goes the papers 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 then in the top of the the top is the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.920
 competition much bigger than in the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.350
 subtop but that is understandable 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.600
 as a trainer you might want something else 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.270
 can say then that I say times 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.369
 I don't think I'll be a trainer of either 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.329
 a subtop club I will prove speak 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.030
 giving guarantees of himself 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.329
 to play out there is further 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.369
 much to be expected in terms of sense or is this 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.189
 the group that is going to happen 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.799
 Ronaldo was called from the lace scarf 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.739
 you need something like that 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.510
 we think about it at some point 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.610
 if we didn't do that then believe 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.920
 I don't think we are creative 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.950
 I think we should go too 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.280
 think in what the market offers 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.620
 and to speak ronaldo 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.830
 here to rehabilitate and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.440
 possibly dana and then see if 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
 there's something more in it no if you get that chance 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.050
 then you should not put it aside 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.610
 put 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.500
 the new faces that are there 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.670
 have already found their way 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.940
 on the re-walk 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.610
 what is being worked on until 30 August 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.900
 that is always the first people of the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.180
 League 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.040
 that is the peak you then you know where you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.870
 because then you have to stand on it and 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.120
 Well we also know that we have a difficult one 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.590
 were in Utrecht 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.560
 yes I do not believe in the preseason 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 once so many points have been obtained from 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 from that 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.720
 we know that we are directly against demand 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.430
 we glad that I started again 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.950
 no I do I am really looking forward to it 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.470
 in and does because there are a lot of fun 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.990
 moment to recede with the boys and 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.880
 well the thumbs up if moments are those 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.180
 we might not be so cheerful 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.400
 but you know that in a group how that 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.570
 there are times when the trainer 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.310
 maybe a little more to the importance of 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.380
 be the team and a little less in it 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.060
 personal interest and so it is 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.070
 officially started the new season 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.690
 as usual many pictures and 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.690
 signatures on the re-entry
