00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
probably not then the design that we do

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.719 
probably not then the design that we do

I<00:02:28.160> like<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.430> much<00:02:28.580> if<00:02:29.030> it's<00:02:29.150> going<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.420> be

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
I like it that much if it's going to be

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.090 
I like it that much if it's going to be
lying<00:02:30.710> on<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> table<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.640> something<00:02:32.590> but<00:02:33.590> we

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
lying on a table or something but we

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.770 
lying on a table or something but we
have<00:02:34.130> to<00:02:34.400> wait<00:02:34.520> and<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.730> how<00:02:35.000> that<00:02:35.060> will<00:02:35.600> be

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
have to wait and see how that will be

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.620

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
here a little bit so that is definitely

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.780 
here a little bit so that is definitely
pretty<00:02:41.480> awesome<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.320> because<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:43.430> do<00:02:43.580> like
