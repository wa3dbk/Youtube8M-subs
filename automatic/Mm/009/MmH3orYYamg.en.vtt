00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.789
 hello I am model architectors 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.429
 architect and builders 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.399
 in fact the project is located in a building of a shopping street of the 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:26.779
 downtown dinan on the ground floor it houses a shop 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.419
 driver side street at the back the garden centers 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.059
 and actually the customers came to see us because it's a bit dated 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.520
 around areva's needs 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.680
 however the new weight so we have 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 we decided the transfer is in party part of the store in a 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.210
 area that was unoccupied 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.070
 so that we discovered cool things including the stairs 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.860
 who became the heart of the project and we turned around the stairs for 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.100
 create% 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.250
 and suddenly we do not have access percent customer welcome it takes 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.420
 celebrate this 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.170
 so that allowed us to clear a family surface after a breakthrough 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.920
 in the garden center so what makes you hang up the garden center to the 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.250
 street we wished to be very very sober our colors yesterday when it was 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 selected 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.750
 a dark brown 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.520
 a deep red 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.070
 for flowers to take their place in mind the purpose of construction 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.090
 in Quebec turf lovers at the time we see flowers that she 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.660
 feels parking and we traced hot colors where it was necessary 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.880
 yet in the shop 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.240
 we have the flowers that come alive alarmed uniboard 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.280
 so we opted to choose a red wine supported an arm alain delon 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.790
 supported for the masters can all that is green to 1 was a beautiful 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.410
 more moderate fallback movement the sheen gives it 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.680
 this is really beautiful 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.230
 and on the bench all that is% 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.020
 colorful flowers and red 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.580
 on all seasonal flowers 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.590
 and whatever their date their survival 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.720
 so the most complicated in the in the project once everything was stopped 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.720
 took shots what to do the work this week 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.180
 keeping e-commerce activities in europe option 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.030
 so we've ironed the singer of times 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.700
 because we have exceeded 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.450
 the commercial area 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.520
 we did the works have the art initially on the wound works the activity 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.490
 worked and we did our rank this week without leaning 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.229
 on this team
