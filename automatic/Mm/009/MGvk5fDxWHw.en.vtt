scenario<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.160> think<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.000> most<00:00:09.210> likely<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
scenario I think it's most likely to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.220 
scenario I think it's most likely to
happen<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.889> economic<00:00:11.490> collapse<00:00:11.929> then<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.019> go

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
happen is it economic collapse then I go

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.620 
happen is it economic collapse then I go
on<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.860> all<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.580> American<00:00:14.759> dollar<00:00:15.179> this

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
on it all about the American dollar this

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.380 
on it all about the American dollar this
is<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:16.049> how<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.010> way<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.340> are

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
is that how things are the way they are

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
is that how things are the way they are
but<00:00:18.390> instead<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.199> really<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.770> want

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
but instead of that I really just want

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.859 
but instead of that I really just want
to<00:00:20.010> make<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.279> video<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:21.000> show<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.270> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
only I think it's important for you to
invest<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> silver<00:01:19.430> I've<00:01:20.430> already<00:01:20.670> made<00:01:20.820> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
invest the silver I've already made a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
invest the silver I've already made a
video<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:22.140> also<00:01:22.290> why<00:01:23.070> support<00:01:23.610> if

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
video like that but also why support if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.630 
video like that but also why support if
you'd<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.030> different<00:01:24.450> size<00:01:24.720> breakdowns<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you'd have different size breakdowns the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.600 
you'd have different size breakdowns the
one<00:01:26.820> ounce<00:01:26.939> silver<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.360> think<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> most

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
one ounce silver I think is the most

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.240 
one ounce silver I think is the most
economic<00:01:29.990> economical<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.259> beat<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.619> worth

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
economic economical can beat it worth

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.440 
economic economical can beat it worth
the<00:01:32.400> purchase<00:01:32.549> when<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.030> comes<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.240> silver

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the purchase when it comes to silver

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
the purchase when it comes to silver
bullion<00:01:33.689> but<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.650> also<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.520> should<00:01:35.700> not

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
bullion but I also think you should not

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.330 
bullion but I also think you should not
sell<00:01:36.360> yourself<00:01:36.479> short<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.409> getting<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
sell yourself short of getting the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
sell yourself short of getting the
quarter<00:01:38.610> ounce<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> half<00:01:39.240> ounce<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.799> any

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.580 
quarter ounce to half ounce and any
other<00:01:41.130> ounce<00:01:41.369> pretty<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.090> those

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
other ounce pretty much in between those

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.950 
other ounce pretty much in between those
with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> top<00:01:43.890> set<00:01:44.479> again<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.509> would<00:01:45.720> like<00:01:45.869> to
