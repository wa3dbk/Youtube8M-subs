 this time we will show you step 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.580
 step by step how to install a dryer for 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.580
 that you can do it yourself 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.720

 maneuver for this you can use some 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.400
 tweezers so that it is tight 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.070
 after discovering with Teflon tape 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.440
 the gas stopcock the tube 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.230
 gas installation the gas outlet of the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.030
 dryer and the new adapter in case of 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.370
 that you require one 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.410
 Remember to place the Teflon tape on 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.079
 the same direction in which to screw 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.790
 the components once you already 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.160
 covered with Teflon the different 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.230
 parts threads the three adapter 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.809
 eighths of an inch in the gas intake of 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.180
 the dryer and with a telescopic key 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.449
 or perica make sure it is well 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.820
 tight does the same thing to install 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.330
 the gas stopcock in the tube of the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.720
 wall subsequently takes the hose 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.340
 flexible and screw both ends one 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.590
 must go in the gas outlet of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.080
 dryer or the adapter that you already had 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.210
 placed and the other end should go 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.430
 connected to the gas pipe 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.700
 uses a stilson key so that 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.950
 you can tighten well now enter the 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.229
 clamp in the flexible metal duct 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 and with a screwdriver connect it to the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.200
 air outlet of the dryer 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.909
 the other end of the pipeline should go in the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.549
 hole in the wall which is 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.500
 prepared for the air outlet to 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.600
 that hot air is released in the 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.060
 exterior wall you must place an exit 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.890
 of air with grilles which you can 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.740
 place introducing the compression in 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.580
 the hole remembers to open again the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.890
 gas stopcock 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.190
 says that's how it went, get your hands on
