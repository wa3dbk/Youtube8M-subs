00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.299

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 active 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.820
 I left blue whites and defined the code that 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.239
 do you want 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.950
 right set the code you can 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:19.659
 just sign out and hold the button 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.799
 as he will ask the enter fished only 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:26.379
 type and then release it for you to hang up 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.280
 Your phone, because I'm talking. 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.430
 that 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.519
 if you hold your blockbuster nor 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.060
 should appear to you to turn off your 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.099
 idevice but with this application he asks 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.799
 a scene 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.599
 if you miss the password if you make a mistake 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.299
 so and will say that it was not so 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.159
 authorized and will not allow you to 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:56.829
 turn off your phone 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:58.810
 If you go into the lock screen, you too. 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.219
 You have to enter your password. 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:08.769
 if you go back there and try to 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:11.049
 phone will also ask for the password and there 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.010
 you choose whether you want to hang up or 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.129
 not 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.049
 This was the only application today. 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.319
 I'll talk later, it's an application like that. 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.409
 deserves a unique space in the channel and 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:26.079
 I hope you liked it and it's a 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:29.229
 very useful application very useful 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:33.340
 that for who has the iphone search 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:35.709
 certain it is going to be very useful because 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.599
 some day robin your device 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.689
 heu the person will not get off 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:46.449
 because you can not remove the batteries in the 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:49.479
 ipad battery goes apple is e 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:53.049
 Only the appliance will have to stay connected. 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:56.019
 and then you will be able to locate a 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.569
 person will not have the device code 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.590
 Are you going to keep trying not to try? 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.810
 will achieve 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.889
 and then you will have time to see where it is 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.579
 lock your device and make other 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:12.189
 things 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:14.739
