00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.700
 I greet my students and I am 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.140
 requesting that for the animation that I 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 they must do work with images 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.010
 transparent I'll show you how to get off 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.610
 these transparent images I'm going to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.980
 enter google 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.950
 I'm going to look 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.900
 here in pictures 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.770
 no one 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.770
 space 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.489
 where it says search tools 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.969
 we click on transparent color and 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.930
 also if I want I can give you size 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.530
 medium 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.740
 in this way the images he brings 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.800
 to be transparent color in this case 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.110
 You can be PNG in your home in your great 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.600
 majority and in that way when 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.640
 let's flash, it's going to be much more 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.070
 easy we also realize 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.040
 the image is transparent when it has 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 look at this background here as a mosaic 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.680
 means that all this is color 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.190
 transparent I'm going to take the click image 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.229
 right save image as in the 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.730
 desk I have a folder that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.950
 flame transparent image 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.979
 I am going to tell you 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.979
 the name will record it as a bird 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.290
 now I'm going to 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.350
 suddenly bring a fund where I go to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.189
 place this ship 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.189
 and that background I'm going to call space 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 stellar 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.230
 also medium 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.490
 from here that is not transparent but 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.440
 any color this if it can be with a 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.200
 medium background 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.620
 here this average can not be 600 more 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.620
 or less 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.569
 then this file of the same goat 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.569
 save as 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.390
 I'm going to place here 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.430
 well it's called other worlds let's leave it 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.569
 with that no man 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 I close then if I go to the desk and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.590
 I look at the folder here I realize that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:39.000
 I have the ship and I have the background the background 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 it tells me here that size 600 by 450 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I'm going to flash 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.000
 and I say file 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.930
 and I apply that same size 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:56.390
 of fund 600 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.390
 for 450 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.510
 the first thing that I will place then is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.510
 the archive file import to library 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.210
 I go to the desk 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.390
 transparent image and I bring the background 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:20.209
 here I am left to see included in the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.800
 library it out of the library and 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.680
 I place here 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.660
 obviously every perfect because we gave him 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.620
 the same size of the image at the bottom of 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:37.080
 flash and here in layer 1 I say background 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:40.990
 now yes import file 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:43.210
 the library and I bring the ship 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.910
 come with the transparent background then 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.030
 If I place it here, look, I will not give 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.470
 account that if it comes transparent as the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.260
 we need 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.170
 obviously for that I'm going to create a 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.730
 new layer 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.730
 which I will call ship 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.380
 then I bring the ship 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:10.350
 in the ship layer I'm going to change the size 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.920
 then here with the transformation with 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.920
 the letter q 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.530
 to put it out here 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.880
 perfect 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.620
 and I do again selection and I do the 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.160
 movement that we already know we have repeated 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.400
 on several occasions 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.240
 of classical interpolation I locate by 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.340
 example 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.449
 around here in 80 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.449
 I give him f5 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:56.620
 after giving him f5 I give him right click 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:01.630
 create classic interpolation 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.740
 I'm on the ship after I give him f6 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.490
 and I pass to the ship 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.490
 to the other side 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.969
 in this way I already have the movement of 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.249
 the ship 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.740
 that is missing to make come here in the 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.139
 background 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.389
 locate me also in 80 which is where 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.260
 end and give f5 for that fund 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:28.320
 to repeat me enter and there I have 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.870
 the animation let's make a variation 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.210
 in this animation is to say that the 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.210
 second 1 up 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.749
 50 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.940
 I give f 6 in 50 normality and here 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:52.230
 I tell him not to come here he changed the 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.230
 free transformation size the increase 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.440
 and look what is going to happen from the 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.480
 second one the ship 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.570
 is going to approach with the increase that I'm 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.920
 doing up to the second 50 and here it 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.770
 it will move away 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.470
 it's more here in the end I'm going to give it another 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.250
 transformation time and I turn it back 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.730
 a little bit smaller he placed it as 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.730
 over here 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.740
 so what happened 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.030
 about 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.380
 disappears control enter to see it in 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.380
 window 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.169
 well this is what I had for 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.830
 show them and so please work 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:47.860
 these images with transparent background 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:52.439
 down then for the moment of internet 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.439
 thank you very much and until another opportunity
