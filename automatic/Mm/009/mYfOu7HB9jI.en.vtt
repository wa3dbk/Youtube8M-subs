spring action um tool then with a link
below<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.460> specifically<00:00:20.460> made<00:00:20.850> for

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
below it specifically made for

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:28.150 
below it specifically made for
watchbands<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.710> it's<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.490> like<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.290 

it's<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.340> a<00:00:29.429> basically<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> flathead

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's like a basically like a flathead

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's like a basically like a flathead
screwdriver<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.800> got<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:33.200> notch

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
screwdriver but it's got a little notch

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.389 
screwdriver but it's got a little notch
in<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.469> middle<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.120> what<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.390> means<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:37.399> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
in the middle and what that means if you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
in the middle and what that means if you
don't<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.640> how<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.820> move<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> band<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:41.010> have

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
don't know how to move the band you have

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
don't know how to move the band you have
to<00:00:42.829> put<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> tool<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:46.579> then<00:00:47.579> pop<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
to put a tool in here and then pop the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
to put a tool in here and then pop the
spring<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> strap<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.899> has<00:00:52.579> no

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
spring out from the strap this has no

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.450 
spring out from the strap this has no
notch<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> middle<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:55.620> basically<00:00:56.129> you're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
notch in the middle so basically you're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
notch in the middle so basically you're
going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> fool<00:00:57.149> around<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.890> get<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
going to have to fool around to get it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
going to have to fool around to get it
and<00:00:59.489> you're<00:00:59.609> gonna<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> put<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> lit<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and you're gonna have to put a lit of

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
and you're gonna have to put a lit of
excess<00:01:01.289> pressure<00:01:01.620> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.489> watch<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
excess pressure on the watch and if this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120 
excess pressure on the watch and if this
tool<00:01:05.700> had<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.470> notch<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.770> middle

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
tool had a little notch in the middle

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
tool had a little notch in the middle
you<00:01:08.280> could<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.580> right<00:01:08.939> around<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.960> metal<00:01:10.229> bar

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
you could go right around the metal bar

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
you could go right around the metal bar
in<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> pop<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.369> right<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
in there and pop it right out the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
in there and pop it right out the
reasoning<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.280> don't<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.119> these

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
reasoning you don't want to use these

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
reasoning you don't want to use these
flathead<00:01:15.840> screwdrivers<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.830> could<00:01:16.979> end<00:01:17.130> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
flathead screwdrivers you could end up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.240 
flathead screwdrivers you could end up
putting<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.680> bending<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.979> too

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
putting this in there I'm bending it too

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.640 
putting this in there I'm bending it too
high<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.119> putting<00:01:21.840> too<00:01:21.960> much<00:01:22.110> pressure<00:01:22.170> on

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
high and putting too much pressure on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
high and putting too much pressure on
the<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> watch<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.020> know

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
but the Moto 360 itself looks very good
