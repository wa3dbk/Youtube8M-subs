you<00:03:16.710> know<00:03:16.800> so<00:03:17.280> don't<00:03:17.640> get<00:03:17.730> rust<00:03:18.000> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.210> inside

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010

let's<00:03:20.010> see<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.520> tires<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.940> rear<00:03:21.030> are<00:03:21.860> to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
let's see the tires in the rear are to

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:35.250 
let's see the tires in the rear are to
95<00:03:23.340> 55<00:03:24.320> Mickey<00:03:25.320> tops<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.770> drag<00:03:26.220> radials

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.390 

and<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:36.409> the<00:03:36.500> front<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:36.800> have<00:03:37.659> Cooper<00:03:38.659> Cobras

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and in the front we have Cooper Cobras

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.180 
and in the front we have Cooper Cobras
and<00:03:40.599> these<00:03:41.599> are<00:03:41.810> 235<00:03:43.090> 6015<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:45.680> it<00:03:45.769> had<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.010> car

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
and these are 235 6015 so it had the car

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.890 
and these are 235 6015 so it had the car
sits<00:03:46.430> with<00:03:46.580> a<00:03:46.610> slight<00:03:47.030> amount<00:03:47.269> of<00:03:47.450> you<00:03:47.810> know

for<00:03:48.140> Drake<00:03:48.409> I'd<00:03:48.590> say<00:03:48.709> about<00:03:48.799> an<00:03:48.980> inch<00:03:53.379> but<00:03:54.379> if

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
for Drake I'd say about an inch but if

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.360 
for Drake I'd say about an inch but if
you<00:03:54.560> switch<00:03:54.739> over<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:54.980> the<00:03:55.220> nito's<00:03:56.440> they<00:03:57.440> that

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
you switch over to the nito's they that

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.980 
its instead of being a regular switch
for<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.919> might<00:05:40.190> see<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.550> it's<00:05:41.449> actually<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
pull the air out you'll notice the car

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.840 
pull the air out you'll notice the car

down<00:05:56.740> and<00:05:57.740> crank<00:05:58.039> it

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.490 

probably<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.419> little<00:06:04.570> bit<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.840> moisture<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.199> sit
