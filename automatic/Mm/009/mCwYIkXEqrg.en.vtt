 dron the intermodal terminal of 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.810
 ferrovalle never rests 24 hours 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.850
 the 365 days of the year the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.220
 mobilization of vans cars and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.930
 containers loaded with goods that 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.879

 cars are inside the mosaic of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.629
 items that come together in this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.010
 logistics complex for your 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.960
 rearrangement and distribution 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.179
 mainly towards the federal district 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.850
 and mexico valley only in the last 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.010
 year this space received almost 400 thousand 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 containers with finished goods and 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.120
 60 million tons of materials 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.559
 premiums transferred by rail only 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.990
 the intermodal part covers a 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.940
 surface of 54 hectares and 7 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.430
 linear kilometers from the avenue 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.270
 rabah still in the federal district up 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.549
 the municipality 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.500
 to nepantla in the state of mexico a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.689
 distance traveled in less than 10 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.429
 minutes by car 7 courtyards of 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.979
 maneuvers a tracking system in 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.840
 real time an enclosure inspected and a 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 customs space are part of the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.280
 logistic complex of ferrovalle well 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.319
 as in the airport there is a tower 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 of control here there is also one from 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.860
 where 60% of the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.860
 railway operations 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.399
 we are in the so-called hump in 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.409
 this place the railroad dogs are 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.869
 disengaged and descend by force 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.299
 of gravity towards a courtyard with 48 tracks 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.130
 a scale weighs them and a radar measures the 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.020
 speed of the wagons so that a 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 intelligent system determine the force 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.729
 with which they must be stopped and 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.119
 subsequently channeled to 48 possible 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.119
 Destinations 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 the great ones that have not passed 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.610
 previously by inspected anal are 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.530
 under review at customs a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.840
 once this point has been drawn for each container 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.270
 is deposited in a place marked with 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.460
 specific coordinates waiting to be 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.410
 claimed by their owners to this 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.240
 point is called the last mile 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.100
 area where the containers are 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.110
 mobilized with the help of cranes and 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 giant trucks called three costs 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.410
 care to be deposited in the units 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.030
 previously accredited for it here 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.680
 ends the train ride and the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.080
 goods leave the terminal 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.540
 complex intermodal with more than 50 years 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.440
 of trajectory and that presumes to be the most 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.440
 important of mexico 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.870
 ah
