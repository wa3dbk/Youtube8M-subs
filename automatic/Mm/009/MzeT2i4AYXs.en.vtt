00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.080
 from the very anticipated principle by the lost fans 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.720
 planet 3 has recently left 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.460
 leaked several doubts in the trust of the 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.440
 brand at the hands of spark unlimited 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.960
 capcom has opted for a change of course 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.970
 unconvincing, focusing on atmospheres 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.580
 strong dead space at the expense of 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.350
 dynamism already reported in the phase of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.760
 preview this feature yes 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.340
 reappointment in the final version 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:42.160
 leaving light above all interdicted 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:43.990
 of an uninspired gameplay the spal and 3 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.650
 tells us the incredible deeds of 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.930
 jim payton now at the point of death 50 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.760
 years of adventures on edn iii planet 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.470
 frozen where ours is the worker 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.030
 mercenary to carry on the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.070
 family 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.540
 a well packaged narrative system 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.950
 we will soon face the real 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.440
 interests of the business of 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.299
 multinational company that works by capturing 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.180
 attention thanks to the blows of 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.580
 scene in the center of attention, however 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.290
 will always be jim whose characterization 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 figure among the most successful aspects of 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 lost planet 3 intelligently inserted 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 between one mission and another convincing 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.229
 intermezzi will lay bare the soul of the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 protagonist painting it in a manner 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.850
 extremely human not always 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.400
 rather the supporting players some 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.870
 capable of arousing a certain interest 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.250
 others referable to real ones 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.140
 specks 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.640
 the budget is in any case positive for 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.280
 a sector that sees the winners being awarded 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.440
 evident verifiable production efforts 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.210
 here in a very good dubbing in the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.170
 relative safety of the interior of the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.290
 shuttle 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.420
 good luck focusing 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.119
 on the narrative aspect leaves lost 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.020
 planet 3 discovered at a playful level 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.899
 showing all the limits of one 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.790
 production with lackluster ideas 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.960
 structure closely resembles the third 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.000
 dead space episode 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.909
 but without the solidity and variety of the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.990
 share production in games 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.180
 getting between primary and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.619
 secondary we will soon realize we are stars 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.780
 experiencing a freedom of action 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.729
 fictitious unable to move the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.280
 progression from the heavy tracks of the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.780
 linearity assignment after assignment a 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.150
 especially missing the appearance 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.860
 exploratory that we awaited enhanced 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.209
 in the light of a setting all from 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.340
 rediscover 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.440
 the pace of the missions and slow tired 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 and with past and also when everything is 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.400
 the more interesting and eventful 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.540
 appearing quality of the level design not 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.150
 guarantees the long-awaited 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.549
 involvement the music does not change 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.080
 evaluating the shooter component for 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.910
 how between the ranks and believes they are 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.769
 numerous new additions to flesh out the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.690
 variety a little implementation 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.660
 botched pointing system e 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.340
 fire makes everything a lot less fun 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.019
 a pity given that the arsenal a 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.880
 disposition appears instead is varied and 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.010
 suitable for any solution and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.239
 possibility of upgrades e 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 customization guarantee a series 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.790
 of novelties not at all trivial 4 after painting 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.120
 lost planet 3 does not encourage experimentation 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.560
 not even fight during the boss fight 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.120
 initially galvanizing tides sin 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.609
 too early to expire in 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.590
 repetitive enemy pattern for him 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.420
 elaborate and the simple necessity of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.850
 dodge and shoot make these 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.620
 moments less and less spectacular 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.020
 it should have made things better 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.750
 the utility lines the mechanized means 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.160
 which replaces lives in the south 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.900
 unfortunately it is not so since even the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.780
 sessions on board the powerful non vehicle 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.400
 have the right bite used 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.660
 at first even as simple 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400
 means of transport 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.320
 the ring does not insert the variables that 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.020
 we waited especially from the change of 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.090
 prospect does n't even do it during i 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.240
 quicktime fights the winds in 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.890
 sequence is always too similar to each other 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.020
 and therefore this is the leit motiv of lost 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.480
 planet 3 a playful production 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.460
 without mordant characterized by 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.560
 several potentially interesting ideas 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.330
 but not implemented properly or left 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.440
 guilty on the sidelines of a move 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.840
 too flat linear for 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.340
 westernize lost planet 3 capcom 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.950
 is not limited to entrust development 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.720
 to a Californian team but also thought 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.270
 to change the graphic engine 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.820
 switching to the real engine 3 is the 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.160
 technically better result loses in 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.570
 personality transforming the splash 3 a 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.180
 all effects in a third person 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.950
 shooter among many talking 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.930
 concretely the polygonal modeling 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.910
 of the protagonists appears in line with the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.260
 recent productions if not at times 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.930
 even higher in the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.130
 realization of facial expressions 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.470
 textures and shaders stand on 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.210
 middle high level showing scotch of 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.430
 significant impact while good 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.370
 selection of particle effects 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.020
 characterizes the most spectacular moments 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.880
 the sound sector that fluctuates 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.920
 presenting effective samples of a 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.450
 Satisfactory dubbing shows a 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.130
 inaccurate work in terms of 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:52.160
 optimization and balancing of 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.990
 channels las planet 3 confirms a good part 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.480
 of doubts that we already had in a whisper 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.610
 expressed at a narrative level we are of 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.560
 face a very pleasant adventure well 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.210
 told and engaging from the beginning 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.930
 at the end 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.480
 unfortunately we cannot say the same 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.190
 of the rather flat playful component 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.660
 and devoid of that flicker that distinguishes i 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.570
 titles to remember from productions 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.550
 mediocri los planet 3 is just that 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.710
 the territory are average shooters 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.160
 who lets himself play without being passionate 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.160
 never really
