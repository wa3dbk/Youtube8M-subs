00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:38.480
 good at the craft level known as 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.989
 Good level is also known level 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.930
 informs us that this level is very 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.520
 simple and easy to prepare only 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.640
 requires two pieces of wood one 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:56.170
 small transparent hose and the ruler 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.870
 which we use is 180 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.199
 approximately for the measurement of 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.199
 batches 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.270
 mainly its use is for 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.030
 measure and take your bread level in a 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.369
 unhappy terrain in this way 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 Usually three people are used 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.530
 to ask for one that has the rules 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.479
 another that takes the level and another person 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.090
 who carries the data that they are taking 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 at each point of the terrain works 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.479
 this form 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.710
 you have to be very precise the margin of 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.750
 error depends on the person whom you 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.800
 looking because you have to keep in mind 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.250
 that the two cultures 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.850
 they must be aligned to take the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.510
 ground height at each point of the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510
 planet for more 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.009
 we can align a two and approximate what 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 as successful as possible to the height that 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.390
 we have already 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.390
 measured in our rule 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.760
 the size of the names we place 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.130
 in that rule because because according to the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.760
 the big one we will have the option to 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.840
 Yesterday, our measurement with 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.840
 our measurements in the lot 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.129
 this time we do not use a 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:56.420
 hose with an approximate diameter of 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:01.609
 1.5 minutes and a length of two fingers 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.180
 point 2.2 meters we use colored water 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:08.540
 hoisted to facilitate observation or 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.269
 determine with better visuality the 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.599
 end points of our hose 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.879
 videos with normal water as it is done to us 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.230
 a little more complicated then determine 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.230
 the height 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.340
 only 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.190
 now 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:51.940
 to facilitate the measurement with the 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:55.390
 good level is painted different 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:00.360
 colors like yellow green or 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.360
 size to give us an area 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:18.239
 Well thank you very much in this case 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:20.540
 this then our personal level for the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.540
 class 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.740
 enough continuations we are going to 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.539
 present medium type a to grant 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.460
 or the kind of we basically need 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.650
 in very few materials that is 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.550
 built for example with two slats 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.280
 of wood that go in hospital form and 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.130
 one that goes horizontally from that of 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.830
 horizontally here the love line what 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.449
 we use to observe the sea 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.630
 if the gravel inclination also 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.669
 we use a cabuya as we can see 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.490
 Each one recyclable material bottle 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.949
 which we fill to some extent 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.810
 this in order to obtain weights and 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.380
 that the rope indicates us with more 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.030
 precision to the extent 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.919
 this instrument helped us to 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.680
 determine the curving at the level of 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.370
 tilting the grounds we can not 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.370
 observe here 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.040
 if for example 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:31.190
 of level ground that we can see that 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.580
 does not match therefore has a degree 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.580
 tilt 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.319
 here we have a curve at the level between this 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:49.259
 point that we can name next to 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.259
 point of the other points already for example 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:01.830
 until the rope is not going to apply 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.780
 with the point 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.480
 what we have here last with a line 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.730
 blue is not going to form a 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.910
 90 degree angle the lath and the 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:20.370
 rope as we can see here 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:22.580
 coming back if we have a level to this 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.580
 level 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.009
 It is easy to apply for 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.509
 farmers since they do not require many 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:34.240
 costs usually in our field 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:36.220
 We can not buy equipment from 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.960
 more sophisticated topography therefore 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.930
 is in the artisan I do not know since great 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.199
 utility as to make a drain not 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.870
 there are at two levels of a crop x 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:50.400
 so then that's all we hope that 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.400
 be great authority thank you very much 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:06.080
 I'm going to give her to call besaya my 4 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:09.499
 open back to sing this 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.039
 pretty door and be truly worth of 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.039
 bed sheet
