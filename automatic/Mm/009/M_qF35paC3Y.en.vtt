tack and in the group but he said if

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
tack and in the group but he said if
there<00:01:29.780> was<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> problem<00:01:30.680> determining<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.610> in

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
there was a problem determining it in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.100 
there was a problem determining it in
advance<00:01:31.820> tons<00:01:32.300> of<00:01:32.390> dragons<00:01:32.750> he<00:01:32.810> whipped<00:01:32.990> by

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.490 
advance tons of dragons he whipped by
weapon<00:01:33.710> length<00:01:33.920> or<00:01:34.190> range<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.630> that's<00:01:36.050> why<00:01:36.290> he

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
weapon length or range so that's why he

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.380 
weapon length or range so that's why he
had<00:01:36.619> ranges<00:01:37.250> written<00:01:37.520> down<00:01:37.610> for<00:01:37.850> every<00:01:38.060> weapon

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
had ranges written down for every weapon

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.700 
had ranges written down for every weapon
he<00:01:38.899> had<00:01:39.110> weapons<00:01:39.649> speeds<00:01:40.160> he<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:42.200> know<00:01:42.320> he<00:01:42.560> had

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
he had weapons speeds he you know he had

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.800 
he had weapons speeds he you know he had
rate<00:01:42.950> of<00:01:43.100> fire<00:01:43.399> for<00:01:43.759> ranged<00:01:44.149> weapons<00:01:44.600> of

rate of fire for ranged weapons of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.960 
rate of fire for ranged weapons of
course<00:01:45.020> if<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.380> could<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:46.280> know<00:01:46.310> throw<00:01:46.700> three

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
course if you could you know throw three

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.580 
course if you could you know throw three
daggers<00:01:47.360> compared<00:01:47.720> to<00:01:47.840> shooting<00:01:48.110> two<00:01:48.259> arrows

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
daggers compared to shooting two arrows

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.410 
daggers compared to shooting two arrows
the<00:01:48.710> daggers<00:01:49.009> would<00:01:49.130> be<00:01:49.220> faster<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.240> I'd<00:01:50.300> he'd

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
the daggers would be faster so I'd he'd

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.700 
the daggers would be faster so I'd he'd
assumed<00:01:50.660> the<00:01:50.750> dagger<00:01:51.050> went<00:01:51.200> first<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:51.619> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
assumed the dagger went first then the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.980 
assumed the dagger went first then the
arrow<00:01:51.890> then<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.759> know<00:01:52.880> so<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.869> the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
arrow then the you know so on that's the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630 
arrow then the you know so on that's the
way<00:01:54.140> he<00:01:54.289> actually<00:01:54.619> intended<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.160> never<00:01:55.399> to

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
way he actually intended it never to

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.730 
way he actually intended it never to
actually<00:01:56.030> roll<00:01:56.240> for<00:01:56.539> initiative<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.229> let's

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
actually roll for initiative and let's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.800 
actually roll for initiative and let's
say<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.979> was<00:01:58.070> a<00:01:58.100> serious<00:01:58.640> fight<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.299> you<00:01:59.659> all

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
say it was a serious fight and you all

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.469 
say it was a serious fight and you all
had<00:01:59.990> weapons<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.740> her<00:02:00.830> even<00:02:01.369> or<00:02:01.640> just<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.420> make

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
had weapons of her even or just to make

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.990 
had weapons of her even or just to make
it<00:02:02.600> more<00:02:02.869> exciting<00:02:03.170> he<00:02:03.560> would<00:02:03.740> go<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.130> you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
it more exciting he would go with you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.789 
it more exciting he would go with you
know<00:02:05.119> well<00:02:05.450> for<00:02:05.750> initiative<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.500> then<00:02:06.710> there

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
know well for initiative and then there

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.710 
know well for initiative and then there
was<00:02:06.920> a<00:02:06.950> chance<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.460> time<00:02:07.760> and<00:02:08.239> that's<00:02:08.600> where
