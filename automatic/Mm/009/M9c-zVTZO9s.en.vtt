HTML doesn't recognize any line breaks
for<00:02:06.540> example<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:06.990> i<00:02:07.140> write<00:02:07.439> something<00:02:07.829> here

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
for example if i write something here

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.530 
for example if i write something here
this<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.970> some<00:02:10.069> nice<00:02:11.069> text<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.530> see<00:02:13.739> it's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
this is some nice text you can see it's

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530 
this is some nice text you can see it's
right<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.720> next<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:17.030> what<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.120> say<00:02:18.270> okay

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
right here next to it what you say okay

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.809

space and also the image is quite big

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.860 
space and also the image is quite big
and<00:03:25.810> for<00:03:26.350> example<00:03:26.650> if<00:03:26.710> we<00:03:26.830> change<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.870> see

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and for example if we change this see

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.260 
and for example if we change this see
it's<00:03:29.140> just<00:03:29.380> got<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.160> broken<00:03:30.880> image<00:03:31.060> there

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
it's just got that broken image there

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.240 
it's just got that broken image there
because<00:03:31.660> this<00:03:32.020> doesn't<00:03:32.320> exist<00:03:32.650> there<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.070> no

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
because this doesn't exist there is no

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.230 
because this doesn't exist there is no
double<00:03:33.760> underscore<00:03:34.210> in<00:03:34.540> ch<00:03:34.570> 1<00:03:34.810> 4pm<00:03:35.400> then<00:03:36.400> PMG

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
double underscore in ch 1 4pm then PMG

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.010 
double underscore in ch 1 4pm then PMG
so<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.620> want<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> user<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.460> know<00:03:40.330> that

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
so you want the user to know that

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.840 
so you want the user to know that
there's<00:03:41.260> something<00:03:41.440> wrong<00:03:41.710> so<00:03:42.190> we'll<00:03:42.520> have<00:03:42.670> to

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
there's something wrong so we'll have to

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.650 
there's something wrong so we'll have to
add<00:03:43.090> an<00:03:43.450> alternative<00:03:44.260> text<00:03:44.620> which<00:03:44.740> is<00:03:44.770> alt

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
and then no commas will put the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.520 
and then no commas will put the
alternative<00:03:50.440> text<00:03:50.770> which<00:03:50.920> is<00:03:51.420> sorry<00:03:52.530> the
