to<00:00:57.179> the<00:00:57.329> Allman<00:00:57.660> Brothers<00:00:58.160> originally<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
to the Allman Brothers originally it was

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.680 
to the Allman Brothers originally it was
the<00:00:59.489> fillmore<00:00:59.879> east<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.269> that's<00:01:00.390> no<00:01:00.539> longer

the fillmore east and that's no longer
there<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> beacon<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.219> kind<00:01:02.399> of
