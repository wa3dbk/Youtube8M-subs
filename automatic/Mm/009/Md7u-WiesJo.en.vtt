00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the BB King so I guess it's RC and then

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.660 
the BB King so I guess it's RC and then
we<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.830> make<00:04:17.240> agent<00:04:18.240> Simmons<00:04:18.510> ride<00:04:18.960> her<00:04:19.670> no

like what I did it's really fine you can

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.570 
like what I did it's really fine you can
transform<00:05:24.600> her<00:05:24.840> back<00:05:25.260> from<00:05:25.590> motorcycle<00:05:26.250> and

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
transform her back from motorcycle and

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.310 
transform her back from motorcycle and
it's<00:05:26.970> ropal<00:05:27.390> are<00:05:27.600> you<00:05:27.840> don't<00:05:28.050> see<00:05:28.200> the

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
it's ropal are you don't see the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.080 
it's ropal are you don't see the
problems<00:05:28.830> so<00:05:30.140> don't<00:05:31.140> worry<00:05:31.260> about<00:05:31.410> it<00:05:32.090> another

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
problems so don't worry about it another

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.270 
problems so don't worry about it another
video<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.810> made<00:05:34.500> us<00:05:34.650> believe<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.190> is

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
video it made us believe that this is

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.710 
video it made us believe that this is
such<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.430> horrible<00:05:35.700> figure<00:05:36.240> when<00:05:36.390> it's<00:05:36.540> not

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
such a horrible figure when it's not

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.990 
such a horrible figure when it's not
it's<00:05:37.140> clearly<00:05:37.440> one<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:37.950> very<00:05:38.820> interesting

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
it's clearly one of the very interesting

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.760 
it's clearly one of the very interesting
figure<00:05:39.420> you<00:05:39.540> just<00:05:39.750> have<00:05:39.930> to<00:05:40.080> be<00:05:40.170> patient<00:05:40.380> with

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
figure you just have to be patient with

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.310 
figure you just have to be patient with
it<00:05:40.800> yes<00:05:41.400> at<00:05:41.700> first<00:05:41.940> a<00:05:42.210> few<00:05:42.360> tries<00:05:42.900> you're<00:05:43.170> gonna

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
it yes at first a few tries you're gonna

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.860 
it yes at first a few tries you're gonna
be<00:05:43.530> frustrated<00:05:44.010> and<00:05:44.070> pop<00:05:44.640> it<00:05:44.850> off<00:05:44.970> but<00:05:45.180> once

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
be frustrated and pop it off but once

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.780 
be frustrated and pop it off but once
you<00:05:45.930> get<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.110> hang<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.530> just<00:05:47.340> like<00:05:47.460> as<00:05:47.640> I've

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
you get the hang of it just like as I've

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.410 
you get the hang of it just like as I've
shown<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.600> tree<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.140> very<00:05:49.440> cool<00:05:50.270> figure<00:05:51.270> to

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
shown the tree a very cool figure to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.800 
shown the tree a very cool figure to
transform<00:05:51.960> into<00:05:52.140> alt<00:05:52.380> mode<00:05:52.590> in<00:05:52.740> robot<00:05:53.040> mode<00:05:53.810> so

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
transform into alt mode in robot mode so

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.250 
transform into alt mode in robot mode so
with<00:05:55.050> that<00:05:55.580> leave<00:05:56.580> it<00:05:56.760> here<00:05:57.060> leaning<00:05:57.930> on<00:05:58.080> the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
with that leave it here leaning on the

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.240 
with that leave it here leaning on the
side<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.710> its<00:05:58.830> my<00:05:58.980> flap<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:01.050> have<00:06:01.290> the<00:06:01.830> human

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
side of its my flap you have the human

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.370 
side of its my flap you have the human
alliance<00:06:02.660> chromia<00:06:04.070> stay<00:06:05.070> tuned<00:06:05.400> for<00:06:06.240> the

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
alliance chromia stay tuned for the

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.600 
alliance chromia stay tuned for the
hopefully<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.440> third<00:06:07.800> and<00:06:08.010> final<00:06:08.280> part<00:06:08.430> of

hopefully the third and final part of
this<00:06:08.700> review<00:06:08.880> where<00:06:09.300> we<00:06:09.510> will<00:06:09.750> review<00:06:10.080> the

this review where we will review the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.070 
this review where we will review the
transformation<00:06:11.580> of<00:06:11.700> mudflap<00:06:12.180> thanks<00:06:12.960> for

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080
