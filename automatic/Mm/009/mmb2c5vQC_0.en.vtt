00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
of this car that Barack Obama is now

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.600 
of this car that Barack Obama is now
getting<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.259> behind<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> wall<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.280> federal

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
getting in behind the wall in federal

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.999 
getting in behind the wall in federal
money<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.810> Bush<00:01:40.079> responsible<00:01:40.860> for

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
money is it was Bush responsible for

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859 
money is it was Bush responsible for
some<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:42.030> he's<00:01:42.360> not<00:01:42.540> responding

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
some of that I know he's not responding

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.960 
some of that I know he's not responding
so<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> 2.3<00:01:44.009> under<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> Obama

administration correct all right and and

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.880 
administration correct all right and and
the<00:01:47.520> idea<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.960> addition<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.619> the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
we're still today recall cars that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.610 
we're still today recall cars that
haven't<00:03:48.480> been<00:03:48.540> sold<00:03:48.870> that's<00:03:49.200> right<00:03:49.440> because

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
haven't been sold that's right because

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.650 
haven't been sold that's right because
they<00:03:49.890> said<00:03:50.130> they<00:03:50.400> catch<00:03:50.820> fire<00:03:51.150> they<00:03:51.180> catch

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
they said they catch fire they catch

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.540 
they said they catch fire they catch
fire<00:03:51.900> and<00:03:52.170> they<00:03:52.350> want<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.620> find<00:03:52.950> them<00:03:53.160> before

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
fire and they want to find them before

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.240 
fire and they want to find them before
they<00:03:53.670> do<00:03:53.730> right<00:03:54.360> which<00:03:55.110> would<00:03:55.380> contribute<00:03:55.920> I

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
they do right which would contribute I

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.550 
they do right which would contribute I
think<00:03:56.550> to<00:03:56.640> global<00:03:57.030> warming<00:03:57.450> because<00:03:57.900> fire<00:03:58.320> is

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
think to global warming because fire is

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.530 
think to global warming because fire is
hot<00:03:58.770> that's<00:03:58.980> right<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.459> so<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.390> whole<00:04:00.510> thing

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
hot that's right and so the whole thing

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.040 
hot that's right and so the whole thing
the<00:04:01.410> vote<00:04:01.880> well<00:04:02.880> it's<00:04:03.420> unfortunate<00:04:03.600> because

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
the vote well it's unfortunate because

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.900 
the vote well it's unfortunate because
the<00:04:04.230> fault<00:04:04.560> itself<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.160> an<00:04:05.280> electric<00:04:05.610> car<00:04:05.640> may

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the fault itself is an electric car may

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.449 
the fault itself is an electric car may
end<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.330> fossil<00:04:06.780> fuel<00:04:06.930> itself<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.560> and

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
end up a fossil fuel itself and and

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.050 
end up a fossil fuel itself and and
that's<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.390> maybe<00:04:09.690> they<00:04:09.870> catch<00:04:10.080> fire

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
that's that maybe they catch fire

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.800 
that's that maybe they catch fire
three<00:04:12.060> billion<00:04:12.330> dollars<00:04:14.239> they<00:04:15.239> build<00:04:15.510> them

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
three billion dollars they build them

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.640 
three billion dollars they build them
well<00:04:16.620> here's<00:04:17.310> a<00:04:17.430> fire<00:04:18.419> just<00:04:18.900> three<00:04:19.169> billion

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
well here's a fire just three billion

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.870 
well here's a fire just three billion
and<00:04:19.859> of<00:04:20.040> course<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.400> will<00:04:20.489> be<00:04:20.520> amortized

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and of course that will be amortized

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.520 
and of course that will be amortized
over<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.450> millions<00:04:21.960> I'm<00:04:22.109> sure<00:04:22.260> they're<00:04:22.440> going

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
over the millions I'm sure they're going

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.030 
over the millions I'm sure they're going
