dad some depth I used to dab some and on

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.560

a<00:03:04.090> different<00:03:04.540> area<00:03:05.020> like<00:03:05.590> cheeks<00:03:06.370> nose<00:03:06.880> chain

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
a different area like cheeks nose chain

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.990 
a different area like cheeks nose chain
or<00:03:07.900> forehead<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:08.830> just<00:03:09.460> plan<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.790> out

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
or forehead and then just plan it out

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.880 
or forehead and then just plan it out
but<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.630> don't<00:03:11.020> think<00:03:11.170> that's

that's not suitable I think for this
emotion<00:03:23.400> because<00:03:23.600> it's<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:24.959> really

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319
