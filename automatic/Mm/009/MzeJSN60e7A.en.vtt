00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it starts off by saying that because he

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.380 
it starts off by saying that because he
needs<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:33.030> personal<00:00:33.510> he<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.620> personal<00:00:35.010> is

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
needs a personal he see the personal is

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.940 
needs a personal he see the personal is
administrate<00:00:36.390> those<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.960> he's<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.680> guy

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
administrate those because he's a guy

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.000 
administrate those because he's a guy
and<00:00:38.450> should<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.809> guess<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.530> would

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and should get one I guess that it would

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
and should get one I guess that it would
take<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.640> several<00:00:45.329> however<00:00:46.230> long<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.860> prepare

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
take so several however long to prepare

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.189 
take so several however long to prepare
and<00:00:48.260> thus<00:00:49.260> needs<00:00:49.860> regular<00:00:50.760> cheaply<00:00:51.570> asked<00:00:52.079> for

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
and thus needs regular cheaply asked for

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.290 
and thus needs regular cheaply asked for
regular<00:00:52.530> training<00:00:52.949> from<00:00:53.070> hokey<00:00:53.430> who<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> his

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
regular training from hokey who is his

viously feels that this is kind of

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.910 
viously feels that this is kind of
unnecessary<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.479> what's<00:01:28.110> along<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> basics

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
unnecessary and what's along the basics

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
unnecessary and what's along the basics
of<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.670> piloting<00:01:30.240> because<00:01:30.509> he<00:01:30.720> somehow<00:01:30.930> does

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
of is piloting because he somehow does

not know anything about it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.240 
not know anything about it
to<00:01:33.750> make<00:01:33.930> sense<00:01:34.170> okay<00:01:34.530> um<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:36.660> as<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.890> began

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
to make sense okay um so as this began

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
to make sense okay um so as this began
talking<00:01:38.580> about<00:01:38.760> actual<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.780> piloting<00:01:40.320> and

uh<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.690> was<00:01:48.980> what<00:01:49.980> I<00:01:50.010> was<00:01:50.100> looking<00:01:50.220> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
uh this was what I was looking for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.940 
uh this was what I was looking for
obviously<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.630> i<00:01:51.870> thought<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
obviously because i thought the the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.950 
obviously because i thought the the
beginning<00:01:53.580> was<00:01:53.730> pretty<00:01:54.000> cool<00:01:54.330> and<00:01:55.550> this<00:01:56.550> this

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
beginning was pretty cool and this this

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.120 
beginning was pretty cool and this this
hopefully<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.080> be<00:01:58.200> too<00:01:58.410> and<00:01:58.650> i<00:01:58.860> guess<00:01:59.010> it

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
hopefully would be too and i guess it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.000 
hopefully would be too and i guess it
was<00:01:59.310> uh<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:03.020> from<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.260> seems<00:02:04.470> like<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
was uh so from what it seems like I

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.210 
was uh so from what it seems like I
sound<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:05.910> a<00:02:06.210> beginning<00:02:06.840> state<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.979> where

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
sound like a beginning state that where

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.210 
sound like a beginning state that where
the<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.670> has<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:09.500> really<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:11.420> guess

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
the is has not really I guess

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.430 
the is has not really I guess
synchronized<00:02:14.220> with<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.460> user<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.300> well<00:02:16.140> as<00:02:16.320> it

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
synchronized with the user as well as it

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.120 
synchronized with the user as well as it
could<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:18.320> well<00:02:19.320> he<00:02:19.350> starts<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> battle

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
could have and well he starts a battle

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.460 
could have and well he starts a battle
obviously<00:02:20.550> with<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> brand-new<00:02:21.390> brand-new<00:02:22.260> is

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
obviously with a brand-new brand-new is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.880 
obviously with a brand-new brand-new is
it<00:02:22.800> hasn't<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.630> shifted<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.720> him<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.110> so

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
it hasn't really shifted to him and so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.260 
it hasn't really shifted to him and so
he<00:02:25.920> fights<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.730> beginning<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.150> battle

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
he fights the beginning of the battle

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.030 
he fights the beginning of the battle
like<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.959> he<00:02:28.020> can't<00:02:28.320> really<00:02:28.590> maneuver

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
like that and he can't really maneuver

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.310 
like that and he can't really maneuver
he<00:02:29.220> can't<00:02:29.520> move<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.150> so<00:02:30.900> he's<00:02:31.020> getting<00:02:31.230> his

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
he can't move and so he's getting his

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.880 
he can't move and so he's getting his
butt<00:02:31.470> kicked<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.240> then<00:02:33.240> right<00:02:33.720> as<00:02:33.990> Cecilia's

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
butt kicked and then right as Cecilia's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.170 
butt kicked and then right as Cecilia's
about<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.250> hit<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.490> final<00:02:35.790> blow<00:02:35.880> with<00:02:36.150> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
about to hit the final blow with the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.560 
about to hit the final blow with the
missiles<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.900> whatnot<00:02:37.200> uh<00:02:38.060> he<00:02:39.060> goes<00:02:39.239> through

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
missiles and whatnot uh he goes through

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.990 
missiles and whatnot uh he goes through
I<00:02:39.840> think<00:02:40.140> what's<00:02:40.260> called<00:02:40.500> first<00:02:41.130> shift<00:02:41.700> or

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I think what's called first shift or

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.810 
I think what's called first shift or
first<00:02:42.360> for<00:02:42.600> whatever<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:44.870> means<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
first for whatever and it means that the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.729 
first for whatever and it means that the
the<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.030> has<00:02:48.540> now<00:02:48.860> synchronized<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.250> him

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
the is has now synchronized to him

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.710 
the is has now synchronized to him
meaning<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.790> no<00:02:53.790> matter<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.209> meaning<00:02:54.540> that

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
meaning that no matter the meaning that

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.509 
meaning that no matter the meaning that
no<00:02:55.230> more<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:56.209> she<00:02:57.209> was<00:02:57.390> fighting<00:02:57.810> her<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.260> a

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
no more like she was fighting her to a

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.210 
no more like she was fighting her to a
relatively<00:02:59.519> good<00:02:59.700> battle<00:03:00.620> without<00:03:01.620> even

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
relatively good battle without even

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.470 
relatively good battle without even
having<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.550> synchronized<00:03:02.970> ianus<00:03:03.330> which

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
having a synchronized ianus which

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.710 
having a synchronized ianus which
apparently<00:03:03.690> means<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.260> whole<00:03:04.410> lot<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:06.030> that

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
apparently means a whole lot so that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.140 
apparently means a whole lot so that
that<00:03:07.650> was<00:03:07.769> pretty<00:03:07.950> cool<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.400> mean<00:03:08.670> I<00:03:08.820> saw<00:03:09.030> it

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
that was pretty cool I mean I saw it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.690 
that was pretty cool I mean I saw it
coming<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.019> pretty<00:03:10.140> cool

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
coming but that was pretty cool

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.479 
coming but that was pretty cool
and<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.959> now<00:03:12.470> you've<00:03:12.739> got<00:03:12.950> his<00:03:13.069> own<00:03:13.160> like

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489

and so now you've got his own like
personalized<00:03:14.000> weapons<00:03:14.390> which<00:03:14.599> happens<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.870> be

how would he know he's completely new
that<00:04:08.750> using<00:04:09.230> masks<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.069> he<00:04:10.910> loses<00:04:11.299> but

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
that using masks so he loses but

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.660 
that using masks so he loses but
everyone<00:04:12.650> knows<00:04:12.739> he<00:04:12.890> should<00:04:13.040> have<00:04:13.130> won<00:04:13.310> but

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
oh let's see um once again really the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.460 
oh let's see um once again really the
the<00:04:39.530> defining<00:04:40.280> really<00:04:41.210> stood<00:04:41.419> out<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:42.260> like

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
the defining really stood out I I like

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.810 
the defining really stood out I I like
the<00:04:42.560> fighting<00:04:42.889> everything<00:04:43.190> else<00:04:43.490> seems

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
the fighting everything else seems

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.180 
the fighting everything else seems
rather<00:04:44.060> ordinary

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
rather ordinary

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.040
