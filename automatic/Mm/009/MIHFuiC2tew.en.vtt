today my dad and I took my home depot
f15<00:00:04.900> out<00:00:05.140> for<00:00:05.440> its<00:00:05.560> first<00:00:05.830> light<00:00:06.190> it<00:00:06.940> weighs

long<00:00:14.790> here<00:00:15.790> you<00:00:15.940> see<00:00:16.179> me<00:00:16.390> setting<00:00:16.749> up<00:00:16.900> for<00:00:17.169> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
long here you see me setting up for the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.859 
long here you see me setting up for the
very<00:00:17.710> first<00:00:17.980> takeoff<00:00:18.489> I<00:00:18.849> didn't<00:00:19.569> know<00:00:19.630> what<00:00:19.839> to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
very first takeoff I didn't know what to

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.880 
very first takeoff I didn't know what to
expect<00:00:20.159> but<00:00:21.159> I<00:00:21.220> had<00:00:21.460> built<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.819> couple<00:00:22.149> homies

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
expect but I had built a couple homies

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.620 
expect but I had built a couple homies
similar<00:00:23.890> in<00:00:24.009> plan<00:00:24.249> form<00:00:24.579> to<00:00:24.759> this<00:00:24.939> that<00:00:25.539> were

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
similar in plan form to this that were

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.069 
similar in plan form to this that were
much<00:00:25.839> smaller<00:00:26.579> turned<00:00:27.579> out<00:00:27.819> it<00:00:28.079> handled

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
much smaller turned out it handled

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.090 
much smaller turned out it handled
almost<00:00:29.439> identically<00:00:30.220> to<00:00:30.249> the<00:00:30.999> smaller

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:32.100 
almost identically to the smaller

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.340 
almost identically to the smaller
foamies<00:00:33.100> except<00:00:33.609> the<00:00:34.059> vertical<00:00:34.809> performance

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
foamies except the vertical performance

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.779 
foamies except the vertical performance
is<00:00:37.289> out<00:00:38.289> of<00:00:38.350> this<00:00:38.620> world<00:00:38.679> with<00:00:39.190> this<00:00:39.339> aircraft

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
is out of this world with this aircraft

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.240 
is out of this world with this aircraft
it<00:00:40.239> will<00:00:40.359> accelerate<00:00:40.690> vertically<00:00:41.620> while

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
it will accelerate vertically while

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.000 
it will accelerate vertically while
doing<00:00:42.489> rolls<00:00:42.910> well<00:00:43.809> here<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.379> just<00:00:44.679> see<00:00:44.829> me

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
doing rolls well here you just see me

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.989 
doing rolls well here you just see me
flying<00:00:45.670> around<00:00:45.999> getting<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.449> sense<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.809> trim

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:47.999 
flying around getting a sense of trim

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.660 
flying around getting a sense of trim
doing<00:00:48.999> a<00:00:49.149> first<00:00:50.129> fly<00:00:51.129> by<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.920> then<00:00:54.100> pulling<00:00:54.429> up

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
doing a first fly by and then pulling up

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.729 
doing a first fly by and then pulling up
just<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.030> see<00:00:55.210> how<00:00:55.300> much<00:00:55.480> power<00:00:55.719> i<00:00:55.870> actually

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
just to see how much power i actually

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.220 
just to see how much power i actually
had<00:00:56.949> because<00:00:57.339> i<00:00:57.489> was<00:00:57.609> flying<00:00:57.899> mostly<00:00:58.899> at<00:00:58.989> about

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
had because i was flying mostly at about

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.250 
had because i was flying mostly at about
a<00:00:59.260> third<00:00:59.589> to<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.859> half<00:00:59.920> throttle<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:02.079> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
a third to a half throttle this is the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.320 
a third to a half throttle this is the
first<00:01:02.739> loop<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.489> of<00:01:03.640> course<00:01:03.850> i<00:01:03.969> throw<00:01:04.150> out<00:01:04.210> the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
first loop and of course i throw out the

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.109 
first loop and of course i throw out the
back<00:01:04.540> at<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> top<00:01:05.310> again<00:01:06.310> trying<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:06.939> be

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
back at the top again trying to be

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.420 
back at the top again trying to be
fairly<00:01:07.360> easy<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.930> stresses<00:01:08.439> until<00:01:08.829> I<00:01:08.860> give<00:01:09.399> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
fairly easy on stresses until I give the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.910 
fairly easy on stresses until I give the
airplane<00:01:09.970> a<00:01:10.000> good<00:01:10.210> inspection<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.740> high

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
airplane a good inspection this is high

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.999 
airplane a good inspection this is high
alpha<00:01:12.189> flight<00:01:12.549> I<00:01:13.170> wanted<00:01:14.170> to<00:01:14.290> check<00:01:14.500> out<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
alpha flight I wanted to check out the

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.100 
alpha flight I wanted to check out the
slow<00:01:15.310> speed<00:01:15.369> envelope<00:01:16.119> and<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.570> was<00:01:16.780> exactly

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
slow speed envelope and it was exactly

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.359 
slow speed envelope and it was exactly
like<00:01:17.880> group<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.149> little<00:01:19.450> ones<00:01:19.659> it<00:01:20.320> just<00:01:20.799> sits

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
like group the little ones it just sits

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
like group the little ones it just sits
there<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.689> we'll<00:01:22.689> just<00:01:22.899> get<00:01:23.049> into<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.460> vertical

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
there and we'll just get into a vertical

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.429 
there and we'll just get into a vertical
descent<00:01:26.250> level<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.909> little<00:01:28.630> wing<00:01:28.840> rock<00:01:29.140> but

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
descent level and a little wing rock but

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.550 
descent level and a little wing rock but
that's<00:01:29.619> about<00:01:29.799> it<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:31.810> come<00:01:32.110> in<00:01:32.320> for<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
that's about it here I come in for the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's about it here I come in for the
first<00:01:32.740> landing<00:01:33.219> you'll<00:01:33.310> see<00:01:33.520> this<00:01:33.700> thing

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
first landing you'll see this thing

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.660 
first landing you'll see this thing
really<00:01:34.119> just<00:01:34.450> slows<00:01:34.750> down<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.469> you<00:01:35.740> can<00:01:36.490> just

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
really just slows down and you can just

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.550 
really just slows down and you can just
land<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.090> on<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.210> dime<00:01:37.509> it<00:01:38.460> probably<00:01:40.560> floated

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
land it on a dime it probably floated

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.279 
land it on a dime it probably floated
only<00:01:42.130> about<00:01:42.460> two<00:01:42.729> or<00:01:42.880> three<00:01:43.240> feet<00:01:43.600> across<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
only about two or three feet across the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.130 
only about two or three feet across the
grass<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:45.549> were<00:01:45.640> flying<00:01:45.969> with<00:01:46.270> about<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.600> 10<00:01:47.109> to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
grass we were flying with about a 10 to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.590 
grass we were flying with about a 10 to
12<00:01:47.530> not<00:01:47.740> when<00:01:48.100> today<00:01:48.399> it<00:01:48.789> was<00:01:48.969> shitty<00:01:49.359> and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
12 not when today it was shitty and

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.069 
12 not when today it was shitty and
breezy<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:51.100> was<00:01:51.219> a<00:01:51.280> little<00:01:51.369> bumpy<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.869> is

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
breezy so it was a little bumpy this is

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.560 
breezy so it was a little bumpy this is
the<00:01:53.229> second<00:01:53.590> take<00:01:53.770> off<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.280> had<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> little<00:01:54.729> had

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
the second take off I had a little had

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.419 
the second take off I had a little had
it<00:01:55.689> trimmed<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.259> knew<00:01:56.409> what<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.710> expect<00:01:56.829> so<00:01:57.399> I

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
it trimmed and knew what to expect so I

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.849 
it trimmed and knew what to expect so I
just<00:01:58.030> did<00:01:58.240> a<00:01:58.270> nice<00:01:58.509> takeoff<00:01:58.929> accelerated<00:01:59.710> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
just did a nice takeoff accelerated and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.319 
just did a nice takeoff accelerated and
pulled<00:02:00.100> straight<00:02:00.369> up<00:02:00.549> and<00:02:00.789> did<00:02:00.909> some<00:02:01.090> rolls

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
pulled straight up and did some rolls

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.340 
pulled straight up and did some rolls
and<00:02:03.090> again<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.270> will<00:02:04.359> just<00:02:04.600> roll<00:02:04.780> out<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:05.140> sight

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
and again it will just roll out of sight

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.310 
and again it will just roll out of sight
I<00:02:05.619> have<00:02:06.250> about<00:02:06.700> five<00:02:07.030> pounds<00:02:07.299> of<00:02:07.570> static

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
I have about five pounds of static

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.480 
I have about five pounds of static
thrust<00:02:08.560> up<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.950> 10<00:02:09.160> 7<00:02:09.520> prop

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
thrust up to 10 7 prop

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.970 
thrust up to 10 7 prop
and<00:02:11.860> again<00:02:12.860> being<00:02:13.160> under<00:02:13.550> 4<00:02:13.820> pounds<00:02:14.710> 3<00:02:15.710> pounds

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
12 ounces is just as more than enough

going<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.440> do<00:02:24.650> much<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.190> way<00:02:25.220> of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
going to have to do much in the way of

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.170 
going to have to do much in the way of

work<00:02:29.570> I<00:02:29.810> did<00:02:30.320> embed<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> rudder<00:02:31.550> back<00:02:32.270> in<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
work I did embed a rudder back in the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.220 
work I did embed a rudder back in the
fuselage<00:02:33.350> box<00:02:33.740> so<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.300> semi<00:02:35.750> rudder<00:02:36.140> a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
fuselage box so it's a semi rudder a

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.010 
fuselage box so it's a semi rudder a
thrust<00:02:36.710> vectoring<00:02:37.130> rudder<00:02:37.490> and<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.780> great

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
thrust vectoring rudder and the great

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.930 
thrust vectoring rudder and the great
thing<00:02:39.050> about<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.650> is<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.100> didn't<00:02:40.430> induce<00:02:40.730> any

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
thing about it is it didn't induce any

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.570 
thing about it is it didn't induce any
role<00:02:41.300> like<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.560> rudders<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.040> have<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> money

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
role like the rudders I have a money

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.090 
role like the rudders I have a money

airplane<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:48.040> did<00:02:49.040> do<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> slow<00:02:49.670> roll<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.180> we

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
airplane I did do a slow roll but we

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.650 
airplane I did do a slow roll but we
didn't<00:02:50.570> get<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.690> on<00:02:51.020> tape<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:52.210> the<00:02:53.210> thrust

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
didn't get that on tape and the thrust

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.810 
didn't get that on tape and the thrust
vectoring<00:02:54.050> rudder<00:02:54.320> attends<00:02:55.160> de<00:02:55.400> behave<00:02:55.790> just

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
vectoring rudder attends de behave just

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.340 
vectoring rudder attends de behave just
like<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.360> regular<00:02:56.960> rudder<00:02:57.380> would<00:02:57.650> be<00:03:02.230> here<00:03:03.230> you

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
like a regular rudder would be here you

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.440 
like a regular rudder would be here you
see<00:03:03.560> me<00:03:03.680> doing<00:03:03.830> several<00:03:04.430> roles<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.030> just<00:03:05.270> saw

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
see me doing several roles you just saw

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.230 
see me doing several roles you just saw
me<00:03:05.480> do<00:03:05.750> a<00:03:05.800> couple<00:03:06.800> hard<00:03:07.010> pools<00:03:07.340> at<00:03:07.760> various

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
me do a couple hard pools at various

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.540 
me do a couple hard pools at various
angles<00:03:08.720> attack<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.710> attitudes<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.340> just

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
angles attack and attitudes I just

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.150 
angles attack and attitudes I just
wanted<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.850> make<00:03:10.940> sure<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.300> was<00:03:11.560> gentle<00:03:12.560> this

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
wanted to make sure it was gentle this

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.620 
wanted to make sure it was gentle this
is<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.370> final<00:03:13.730> landing<00:03:14.410> thanks<00:03:15.410> for<00:03:15.590> watching
