00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.620
 as always today is Friday is south in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.570
 intended week 32 recommendations the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.490
 Feeling available styles this 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.809
 occasion can not be left behind 5 the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 tomorrow for let's say that third the mind 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 is that nobody is a little disguised that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 I take two weeks without being able to do it but 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.550
 this is always the next week 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.109
 to be able to violate what they see 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 here is south will be here just 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 below in the room is to be here in 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.820
 the hangar 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 by the way if you do not see the boyfriend I went up 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.019
 here is one as I would call it a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.700
 rockola a musical box or like dj I do not know 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.960
 here you can give play will sound music 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 this room what to do because it 's for 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.620
 music overshadowed my voice and the game but it's 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.660
 a new story that they put the last 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 patch and then if you have not done it yet 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.780
 let's tell him I'm telling him to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.059
 that so they did not know 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.620
 so as berankis south this occasion 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.059
 let's say you have a good variety of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.410
 weapons follow also these leads to 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.270
 some of these took time that no 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.739
 I would be thinking a lot because it went down 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.960
 good with say with telemetry 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.510
 we have for cannon rifle cannon 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.489
 hand and shotgun to climb a little more 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.289
 fast these weapons for 30 minutes what 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 we have plasma hummingbird boosters and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.320
 empty to turn rare hummingbirds into 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.620
 legendary and wake cameras 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.050
 and the heavy syntheses of let's say that 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.150
 you feel and started a lot because 5 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.250
 a strange way in question let's say 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.560
 that at the 90-week studies we have 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.110
 of weapon the last word of the word 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.410
 this is an excellent shotgun so that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.660
 used the three exotics of the trucks of 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.460
 hand the three exotic brothers are 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.509
 they light in a crucible and let's say that 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.360
 is one of the favorites of many 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.619
 people is weapon is automatic this one 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.210
 I did excellent to shoot from the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.990
 hip rather your skills let's say 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.149
 they ask for your first skill 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.680
 both sections of Nazarene institution 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.550
 of the game 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.160
 let's say to put diosque 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.409
 just in case so that he does not touch the voice 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.560
 turn off the music 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.299
 I do not know if you heard a lot but good 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.520
 be following with surf here the last 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.590
 word has its ability that more than 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.689
 everything to run from the hip that gives 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.640
 special increased this the damage and the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.899
 stability and precision damage 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 when there is for the hip is a 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.250
 excellent weapon more than touching Christ not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.569
 I would use it in a missions but 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.390
 with the service ones if we live inside 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.799
 of the next one in the wolves house can 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.690
 see to recommend a good weapon for 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.819
 crucible and if you do not have it is a good 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.980
 option to buy them now then this one in 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.470
 armor we have started the titan on 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.510
 We went light hull and this is a 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.549
 good comes with very good stats come 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.370
 up to 125 which is good for helmets 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.760
 this soleÃ¡ is faster and attack 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.079
 body body plus this reduces the attack 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.819
 from body to body body recharging 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.340
 body when you collect orbs of light and 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.840
 just stepping on regions allows you this one 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.790
 have two skills put in the 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.989
 subclass of attacking titan only 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.609
 in that his class 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.700
 when you wear this helmet on, so 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.160
 basically in the assailant titan you're going to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
 have stability of your robot and management 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.549
 when you do not even activate them in your 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.630
 classes then you can have as well as 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.700
 I am me and you have 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.810
 active skills at the same time that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.490
 what is that helmet is very good 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 precision luck above all appear 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.360
 successful and if I recommend for the stands 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.770
 if they do not have not yet we have the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.960
 striped machines following that with the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.460
 hunter in this case because these boots do not 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.780
 they are the best because simply the 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.790
 skill is not that it's worth it over other 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 exotic but you can use them to vary 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.930
 about that more heavy ammunition and death 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.300
 faster when aiming with any of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 your weapons is something they could use that 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.900
 it can be effective for crucible but 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.550
 I would say that nothing by 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.170
 appearance because that's why its 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.270
 let alone skill that does not beat 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.190
 other exotic also has bullets these 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.320
 reaches up to 150 strength which is very 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.030
 good in boots and I recommend them if not 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.070
 they have them accelerating for yet if not 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.750
 they have achieved or if they need a 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.550
 exotic boots in hunter any 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.860
 reason this one is a good occasion 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.150
 to buy them and finally with a 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.420
 decision we have the clothes of 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.270
 empty that leads to empty these have 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.060
 this 105 44 of effort and it comes up 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.100
 155 is a good number of chest could 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.380
 have more than 160 but still is a good 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.240
 number in your skills let's say and you have 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.510
 more handgun ammunition be more 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.459
 ammunition for special weapons and final 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.280
 the action ball grenade that is the last 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.439
 grenade and 0 vacuum appears with a 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.420
 pursuer sphere to our sphere 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.890
 work more and also reappears every time 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 that you die with the ornate pomegranate 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.310
 so every time you die a 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.629
 split of crucible since they will appear already 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.670
 directly by telling you to use your 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.290
 granada again is very good this 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.229
 second skill above all for example 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.079
 on the solar site even if you do not have the 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.340
 bonus for the vacuum grenade if you have 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.990
 the solar sorcerer's ability to 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.460
 put two grenades on you with this 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.500
 chest every time you die reappears 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.090
 with the two recharged grenades is very 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.199
 good looking and unfortunately I recommend them 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.729
 if they do not have it apart they look 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.229
 excellent physically are from the 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.210
 best shawls with their ticos in all the 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.500
 game and finally we have here 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.840
 fragments their types and we have the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.449
 strange and in grass of the exotic country by 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.130
 23 models which if you prefer 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:44.930
 buy on grass from the chest this 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.660
 it is a good option also later 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 We have this assemblers to improve 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.530
 the helmet radars or I have for the hunter 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.840
 and it has 101 strength is not a 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.139
 good number we recommend 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.720
 improve them 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:58.220
 just unless they go from 115 in this 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.330
 Therefore, it is not a good option for 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.550
 state 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.129
 the helmet here or face simbionte for the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.810
 hunter 125 discipline this is a 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.759
 excellent helmet has flights stay in 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.500
 this time and it is more than you for 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.300
 the hunter gunman because it increases 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.060
 one more bullet to the super golden gun 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.860
 then we have the titan creates ludic sofa 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.289
 139 intellect 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.319
 is about the average could have 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:23.840
 more than 147 better but well this one let's say 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.879
 that is not so bad we have the weapon 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.919
 mentary percent 48 is a good number 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.689
 although you can have more and let's say that a 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.810
 good option still for the titan and 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:35.060
 finally the sorcerer has the heart 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.889
 of practical fire with 151 discipline 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.659
 to improve it is a good number and 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.940
 finally they are breakers break soles with 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.990
 105 intellect which then this one count 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.599
 to ascend the 100 gloves 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.099
 could be considered good and weapons 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.259
 for this week to improve them 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.719
 we have direct light your king and that this one 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:53.340
 red death everything is not pine plan it 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:56.520
 he has patience and young 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.960
 with him a lady guys this is surfing 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.070
 this week 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.870
 thank you very much for looking good because 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:04.639
 I liked a greeting to all not the 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.639
 next is next
