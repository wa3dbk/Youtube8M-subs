00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.330
 or the youtubers or greet metal mister 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.000
 today I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.009
 technology that is already active by 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.799
 defect for certain programs 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.200
 windows in this tutorial I will teach you to 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.779
 activate this technology for all 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.439
 programs of your pc if it is compatible 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.480
 with your processor and add certain 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.580
 exceptions if detected 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.560
 erratic operations with some 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.560
 application if you want you already know 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.560
 accompany 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.829
 and continue with the tutorial I want them 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.460
 explain a little something about the 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.040
 technology inside 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.010
 the acronym means data execution 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.580
 prevention as prevention of execution 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.520
 of data 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.619
 this technology will protect you from code 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
 malicious that takes advantage of certain 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.360
 vulnerabilities in some systems 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.790
 operational by skipping the limitations 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 when executing programs 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.220
 the operation of this technology to 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.710
 big traits is that it stores the code 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.930
 of the application in the data area of 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.180
 the memory instead of making it true 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.640
 execution with the benefit that the 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.850
 operating system is able to stop its 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 operation if it detects some code 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.210
 malicious 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.000
 start with the tutorial script as you 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 I have explained this technology before 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.950
 is active for certain applications and 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.200
 windows services with this tutorial 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.450
 we will learn to activate it for all 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.520
 other programs including windows 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.549
 for this we have to go to the panel 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.549
 control 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.740
 in the control panel we must go 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.870
 move to system 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.970
 once the system we must go to the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.030
 Advanced configuration section 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.670
 system 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.160
 this window will open and in the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.670
 section that with the performance we should 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.920
 give the little button configuration 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.590
 will open this other window and we should 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 give in the tab that puts prevention of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.200
 data execution 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.680
 it is here by default the first time and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.440
 in three and you'll find this little button 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.180
 here that sets off to activate only for those 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.500
 windows programs and services 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.720
 essential by default you will have it here 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.460
 before continuing what I want you 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.350
 explain is that you have to take into account 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.990
 if your processor is compatible with 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.120
 our technology and to know it in the 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.920
 this is what you will find here in the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.750
 section below you will find if it puts you 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.270
 The computer's processor is compatible 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.330
 with well based on hardware if you have 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.640
 this appears this then you can 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.040
 activate technology for the rest of 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.319
 problems 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.819
 to be able to do it you simply have 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.340
 to give in the box is this 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.830
 activate test for all programs and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.730
 services except those that select 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.580
 you give him here high followers you give in 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.710
 apply accept and in the next 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.600
 accept window 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.990
 will surely ask you to restart your 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.870
 pc 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.970
 when it has restarted it is possible that 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.980
 some application or program has been 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.050
 given in a conflict then you 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.840
 will appear some poster in which 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.370
 will notify that a certain application has a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.470
 problem 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.709
 keep in mind if application is the one 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.420
 gives you the program and now what we 're going to 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.940
 to do is knowing what application the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.970
 observer problem the problem to do 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.810
 an exception in technology for it 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.880
 we will go back to the control panel 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.880
 we will go to the system section 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.200
 we will go to advanced configuration of 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.870
 system 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.470
 to the performance section the little button 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.270
 configuration and we will give you in the tab 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.520
 the prevention of damage execution 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.530
 taking into account the application that we 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.009
 has given the problem the only thing that we are going to 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.039
 go is to the add section 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.710
 this window is going to open and in this 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.740
 section we are going to unfold the tree 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.720
 of navigation and we're going to select the 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.169
 program files folder for 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.430
 that we have our program 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.600
 I want savior in error 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.710
 in my case it's the oviedo bar and saw what 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.100
 only I 'm going is to look for the executable 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.740
 in this case there is what I would select 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.819
 you would speak 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:09.870
 it will automatically be added in this 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.420
 recipe and you should check the option of 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.520
 said program 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.680
 the only thing you have to do after 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.720
 I will apply 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.030
 to accept 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.220
 accept and restart 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.350
 immediately after you have restarted 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.409
 this application does not have to give 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.839
 minutes 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.860
 and so with all the applications that you 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:31.860
 give some 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:38.530
 good friends, I do not expect anything like 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.240
 I always liked this tutorial 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.340
 all those that you like a little bit 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.840
 more the issue of security with this 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.660
 technology you will be a little bit more 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.800
 sure that you do not run code 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.950
 malicious 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.170
 application 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.360
 I say goodbye to all of you until the 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.770
 next 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.190
 two 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.579
 yes 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.579
