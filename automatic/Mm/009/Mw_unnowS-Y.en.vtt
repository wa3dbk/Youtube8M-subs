00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:06.870
 Do you have anything from the party to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.550
 official launch of obama I noticed 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 have seen it you could not avoid it 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.300
 in the midst of all the glitz and glamor 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.099
 and the action and so of the new 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.350
 maybe you have one 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.270
 The headlines above see the rapper 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 lupe fiasco was during partie 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 on the occasion of the swearing-in of president 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.109
 obama has been off the stage after he 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.880
 Obama criticized the rapper Lupe 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.590
 fiasco is known to have no leaf 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 took the mouth was invited on the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 party on the occasion of the inauguration of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.649
 President Obama last Sunday 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.420
 to play and he decided one 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.620
 playing his songs is probably something 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 too much was for the guests 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 He sang the song for 30 minutes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 title of the song is words that I never 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.539
 said 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 in the first stanza of the song it says 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.739
 I believe that the whole war against 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.960
 the terror is simply a lie 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.059
 Get rid of all the ammo and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 later it says in song rush limbaugh 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 is a racist greenback is a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.670
 racist gaza was bombed and obama 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.530
 said nothing 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.149
 that's why I do not care for obama 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.860
 voted and not the next time 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.170
 I am part of the problem and that 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.939
 problem is that being nonviolent is that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 Management claimed that the fact 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.299
 that he was expelled from the stage was nothing 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 to do with his lyrics against obama 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.990
 but that he had the song 30 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
 played for minutes 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 but he had the main appearance in the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 event party on the occasion of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.280
 Appointment of President Obama therefore 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 I hardly believe that one from him 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 got stage because he's a bit too 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.220
 long therefore played I speak lupe 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.960
 fiasco today my respect for that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.939
 that he is so wild and one of the rapper 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 that 's the clearest way to say that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.130
 say 2011 is declared loop in one 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 interview obama is the biggest terrorist 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.310
 and with that he referred to the threat 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.110
 in the program of the president 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.420
 He described the president as someone 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.560
 but he is a great speaker 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.299
 killing small children 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.070
 for me there is a strong opponent 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.670
 of war a fighter for peace 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.240
 and for the freedom of speech, lupe fiasco you 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 you are my hero 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.680
 [Music] 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.919
