 ambrose who do not get anything to be alarmed whatever the season 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.599
 we start by putting a large amount of water 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:11.449
 not brilliant 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.259
 we will love each other at a rate of 10 grams of salt 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.249
 per liter of water 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.110

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.679
 I will pay zucchini in small dice I dream both ends 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.449

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.890
 I missed basil 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.230
 I'm going to stack the sheets on top of each other 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.370
 I roll 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.370
 and I will pay them in thin slices 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.320
 when the taste 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.400
 I did not laugh 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.160
 in a rare large container I pour 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.680
 mellouli 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.430

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
 I do not mix again 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.249

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.889
