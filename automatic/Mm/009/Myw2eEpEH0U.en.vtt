00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.940
 the game strength of the player so that 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.560
 I think that's very important 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.120
 step what we heard again and again 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
 therefore have this calculation method 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.570
 that was introduced two years ago 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.099
 to have 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.509
 not everyone liked it and I think so 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.350
 we are now at a very good 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.180
 Solve the weaknesses of suitable solutions 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.640
 fixed that so certain 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.430
 skills stop in recovery 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.349
 although they are actually received 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 were not important for the player so 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.590
 For example, just do not play games 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.239
 can still be awesome 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.559
 the one system could not do that 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.059
 you had to give, after all, had the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.710
 value retention high in the header 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.320
 so that he has a really high playing strength 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 that's the new one now 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.620
 system just makes you easy 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.469
 accordingly type of player fails 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 also good as a nice solution believe 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'll see you here right now 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.940
 if we have info screens on the game 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 are there still some new ones? 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.160
 things here for example what is that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.359
 right here we see new tabs in it 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.400
 So I think there is a lot 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.290
 So what are the people doing in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 forum on again desired 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.740
 now been added by the statistics 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 are all over the new ones 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.759
 Characteristics that's all one 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.500
 it fits better together 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.000
 to see such a mark value development now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.409
 can over the individual stages as has 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 the player develops there that he 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.979
 so read carefully what you are like 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.049
 wished and we also have the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.890
 area afterwards with 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.020
 Added family relationships 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 He is also very important that year 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 namely the fm the first time to the brothers 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.920
 and cousins ​​also recognize and that in the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
 game picks up at various points 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 and that would be such a nice one too 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.049
 games info of course, there is a münster 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.200
 corresponding a brother or a course 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.579
 in the game there 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.399
 Altogether I have noticed there 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.110
 Over 800 relationships in 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.380
 the one of the 40,000 we surveyed 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.360
 players are 800 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.920
 you can warn that somewhere in the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.229
 quite our times show what in the game 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 So right there I must again 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.700
 take a little further because that is 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.380
 one of our bonus features we have in 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.110
 this year the possibility that one 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 through performance so to speak in the game that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.860
 We can see beautiful 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.269
 can collect points and about this 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.959
 points you can then turn features 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.110
 unlock 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.910
 a total of 30 bonus features just now 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.650
 in the course of the game, so to speak free 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.580
 switched because cologne and one of them is 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.970
 a statistic that the whole 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.739
 Relationships to one 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.810
 list also lists then you can 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.349
 Just watch it in the league 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.750
 looks then there is just here 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.480
 possibility in this shop practically in 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.310
 to go then here most diverse 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.410
 In addition, then acquire things by 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:56.110
 you make the appropriate payments 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.989
 because there are all sorts of things can be found here 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.549
 next to the things about those coins 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.200
 still the possibility to run the 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.329
 certain play areas several 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.859
 has solved tasks, for example 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.780
 transfer area or about successes then 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.450
 there you the option again 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.130
 unlock more 4 features and there 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.160
 Believe I belong very exciting things 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.690
 Also, for example, that at 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.639
 a player can now easily watch 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.470
 how will it develop and how? 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.850
 then you go on it is like 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.620
 one assumes that he is the next 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.090
 years can make an impact 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.190
 from the injury for example 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.810
 Checking can and can set that 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.880
 then really see something over the years 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.579
 as well as the player will do 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.139
 I think that is a very nice and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.150
 central new feature what on as 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.600
 manager helps the right one 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.250
 to make decisions 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.630
 I can also do two things right now 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.270
 Show that I think very exciting 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.030
 the one is in the calendar of the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.800
 screen with the next appointment 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.240
 Here you can see what the next 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.590
 every day so everything is still pending 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.790
 that's why very important screen because the 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.080
 you should actually call if 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.010
 one now says okay actually would like 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.600
 I can not continue playing 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.890
 look on it and then you see 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360
 not exactly what's next here 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.910
 time still so everything will happen and 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.440
 I belong is already a strong one 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.360
 motivation one or the other 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.860
 Step then take it with you 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.890
 three parts once the next dates 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.400
 that means there is something in 2 45 20 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.010
 meet 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.150
 But then there are also the values 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.460
 there is then in when, for example 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.070
 that player somehow next one 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.570
 has anniversary or that one still 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.580
 any sponsors places freedom 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.050
 which one could only prove fast but 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 also unpleasant things for example 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.110
 how long you can not master anymore 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.340
 what you might have got there has become 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.340
 There are certainly some clubs as well 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 not as far as now 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.080
 It's just starting to happen soon 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.080
 you also appear there 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.080
 at the fc bavaria it is about stands therefore 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.910
 nothing more why not worry us though 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.430
 right now that would be here for example 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.840
 stand really clear as a coop with it 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.960
 This is also motivated accordingly 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.090
 of course to solve yes and there are 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.740
 quite a bit of it so we have one 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.030
 huge list of potential point believes 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.810
 many surprises even a few 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.580
 crazy things yes there I believe in 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.410
 motivation to continue and I believe 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.030
 also very interesting is that with the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.860
 new level of experience because you're on here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.510
 a look sees which player must 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.680
 I use it next 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.480
 it has been promoted so far 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.100
 not that great that that 's exactly what 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.270
 everything has been seen here it is again 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.160
 summarized then one can to 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.600
 for example see because of the low Meier 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.910
 it takes a few bets and then 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.310
 Of course he will manage the next level 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.169
 concrete concrete motivation because that 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.610
 is just in game strength point easy 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.129
 I have another question here 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.120
 What was especially interviews before after 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.389
 changed the game 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.919
 Say more questions ask others 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:48.090
 as it looks as ask from a few new 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.129
 but we do not have that now 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.930
 system in the completely converted to 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.310
 this place is still one 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.819
 evaluation screen at the end of one 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.349
 interview 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:02.639
 which is I believe that you not done 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:05.610
 can you stop if you are if you are now 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.839
 just all these text features one 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.979
 takes what he did that we did 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.930
 had so far before the game 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.919
 Speeches that we have now exactly and 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.749
 have that again at half-time 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.180
 aggravates that means if you before the 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:18.650
 play victory sure and must for example 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.650
 for break still 0 0 stands
