punctuation<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.309> easy<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
punctuation I think it's just easy to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.779 
punctuation I think it's just easy to
realize<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.840> punctuation<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.100> haiku<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
realize that punctuation in a haiku is
really<00:00:54.180> left<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> poet<00:00:55.699> just

really left up to you the poet just

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.760 
really left up to you the poet just
remember<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.360> complete<00:00:57.809> thoughts<00:00:58.109> should

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
remember that complete thoughts should

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.170 
remember that complete thoughts should
end<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> period<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.219> say<00:01:02.460> why

now what if my next line I wrote feeling

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.320 
now what if my next line I wrote feeling
safe<00:01:50.860> from<00:01:51.610> all<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.030> predators<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:55.180> you

there only seven you are right that was

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.320 
there only seven you are right that was
more<00:02:05.500> than<00:02:05.650> seven<00:02:06.070> syllables<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.820> let's<00:02:07.060> try

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
more than seven syllables so let's try

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.120

our final line that must have five

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.580 
our final line that must have five
syllables<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.770> thought<00:02:15.670> you're<00:02:15.940> right<00:02:16.590> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
lines together we would end up with a

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.920 
lines together we would end up with a
haiku<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.400> reads<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:26.709> my<00:02:26.890> brown<00:02:27.250> shell
