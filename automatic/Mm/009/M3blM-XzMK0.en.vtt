reason I what what this here is because
the<00:01:26.820> other<00:01:27.060> heater<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:28.140> been<00:01:28.439> really<00:01:29.250> really

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the other heater has been really really

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
the other heater has been really really
successful<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:31.200> me<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.530> notice<00:01:31.859> any

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
change in temperature while running this

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.539 
change in temperature while running this
here<00:01:36.539> when<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.840> set<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.140> at<00:01:37.259> 78<00:01:37.619> degrees<00:01:38.039> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
here when I set it at 78 degrees it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.539 
here when I set it at 78 degrees it
stays<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.240> 78<00:01:39.750> degrees<00:01:40.140> now<00:01:40.649> I'm<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:41.070> running

stays at 78 degrees now I'm not running
a<00:01:42.500> high<00:01:43.500> end<00:01:44.270> temperature<00:01:45.270> probe<00:01:45.539> connected

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
a high end temperature probe connected

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.719 
a high end temperature probe connected
to<00:01:46.229> like<00:01:46.380> an<00:01:46.500> apex<00:01:46.859> so<00:01:47.039> I<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.549> monitor

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to like an apex so I can really monitor

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.849 
to like an apex so I can really monitor
within<00:01:48.570> half<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> degree<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.500> know

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
within half a degree and really know

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.370 
within half a degree and really know
what<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.039> doing<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.789> my<00:01:51.509> thermostat<00:01:52.049> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
what it's doing but my thermostat it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130 
what it's doing but my thermostat it
just<00:01:52.859> stays<00:01:53.070> dead<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.549> 78<00:01:54.149> degrees<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
just stays dead on 78 degrees all the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.580 
just stays dead on 78 degrees all the
time<00:01:55.350> no<00:01:56.130> worries<00:01:56.429> but<00:01:57.049> like<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.170> said<00:01:58.409> I'm

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
time no worries but like I said I'm

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.510 
time no worries but like I said I'm
getting<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.630> little<00:02:00.630> big<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.140> one<00:02:01.590> heater<00:02:01.859> so<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
getting a little big for one heater so I

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.580 
getting a little big for one heater so I
went<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:02.969> another<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> ideally<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
went with another one and ideally I

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.919 
went with another one and ideally I
would<00:02:04.920> prefer<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.429> two<00:02:06.210> small<00:02:06.539> heaters

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
would prefer to have two small heaters

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.469 
would prefer to have two small heaters
on<00:02:07.289> any<00:02:07.649> system<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.220> together<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.119> that's

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
on any system I put together and that's

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.729 
on any system I put together and that's
just<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.619> redundancy<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.909> way<00:02:12.659> if<00:02:12.989> one

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
just for redundancy that way if one

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.710 
just for redundancy that way if one
heater<00:02:14.010> goes<00:02:14.280> out

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
heater goes out

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.580 
heater goes out
and<00:02:16.130> stops<00:02:17.130> working<00:02:17.400> I'm<00:02:18.330> still<00:02:18.720> able<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.350> heat

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
and stops working I'm still able to heat

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.420 
and stops working I'm still able to heat
my<00:02:19.740> tank<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.270> if<00:02:21.270> one<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> heater<00:02:22.440> fails

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
my tank and if one of the heater fails

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.570 
my tank and if one of the heater fails
in<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.000> on<00:02:24.180> position<00:02:24.230> I'm<00:02:25.230> much<00:02:25.980> less<00:02:26.010> likely

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
in the on position I'm much less likely

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.120 
in the on position I'm much less likely
to<00:02:26.940> fry<00:02:27.600> everything<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.200> my<00:02:28.260> tank<00:02:28.440> there's

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
to fry everything in my tank there's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.100 
to fry everything in my tank there's
still<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.580> possibility<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.930> less

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
still that possibility but it's less

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.740 
still that possibility but it's less
likely<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:32.460> when<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.670> look<00:02:32.820> for<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> heater<00:02:33.210> the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
likely so when I look for a heater the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.490 
likely so when I look for a heater the
criteria<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.640> want<00:02:36.260> titanium<00:02:37.260> or<00:02:37.440> I

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
criteria I want is I want titanium or I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.790 
criteria I want is I want titanium or I
want<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> composite<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:39.050> want<00:02:40.050> something<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
want to composite I want something that

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.880 
want to composite I want something that
isn't<00:02:41.010> gonna<00:02:41.310> break<00:02:41.580> personally<00:02:42.680> I'm<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.710> bit

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
isn't gonna break personally I'm a bit

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.600 
isn't gonna break personally I'm a bit
of<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.040> klutz

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
of a klutz

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.490 
of a klutz
I<00:02:44.640> move<00:02:45.270> rock<00:02:45.510> around<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:46.020> move<00:02:46.170> stuff<00:02:46.380> around

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
I move rock around I move stuff around

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.170 
I move rock around I move stuff around
and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.820> drop<00:02:48.120> stuff<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:49.160> well<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.580> dr.<00:02:50.970> break

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
and I drop stuff and well it's dr. break

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.290 
and I drop stuff and well it's dr. break
one<00:02:51.390> but<00:02:51.930> even<00:02:52.620> worse<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:53.280> I've<00:02:53.640> heard<00:02:53.910> too

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
one but even worse is I've heard too

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.260 
one but even worse is I've heard too
many<00:02:54.450> horror<00:02:54.750> stories<00:02:55.610> people<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.120> in

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
many horror stories people just have in

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.090 
many horror stories people just have in
their<00:02:57.390> glass<00:02:57.630> heaters<00:02:58.170> shatter<00:02:58.590> on<00:02:58.920> them

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
their glass heaters shatter on them

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.320 
their glass heaters shatter on them
they'll<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.770> away<00:03:01.770> at<00:03:01.950> work<00:03:02.130> or<00:03:02.430> wherever<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
they'll be away at work or wherever the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.150 
they'll be away at work or wherever the
heater<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:03.720> shatter<00:03:04.080> they'll<00:03:04.800> come<00:03:05.010> home

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
heater will shatter they'll come home

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.080 
heater will shatter they'll come home
and<00:03:05.220> everything's<00:03:05.760> dead<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:07.440> for<00:03:08.040> me<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.400> glass

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and everything's dead so for me a glass

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.970 
and everything's dead so for me a glass
heater<00:03:09.420> is<00:03:09.480> just<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.870> an<00:03:10.020> option<00:03:10.140> you'll

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
heater is just not an option you'll

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.520 
heater is just not an option you'll
notice<00:03:11.310> on<00:03:11.490> my<00:03:14.450> fish<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.570> only<00:03:15.810> system<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.470> I

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
notice on my fish the only system that I

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.480 
notice on my fish the only system that I
also<00:03:16.940> use<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:19.020> quarantine<00:03:19.680> tank<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.070> am<00:03:20.220> still

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
also use as a quarantine tank I am still

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.220 
also use as a quarantine tank I am still
running<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.790> glass<00:03:21.000> heater<00:03:21.240> and<00:03:21.510> that's<00:03:21.930> just

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
running the glass heater and that's just

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.650 
running the glass heater and that's just
basically<00:03:22.440> due<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.370> budget<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.000> will<00:03:24.540> be

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
basically due to budget that will be

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.630 
basically due to budget that will be
upgraded<00:03:25.200> eventually<00:03:25.770> but<00:03:26.040> anything<00:03:26.370> I<00:03:26.459> buy

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
upgraded eventually but anything I buy

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.930 
upgraded eventually but anything I buy
definitely<00:03:27.570> from<00:03:28.170> now<00:03:28.290> on<00:03:28.500> titanium<00:03:29.459> or

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
definitely from now on titanium or

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.800 
definitely from now on titanium or
composite<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.830> also<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:33.450> having

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
composite so also I really like having

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.940 
composite so also I really like having
the<00:03:34.020> temp<00:03:34.380> probe<00:03:35.060> external<00:03:36.060> of<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.630> heater

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the temp probe external of the heater

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.100 
the temp probe external of the heater
that<00:03:37.950> way<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.340> set<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:39.120> long<00:03:39.600> distance

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
that way I can set this a long distance

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.680 
that way I can set this a long distance
away<00:03:40.560> from<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.550> heater<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:41.970> that<00:03:42.450> way<00:03:42.570> I'm

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
away from the heater and that way I'm

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.630 
away from the heater and that way I'm
not<00:03:42.840> getting<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.590> direct<00:03:43.920> heat<00:03:44.160> off<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.610> the

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
not getting the direct heat off of the

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.740 
not getting the direct heat off of the
heater<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.060> just<00:03:45.270> more<00:03:45.930> accurate<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.750> then

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
heater it's just more accurate and then

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.680 
heater it's just more accurate and then
I<00:03:49.050> like<00:03:49.890> having<00:03:50.400> external<00:03:51.500> controller<00:03:53.690> this

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
I like having external controller this

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.140 
I like having external controller this
puts<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.260> controller<00:03:56.160> out<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.910> water

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
puts the controller out of the water

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.810 
puts the controller out of the water
where<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.870> easily<00:03:58.110> accessible<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:59.100> this

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
where it's easily accessible and this

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.420 
where it's easily accessible and this
one's<00:04:00.030> really<00:04:00.209> nice<00:04:00.450> it's<00:04:00.780> got<00:04:00.959> an<00:04:01.260> LED<00:04:01.739> setup

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
one's really nice it's got an LED setup

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.060 
one's really nice it's got an LED setup
on<00:04:02.610> here<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.840> see<00:04:04.050> what<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.470> set<00:04:04.709> at<00:04:04.890> at

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
on here so I can see what it's set at at

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.300 
on here so I can see what it's set at at
all<00:04:05.190> times<00:04:05.489> so<00:04:06.330> those<00:04:07.110> are<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.350> big<00:04:07.709> criteria

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
all times so those are the big criteria

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.850 
all times so those are the big criteria
I<00:04:08.430> look<00:04:08.640> for<00:04:10.100> this<00:04:11.100> via<00:04:11.520> aqua

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
I look for this via aqua

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.370 
I look for this via aqua
system<00:04:13.860> is<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.160> very<00:04:14.540> inexpensive<00:04:15.540> heater<00:04:16.080> for

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
system is a very inexpensive heater for

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.800 
system is a very inexpensive heater for
what<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.650> get<00:04:16.770> here<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:18.120> year<00:04:18.570> with

so for me is a no-brainer
it<00:04:27.780> has<00:04:27.930> proven<00:04:28.229> reliability

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
it has proven reliability

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.380 
it has proven reliability
least<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:30.060> my<00:04:30.540> own<00:04:30.720> personal<00:04:31.610> experience<00:04:32.610> and

it works very well and like I previous

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.840 
it works very well and like I previous
mentioned<00:04:38.850> huge<00:04:39.570> that<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.050> run<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:41.490> smaller

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
mentioned huge that you run to smaller

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.780 
mentioned huge that you run to smaller
heaters<00:04:42.300> instead<00:04:42.660> of<00:04:42.780> one<00:04:42.930> big<00:04:43.080> here<00:04:43.470> just<00:04:43.950> for

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
heaters instead of one big here just for

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.990 
heaters instead of one big here just for
the<00:04:45.180> redundancy<00:04:45.720> fact<00:04:46.580> we<00:04:47.580> want<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.850> make<00:04:47.970> sure

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
the redundancy fact we want to make sure

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.390 
the redundancy fact we want to make sure
that<00:04:48.450> if<00:04:48.630> one<00:04:48.930> heater<00:04:49.170> goes<00:04:49.470> we<00:04:50.010> still<00:04:50.250> have<00:04:50.370> a

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
that if one heater goes we still have a

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.180 
that if one heater goes we still have a
backup<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.510> if<00:04:51.660> one<00:04:51.870> heater<00:04:52.440> fails<00:04:52.740> in<00:04:52.980> the<00:04:53.070> on

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
backup and if one heater fails in the on

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.720 
backup and if one heater fails in the on
position

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
position

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.660 
position
we<00:04:53.970> don't<00:04:54.150> fry<00:04:54.390> our<00:04:54.570> system<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.620> I'm<00:04:56.370> gonna<00:04:56.550> go

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
we don't fry our system so I'm gonna go

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.710 
we don't fry our system so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.000> install<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:57.660> on<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.930> system<00:04:58.370> and

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
ahead and install this on the system and

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.700 
ahead and install this on the system and
we'll<00:05:00.720> take<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.900> look<00:05:01.140> at<00:05:01.290> it<00:05:01.410> okay<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.500> here's

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
we'll take a look at it okay so here's

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.430 
we'll take a look at it okay so here's
the<00:05:04.800> heater<00:05:05.460> installed<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:07.080> comes<00:05:07.320> with

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
the heater installed it comes with

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.050 
the heater installed it comes with
suction<00:05:07.680> cups<00:05:07.860> but<00:05:08.310> like<00:05:08.520> everything<00:05:08.940> with

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
suction cups but like everything with

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.470 
suction cups but like everything with
suction<00:05:09.330> cups<00:05:09.630> they<00:05:10.220> don't<00:05:11.220> actually<00:05:11.670> suck<00:05:12.030> so

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
suction cups they don't actually suck so

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.760 
suction cups they don't actually suck so
it's<00:05:12.600> just<00:05:12.720> kind<00:05:12.930> of<00:05:12.960> sitting<00:05:13.140> on<00:05:13.320> the<00:05:13.410> bottom

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
it's just kind of sitting on the bottom

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.930 
it's just kind of sitting on the bottom
and<00:05:13.980> then<00:05:14.940> I<00:05:14.970> ran<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.420> temperature<00:05:16.380> probe

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
and then I ran the temperature probe

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.790 
and then I ran the temperature probe
behind<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.120> rock<00:05:18.660> and<00:05:19.170> it's<00:05:19.320> held<00:05:19.530> down<00:05:19.620> with

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
behind this rock and it's held down with

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.220 
behind this rock and it's held down with
the<00:05:19.950> rocks<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.640> course<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.570> suction<00:05:22.050> cups

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
the rocks and of course the suction cups

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.680 
the rocks and of course the suction cups
never<00:05:22.440> stay<00:05:22.710> but<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:24.000> keeps<00:05:24.150> my<00:05:24.330> temperature

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
never stay but that keeps my temperature

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.060 
never stay but that keeps my temperature
away<00:05:24.960> from<00:05:25.140> my<00:05:25.230> heater<00:05:25.410> so<00:05:25.620> I<00:05:25.650> get<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.830> pretty

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
away from my heater so I get a pretty

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.220 
away from my heater so I get a pretty
accurate<00:05:27.500> reading<00:05:28.500> as<00:05:28.830> to<00:05:29.250> what's<00:05:29.460> going<00:05:29.670> on

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
accurate reading as to what's going on

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.320 
accurate reading as to what's going on
then<00:05:31.230> the<00:05:31.590> wires<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.220> run<00:05:32.820> up<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.210> this

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
then the wires just run up to this

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.260 
then the wires just run up to this
controller<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:34.610> just<00:05:35.610> set<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.790> controller

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
controller and just set the controller

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.440 
controller and just set the controller
you<00:05:36.540> just<00:05:37.410> hit<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:37.800> button<00:05:37.860> and<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:39.210> runs

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
you just hit this button and it runs

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.150 
you just hit this button and it runs
through<00:05:39.690> the<00:05:39.750> root<00:05:40.020> loops<00:05:40.260> you<00:05:40.620> navigate<00:05:41.040> and

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
through the root loops you navigate and

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.580 
through the root loops you navigate and
either<00:05:41.310> Fahrenheit<00:05:41.880> or<00:05:41.910> Celsius<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.690> live<00:05:43.500> in

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
either Fahrenheit or Celsius I live in

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.140 
either Fahrenheit or Celsius I live in
America<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.310> went<00:05:44.490> ahead<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.760> stuck<00:05:45.120> with

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
America so I went ahead and stuck with

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.460 
America so I went ahead and stuck with
the<00:05:45.300> Fahrenheit<00:05:47.990> people<00:05:48.990> may<00:05:49.110> be<00:05:49.170> wondering

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
the Fahrenheit people may be wondering

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.270 
the Fahrenheit people may be wondering
what<00:05:50.460> size<00:05:50.760> heater<00:05:51.210> they<00:05:51.360> should<00:05:51.540> buy<00:05:51.690> and

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
what size heater they should buy and

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.550 
what size heater they should buy and
well<00:05:53.280> that's<00:05:53.610> kind<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.150> up<00:05:54.540> to<00:05:54.930> your<00:05:55.080> system

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
well that's kind of up to your system

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.840 
well that's kind of up to your system
and<00:05:55.830> how<00:05:56.430> everything<00:05:56.700> works<00:05:56.970> for<00:05:57.210> you<00:05:58.610> if<00:05:59.610> you

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
and how everything works for you if you

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.550 
and how everything works for you if you
read<00:06:00.060> the<00:06:00.300> literature<00:06:00.660> that<00:06:01.050> comes<00:06:01.290> with<00:06:01.440> this

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
read the literature that comes with this

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.400 
read the literature that comes with this
controller<00:06:02.390> alright<00:06:03.390> with<00:06:03.510> this<00:06:03.660> heater<00:06:03.930> it's

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
controller alright with this heater it's

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.740 
controller alright with this heater it's
only<00:06:04.620> good<00:06:04.920> for<00:06:05.280> about<00:06:05.670> an<00:06:05.880> 80<00:06:06.030> gallon<00:06:06.390> system

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
only good for about an 80 gallon system

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.230 
only good for about an 80 gallon system
which<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.230> don't<00:06:07.920> believe<00:06:08.520> because<00:06:08.850> I<00:06:09.000> was

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
which I don't believe because I was

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.210 
which I don't believe because I was
running<00:06:09.360> 250<00:06:10.080> gallons<00:06:10.410> of<00:06:10.530> water<00:06:10.680> on<00:06:10.980> it<00:06:11.010> and

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
running 250 gallons of water on it and

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.450 
running 250 gallons of water on it and
it<00:06:11.910> will<00:06:12.000> still<00:06:12.240> maintain<00:06:12.390> 78<00:06:13.110> degrees<00:06:13.440> so<00:06:14.310> I'm

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
it will still maintain 78 degrees so I'm

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.950 
it will still maintain 78 degrees so I'm
not<00:06:14.550> gonna<00:06:14.700> be<00:06:14.820> a<00:06:14.850> lot<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.030> help<00:06:15.240> as<00:06:15.480> to<00:06:15.720> what

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
not gonna be a lot of help as to what

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.430 
not gonna be a lot of help as to what
size<00:06:16.230> best<00:06:16.950> I<00:06:17.100> can<00:06:17.310> say<00:06:17.490> is<00:06:17.730> if<00:06:18.630> you've<00:06:19.020> got<00:06:19.410> a

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
size best I can say is if you've got a

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.950 
size best I can say is if you've got a
house<00:06:19.950> that<00:06:20.280> fluctuates<00:06:20.850> in<00:06:21.210> temperature<00:06:21.930> a

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
house that fluctuates in temperature a

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.500 
house that fluctuates in temperature a
lot<00:06:22.110> it's<00:06:22.770> gonna<00:06:22.920> make<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.160> huge<00:06:23.490> difference<00:06:24.000> my

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
lot it's gonna make a huge difference my

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.200 
lot it's gonna make a huge difference my
dump<00:06:25.350> is<00:06:25.500> in<00:06:25.620> the<00:06:25.710> basement<00:06:25.920> it<00:06:26.850> probably

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
dump is in the basement it probably

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.080 
dump is in the basement it probably
stays<00:06:27.420> about<00:06:27.630> 73<00:06:28.320> degrees<00:06:28.650> in<00:06:28.980> this<00:06:29.490> room<00:06:29.790> just

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
stays about 73 degrees in this room just

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.760 
stays about 73 degrees in this room just
because<00:06:30.750> with<00:06:30.840> all<00:06:30.930> the<00:06:31.050> equipment<00:06:31.260> running

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
because with all the equipment running

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.040 
because with all the equipment running
so<00:06:32.160> really<00:06:33.090> I<00:06:33.150> only<00:06:33.270> upkeep<00:06:33.630> the<00:06:33.720> water<00:06:33.900> about

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
so really I only upkeep the water about

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.330 
so really I only upkeep the water about
five<00:06:34.320> degrees<00:06:34.650> -<00:06:35.220> what's<00:06:35.460> going<00:06:35.730> on<00:06:35.790> upstairs

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
five degrees - what's going on upstairs

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.730 
five degrees - what's going on upstairs
so<00:06:38.340> it<00:06:38.460> makes<00:06:38.610> a<00:06:38.700> difference<00:06:39.350> that's<00:06:40.350> also

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740
