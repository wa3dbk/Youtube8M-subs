to talk to you about a new product from

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.700 
to talk to you about a new product from
saunas<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:08.370> g2m<00:00:09.000> version<00:00:09.660> -<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.170> box<00:00:10.410> says

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
saunas the g2m version - the box says

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.560 
saunas the g2m version - the box says
that<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.190> enhances<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> tracking<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.420> that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
that it enhances the tracking and that

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
that it enhances the tracking and that
it's<00:00:12.719> three<00:00:13.080> times<00:00:13.290> faster<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.280> convert<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
it's three times faster to convert the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.939 
it's three times faster to convert the
notes<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.599> looks<00:00:15.750> exactly<00:00:15.929> like<00:00:16.260> version<00:00:16.770> one

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
notes it looks exactly like version one

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.310 
notes it looks exactly like version one
with<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.430> additional<00:00:18.000> chromatic<00:00:18.869> mode<00:00:18.900> as

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
with the additional chromatic mode as

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
with the additional chromatic mode as
chromatic<00:00:19.770> mode<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:20.220> simply<00:00:20.609> allow<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.910> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
chromatic mode would simply allow you to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.140 
chromatic mode would simply allow you to
configure<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.859> no<00:00:23.100> pitch<00:00:23.699> bends

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
configure this so that no pitch bends

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.550 
configure this so that no pitch bends
would<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> allowed<00:00:24.750> which<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.170> great<00:00:25.380> when

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
would be allowed which is great when

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.679 
would be allowed which is great when
you're<00:00:25.680> tracking<00:00:25.949> with<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.640> keyboard<00:00:27.539> for

find<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:49.860> today<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.460> recorded<00:00:51.059> my<00:00:51.239> guitar

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
find out today I recorded my guitar

find out today I recorded my guitar
tracks<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.170> GarageBand<00:00:52.890> dry<00:00:53.610> signal<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
tracks in GarageBand dry signal the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
tracks in GarageBand dry signal the
output<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> my<00:00:54.989> sound<00:00:55.260> card<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.860> feeding<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
output of my sound card was feeding the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.569 
output of my sound card was feeding the
dry<00:00:56.670> signal<00:00:56.870> directly<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> g2m<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
dry signal directly into the g2m and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.360 
dry signal directly into the g2m and
then<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.879> fed<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.449> MIDI<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.620> my<00:01:01.770> sound<00:01:02.039> card

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
then I fed the MIDI out to my sound card

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.690 
then I fed the MIDI out to my sound card
so<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.390> sound<00:01:03.660> card<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.489> convert<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so that the sound card would convert to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.510 
so that the sound card would convert to
MIDI<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.600> same<00:01:06.900> exact<00:01:07.350> dry<00:01:07.770> signal<00:01:08.100> using

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
MIDI the same exact dry signal using

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.330 
MIDI the same exact dry signal using
both<00:01:08.850> G<00:01:09.570> 2<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.960> version<00:01:10.170> 1<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.650> G<00:01:11.040> 2<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
both G 2 and version 1 and G 2 and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
both G 2 and version 1 and G 2 and
version<00:01:11.580> 2<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.330> gave<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.750> three<00:01:13.260> different

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
version 2 this gave me three different

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.700 
version 2 this gave me three different
tracks<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.369> dry<00:01:14.850> guitar<00:01:15.060> track<00:01:15.630> followed<00:01:16.470> by<00:01:16.680> a
