00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.739
 there are very good youtube for wanted 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.720
 commenting I tell them a new video 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.129
 decalogue of advance warfare a video in 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.510
 the one who taught how he went from prestige 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.070
 you know I have this this series this 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.230
 miniseries that you like so much and that only 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.820
 go up basically every week and good 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.509
 that we are passing to prestige number 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.060
 24 in total I think the prestige teacher is 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:22.039
 the number 9 and that you already know that they see 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.390
 statistics the weapon and all that though 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.949
 Well the weapon they give you is that of 4 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.869
 jawad who teaches it yesterday to a counselor 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.980
 I'll do a little bit of it like that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.210
 over if you want to see it a bit in 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.279
 depth and it was seen in the description 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 but good also clarify some things 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.070
 that he had not said in yesterday's video 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.480
 here is watching how I unlock the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.000
 m1 they give it to you soon but for having 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.730
 We had such prestige and good for us 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.960
 give the emblem the advanced supply and 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.300
 the four and water supply 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.400
 advanced we will open it in him opening 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.390
 this week's supplies one week 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.370
 which is better said because it's the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.290
 Monday and I will show you the file 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.420
 technique of the e4 and water is that it is already 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.070
 yesterday but well there you are seeing that I 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.690
 I'm a point of the damage it goes up two points 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.790
 the mobility of lowered I put is the 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.590
 handling and one point down the reach 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.500
 this makes it worse than 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.519
 hip 20% points worse than 20% more 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.289
 fast with which is very good 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.030
 they gain damage that comes in handy in 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.219
 average distances and the reach then it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.600
 Fuck a little bit but do not fuck as much as 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.030
 other things that you could not have gone down 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.579
 and well, here you have the theme of 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.500
 statistics no 11 10 hours proportion 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.259
 of 2 with 0 7 and the lost points of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.429
 rise 2 with 23 if I'm not wrong like that 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.810
 that's good here, spending a little bit of 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.369
 latest statistics this is taught by 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.539
 complete perhaps when prestige rises 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.819
 more the latter is asking who 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.439
 if you give me all that but when I go up 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.729
 great prestige of this is to say when 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.819
 reach the last level that I need 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.259
 about five or six basically it is 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.880
 signal and in full all my arsenal 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.020
 all the weapons that I have without garetto 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.149
 the statistics all the medals 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 all the gusts all that I have what 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.610
 I'm going to save for the final video that goes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.280
 to be a little longer than it would be 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.369
 absolutely everything and good then here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.159
 You have on screen 4 ayahua the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.349
 remiseros yesterday the issue of red dot 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.880
 we have the stock we have the heatsink 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.069
 so that it lasts a little longer by shooting 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 and I do not put it off because 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.950
 well as I said it points a little 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.270
 faster and I think without difficult the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.770
 red dot I did not say it yesterday because the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.629
 your average is very bad is like that of 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 green tuna modern warfare 2 or m 60 

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:10.679
 of the call of duty 4 is a super peephole 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.240
 obstructive that covers the entire screen 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.760
 it does not let you see practically anything 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.280
 so I think that one hundred percent you have 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
 that put the point peephole because 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.940
 if it's not going to cost much to give to the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.770
 people mostly from afar then it's a 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.480
 weapon that as I told you is very good is very 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.160
 comfortable to wear points very fast kills 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.470
 very fast it does not move practically 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.820
 nothing so also if you put the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.140
 heatsink lasts a lot shoots no 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.240
 it has a pretty large charger and if 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.160
 because you are shooting shots stop shooting 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.900
 such recharges it as being me now but 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.970
 it is not advisable, it is better that 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.350
 let it cool alone but good is 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.420
 a weapon that is super super comfortable 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.280
 carry and it's good if you want to like 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.990
 made it look more in depth because the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.540
 you have in the in the description of the video 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.000
 that went up yesterday so good too 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.860
 tell you the subject of I have thought tomorrow 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 climb in the top 10 weapons of this 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.520
 game of aphas warfare pertaining to 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
 models obviously and see if I get 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.200
 time because I'm missing a gameplay to see 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.210
 if I can get it and then upload 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.530
 that video that you probably like is not going 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.880
 to be a video I do not want to be besides what 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.230
 long I will not buy the weapons 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.180
 statistical statistics because they are going to 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.710
 be very very long in the video but that 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'm going to make plans according to my 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.310
 opinion and I'll let you also put 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.590
 our opinion the comments in plan 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.940
 your top we are not going let's say that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.200
 what's going on here and in the end 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.209
 leave another piece of example for what 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.920
 It's an authentic 5 on screen I stayed 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.599
 I'm alive, I'm not going to bury 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.830
 so good finally tell you that 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.959
 you have in the description as always 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.489
 like to remember every week the subject of 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.920
 this thing with a discount code if 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.560
 you want to buy psn points if you want 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.970
 buy xbox live from xbox if you want 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.950
 buy games estimated the origin you have 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.810
 the description on the g2 page to that 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.400
 already in case things are worth a little 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.690
 cheaper and above you have a 3 for 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.280
 percent discount that least gives a 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.540
 stone not also the boot theme 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.819
 controls that have taken out new ones 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.739
 levers the truth is they are pretty 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.720
 great is to say in plan for if os 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.950
 They look small, because they leverage a little 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.209
 more resistant perhaps and a little more 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.799
 great to have a contact area 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.110
 by the way there is the 5 in screen by 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.760
 appealed in my mother group so 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.019
 You also have a 5% discount on 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.370

 oriented so to japan today such 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.340
 thematic of japan pretty cool and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.329
 also sound a bit in that video 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.400
