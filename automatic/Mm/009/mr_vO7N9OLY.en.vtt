00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
Twitter book I guess this is how they

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100 
Twitter book I guess this is how they
balance<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.400> earlier<00:02:19.390> area<00:02:19.780> where<00:02:19.990> you

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
balance out the earlier area where you

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.460 
balance out the earlier area where you
could<00:02:20.380> really<00:02:20.680> shoot<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.640> guy<00:02:21.840> or<00:02:22.840> no<00:02:23.050> no<00:02:23.410> you

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
could really shoot the guy or no no you

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.200 
could really shoot the guy or no no you
couldn't<00:02:23.980> really<00:02:24.070> get<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.430> lot<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.760> accurate

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
couldn't really get a lot of accurate

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.230 
couldn't really get a lot of accurate
shots<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.750> motorcycle<00:02:26.320> people<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:28.210> I

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
shots on the motorcycle people now I

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.589 
shots on the motorcycle people now I
couldn't<00:02:28.570> let<00:02:28.810> me<00:02:28.960> again

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
couldn't let me again

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.970 
couldn't let me again
I'm<00:02:31.599> assuming<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.200> reason<00:02:32.530> they<00:02:32.650> make<00:02:32.829> him

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
I'm assuming the reason they make him

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.470 
I'm assuming the reason they make him
much<00:02:33.159> stronger<00:02:33.670> because<00:02:33.879> they<00:02:34.090> put<00:02:34.299> like<00:02:34.450> a

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
much stronger because they put like a

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.410 
much stronger because they put like a
thousand<00:02:34.989> times<00:02:35.140> more<00:02:35.379> flag<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.099> him<00:02:36.420> like

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
thousand times more flag up in him like

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.059 
thousand times more flag up in him like
I<00:02:37.540> think<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.840> most<00:02:38.049> i've<00:02:38.319> ever<00:02:38.409> counted<00:02:38.890> on

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
I think the most i've ever counted on

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.509 
I think the most i've ever counted on
him<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.459> like<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.720> 10<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.950> including<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
him is like like 10 not including the

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.030 
him is like like 10 not including the
big<00:02:42.730> one<00:02:42.939> on<00:02:43.090> his<00:02:43.209> back<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:44.170> now<00:02:44.230> I'm<00:02:44.530> managers

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
big one on his back and now I'm managers

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.190 
big one on his back and now I'm managers
for<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.790> now<00:02:48.939> he<00:02:49.000> manages<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.629> pick<00:02:49.900> up<00:02:50.049> a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
for one and now he manages to pick up a

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.220 
for one and now he manages to pick up a
giant<00:02:50.859> perfectly<00:02:51.670> sized<00:02:51.879> boulder<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:53.079> now<00:02:53.200> I

shoot the barrel the other the

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.380 
shoot the barrel the other the
alternative<00:02:57.340> strategy<00:02:57.760> would<00:02:57.909> have<00:02:58.060> been<00:02:58.209> to

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
alternative strategy would have been to

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.059 
alternative strategy would have been to
shoot<00:02:58.569> him<00:02:58.689> and<00:02:58.900> he<00:02:59.049> can<00:02:59.140> also<00:02:59.319> pack<00:02:59.859> the
