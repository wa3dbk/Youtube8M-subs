00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.140 
the side the last thing I had to work on
was<00:01:58.890> her<00:01:59.040> finish<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.610> touching<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.000> wall

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
was her finish and touching the wall

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.510 
was her finish and touching the wall
straight<00:02:00.510> with<00:02:00.690> her<00:02:00.780> head<00:02:00.930> down<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.520> think

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
straight with her head down I think

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.650 
straight with her head down I think
she's<00:02:02.670> actually<00:02:02.820> going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.120> do<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.420> well

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
she's actually going to do really well

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.240 
she's actually going to do really well
today<00:02:03.810> her<00:02:04.050> form<00:02:04.290> looks<00:02:04.440> pretty<00:02:04.770> good<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:04.980> she

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
today her form looks pretty good so she

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.460 
today her form looks pretty good so she
might<00:02:05.490> surprise<00:02:05.730> some<00:02:05.850> people

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.380 
or lounging by the pool it should
probably<00:02:17.980> be<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.370> easiest<00:02:18.400> challenge<00:02:19.000> all

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
probably be the easiest challenge all

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.170 
probably be the easiest challenge all
season<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.580> remember<00:02:21.580> when<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.820> was<00:02:22.000> first

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
season I remember when I was first

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940 
season I remember when I was first
learning<00:02:22.330> how<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.720> dive<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.350> coach<00:02:23.740> would

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
learning how to dive and coach would

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.350 
learning how to dive and coach would
tell<00:02:24.100> us<00:02:24.220> about<00:02:24.340> all<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.640> bad<00:02:24.880> habits<00:02:24.940> of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
tell us about all the bad habits of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.420 
tell us about all the bad habits of
diving<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:26.620> sure<00:02:26.830> he<00:02:26.980> was<00:02:27.010> talking<00:02:27.400> about

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
diving pretty sure he was talking about

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.030 
diving pretty sure he was talking about
Adrian<00:02:27.910> doing<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.300> talk<00:02:28.710> well<00:02:29.710> I've<00:02:29.830> watched

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
Adrian doing that talk well I've watched

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.410 
Adrian doing that talk well I've watched
her<00:02:30.190> warm<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.550> already<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.150> don't<00:02:31.300> really

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
her warm up already and I don't really

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.820 
her warm up already and I don't really
know<00:02:31.630> if<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:32.020> call<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.470> swimming

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.040 
know if I can call that swimming
honestly<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:34.060> looks<00:02:34.330> like<00:02:34.480> she's<00:02:34.660> trying<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
honestly it looks like she's trying to

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.420 
honestly it looks like she's trying to
drown<00:02:35.260> but<00:02:35.530> doesn't<00:02:35.860> even<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.100> how<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.250> do

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430

probably<00:05:01.760> going<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.150> be<00:05:02.240> the<00:05:02.390> toughest<00:05:02.780> sport

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
probably going to be the toughest sport

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.110 
probably going to be the toughest sport
I<00:05:03.350> was<00:05:03.620> gonna<00:05:03.710> have<00:05:03.830> to<00:05:03.860> go<00:05:04.010> against<00:05:04.310> swimming
