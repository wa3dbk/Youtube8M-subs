00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello today we are going to learn how to make a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.770
 wooden headboard like this that we have 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.600
 here of slats or pallets that as you see 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.590
 it is a very rustic result very 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.650
 nice and helps us to recycle 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.580
 wood I hope you like it 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 we're going to need wood slats 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.200
 about two meters long we have 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 bought us to cut them to the 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.820
 appropriate measure depending on what 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 look at our box, you will need some 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.410
 Longer or shorter timbers also 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.190
 you can use pallets that you have had 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 to remove obviously and then you can 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.540
 treat them 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.230
 let's also use a sander 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.230
 a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.600
 saw to cut them to the measurements of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.690
 crystals and points or klaus 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.289
 we have already fixed all the slats 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.850
 and they are ready for us to place 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.810
 in the expedition that our 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.510
 headboard 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.940
 to begin to join them for it we go 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.000
 to start by fixing each other with a 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.400
 little bit of glue all over the ground 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.060
 Special for wood or special glue 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.060
 for wood 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.500
 let's mark several points here and here 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.830
 more or less a distance of about 20 30 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.300
 centimeters and we're going to hit the 11 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.850
 making pressure 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.680
 once the glue has dried what 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.540
 we have done is in the part that is going to be 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.160
 the back of the headboard with the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.750
 pieces of the slats that had 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.260
 as you know a lesson is about 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.540
 two meters we have cut them to 160 then 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.690
 with that stretch that was left over we're going to do 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 the reinforcement in the back area to 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.910
 we're going to use glue again 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.480
 for wood or all-terrain and we're going to 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.370
 stick the reinforcement strips back one 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.510
 once the glue is dry if you want 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.990
 you can reinforce it with the help of nails or 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.990
 tips 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.480
 we have waited for the wheat needed to 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.820
 that the glue adheres well to the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.220
 wood and then as you see we have 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.070
 fixed with nails to make sure 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.730
 that all the ribbons fit 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.110
 subjects and the headboard is not undone 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.370
 we want them to last us longer 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.650
 possible so that our 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.960
 headboard and we could decorate it from the 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.820
 way that we like or leave it like that 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.230
