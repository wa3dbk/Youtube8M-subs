00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.510
 it's better to make the story 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:29.460
 to the side with the hands gathered to a 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:38.480
 attack dog is better to do the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.480
 dead over 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.590
 when one is in the center that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.590
 draws attention 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.050
 can be done the dead reality but 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.000
 also apart from answering this 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.400
 actually the dog can get to 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.970
 betray not being one the love being 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.970
 one love 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.790
 or because in the case of this 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.140
 play dead on the floor but you can 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.720
 approach and maybe you think that 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.010
 it's all ok suddenly you a little 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.590
 movement can make the dog and I 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.720
 seen the dog can attack to see the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 subject of fast movements that's 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.670
 important is also the same but not 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.929
 Like people if I go as well 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.929
 and in the case of the dog some 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.650
 what brings us 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.060
 in the attack of a dog 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.860
 the best the state indifference with 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.860
 your 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.580
 it's something very true that when I 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.860
 I spend agacho is different what the 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.540
 dog sees from me me at the height of him that 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.060
 what he sees from my achievement this portion 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.090
 other proportions and also another 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.780
 communication that the message being of 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.250
 another level no no because of starting you 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.350
 you are going to look helpless the area of ​​the 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 face that is very important the area of 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.990
 neck that is also very important in 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.330
 stronger attacks and therefore 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.440
 always stay at height maintain 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.580
 the arms stuck the body what 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.170
 we talk about the vision to the side 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.060
 because you can eat more risk in the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.130
 soil can be here they established a lot 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.170
 people say do the dead is not to be 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.630
 the dead but stay still 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.470
 so as not to stimulate her as she talks 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.470
 they have frozen 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.520
 I'm not doing anything, I 'm not coming 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.350
 threaten you or want anything with you without 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.240
 But I respect you for the sun I do not look at you 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.800
 and I go after it burns percent there 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.900
 a thing called critical zone 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.850
 because in the area where the animal tolerates 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.810
 depending on the type of animal and how 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.540
 sensible 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.700
 if it is very large or very small in the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.110
 more aggressive animals more sensitive the 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.180
 area is very wide therefore you 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.709
 as soon as you enter your territory or your 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.330
 invasion sector begins to have 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.459
 reactions like growling and that wants 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.930
 say that you are visiting what the 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.450
 costs are more or less depends the dog 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.040
 but back he pays the bbva is super 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.470
 variable but the issue warn with 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.870
 grunts or with his gestural language and that 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.980
 it's already good that you have to get to 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.980
 there just fixed 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.940
 that is when you go to that radio but what 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.410
 who always understands is how to do so or 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.410
 whether I am about the person 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.139
 and the 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.650
 but the dog and I went out I show the video 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.169
 the dog was doing like this and the guy 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.500
 the dog approaches him thus makes a 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:55.230
 shame 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:56.700
 the issue is that many times when not 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.160
 you can read the verbal language very well 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.900
 you do not see you do not see the attention of the 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.690
 muscles for example is different than a 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.460
 dog do so it's like submissive that 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.940
 they are taking a dog that is tense and 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.370
 It makes you like that and that means you 're 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.419
 with your fight the cats that put on 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.550
 faces on the side of those alerted the 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.290
 language you can not see only the face 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.880
 but the whole body so much said 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.710
 in good Chilean asking me the Chilean 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.010
 for the cowards that I include myself on 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.849
 everything we have that the first thing that there is 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:34.869
 do when you see 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:37.809
 relatively pass safely to 

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:39.520
 be conscious but not challenging what 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.050
 happens as I do not know the dog well and 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.089
 there are many people who have houses for 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.339
 dogs with water with food and some 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.139
 animals take as territory maybe me 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:48.789
 I may not necessarily start because 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.529
 yes I also make him nervous but not 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:54.270
 perceive then pass safely 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.270
 for a prudent distance that the dog
