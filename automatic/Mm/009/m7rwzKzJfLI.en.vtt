pretty<00:01:31.350> cool<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> effective<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.430> may

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
pretty cool and effective then you may

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.039 
pretty cool and effective then you may
not<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.790> able<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.000> fool<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.329> actual<00:01:33.630> jazz<00:01:33.840> guy

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
not be able to fool an actual jazz guy

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.749 
not be able to fool an actual jazz guy
with<00:01:34.290> them<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.740> most<00:01:35.100> people<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.460> buy<00:01:35.610> them

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
with them but most people would buy them

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.249 
with them but most people would buy them
and<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.600> they're<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:36.960> cool<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:39.259> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and I think they're pretty cool now the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.389 
and I think they're pretty cool now the
first<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.619> kind<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.979> sounds<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.280> this

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.219 

and<00:01:47.399> all<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.390> pentatonic<00:01:48.960> stuff

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and all that is some pentatonic stuff

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
and all that is some pentatonic stuff
with<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.579> jazzy<00:01:50.789> sound<00:01:51.090> coming<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:51.570> this

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
with the jazzy sound coming from this

pull<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:53.360> if<00:01:54.360> you're<00:01:54.509> rock<00:01:54.719> guy<00:01:54.899> you've

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pull off right if you're rock guy you've

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.490 
pull off right if you're rock guy you've
probably<00:01:55.289> played<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:57.140> stuff<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
probably played these stuff like that

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
probably played these stuff like that
right<00:01:58.679> it's<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> blue<00:01:59.640> scale<00:01:59.969> Renai

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479

minor<00:02:03.979> definitely<00:02:04.979> also<00:02:05.220> played<00:02:05.399> these<00:02:05.579> notes

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
minor definitely also played these notes

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.139 
minor definitely also played these notes
so<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> basic<00:02:06.450> idea<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:08.030> pick<00:02:09.030> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so the basic idea is that you pick this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
so the basic idea is that you pick this
note<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.810> stroke<00:02:10.130> do<00:02:11.130> an<00:02:11.250> op

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
note with the down stroke do an op

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
note with the down stroke do an op
stroke<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:12.030> then<00:02:12.180> pull<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.510> twice<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:16.560> if

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
stroke and then pull off twice see if

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.960 
stroke and then pull off twice see if
you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.799> get<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.040> accent<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.610> downbeat

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
you can get the accent on the downbeat

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.660 
you can get the accent on the downbeat
here<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:19.799> play<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.099> root<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.610> in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
here and then play the root up here in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.490 
here and then play the root up here in
the<00:02:20.760> D<00:02:20.910> string<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:23.040> 7th<00:02:23.340> fret<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.819> down<00:02:24.150> up

pull<00:02:25.500> off<00:02:25.680> pull<00:02:26.130> right<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:27.900> got<00:02:28.019> this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
pull off pull right and we got this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.610 
pull off pull right and we got this
little<00:02:28.760> rhythm<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.780> resolve<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.440> here

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
little rhythm you can resolve it up here
