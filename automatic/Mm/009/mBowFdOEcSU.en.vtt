00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.840 

I'm<00:00:03.750> gonna<00:00:03.990> do<00:00:04.260> one<00:00:04.529> more<00:00:04.710> head<00:00:05.250> drawing<00:00:05.549> video

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I'm gonna do one more head drawing video

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.030 
I'm gonna do one more head drawing video
in<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.089> series<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.720> had<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> comment<00:00:07.410> asked<00:00:07.799> if

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
in this series I had a comment asked if

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.320 
in this series I had a comment asked if
I<00:00:08.129> could<00:00:08.190> show<00:00:08.490> how<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> draw<00:00:08.940> heads<00:00:09.150> from

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I could show how to draw heads from

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.879 
I could show how to draw heads from
different<00:00:09.720> angles<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> an

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
different angles and so this is an

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.330 
different angles and so this is an
attempt<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> give<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> little<00:00:12.330> bit<00:00:12.510> more<00:00:13.410> detail

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
attempt to give a little bit more detail

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.190 
attempt to give a little bit more detail
on<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:15.299> also<00:00:15.450> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.809> draw<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> head

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
on that I'm also going to draw the head

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.630 
on that I'm also going to draw the head
in<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.380> slightly<00:00:16.619> different<00:00:16.890> way<00:00:17.279> than<00:00:17.520> before

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
in a slightly different way than before

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.480 
in a slightly different way than before
so<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.210> see<00:00:18.510> I've<00:00:18.630> got<00:00:19.100> circles<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
so you see I've got circles for the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.109 
so you see I've got circles for the
skull<00:00:21.000> or<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.539> cranium<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.910> most

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
skull or the cranium and the most

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.599 
skull or the cranium and the most
important<00:00:24.660> part<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.100> cross<00:00:26.369> that

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
important part here is the cross that

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
important part here is the cross that
you<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.330> basically<00:00:28.140> dividing<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you see I'm basically dividing that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.220 
you see I'm basically dividing that
sphere<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.189> half<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.510> gonna<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.990> where

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
sphere in half and that's gonna be where

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.960 
sphere in half and that's gonna be where
our<00:00:31.260> nose<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.010> our<00:00:32.099> eyes<00:00:32.250> line<00:00:32.580> and<00:00:32.879> I'm

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
our nose and our eyes line and I'm

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.979 
our nose and our eyes line and I'm
drawing<00:00:33.180> cheekbones

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
drawing cheekbones

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
drawing cheekbones
slicing<00:00:34.559> off<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> side<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> circle<00:00:35.550> for

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
slicing off the side of the circle for

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.180 
slicing off the side of the circle for
the<00:00:35.880> shape<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> head<00:00:36.860> now<00:00:37.860> over<00:00:38.040> here

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the shape of the head now over here

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
the shape of the head now over here
let's<00:00:38.399> draw<00:00:38.610> another<00:00:38.750> quick<00:00:39.750> set<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
let's draw another quick set of

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
let's draw another quick set of
guidelines<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.489> help<00:00:41.760> us<00:00:41.940> define<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
guidelines to help us define how this

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
guidelines to help us define how this
other<00:00:43.050> head<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.680> look<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.399> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
other head will look and it's going to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.110 
other head will look and it's going to
be<00:00:44.579> looking<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> side<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.910> we'll

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
be looking to the side and so we'll

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
be looking to the side and so we'll
simply<00:00:48.329> draw<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.649> vertical<00:00:50.640> line<00:00:51.350> off<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
simply draw the vertical line off to the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
simply draw the vertical line off to the
right<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.610> also<00:00:53.789> I'm<00:00:54.030> gonna<00:00:54.239> cut<00:00:54.809> off

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
right and and I also I'm gonna cut off

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.299 
right and and I also I'm gonna cut off
the<00:00:55.110> skull<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.559> did<00:00:55.710> before<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> draw<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the skull like I did before and draw the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.180 
the skull like I did before and draw the
cheekbones<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.800> kind<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> give<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
cheekbones and this is to kind of give a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
cheekbones and this is to kind of give a
good<00:00:59.430> visual<00:00:59.730> guide<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> where<00:01:00.210> things<00:01:00.390> are

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
good visual guide to where things are

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.529 
good visual guide to where things are
going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:01.100> basically<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.699> draw<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
going to be basically if you draw this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.469 
going to be basically if you draw this
circle<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.410> create<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.399> sphere<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.150> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
circle and create a sphere from it and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.260 
circle and create a sphere from it and
divide<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.950> half<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> different<00:01:08.939> axes

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
divide it in half on the different axes

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
divide it in half on the different axes
you<00:01:09.510> kind<00:01:09.750> of<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.740> guidelines<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
you kind of get the guidelines that you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750 
you kind of get the guidelines that you
need<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> help<00:01:11.909> draw<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> head<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.460> again<00:01:14.460> we'll

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
need to help draw a head and again we'll

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
need to help draw a head and again we'll
draw<00:01:14.939> somebody<00:01:15.270> looking<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.009> now

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
draw somebody looking down and so now

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.359 
draw somebody looking down and so now
that<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.840> vertical<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.770> horizontal<00:01:19.979> line

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that the vertical or the horizontal line

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
that the vertical or the horizontal line
is<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:22.430> much<00:01:23.430> lower<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.360> we'll<00:01:25.290> draw

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
is going to be much lower and we'll draw

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.350 
is going to be much lower and we'll draw
the<00:01:25.530> vertical<00:01:25.920> line<00:01:26.280> at<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.549> angle<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.090> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the vertical line at an angle and this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.820 
the vertical line at an angle and this
time<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> cheekbones<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> fall

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
time to the cheekbones are going to fall

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.530 
time to the cheekbones are going to fall
a<00:01:28.860> little<00:01:28.950> bit<00:01:29.189> outside<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.880> sphere<00:01:29.939> instead

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
a little bit outside the sphere instead

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.870 
a little bit outside the sphere instead
of<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.780> top<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.460> because<00:01:32.460> they've<00:01:32.670> been

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of on top of it because they've been

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.710 
of on top of it because they've been
rotated<00:01:33.659> down<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:35.240> this<00:01:36.240> line<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> I'm

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
rotated down and this line that I'm

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.240 
rotated down and this line that I'm
drawing<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.590> pretty<00:01:37.770> important

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
drawing right there is pretty important

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.050 
drawing right there is pretty important
too<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:40.470> will<00:01:40.799> help<00:01:41.460> show<00:01:41.759> us<00:01:41.909> where

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
too because it will help show us where

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.600 
too because it will help show us where
the<00:01:42.180> jawline<00:01:42.540> should<00:01:42.810> connect<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.350> skull

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.880 

so<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:47.759> three<00:01:48.420> heads<00:01:48.899> here<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.740> an

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so these three heads here have an

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
so these three heads here have an
obvious<00:01:50.100> direction<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.899> can<00:01:52.020> kind<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
obvious direction and you can kind of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.749 
obvious direction and you can kind of
see<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.560> we're<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
see what we're going with just the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
see what we're going with just the
simple<00:01:54.000> guidelines<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.439> ahead

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
simple guidelines so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.160 
simple guidelines so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:55.880> flesh<00:01:56.880> these<00:01:57.119> out<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and flesh these out and I'm not going to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
and flesh these out and I'm not going to
go<00:01:58.259> into<00:01:58.500> detail<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.850> method<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.869> drawing

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
go into detail on my method for drawing

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.690 
go into detail on my method for drawing
the<00:02:01.369> nose<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.670> eyes<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.060> whatnot<00:02:03.560> but

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
the nose and eyes and whatnot but

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
the nose and eyes and whatnot but
basically<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.030> want<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.390> show<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.200> these

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
basically I want to show that with these

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.150 
basically I want to show that with these
simple<00:02:07.710> guidelines<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.429> draw<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> head

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
simple guidelines we can draw a head

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.339 
simple guidelines we can draw a head
looking<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.280> any<00:02:11.430> direction

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
looking in any direction

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.199 
looking in any direction
so<00:02:13.349> yeah<00:02:13.590> I'll<00:02:13.680> flesh<00:02:13.950> out<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.220> details

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
so yeah I'll flesh out the details

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.209 
so yeah I'll flesh out the details
of<00:02:15.390> course<00:02:15.719> the<00:02:15.930> eyebrows<00:02:16.319> fall<00:02:16.650> across<00:02:16.890> that

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
of course the eyebrows fall across that

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.959 
of course the eyebrows fall across that
horizontal<00:02:17.760> line<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.299> drew<00:02:19.579> the<00:02:20.579> nose<00:02:20.790> is

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
horizontal line we drew the nose is

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.759 
horizontal line we drew the nose is
about<00:02:21.209> halfway<00:02:21.450> between<00:02:21.719> that<00:02:22.109> line<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
about halfway between that line and the

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.360 
about halfway between that line and the
chin<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:25.379> mouth<00:02:25.530> will<00:02:25.829> fall<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.040> or

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
chin and the mouth will fall more or

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.959 
chin and the mouth will fall more or
less<00:02:26.519> at<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.730> bottom<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.269> sphere<00:02:28.969> also

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
less at the bottom of the sphere also

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.629 
less at the bottom of the sphere also
remember<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.170> ears<00:02:31.349> connect<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
remember that the ears connect at the

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.670 
remember that the ears connect at the
top<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.299> brow<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.260> bottom<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
top of the brow and the bottom of the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.720 
top of the brow and the bottom of the
nose<00:02:35.840> at<00:02:36.840> least<00:02:37.079> they<00:02:37.319> typically<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:41.519> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
nose at least they typically do and you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.640 
nose at least they typically do and you
can<00:02:41.879> see<00:02:42.090> how<00:02:42.269> I<00:02:42.299> connected<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> jaw<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.469> where

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
can see how I connected the jaw to where

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.170 
can see how I connected the jaw to where
that<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.930> third<00:02:46.230> dividing<00:02:46.859> line<00:02:47.180> intersects

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
that that third dividing line intersects

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:02.500 
that that third dividing line intersects
with<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.480> sphere

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.350 

now<00:03:03.200> this<00:03:03.440> one's<00:03:03.709> just<00:03:04.060> following<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.150> same

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
now this one's just following the same

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.149 
now this one's just following the same
principles<00:03:05.900> we<00:03:05.989> do<00:03:06.260> have<00:03:06.409> to<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:06.890> keep<00:03:07.040> in

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
principles we do have to kind of keep in

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.050 
principles we do have to kind of keep in
mind<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.519> we've<00:03:07.670> rotated<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.330> bit<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.830> so

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
mind that we've rotated a bit and so

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
mind that we've rotated a bit and so
certain<00:03:11.060> things<00:03:11.209> are<00:03:11.420> going<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.599> be<00:03:11.750> hidden

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
certain things are going to be hidden

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.809 
certain things are going to be hidden
for<00:03:12.560> example<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.040> nose<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.640> cover

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
for example the nose is going to cover

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:20.890 
for example the nose is going to cover
up<00:03:14.030> parts<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.420> eye<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> face<00:03:18.069> and<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
up parts of the eye in the face and the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.180 
up parts of the eye in the face and the
mouth<00:03:21.049> is<00:03:21.290> going<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.560> come<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.920> edge<00:03:22.040> of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
mouth is going to come to the edge of

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.110 
mouth is going to come to the edge of
the<00:03:22.310> face<00:03:22.459> as<00:03:22.700> well

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.000 

so<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.180> can<00:03:31.360> see<00:03:31.569> I've<00:03:31.750> drawn<00:03:31.989> three<00:03:32.319> quick

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
so you can see I've drawn three quick

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.199 
so you can see I've drawn three quick
head<00:03:33.190> drawings<00:03:34.170> based<00:03:35.170> off<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.530> my<00:03:35.709> initial

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
head drawings based off of my initial

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.420 
head drawings based off of my initial
guidelines<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.440> let's<00:03:38.620> do<00:03:38.830> some<00:03:39.099> more<00:03:39.250> with

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
guidelines so let's do some more with

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.839 
guidelines so let's do some more with
these<00:03:39.610> bottom<00:03:40.000> circles<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:42.430> first<00:03:42.670> one

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
these bottom circles and the first one

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.520 
these bottom circles and the first one
we'll<00:03:42.970> do<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.390> center<00:03:43.630> is<00:03:43.870> somebody<00:03:44.290> just

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
we'll do in the center is somebody just

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.699 
we'll do in the center is somebody just
looking<00:03:45.250> down<00:03:45.489> but<00:03:45.940> from<00:03:46.090> straight<00:03:46.450> on<00:03:46.709> so

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
looking down but from straight on so

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.320 
looking down but from straight on so
again<00:03:48.010> we'll<00:03:48.190> draw<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.519> crossbar<00:03:49.000> much

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
again we'll draw this crossbar much

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.790 
again we'll draw this crossbar much
further<00:03:49.569> towards<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.050> bottom<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.410> this<00:03:50.560> of

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
further towards the bottom of this of

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.620 
further towards the bottom of this of
the<00:03:51.069> sphere<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:51.870> then<00:03:53.940> cut<00:03:54.940> off<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> sides<00:03:55.450> of

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the sphere and then cut off the sides of

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.170 
the sphere and then cut off the sides of
the<00:03:55.690> head<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:56.019> we<00:03:56.140> did<00:03:56.290> before<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
the head like we did before the

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.120 
the head like we did before the
cheekbones<00:03:58.690> are<00:03:59.200> gonna<00:03:59.470> fall<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.739> little<00:03:59.980> bit

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
cheekbones are gonna fall a little bit

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.590 
cheekbones are gonna fall a little bit
below<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.550> sphere<00:04:00.910> since<00:04:01.209> they're<00:04:01.420> gonna

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
below the sphere since they're gonna

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.660 
below the sphere since they're gonna
actually<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:02.019> sticking<00:04:02.410> out<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:03.340> person's

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
actually be sticking out the person's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.309 
actually be sticking out the person's
looking<00:04:03.910> down<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:07.510> course<00:04:07.750> since<00:04:07.959> there's

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
looking down and of course since there's

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.830 
looking down and of course since there's
foreshortening<00:04:09.040> happening<00:04:09.489> the<00:04:10.450> distance

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
foreshortening happening the distance

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.750 
foreshortening happening the distance
between<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.500> brow<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.190> nose<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.400> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
between the brow and the nose and the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.940 
between the brow and the nose and the
chin<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.090> much<00:04:13.569> shorter<00:04:13.810> we'll<00:04:14.560> still<00:04:14.799> keep

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
chin is much shorter we'll still keep

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.770 
chin is much shorter we'll still keep
the<00:04:15.099> same<00:04:15.250> ratio<00:04:15.700> in<00:04:15.819> this<00:04:15.940> case<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.450> the<00:04:16.630> nose

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
the same ratio in this case so the nose

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.960 
the same ratio in this case so the nose
is<00:04:16.989> about<00:04:17.139> half<00:04:17.470> way<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.269> then<00:04:20.669> here<00:04:21.669> we<00:04:21.820> have

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
is about half way and then here we have

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.659 
is about half way and then here we have
the<00:04:22.210> basic<00:04:22.419> guidelines<00:04:23.200> of<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> head<00:04:23.800> also

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
the basic guidelines of the head also

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.830 
the basic guidelines of the head also
with<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.060> ears<00:04:25.240> you<00:04:25.419> can't<00:04:25.600> have<00:04:25.720> to

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
with the ears you can't have to

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840 
with the ears you can't have to
visualize<00:04:26.290> where<00:04:26.500> those<00:04:26.680> lines<00:04:27.040> wrap<00:04:27.490> around

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
visualize where those lines wrap around

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.520 
visualize where those lines wrap around
so<00:04:28.210> the<00:04:28.300> brown<00:04:28.510> line<00:04:28.750> wraps<00:04:29.050> around<00:04:29.200> to<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
so the brown line wraps around to the

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.930 
so the brown line wraps around to the
back<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:30.220> where<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.520> top<00:04:30.700> should

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
back and that's where the top should

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.060 
back and that's where the top should
connect<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.630> where<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.470> nose<00:04:32.620> wraps<00:04:32.919> around

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
connect and where the nose wraps around

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.330 
connect and where the nose wraps around
to<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.580> bottom<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.860> takes<00:04:36.070> just<00:04:36.250> a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
to the bottom and that takes just a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.920 
to the bottom and that takes just a
little<00:04:36.550> bit<00:04:36.640> of<00:04:36.729> practice<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.120> kind<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.570> get<00:04:37.900> a

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
little bit of practice to kind of get a

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.850 
little bit of practice to kind of get a
feel<00:04:38.169> for<00:04:38.380> what<00:04:38.530> looks<00:04:38.740> natural<00:04:43.740> I'll<00:04:44.740> go

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
feel for what looks natural I'll go

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.320 
feel for what looks natural I'll go
ahead<00:04:44.950> and<00:04:45.130> draw<00:04:45.250> out<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> few<00:04:45.669> more<00:04:45.880> details

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
ahead and draw out a few more details

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.350 
ahead and draw out a few more details
here<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.930> nose<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.380> brow<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.360> kind

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
here so the nose and the brow and kind

00:04:49.360 --> 00:05:13.070 
here so the nose and the brow and kind
of<00:04:49.390> indicate<00:04:49.780> where<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.110> eye<00:04:50.140> should<00:04:50.289> be

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.360 

okay<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:14.140> let's<00:05:14.440> draw<00:05:14.620> a<00:05:14.650> different<00:05:15.010> head<00:05:15.160> here

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
okay so let's draw a different head here

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.280 
okay so let's draw a different head here
this<00:05:15.550> one<00:05:15.760> will<00:05:15.910> make<00:05:16.090> looking<00:05:16.900> Kenneth

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
this one will make looking Kenneth

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.950 
this one will make looking Kenneth
upward<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.670> so<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.180> crossbar<00:05:19.630> is<00:05:19.750> gonna

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
upward and so the crossbar is gonna

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.600 
upward and so the crossbar is gonna
start<00:05:20.260> at<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.440> top<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.860> circle<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.430> wrap

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
start at the top of the circle and wrap

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.650 
start at the top of the circle and wrap
around<00:05:21.810> down<00:05:22.810> and<00:05:23.320> then<00:05:23.470> our<00:05:23.650> horizontal<00:05:24.250> line

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
around down and then our horizontal line

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.160 
around down and then our horizontal line
that<00:05:25.660> indicates<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.410> face<00:05:26.740> plane<00:05:27.130> is<00:05:28.170> going

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
that indicates the face plane is going

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.250 
that indicates the face plane is going
to<00:05:29.290> be<00:05:29.470> at<00:05:29.590> an<00:05:29.680> angle<00:05:29.800> facing<00:05:30.340> upward<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:32.110> I'll

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
to be at an angle facing upward and I'll

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.280 
to be at an angle facing upward and I'll
still<00:05:32.530> divide<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.430> chin<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:33.850> nose

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
still divide for the chin and the nose

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.540 
still divide for the chin and the nose
like<00:05:35.290> we<00:05:35.440> did<00:05:35.590> before<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.780> then<00:05:37.780> of<00:05:38.020> course

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
like we did before and then of course

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.920 
like we did before and then of course
chop<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.730> side<00:05:39.940> of<00:05:40.090> the<00:05:40.180> sphere<00:05:40.240> off<00:05:40.630> for<00:05:40.840> the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
chop the side of the sphere off for the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.350 
chop the side of the sphere off for the
skull<00:05:41.170> to<00:05:41.500> flatten<00:05:41.830> out<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.070> head<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:43.240> draw

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
skull to flatten out the head and draw

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.760 
skull to flatten out the head and draw
our<00:05:43.480> side<00:05:43.660> guide<00:05:43.930> line<00:05:44.140> or<00:05:44.290> the<00:05:44.410> jaw<00:05:44.590> will

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
our side guide line or the jaw will

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.300 
our side guide line or the jaw will
connect<00:05:45.390> and<00:05:46.390> you<00:05:47.230> can<00:05:47.410> see<00:05:47.590> using<00:05:47.740> those<00:05:48.040> same

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
connect and you can see using those same

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.510 
connect and you can see using those same
basic<00:05:49.080> simple<00:05:50.080> lines<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.470> start<00:05:50.680> with<00:05:50.830> I've

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
basic simple lines to start with I've

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.290 
basic simple lines to start with I've
really<00:05:51.910> quickly<00:05:52.300> drawn<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.940> head<00:05:54.940> looking

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
really quickly drawn a head looking

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.090 
really quickly drawn a head looking
upward<00:05:55.660> I'll<00:05:56.440> go<00:05:56.560> ahead<00:05:56.650> and<00:05:56.830> fill<00:05:56.950> out<00:05:57.070> some

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
upward I'll go ahead and fill out some

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.430 
upward I'll go ahead and fill out some
details<00:05:57.610> on<00:05:57.730> this<00:05:57.880> one<00:05:58.060> as<00:05:58.180> well<00:05:58.390> notice<00:05:59.260> where

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
details on this one as well notice where

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.200 
details on this one as well notice where
the<00:05:59.470> ear<00:05:59.740> connects<00:06:00.190> at<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.700> top<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.060> brow

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
the ear connects at the top of the brow

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.810 
the ear connects at the top of the brow
bottom<00:06:01.690> of<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.900> nose

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
bottom of the nose

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.910 
bottom of the nose
how<00:06:04.600> the<00:06:04.660> chin<00:06:04.960> connects<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.470> the<00:06:05.560> side<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.860> the

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
how the chin connects to the side of the

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:22.560 
how the chin connects to the side of the
head<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:06.970> so<00:06:07.660> on

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.260 

now<00:06:23.560> kind<00:06:24.220> of<00:06:24.310> knowing<00:06:24.550> how<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.700> draw<00:06:24.940> some<00:06:25.180> of

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
now kind of knowing how to draw some of

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.670 
now kind of knowing how to draw some of
these<00:06:25.360> details<00:06:25.840> might<00:06:26.110> be<00:06:26.260> a<00:06:26.290> little<00:06:26.470> bit

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
these details might be a little bit

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.700 
these details might be a little bit
tricky<00:06:27.070> to<00:06:27.100> people<00:06:27.790> who<00:06:27.880> are<00:06:28.000> new<00:06:28.150> to<00:06:28.180> drawing

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
tricky to people who are new to drawing

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.140 
tricky to people who are new to drawing
and<00:06:29.710> so<00:06:29.920> I'll<00:06:30.040> make<00:06:30.220> this<00:06:30.490> final<00:06:30.940> image

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
and so I'll make this final image

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.580 
and so I'll make this final image
available<00:06:31.810> for<00:06:31.990> you<00:06:32.050> to<00:06:32.140> look<00:06:32.260> at<00:06:32.440> as<00:06:32.560> a

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
available for you to look at as a

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.950 
available for you to look at as a
reference<00:06:32.980> if<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.160> want<00:06:33.400> but<00:06:34.360> of<00:06:34.450> course<00:06:34.720> it's

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
reference if you want but of course it's

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.630 
reference if you want but of course it's
always<00:06:35.110> great<00:06:35.440> to<00:06:35.620> look<00:06:35.770> at<00:06:35.890> real<00:06:36.100> life<00:06:36.130> to

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
always great to look at real life to

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.120 
always great to look at real life to
take<00:06:37.000> photographs<00:06:37.240> and<00:06:37.900> use<00:06:38.200> other<00:06:38.470> images<00:06:38.980> to

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
take photographs and use other images to

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.040 
take photographs and use other images to
help<00:06:39.160> you<00:06:39.430> get<00:06:40.060> a<00:06:40.090> feel<00:06:40.330> for<00:06:40.390> what<00:06:40.690> the<00:06:40.780> human

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
help you get a feel for what the human

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.530 
help you get a feel for what the human
form<00:06:41.260> looks<00:06:41.440> like<00:06:41.850> and<00:06:42.850> we'll<00:06:42.970> draw<00:06:43.120> our<00:06:43.150> last

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
form looks like and we'll draw our last

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.190 
form looks like and we'll draw our last
head<00:06:45.030> kind<00:06:46.030> of<00:06:46.120> looking<00:06:46.450> down<00:06:46.480> and<00:06:46.930> add<00:06:46.990> in<00:06:47.110> a

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
head kind of looking down and add in a

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.320 
head kind of looking down and add in a
different<00:06:47.560> angle<00:06:47.680> here<00:06:48.040> so<00:06:48.250> you<00:06:48.790> can<00:06:49.000> see<00:06:49.180> I've

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
different angle here so you can see I've

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.960 
different angle here so you can see I've
drawn<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:49.630> cross<00:06:49.840> bar<00:06:50.140> the<00:06:50.830> horizontal<00:06:51.430> bar

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
drawn the cross bar the horizontal bar

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.220 
drawn the cross bar the horizontal bar
for<00:06:52.240> the<00:06:52.300> face<00:06:52.480> and<00:06:53.940> divided<00:06:54.940> the<00:06:55.060> skull<00:06:55.300> and

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
for the face and divided the skull and

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.030 
for the face and divided the skull and
I'm<00:06:57.130> gonna<00:06:57.250> go<00:06:57.430> ahead<00:06:57.490> and<00:06:57.610> connect<00:06:57.970> the<00:06:58.030> chin

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
I'm gonna go ahead and connect the chin

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.350 
I'm gonna go ahead and connect the chin
and<00:07:00.040> you'll<00:07:00.430> notice<00:07:00.580> these<00:07:00.850> I've<00:07:01.090> gotten<00:07:01.330> a

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
and you'll notice these I've gotten a

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.310 
and you'll notice these I've gotten a
little<00:07:01.420> bit<00:07:01.630> quicker<00:07:01.840> as<00:07:01.960> I've<00:07:02.110> gone<00:07:04.080> it<00:07:05.080> just

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
little bit quicker as I've gone it just

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.540 
little bit quicker as I've gone it just
seems<00:07:05.560> to<00:07:05.680> happen<00:07:05.800> that<00:07:06.070> way<00:07:06.190> you<00:07:06.250> know<00:07:06.490> you

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:06.550 
seems to happen that way you know you

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.610 
seems to happen that way you know you
get<00:07:06.760> into<00:07:07.030> the<00:07:07.090> rhythm<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:08.230> you<00:07:08.380> start

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
get into the rhythm and you start

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.070 
get into the rhythm and you start
drawing<00:07:08.920> these<00:07:09.100> and<00:07:09.580> it<00:07:10.240> gets<00:07:10.390> easier<00:07:10.900> and

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
drawing these and it gets easier and

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.260 
drawing these and it gets easier and
easier<00:07:11.170> and<00:07:11.470> quicker<00:07:11.620> and<00:07:12.460> so<00:07:12.670> I<00:07:12.700> recommend<00:07:13.180> as

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.270 
easier and quicker and so I recommend as

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.090 
easier and quicker and so I recommend as
you<00:07:13.390> practice<00:07:13.840> you<00:07:14.170> do<00:07:14.290> the<00:07:14.410> same<00:07:14.620> thing<00:07:14.920> that

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
you practice you do the same thing that

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.370 
you practice you do the same thing that
you<00:07:15.250> do<00:07:15.970> it<00:07:16.120> over<00:07:16.420> and<00:07:16.450> over<00:07:16.630> try<00:07:17.110> it<00:07:17.170> from

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
you do it over and over try it from

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.680 
you do it over and over try it from
different<00:07:17.530> angles<00:07:17.800> and<00:07:18.400> this<00:07:19.180> is<00:07:19.360> something

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
different angles and this is something

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.040 
different angles and this is something
that<00:07:19.720> you<00:07:19.900> could<00:07:20.050> do<00:07:20.260> every<00:07:21.040> day<00:07:21.190> for<00:07:21.930> you<00:07:22.930> know

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.050 
that you could do every day for you know

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.870 
that you could do every day for you know
as<00:07:23.290> long<00:07:23.470> as<00:07:23.530> you<00:07:23.770> want<00:07:23.980> until<00:07:24.100> you<00:07:24.340> really<00:07:24.610> get

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
as long as you want until you really get

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.640 
as long as you want until you really get
good<00:07:25.000> at<00:07:25.180> it<00:07:25.210> and<00:07:25.840> it's<00:07:25.990> something<00:07:26.170> that<00:07:26.410> I<00:07:26.440> had

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
good at it and it's something that I had

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.800 
good at it and it's something that I had
to<00:07:26.680> come<00:07:26.890> back<00:07:27.070> to<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.460> practice<00:07:27.880> and<00:07:28.150> and

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
to come back to and practice and and

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.230 
to come back to and practice and and
make<00:07:29.290> sure<00:07:29.470> that<00:07:29.620> I'm<00:07:29.800> doing<00:07:30.240> things

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 
make sure that I'm doing things

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.530 
make sure that I'm doing things
correctly<00:07:31.830> and<00:07:32.830> it's<00:07:33.610> definitely<00:07:34.000> not<00:07:34.240> a<00:07:34.300> bad

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540 
correctly and it's definitely not a bad

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.230 
correctly and it's definitely not a bad
thing<00:07:34.810> to<00:07:35.050> use<00:07:35.230> these<00:07:35.500> guidelines<00:07:35.800> or<00:07:36.460> to<00:07:36.940> you

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
thing to use these guidelines or to you

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.580 
thing to use these guidelines or to you
know<00:07:37.360> start<00:07:37.630> by<00:07:37.780> drawing<00:07:37.960> those<00:07:38.290> simple

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:38.590 
know start by drawing those simple

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.540 
know start by drawing those simple
shapes<00:07:38.830> in<00:07:39.250> fact<00:07:40.500> most<00:07:41.500> people<00:07:41.650> do<00:07:42.040> that<00:07:42.220> you

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:42.550 
shapes in fact most people do that you

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.190 
shapes in fact most people do that you
know<00:07:42.670> experienced<00:07:43.300> artists<00:07:43.660> will<00:07:43.780> continue

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.200 
know experienced artists will continue

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:45.840 
know experienced artists will continue
to<00:07:44.290> do<00:07:44.440> that<00:07:44.620> because<00:07:44.920> it<00:07:45.280> just<00:07:45.310> gives<00:07:45.550> a<00:07:45.700> good

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:45.850 
to do that because it just gives a good

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.300 
to do that because it just gives a good
foundation<00:07:46.290> it<00:07:47.290> allows<00:07:47.710> you<00:07:47.890> to<00:07:47.980> check<00:07:48.190> your

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:48.310 
foundation it allows you to check your

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.890 
foundation it allows you to check your
proportions<00:07:48.910> and<00:07:49.180> make<00:07:49.360> sure<00:07:49.480> everything's

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900 
proportions and make sure everything's

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.020 
proportions and make sure everything's
lined<00:07:50.110> up<00:07:50.380> the<00:07:50.500> way<00:07:50.590> it<00:07:50.650> should<00:07:50.710> be<00:07:51.010> before<00:07:51.730> you

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.030 
lined up the way it should be before you

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.470 
lined up the way it should be before you
go<00:07:52.180> and<00:07:52.360> finish<00:07:52.540> your<00:07:52.780> drawing<00:07:53.020> and<00:07:54.030> so<00:07:55.030> here

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:55.480
