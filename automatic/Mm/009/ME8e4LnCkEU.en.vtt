00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello friends welcome to a chapter 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.809
 more of this in training in this 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.940
 case we will see the advanced flat pass to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.600
 legend level for this exercise 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.279
 Xabi Alonso will use in the center 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.490
 this is a pretty complicated exercise 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.259
 It takes a long time to do it 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.419
 so I leave this video because I think 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.269
 that can be quite useful to me what 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.710
 it served me was to play by the sides as 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.900
 can see in the video only 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.120
 I'm when the left side almost does not 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.360
 I'm going to the right side too 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.790
 I discovered that if you give the passes with the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.780
 colors of the side is much easier 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 because the defenses 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.460
 tend to go towards the center then 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.620
 it leaves you very good space to be able 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.500
 pass between the sides without there 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.280
 no problem these passes i am 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.950
 coming up with the elevate button and the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020
 center 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.910
 very little I let you press the button 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.550
 to make it a fairly small center 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.000
 if they realize also if they can give 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.490
 the center almost almost directly what the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.610
 receive is good the term is essential 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.130
 in this exercise since tape m the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.830
 defenses arrive they take away the ball is a 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.420
 really complicated exercise here I continue 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.080
 passing it on the sides as they can 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.930
 see and if the score is for a pass 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.000
 elevated is at 400 points a pass 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.640
 direct as regards the receipt you get 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.619
 200 and if you stop her if you pass her give you 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.800
 100 points then basically what 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.050
 let's look is to give high passes that 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.090
 is the most important thing and how can you see 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.920
 on the right side I'm practically not 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.410
 I'm playing it with the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.360
 bale side with me is almost almost 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.860
 it goes and it's horrible because you have to 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.530
 start from scratch and you have to do 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.380
 really many points if they achieve 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.360
 mastering the technique will be very easy 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.450
 that they can achieve it once they know 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.310
 how the ball is passed there finished the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.580
 exercise and then we end up in this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.670
 case with 20 thousand 700 points 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.410
 but with this technique I achieved a record 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.360
 worldwide so friends already know 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 add to my social networks any 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.370
 I can definitely answer and see you in 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.370
 the next
