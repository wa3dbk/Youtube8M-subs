00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.650
 hello I'm local frames and I come with another 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.610
 tutorial 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 in this video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.960
 melody of light is a nation but it is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.950
 as to more or less know how to touch light 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.950
 that would sound like that 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.250
 Y 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.630
 that can be repeated when you 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.630
 want the nations only day 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:55.149
 well the song goes like this 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.980
 first on the sixth string twice at 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.660
 air 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 after the second fret 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 dragging in the fourth fret 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.250
 when I played the fourth fret I wanted 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.799
 after 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.320
 they go down the fifth string and they play two 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.150
 times 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.360
 after the fourth fret the fifth 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 rope other times and then go down 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 in the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.310
 will organize the fifth 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.350
 then they are in the fourth 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.350
 and playing months on the floor 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.830
 well then bench to back would be 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.130
 after the child 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.930
 they play in the in the fourth of the fifth two 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.020
 times after the second fret of the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.710
 fifth for another time 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.390
 and then instead of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.200
 to start with this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.200
 they are going to do 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.380
 we loved you 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 well that twice after they 're going to go to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.739
 be the same only as a rope down 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.739
 then it would be 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.740
 if all alone with a garlic cap 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.090
 do the same with start fifth 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.250
 will remember and twice drag the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.790
 fourth of the fifth string after down 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.880
 on the fourth string twice the second 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.470
 tank then in the room and then two 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.900
 times on the third string of the second 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.620
 fret 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.620
