00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.690
 jean-louis the formula 1 arrives for the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.420
 very first time in russia then 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 why this chi well because there is 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
 a possible identity with the site that has 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.449
 hosted the Olympic Games 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.640
 and so that's very important that's the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.410
 first thing secondly this is the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.619
 site I would say tourist by 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.359
 excellence of russia and sochi with 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 jo is a name and in this case 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.189
 when we have a name well we keep it 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.910
 and I believe that the route was planned 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 to snake it was you who had it 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.460
 says geraldine through everything that has 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 been the Olympic site 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 so this is a name but this announcement has 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 the air we do not know much 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.399
 sochi but on the side of Russia 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.899
 everyone knows the name of this 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.730
 place and in this case so that's it 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 that's for them as it looks 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.170
 could say nice or monaco level and 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.129
 well expect that the Russians are 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.859
 fans of this discipline 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.840
 we do not know we do not know what is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.789
 sure is that everyone expects 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.790
 to see Vladimir Putin land himself 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.010
 and that we did not let him go when 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 poutine moves in russia a lot of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.080
 people are moving around and I think that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.420
 curiosity will make it public and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.790
 that there will be public I remember 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.159
 Hungary when we landed the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 died in 1986 so it was already it was 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.390
 still halo iron curtain there was a 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.920
 Giant curiosity around these formula 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.140
 1 what was this world 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.310
 we do not know of course that in Russia 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.900
 we know the world of cars even 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.799
 sports cars but that's 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.299
 still a world apart 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.640
 and so I think there will be a 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.680
 craze for daniel 4.6 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.780
 maybe surely for danielle catala 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.759
 I'm suspicious because you remember 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
 that there had been petrov worrying russian 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.810
 and who ran and it did not look 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.960
 at all to interest the streets otherwise 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.899
 it's true you know I worked at 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.540
 that time along with tf1 and 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.049
 self more for the Russian vogue the big 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.280
 magazine 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.500
 and yes you hang them at all 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.729
 from petrov it was for the not terrible 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.040
 at all they wanted to hear about 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.390
 stars so good we'll see and 4 4 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.369
 it's different because we know very well 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.600
 although he will climb at red bull 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.410
 renault so is still a great 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.630
 team and that's maybe going to spark 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.190
 a craze for the public we know jean 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.930
 louis and sochi but this is one of the most 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.100
 great circuits of the season with the 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.630
 belgium and silverstone 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.670
 how do the complete teams have 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.170
 could get ready and how pirelli is going 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 does he do for his tires 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.250
 so already peerally they will spend his 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.020
 sins they did not take the hardest 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.570
 but they took the hard means and the 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.680
 hard and not the extra hard but because 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.060
 we have to be careful this is the 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.830
 first thing the second thing the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.990
 teams have sent people to the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.370
 measures for example we have all the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.430
 teams did simulations on 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.470
 computer with drawing the cameras 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.820
 video the exact length and when j of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.920
 exact length is measuring with a 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 little roulette it's not like that 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.150
 10 meters no it's very very precise and 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.830
 so on this map we will see the circuit 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.970
 he himself told you he meanders 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.260
 in the facilities 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.790
 I see that already there are two zones of drs 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.530
 which one in a curve is a little 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 weird but finally we'll see 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.750
 there is a very big bend of the bend 2 3 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.580
 4 which is a very big left turn 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.350
 even worse than the one who adventure that 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.700
 you remember on the super feather 8 is 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.900
 so there it can create worries 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.850
 in any case the two zones of drs 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.320
 should favor overruns for 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.730
 the rest one girl is what we can say 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.740
 that sebastian vettel is advantageous 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.180
 since he inaugurated this trip yes then 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.980
 did not at all not because 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.959
 when we saw the positions of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.190
 infiniti and despite all respect I 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.230
 door to infiniti the car was like 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.400
 that's because vettel is amused so I 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.340
 do not think it's giving him 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.900
 exact sensations of what he will have with 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.280
 his red bull renault sas and the 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.570
 first thing the second thing it's 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.770
 that a production car has nothing to 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.959
 see with a race car and 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.310
 especially a formula 1 statistically one 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.380
 know it's a world alonso is 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.480
 always the best 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.190
 he still holds yes because his 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.180
 experience does he have I want to talk 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.190
 vulgarly of the pifometer 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.900
 he sees things very well that's 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.510
 experience the knowledge of the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.430
 knowledge car of asphalt he 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.780
 will have it well check all this is good 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.160
 sure he can pull himself out of the game 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.380
 but he will not be the only one 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.420
 at mercedes we had spies too 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.220
 we know very well at hamilton as 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.420
 at rosberg started doing all that and in 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.280
 the occurrence so we can wait for them 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.750
 again again I'm selling said 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.730
 jean-louis to finish on hope 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.650
 ferrari whose state of health 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.420
 currently and is in parentheses 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.100
 it's jules bianchi is what you have 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.690
 news to bring us on 10 no 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.250
 the news is 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.570
 bad because his condition gets worse 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.600
 you have to say things like that 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.600
 are 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.670
 it would be lying on our part to say 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.560
 that we find it in formula 1 I do not 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.060
 absolutely do not believe and that he will 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.550
 should be expected in the hours that 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.680
 follow to a gag nastic doctors 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.820
 what will it be we do not know anything yet 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.130
 last night on canal + 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.020
 we are talking so it's Thursday 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.750
 we did the specialists and and 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.300
 we are content to talk about jules 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.950
 not in the past but in the present but 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.080
 without giving hope either 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.580
 was going to see again to play in the race so I 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.370
 know that the whole family now is 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.380
 gathered around him and that it will be necessary 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.760
 make an up-to-date decision of what 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.680
 what we have to do 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.330
 doctors this morning he was operated on a 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.770
 again we have not yet 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.770
 of results no news at all 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.970
 case is so good I think we are on 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.970
 is doomed to wait
