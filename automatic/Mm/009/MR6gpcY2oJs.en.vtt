beetle on cutters these cutters are used

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.920 
beetle on cutters these cutters are used
for<00:00:09.049> cutting<00:00:09.680> all<00:00:09.920> types<00:00:10.219> of<00:00:10.400> wires<00:00:10.930> there's

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
for cutting all types of wires there's

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.959 
for cutting all types of wires there's
the<00:00:12.199> two<00:00:12.590> types<00:00:12.830> I'd<00:00:13.039> like<00:00:13.190> to<00:00:13.309> show<00:00:13.520> you<00:00:13.549> today

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
the two types I'd like to show you today

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.720 
the two types I'd like to show you today
are<00:00:14.150> flush<00:00:15.080> cutters<00:00:15.469> and<00:00:15.500> semi<00:00:16.070> flush<00:00:16.340> cutters

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
are flush cutters and semi flush cutters

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.509 
are flush cutters and semi flush cutters
a<00:00:16.970> flush<00:00:17.779> cutter<00:00:18.080> is<00:00:18.609> a<00:00:19.990> cutter<00:00:20.990> that<00:00:21.259> has<00:00:21.519> the

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
a flush cutter is a cutter that has the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.849 
a flush cutter is a cutter that has the
opposite<00:00:23.029> side<00:00:23.240> which<00:00:23.539> is<00:00:23.839> where<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.529> metal

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
opposite side which is where the metal

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.179 
opposite side which is where the metal
is<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:25.429> the<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.939> cut<00:00:26.230> here<00:00:27.230> is<00:00:27.410> at<00:00:27.619> a<00:00:27.650> higher

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
is and the the cut here is at a higher

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.640 
is and the the cut here is at a higher
angle<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:28.939> this<00:00:29.179> is<00:00:29.359> at<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.509> flush<00:00:29.869> cut<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.499> it's

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
angle and this is at a flush cut so it's

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.229 
angle and this is at a flush cut so it's
so<00:00:31.339> when<00:00:31.519> this<00:00:31.699> cuts<00:00:32.090> in<00:00:32.480> one<00:00:33.320> direction<00:00:34.239> such

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
so when this cuts in one direction such

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.460 
so when this cuts in one direction such
as<00:00:35.420> here<00:00:36.130> this<00:00:37.130> portion<00:00:37.460> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.660> cut<00:00:38.840> is<00:00:39.050> flat

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
as here this portion of the cut is flat

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.910 
as here this portion of the cut is flat
and<00:00:39.800> what's<00:00:40.550> left<00:00:40.790> over<00:00:41.000> has<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:42.140> peak<00:00:42.470> to<00:00:42.770> it

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
and what's left over has a peak to it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.080 
and what's left over has a peak to it
and<00:00:43.160> that<00:00:43.790> peak<00:00:44.060> is<00:00:44.240> is<00:00:44.510> shown<00:00:45.170> right<00:00:45.680> there

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
and that peak is is shown right there

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.360 
and that peak is is shown right there
and<00:00:47.410> the<00:00:48.410> other<00:00:48.530> side<00:00:48.770> is<00:00:49.040> is<00:00:49.310> flush<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.850> course

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
and the other side is is flush of course

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.770 
and the other side is is flush of course
we<00:00:52.370> have<00:00:52.490> three<00:00:52.760> types<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.180> flush<00:00:53.390> cutters

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
we have three types of flush cutters

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.350 
we have three types of flush cutters
there's<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.710> economy<00:00:55.670> version<00:00:56.060> which<00:00:56.210> we

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
there's the economy version which we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.700 
there's the economy version which we
call<00:00:56.600> a<00:00:56.630> nipper<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.730> we<00:00:58.730> also<00:00:58.880> have<00:00:59.270> a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
call a nipper and we also have a

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.560 
call a nipper and we also have a
professional<00:01:00.710> nipper<00:01:01.030> which<00:01:02.030> is<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.360> one

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
professional nipper which is this one

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.990 
professional nipper which is this one
with<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.870> green<00:01:03.020> handles<00:01:03.530> again<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.460> flush

will you want a semi flush cutter and
what<00:02:00.679> that<00:02:00.859> is<00:02:01.100> is<00:02:01.549> where<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.329> angle<00:02:02.779> of<00:02:02.990> the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
what that is is where the angle of the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.550 
what that is is where the angle of the
flush<00:02:03.499> cutters<00:02:03.859> is<00:02:04.130> about<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:08.560> semi

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
flush cutters is about this the semi

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.449 
flush cutters is about this the semi
flush<00:02:09.800> cutter<00:02:10.100> has<00:02:10.340> an<00:02:10.520> additional<00:02:12.010> cut<00:02:13.010> going

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
flush cutter has an additional cut going

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.530 
flush cutter has an additional cut going
this<00:02:13.640> direction<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:14.299> this

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
this direction on this

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.759 
this direction on this
I<00:02:14.569> think<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.959> can<00:02:15.110> see<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.379> pretty<00:02:15.590> well

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
I think you can see it pretty well

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.240 
I think you can see it pretty well
there's<00:02:16.549> a<00:02:16.670> nice<00:02:17.140> indent<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:18.439> instead<00:02:19.189> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
there's a nice indent so instead of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.640 
there's a nice indent so instead of
being<00:02:19.489> flushed<00:02:19.790> there's<00:02:20.359> an<00:02:20.540> additional<00:02:21.049> cut

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
being flushed there's an additional cut

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.179 
being flushed there's an additional cut
on<00:02:21.829> either<00:02:22.129> side<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.390> sharp<00:02:23.689> edge

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
on either side so that the sharp edge

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.910 
on either side so that the sharp edge
has<00:02:25.189> more<00:02:25.579> backing<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.629> it's<00:02:27.019> got<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> wider

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
has more backing so it's got a wider

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.410 
has more backing so it's got a wider
angle<00:02:28.870> leading<00:02:29.870> up<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.019> the<00:02:30.319> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:32.180> peak

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
angle leading up to the to the the peak

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.020 
angle leading up to the to the the peak
that's<00:02:32.659> going<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.769> cutting<00:02:34.099> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
that's going to be to the cutting so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.339 
that's going to be to the cutting so
there<00:02:35.180> are<00:02:35.239> several<00:02:35.450> different<00:02:35.569> sizes<00:02:36.079> of

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
there are several different sizes of

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.670 
there are several different sizes of
these<00:02:36.560> cutters<00:02:38.019> though<00:02:39.019> they<00:02:39.319> all<00:02:39.470> work

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
these cutters though they all work

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.890 
these cutters though they all work
pretty<00:02:39.709> much<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.250> same<00:02:40.489> except<00:02:41.480> for<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.689> one

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
pretty much the same except for this one

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.490 
pretty much the same except for this one
this<00:02:42.439> one<00:02:42.709> has<00:02:42.980> if<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.609> can<00:02:43.730> see<00:02:43.909> that<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
this one has if you can see that the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.099 
this one has if you can see that the
edges<00:02:45.500> have<00:02:46.280> been<00:02:46.420> heat-treated<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:48.019> an

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
edges have been heat-treated it's an

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.379 
edges have been heat-treated it's an
induction<00:02:48.500> heat<00:02:49.069> treatment<00:02:49.609> that<00:02:50.090> makes

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:50.389 
induction heat treatment that makes

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.949 
induction heat treatment that makes
these<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:51.560> tips<00:02:51.799> very<00:02:52.129> very<00:02:52.400> hard<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:53.780> is

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
these the tips very very hard so this is

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.759 
these the tips very very hard so this is
the<00:02:54.079> only<00:02:54.549> cutter<00:02:55.689> in<00:02:56.689> this<00:02:57.019> type<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.319> cutter

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
the only cutter in this type of cutter

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.539 
the only cutter in this type of cutter
that<00:02:58.400> can<00:02:58.609> cut<00:02:58.849> memory<00:02:59.269> wire<00:02:59.480> and<00:02:59.780> other<00:03:00.650> steel

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
that can cut memory wire and other steel

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.089 
that can cut memory wire and other steel
wires<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.139> very<00:03:03.439> good<00:03:03.620> production

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
wires so this is a very good production

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.929 
wires so this is a very good production
cutter<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:06.109> can<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.650> used<00:03:06.919> for<00:03:07.280> many<00:03:07.760> many

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:07.939 
cutter that can be used for many many

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.490 
cutter that can be used for many many
different<00:03:08.299> things<00:03:08.329> all<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.109> others<00:03:09.379> should

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
different things all the others should

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.190 
different things all the others should
be<00:03:09.560> used<00:03:09.889> with<00:03:10.099> beetling<00:03:10.819> wires<00:03:11.120> and<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:12.019> of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
be used with beetling wires and all of

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.280 
be used with beetling wires and all of
the<00:03:12.349> artistic<00:03:12.889> wires<00:03:13.510> as<00:03:14.510> well<00:03:14.569> as<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.989> German

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the artistic wires as well as the German

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.610 
the artistic wires as well as the German
style<00:03:15.439> wires<00:03:15.970> so<00:03:16.970> we've<00:03:17.450> learned<00:03:17.720> about<00:03:17.870> flush

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
style wires so we've learned about flush

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.059 
style wires so we've learned about flush
cutting<00:03:18.979> and<00:03:19.190> also<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.090> semi<00:03:20.299> flush<00:03:20.540> cutters

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
cutting and also the semi flush cutters

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.610 
cutting and also the semi flush cutters
always<00:03:22.069> choose<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.669> proper<00:03:23.150> cutter<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:24.560> the

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
always choose the proper cutter for the

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.639 
always choose the proper cutter for the
work<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.040> you'll<00:03:25.370> be<00:03:25.489> doing
