 very much dissatisfaction 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.270
 we are setting ourselves up for everything that is 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:49.240
 type of material to be supplied 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.920
 emptiness that fills nothing we go to 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.370

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.360
 Happiness on the shelves but we came back 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.870
 frustrated with the full car and a 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.870
 empty 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.580
 never has man had so much access to 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.410
 God is like now and has never been so 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.640
 the violence that spreads consumerism 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.970
 which generates social differences as 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.910
 brutal and nothing jealous 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:54.880
