00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.939 
corruption so I'm bringing you a
corruption<00:00:28.750> match<00:00:29.110> I<00:00:29.440> played<00:00:29.800> some

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
corruption match I played some

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.130 
corruption match I played some
corruption<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.520> other<00:00:30.670> day<00:00:30.900> seeing<00:00:31.900> what

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
corruption the other day seeing what

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.560 
corruption the other day seeing what
type<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.489> matches<00:00:33.489> I<00:00:33.580> could<00:00:33.760> get<00:00:33.879> in<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.360> in

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
type of matches I could get in and in

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.710 
type of matches I could get in and in
this<00:00:34.720> match<00:00:34.900> I'm<00:00:35.140> using<00:00:35.350> morph<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.100> smoke<00:00:36.720> the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
this match I'm using morph and smoke the

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.720 
this match I'm using morph and smoke the
main<00:00:37.870> reason<00:00:38.170> for<00:00:38.320> this<00:00:38.410> because<00:00:38.770> I'm<00:00:39.129> on<00:00:39.340> sook

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
main reason for this because I'm on sook

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.950 
main reason for this because I'm on sook
and<00:00:40.890> sook<00:00:41.890> is<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.820> ground<00:00:43.180> map<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.600> has<00:00:43.720> no

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
and sook is a ground map that has no

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.110 
and sook is a ground map that has no
roofs<00:00:44.290> so<00:00:44.739> there's<00:00:45.010> really<00:00:45.220> no<00:00:45.430> reason<00:00:45.730> for<00:00:45.910> me

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
roofs so there's really no reason for me

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.080 
roofs so there's really no reason for me
to<00:00:46.149> take<00:00:46.390> throwing<00:00:46.780> knives<00:00:47.579> otherwise<00:00:48.579> I

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
to take throwing knives otherwise I

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.120 
to take throwing knives otherwise I
might<00:00:49.420> have<00:00:49.630> or<00:00:50.410> I<00:00:50.440> might<00:00:50.649> have<00:00:50.770> just<00:00:50.950> taken

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
might have or I might have just taken

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.560 
might have or I might have just taken
smoke<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.149> mute<00:00:52.570> or<00:00:52.899> something<00:00:53.260> like<00:00:53.500> that

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
smoke and mute or something like that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.900 
smoke and mute or something like that
this<00:00:55.570> games<00:00:55.840> pretty<00:00:56.020> intense<00:00:56.829> I've<00:00:57.579> had<00:00:57.700> some

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
so yeah not really interested in playing

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.430 
so yeah not really interested in playing
competitive<00:01:24.880> corruption<00:01:25.479> but<00:01:25.630> if<00:01:25.780> I<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:25.929> at

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
competitive corruption but if I do at

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.050 
competitive corruption but if I do at
some<00:01:26.709> point<00:01:26.740> place<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.429> competitive

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
some point place in competitive

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.059 
some point place in competitive
corruption<00:01:28.660> then<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.319> will<00:01:29.500> probably<00:01:29.709> put<00:01:29.890> it

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
corruption then I will probably put it

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.669 
corruption then I will probably put it
up<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:31.450> was<00:01:31.539> pretty<00:01:31.690> funny<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.200> guy<00:01:32.349> tried

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
up that was pretty funny that guy tried

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.639 
up that was pretty funny that guy tried
to<00:01:32.729> morph<00:01:33.729> my<00:01:34.119> group<00:01:34.450> offensively<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.530> then

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
to morph my group offensively and then

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:36.120 
to morph my group offensively and then
kill<00:01:35.890> me

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
kill me

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.089 
kill me
that's<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.720> might<00:01:37.899> work<00:01:38.110> but<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.560> mean<00:01:38.979> it

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:39.099 
that's it might work but I mean it

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.559 
that's it might work but I mean it
didn't<00:01:39.310> work<00:01:39.459> there<00:01:39.700> because<00:01:39.880> as<00:01:40.149> soon<00:01:40.300> as<00:01:40.420> he

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
didn't work there because as soon as he

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.460 
didn't work there because as soon as he
popped<00:01:41.050> his<00:01:41.170> more<00:01:41.470> if<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.590> just<00:01:41.800> stunned<00:01:42.009> him<00:01:42.130> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
popped his more if I just stunned him so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.630 
popped his more if I just stunned him so
as<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.590> can<00:01:44.709> see<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:44.890> just<00:01:44.950> came<00:01:45.220> into<00:01:45.399> sudden

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
as you can see I just came into sudden

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.550 
as you can see I just came into sudden
death<00:01:46.000> and<00:01:46.300> this<00:01:46.630> is<00:01:46.780> where<00:01:46.929> it<00:01:47.020> gets<00:01:47.110> intense

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
death and this is where it gets intense

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.940 
death and this is where it gets intense
and<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:47.950> almost<00:01:48.190> got<00:01:48.429> shot<00:01:48.759> there<00:01:49.000> but<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.450> didn't

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and I almost got shot there but I didn't

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.740 
and I almost got shot there but I didn't
drop<00:01:50.950> my<00:01:51.099> smoke<00:01:51.369> here<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.670> see<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.179> lure<00:01:52.390> there

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
drop my smoke here I see the lure there

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.930 
drop my smoke here I see the lure there
I<00:01:53.110> go<00:01:53.709> for<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:53.979> guy<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.429> stun<00:01:54.700> on<00:01:54.789> him

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
I go for this guy to get a stun on him

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.969 
I go for this guy to get a stun on him
because<00:01:55.239> I<00:01:55.270> know<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.929> he<00:01:56.229> cannot<00:01:56.530> kill<00:01:56.830> me

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
because I know that he cannot kill me

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.510 
because I know that he cannot kill me
because<00:01:57.280> he<00:01:57.580> just<00:01:57.759> gave<00:01:57.910> me<00:01:57.940> a<00:01:58.060> lure<00:01:59.459> now<00:02:00.459> I'm

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
which hoop run around for a bit while I

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.400 
which hoop run around for a bit while I
wait<00:02:02.470> for<00:02:02.500> my<00:02:02.649> morph<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.130> come<00:02:03.280> back<00:02:03.429> up<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:05.259> you

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
wait for my morph to come back up as you

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.859 
wait for my morph to come back up as you
can<00:02:05.530> see<00:02:05.679> it's<00:02:05.890> almost<00:02:06.130> back<00:02:06.459> up<00:02:06.670> now<00:02:06.910> so<00:02:07.780> I'm
