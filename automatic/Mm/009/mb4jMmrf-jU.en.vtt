I think for really getting as figures
because<00:02:42.470> really<00:02:43.220> just<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.610> idea<00:02:44.000> if<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.230> want

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
because really just the idea if you want

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.240 
because really just the idea if you want
to<00:02:45.620> own

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to own

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.670 
to own

existed in the Dragon Ball universe and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.560 
existed in the Dragon Ball universe and
I<00:02:51.230> mean<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.680> combination<00:02:52.340> of<00:02:52.520> two<00:02:52.850> Super<00:02:53.270> Saiyan

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570

figures I think they made this one I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.740 
figures I think they made this one I
think<00:03:09.680> they<00:03:10.130> made<00:03:10.310> a<00:03:10.340> movie<00:03:10.640> collection<00:03:11.030> like

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
think they made a movie collection like

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.280 
think they made a movie collection like
9<00:03:12.170> inch<00:03:13.090> figure<00:03:14.090> like<00:03:14.270> those<00:03:14.450> big<00:03:14.750> really

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
9 inch figure like those big really

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.870 
9 inch figure like those big really
heavily<00:03:15.500> detailed<00:03:16.100> ones<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:16.489> not<00:03:16.700> sure
