 What is 80 10 10 Diet? 

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.805
 Hello, I'm Dr. Douglas Graham. 

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:13.747
 I am the author of "80 10 10 Diet". 

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:17.169
 I'd like to briefly explain what it is about. 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.016
 The concept of 80 10 10 is relatively simple. 

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.458
 It's about the ratio of calories. 

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:30.043
 How much protein, how many sugars, how many fats out of total intake. 

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:35.477
 I usually express it as sugars / protein / fat. 

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:40.434
 I use this order because of the amount of protein 

00:00:40.435 --> 00:00:42.540
 is not much different in different diets. 

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:44.398
 As for the amount of protein, 

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.877
 some people eat a high single-digit amount 

00:00:46.878 --> 00:00:49.120
 others low double digit 

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:55.019
 But most people in the world eat 11 to 19% of their calories from protein. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.509
 I only use this number as a support, 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.685
 because only the intake of fats and sugars 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.981
 may vary dramatically in different diets. 

00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:12.562
 What I noticed when studying nutrition and the doctor 

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:14.623
 and also in private practice 

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:19.856
 and in my research on the diet of athletes. 

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:24.015
 It was that the greater the intake of sugars, 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.568
 the better people were in it. 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.289
 We found that: 

00:01:29.324 --> 00:01:36.130
 when sugar intake exceeds 80% of total calories consumed, 

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:44.431
 so the incidence of heart disease, diabetes, candida, colitis, digestive problems, 

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:53.254
 and many other problems including overweight, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, 

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:58.167
 just an endless stream of trouble 

00:01:58.168 --> 00:01:59.613
 basically disappeared. 

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:02.922
 There are books to reverse heart disease 

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:09.049
 which are designed for sugar intake of more than 80%. 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.264
 Lots of health centers and professionals 

00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:17.396
 have created programs 

00:02:17.397 --> 00:02:21.886
 where they reduced the fat percentage below 10% 

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:25.616
 and allowing sugars to cover more than 80% of calories. 

00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:28.959
 This leaves the proteins virtually untouched. 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.871
 Thanks to my own health center 

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:36.584
 in the 1980s and 1990s 

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:40.298
 I realized that if we do the same thing, 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.458
 But we will use raw food as a source of calories 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.500
 instead of cooked food 

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.050
 so we get even better results. 

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:49.783
 So I ended up with the proposal 

00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:50.784
 80/10/10 Diet 

00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:51.672
 Which is simply food, 

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.461
 where more than 80% of the calories come from sugars 

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:58.477
 and less than 10% protein and fat. 

00:02:58.478 --> 00:03:00.545
 What results can we expect at 80/10/10 Diet? 

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:04.156
 As for the expected results, 

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:07.857
 people almost unanimously say 

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.066
 that they started to think more clearly 

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:11.648
 that they have more energy 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.161
 their health problems have disappeared 

00:03:13.162 --> 00:03:17.351
 lose weight if they lose weight, 

00:03:17.352 --> 00:03:20.311
 they have energy for strength exercises, 

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:23.063
 which is necessary for the desired gain. 

00:03:24.327 --> 00:03:27.967
 Basically what we see 

00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:30.625
 are positive results, 

00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:34.868
 which can be supported by research 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:36.773
 especially in sports science 

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:37.927
 which shows us 

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:43.030
 that they receive, transport, and deliver oxygen 

00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:45.660
 it improves into cells 

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:49.308
 when fat intake goes below 10% calories 

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:52.426
 and is weakened or damaged 

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.589
 when fat intake increases. 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.941
 It's not how fat you are, 

00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:59.001
 But how much fat is in your food every day. 

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:01.273
 How many percent of the total income is in your meal. 

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:07.807
 The average American eats about 40% of calories from fat. 

00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:13.351
 The average Vitarian eats about 60-80% of the calories from fat 

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:17.975
 on a diet full of fat, grass, flavors and supplements. 

00:04:17.976 --> 00:04:19.223
 If you avoid fruits, 

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:21.575
 so they have no source of sugars 

00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:23.221
 and then they turn 

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:26.164
 to refined sugars and sweeteners, 

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:31.452
 they add to their bold recipes. 

00:04:31.453 --> 00:04:33.924
 It's not a program that works 

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:38.606
 and therefore we see a lot of former vitarians 

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:42.674
 claiming they could no longer be on a raw diet 

00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:44.649
 or they could no longer be vegans. 

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.340
 Mostly they say their body needed something. 

00:04:50.174 --> 00:04:53.015
 What he needed is what he was lacking. 

00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:58.870
 For People 80/10/10 Food Not Only Sustainable 

00:04:58.871 --> 00:04:59.768
 but their health will improve as well 

00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.911
 and do not want to do anything else 

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:03.842
 And so we see that 80/10/10 is 

00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:07.809
 the fastest growing 

00:05:07.844 --> 00:05:09.893
 segment of the vitarious population 

00:05:09.894 --> 00:05:12.939
 because 80/10/10 is sustainable for people. 

00:05:12.974 --> 00:05:14.563
 Sports Scientists Show Us 

00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:18.126
 the intake, transport and delivery of sugars 

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:21.803
 will improve when fat intake decreases. 

00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:27.286
 So we can combine income, transport, and delivery 

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:29.612
 oxygen and sugars for sports performance. 

00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:33.472
 We know that if there is not enough oxygen in the cells, 

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:38.154
 so they tend to become carcinogenic. 

00:05:38.155 --> 00:05:40.489
 Cancer can develop. 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.996
 If sugar cannot get out of the bloodstream, 

00:05:44.997 --> 00:05:48.397
 so diabetes is coming. 

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:51.601
 If there is too much fat in the bloodstream 

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:53.508
 so there is a heart disease. 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.800
 Research continues to support 80/10/10 Diet again and again. 

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:04.986
