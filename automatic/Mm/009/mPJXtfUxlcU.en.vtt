00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.480
 good I would have 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.550
 Classroom of the rode performs 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.950
 right now we know 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.390
 and after 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.970
 learning and didactics 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.710
 French as a foreign language is this the goal 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.720
 of this video and introduce you to a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.430
 tool that is not yet widespread 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.930
 in France but he is in a lot 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.200
 of classrooms all over the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.970
 world 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.700
 I want to talk about the white board 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.649
 interactive otherwise called smart board 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.149
 during this video I will try 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.520
 to introduce you to most 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.410
 features of this tool we have 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.800
 started by planting material 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.800
 general 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.060
 proto man what are the components 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 interactive whiteboard 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.460
 we obviously have a table one 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.300
 video projector that is located above 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.580
 from me a remote control to activate this 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.580
 same video projector and two speakers 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.339
 and then his soul in the room we have 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.990
 also four color styles 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.390
 this model as well as a rise 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 you should know that this model of tables 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.369
 interactive whites also has 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 two buttons 1 3-1 travier another one for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.750
 right click 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.080
 all this material is connected by a cable 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.430
 to a computer to make it work 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.530
 the interactive whiteboard 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.090
 it is necessary to have installed at 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.110
 prior 500 computer software 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.610
 which it is particularly important to see how 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.610
 works this software 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.870
 I am going now 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.850
 the toolbar of the software thanks to 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.130
 this agreement we can create a 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.370
 positive news and thanks to his arrows 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.280
 we can navigate between each 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.860
 of them then we have them 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
 classic tools of opening of 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.700
 saving documents and then half 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:13.380
 hue to paste a document a button 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.720
 backspace returns before among 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.110
 other interesting features 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.690
 this school allows you to place a cache 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.910
 on the screen that it is possible to do 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.190
 slide up and down left to 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.430
 right we'll have to left and from 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 barande another like for m 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.400
 in full screen among the others 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.090
 interesting features we have 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.940
 this element cutting tool 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 visuals that can open it on a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.700
 new slides directly us 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.360
 also have the opportunity to include 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.239
 a table that works as submitted 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.620
 conservatory and various tools for 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.239
 plot for the pens we have 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.880
 also a vertical bar that we 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.180
 allows first to have access to a 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.690
 slide selector then to a 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.500
 gallery of funds and objects to a pure 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.420
 in the document a gallery here empty 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.160
 which usually allows us to 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.069
 visualize the documents we have 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:28.120
 imported into this 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.120
 and also a selector of this shot 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.480
 will now go to the demonstration 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 concrete of meetic firstly how 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.310
 include testing on this page 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.630
 white 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.250
 we can immediately type a text on 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.920
 the computer keyboard 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.990
 it is displayed directly where the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.550
 mouse cursor is found one can 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.920
 then modify it as we would like 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.620
 seems 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.950
 second possibility bring up a 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:05.060
 present button here a touch keyboard 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:12.170
 on the screen where we can likewise 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:15.120
 typed our payx a third solution 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.590
 would be to use the pens of the 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.590
 colors that are available to us 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.910
 this writing gives us more than 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.540
 possibilities of action we prove 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.540
 selected this object rotate it 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:43.520
 enlarge or reduce it but we have 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:47.220
 also access to a menu bar here 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.020
 which allows us for example to 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.930
 transform our writing team 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.310
 handwritten typewritten writing we 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.740
 can already be discussed 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.689
 practical application of the text on 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.819
 white boards 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.619
 tiff one of the great benefits of this 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.319
 tool is that it allows to manipulate in 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:08.179
 the space of the textual elements 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.919
 we know that some learners are 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:11.209
 sensitive to different types of a 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.219
 poutine and linguistics 

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:16.399
 some will be more receptive to 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.479
 solaure inputs other visuals while 

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:20.929
 that others need power 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.639
 manipulate in space the language this 

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:25.339
 is not possible using a simple 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.989
 pen and a simple caliber this is 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.939
 made possible by the whiteboard 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:31.459
 interactive 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.860
 take a simple example a sentence 

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:38.300
 simple that we cut in three 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.209
 elements for so many words we 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.879
 can easily add to this 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:48.139
 sentence of the elements explaining the 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:06:00.699
 negation by writing first 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:06:03.769
 an hour and moving those elements 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.009
 in the same way we can by 

00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:09.919
 example invert subject and verb 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:12.039
 to explain the question we 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.619
 Lake working on a horizontal axis 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.539
 but we can also vary the 

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:20.860
 vocabulary while working on the maxi 

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:24.129
 vertical replacing for example 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.129
 french by 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:36.259
 thanks to a quick manipulation we 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:40.389
 can get out the French word for 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.389
 include the word English
