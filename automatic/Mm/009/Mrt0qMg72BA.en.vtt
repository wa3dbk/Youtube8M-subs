 career and entrusted to Eric Raffin 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 mistrust is needed number 11 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.650
 also his rates goes from landrienne 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.930
 seems barred for the victory but 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 the brave and regular and a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.930
 first 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.299

 program in vincennes in the first 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.780
 know that christophe hamel who realizes 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.750
 an excellent meeting is not negative 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.790
 with the 105 hermes armani a horse 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.560
 esteemed a preserved horse who finds here 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.570
 the opportunity to play the leading roles in 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.130
 condition that he shows himself wise I 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.390
 will however ask the 103 to come from 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.100
 snow i know we like it the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.390
 bigeon family especially under 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.500
 the training of jean luc bigeon the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.789
 horse life would be later for 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 the first time there are already taken 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.060
 places behind quality foals 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.709
 who do not box anymore in this category 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 so watch out for him for a surprise 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.230
 and nice odds the 105 and the 103 in the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.390
 next I recommend the 202 in 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 this competition presented by 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.650
 Sebastian Hardy The filly is in shape 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.200
 attest its latest results here 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.550
 the opportunity to play the leading roles 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.230
 it is the 202 star of the moors 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.150
 attention this test also for 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.950
 a rating is a surprise of 211 vestale 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.090
 from the goutier she will leave among the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.620
 outsiders and a nice odds 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.060
 but I know that thibault the floch 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.550
 like it is a filly after 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.160
 him late gains she progressed 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.410
 since it was equipped with an event 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.690
 automatic and it becomes more 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.790
 effective and easier and less at fault 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.489
 under these conditions it can 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.390
 reports from this competition 202 and 211 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.440
 for the odds in the third the 305 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.970
 pretty fast of the banney who stays on 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.739
 three consecutive victories including two 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.049
 obtained on this course will be announced 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.150
 formidable new times him who already has 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.769
 market less than 12 on the course that 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.109
 we are interested for 7 to be precise 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.859
 on the lumix 175 m it must be enough for 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.900
 play the victory 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.340
 I will ask myself 302nd of maple 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.720
 irreproachable since the beginning of the meeting 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.820
 winter this family boarder 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.380
 thomas should also play the 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:26.270
 leading roles the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.880
 utopia perial the 308 which had also 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.890
 market 11.7 on this course also 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.530
 his place on the podium of this 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.240
 competition three his bag 302 and you 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.940
 check number of inner utopia 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.350
 probably 8 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.400
 regarding now the price of the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.710
 marne a beautiful test 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.720
 we find at the beginning the 511 universe of 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.740
 passage do you remember philippe 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.540
 daugeard intended to run him 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.710
 to align it at the start of the grand prix 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.230
 from America unfortunately for lack of 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.670
 gains he was not selected and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.710
 qualified he finds here the opportunity to 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.480
 to get a meager compensation but 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.520
 in any case the opposition seems in his 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.140
 ropes and logically his place is among 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.360
 the first two his main rival 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.070
 will be the 520 beckmann one of the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.830
 revelations of this winter rally he has 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.240
 collected the successes this winter and 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.680
 lately in the price of luxembourg 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.330
 he could never find the opening 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.830
 finally, it is imperative that you 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.130
 take back it's a class horse 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.739
 sasson 1 511 511 it will be for 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.400
 of any coupled winning placed in the 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.080
 price the island of france 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.330
 the highlight of this meeting even says 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.490
 dominical sort of revenge the price of 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.110
 but with the difference that it is 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.940
 takes place on 2175 meters 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.120
 well we would resume conflicting 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.280
 hitting fast roxane scratching heroin 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.450
 of the harrier price that will attempt the 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.510
 doubled as did singalo the year 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.760
 last the 607 that came second from 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.750
 this race last year should 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.930
 also 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.790
 hold and play the leading roles so 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.580
 608 607 for this price of the Ile-de-France 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.450
 of application and two mares to follow 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.640
 at the highest point 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.140
 I also like 909 sun 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.000
 of hell did not forget that he already has 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.730
 well done under the saddle he had 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.080
 especially won the prize 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.720
 he had participated in the price of 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.980
 in 2013 also know that he 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.780
 had finished third in the price of 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.210
 calvados under the saddle the price of 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.560
 calvados is a group ii short here i 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.390
 think the lot in his ropes to my 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.100
 notice it could well make display a 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.580
 nice odds and why not impose on 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.940
 a speculative rating around 7 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.500
 8 to 1 909 sun of hell 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.700
 about mauquenchy king I was able 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.620
 talk to kerry that you and 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.450
 know he's confident he'll have three 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.520
 departing he is confident that the 211 is going 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.750
 pretty horse that was kept apart from the 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.030
 competition for over a year and a half 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.410
 since he had been elected and a look-alike 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.820
 health a broken knee 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.080
 the horse is late for gains he 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.170
 just played bad luck lately 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.300
 in my opinion he should play the victory 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.130
 anyway eric Letouzé confidence and 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.880
 that he told me when I could 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.700
 join the phone 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.040
 he also presents in the 3rd race 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.210
 306 winter odiet a horse that remains 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.620
 on honorable performances on 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.240
 evidence of paris vincennes where he did 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.160
 by the way not always been very revered 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.080
 of the happiest he's back here in 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.060
 province with the donkey with solids 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.470
 ambitions the opposition in his strings 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.600
 he confronts his elders certainly he 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.250
 there are others going somewhat ambitious 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.650
 in this category and in this 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.240
 test that said live to the jets has 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.990
 logically its place among the three 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.090
 first of this race 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.440
 so beware two protected from Eric the 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.510
 12 and the 211 goes pretty and the 306 vivaro 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.740
 of viette also beautiful races 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.540
 are waiting for us on skin problems 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.000
 the great hurdle race the big cross 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.860
 of pau with headliners malberaux 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.670
 who will attempt a fifth victory in 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.210
 this competition and toutankhamon 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.770
 hope is a very confident horse 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.300
 but also on the cross a nice duel 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.130
 in perspective between males of euros and 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.260
 toutankhamon so that's for the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.790
 Sunday program of this February 2nd I 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.900
 wish you a very good game at all one 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.650
 good day we say very soon 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.650
 on live race
