without permission of congress that's a
very<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.799> dangerous<00:01:14.040> precedent<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
very very dangerous precedent and I

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
very very dangerous precedent and I
guess<00:01:15.570> what<00:01:15.750> really<00:01:15.780> upsets<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.770> he<00:01:16.979> had

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
guess what really upsets me is he had

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
guess what really upsets me is he had
time<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> go<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> UN<00:01:18.090> he<00:01:18.780> had<00:01:18.900> time<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
time to go to the UN he had time to go

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.950 
time to go to the UN he had time to go
to<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> Arab<00:01:19.860> League<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.180> say<00:01:21.450> oh<00:01:21.689> he

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
to the Arab League and so some say oh he

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.020 
to the Arab League and so some say oh he
has<00:01:22.080> permission<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> UN<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.640> okay

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
has permission from the UN so it's okay

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.149 
has permission from the UN so it's okay

is passed by Congress inside my

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.370 
is passed by Congress inside my
president<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> law<00:01:57.990> until<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
president it is the law until the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
president it is the law until the
supreme<00:01:58.680> court<00:01:58.890> overturns<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.000> believe

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
supreme court overturns it and I believe

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
supreme court overturns it and I believe
in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> rule<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.689> law<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.649> restrain

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
in the rule of law and that we restrain

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.320 
in the rule of law and that we restrain
and<00:02:02.340> control<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> powers

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
and control the powers

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.210 
and control the powers
we<00:02:04.420> don't<00:02:04.540> give<00:02:04.810> unlimited<00:02:04.990> power<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.710> think

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
we don't give unlimited power I think

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.680 
we don't give unlimited power I think
it's<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.430> very<00:02:06.550> dangerous<00:02:06.820> precedent<00:02:07.510> if<00:02:07.570> we

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
it's a very dangerous precedent if we

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.270 
it's a very dangerous precedent if we
let<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.960> go<00:02:08.140> forward<00:02:08.590> there's<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:08.920> court<00:02:09.160> here

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
by Congress or imminent danger I think

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.460 
by Congress or imminent danger I think
even<00:02:48.790> myself<00:02:49.060> agrees<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.990> president

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
even myself agrees that the president

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.199 
even myself agrees that the president
under<00:02:50.800> extraordinary<00:02:51.280> times<00:02:51.820> if<00:02:52.060> we're

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
under extraordinary times if we're

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.090 
under extraordinary times if we're
attacked<00:02:52.600> if<00:02:52.959> there's<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.200> terrorist<00:02:53.740> attack

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
attacked if there's a terrorist attack

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.890 
attacked if there's a terrorist attack
or<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.340> nuclear<00:02:54.700> attack<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.420> president<00:02:55.630> can

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
or a nuclear attack the president can

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.930 
or a nuclear attack the president can
take<00:02:56.050> action<00:02:56.530> but<00:02:56.950> just<00:02:57.130> think<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.640> the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
take action but just think if the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.670 
take action but just think if the
president<00:02:58.450> were<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.600> real<00:02:58.930> leader<00:02:59.200> here's<00:02:59.500> what

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
president were a real leader here's what

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.040 
president were a real leader here's what
would<00:02:59.830> have<00:02:59.950> happened<00:03:00.370> when<00:03:00.850> Libya<00:03:01.330> escalated

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
would have happened when Libya escalated

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.420 
would have happened when Libya escalated
and<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.260> were<00:03:02.410> out<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.590> session<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.370> he

to begin with if you were true leader he

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.590
