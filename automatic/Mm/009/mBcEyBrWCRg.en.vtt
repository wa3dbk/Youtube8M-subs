00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.340
 Paula was talking and maybe she goes out with 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.010
 a car 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.620
 how are you facing a new series of 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 near 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.370
 happy with game form 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.280
 that we train very well 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.289
 so calm quiet that is based 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.360
 in the series 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.110
 forever 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.780
 flame and remarked 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.260
 but she is not ready to go out and play 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.920
 tomorrow but weather permitting 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.829
 and leave everything once again strong 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.570
 How did you like Madryn's victory? 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.320
 kan in the australia open and the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.440
 originals and half roses 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.329
 combining charm 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.329
 regarding rafa because its birds 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.340
 people 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.640
 and right that he has won another 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.640
 person 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.780
 yes 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.820
 super recontra deserved because I think that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:14.290
 It has improved a lot, it was always the same 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:18.399
 a player but that charm was missing 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.560
 because I am a death but good too 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.330
 the level he showed during the tournament 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.270
 it was amazing to get up early and 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.880
 watch them play against murray and what he played 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.880
 for me it was enough 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.729
 for me 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.229
 there are many fanatical courses that comment 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.850
 on the page admirers are you girlfriend 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.850
 third voice 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.140
 but very happy I'm having a good time 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.610
 moment that I would have to be a boy that 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.610
 it attracts you that attracts you good 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.450
 I think most guys guys 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:16.480
