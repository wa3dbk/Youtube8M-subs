00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.290
 hello good morning 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.330
 good guys today I will not do 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.950
 costume jewelery because good sometimes too 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.010
 I like doing crafts in fact in 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.770
 I do a lot of home and I will share with 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:23.020
 you how I do a candle with the 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.830
 part of the sidewalk of these cheeses that 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 they sell small 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.250
 you know what kind of cheeses I speak 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 you keep the waxes what is the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.620
 outside the pod and when 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.620
 you have a certain amount 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.760
 we can make a candle 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.399
 you have to remove all the pieces 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.079
 have paper because good you know 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.860
 that normally carry a strip of paper 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.570
 to be able to start it 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.170
 then all those pieces the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.170
 we discard 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.540
 and we are going to work on what we have 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 what to do is 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.690
 very very easy, it's very simple, let's go 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.030
 to work what is wax 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.680
 with hands little by little we are giving 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.840
 heat and as you give it heat 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.479
 it gets softer 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.230
 and then let's go as a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.460
 tubule 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.460
 we are working well 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.450
 everything depends on the size you want 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.320
 do 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.320
 of the candle 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.479
 well let's work like this we do 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.479
 first the tube that is said 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.780
 and then we clarify it a bit 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.870
 and working it so that it stays 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.350
 with a good shape that do not leave you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.229
 too much dust 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.229
 then we are working it well 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 we can do it a little more 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.980
 and when we have it already 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.319
 worked as we want there are simply 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.579
 what to do this way 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.670
 for the middle part we are going to double 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.670
 the 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.070
 once we have this footprint 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.340
 with a little bit of wax 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.260
 let's prepare what is the wick the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.299
 wick I make it with cotton thread 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 as it is a very fine thread I do not have and 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:54.340
 then thick what I do is take the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.340
 As what is the candle 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.370
 I'm going to fold it several times so that it 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.370
 make a more chubby wick 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.600
 when we have it 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:19.180
 prepared the thread or the cord 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.180
 what we are going to do is 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.770
 we leave it here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.030
 and you can do two things 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.030
 beat this 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.530
 with a piece of cheese wax 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.360
 or on the surface where you have it 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.710
 worked always stays 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.350
 you can pass it like this in this way 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.880
 and then he picks up the pieces of 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.880
 wax that has been stuck 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.810
 this part of doing it well because if not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.710
 the wick will burn too fast and the 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.710
 candle will go out 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.990
 so 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.050
 once we have done it well 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:14.790
 it is simply what we put in the middle of 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.790
 the uv and we close it 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.620
 and the wick is already inside 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.620
 then now 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.420
 let's work our candle of 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.090
 urgency because one day we were left without 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.260
 light at home in a storm of those that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.969
 sometimes they stick around here 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.099
 good around here everywhere 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:40.320
 we work on the edges that stays and 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.310
 they come 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.310
 cogidito 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.949
 If you want 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.949
 and you can give a little more shape 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:56.230
 and once you have it like that we plant 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.230
 the bottom 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.060
 and so where you put it will stay I 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.009
 I usually put a piece of paper 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.999
 albal a paper 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.999
 of aluminum 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.789
 and then or a cover also of 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.229
 any glass pot of which 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.229
 We use in house preserves 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.690
 and then as you see we would have 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.690
 our little candle 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.710
 You see the fire as it holds 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.380
 and well in this way we can 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.470
 reuse all the barks of the 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:48.150
 cheese that we bought 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.380
 and good nothing I hope that it serves you and 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.200
 when you have a storm and you 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.450
 you are without light you remember me like that 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:00.250
 I hope you liked it and 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:04.110
 that can serve you for something we 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.110
 we see the next video a little kiss
