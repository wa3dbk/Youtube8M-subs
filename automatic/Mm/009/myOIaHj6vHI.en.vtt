00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510 
don't get extra points for hitting the
ball<00:00:45.809> harder<00:00:46.170> especially<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.129> not<00:00:47.190> in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
ball harder especially if it's not in

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.850 
ball harder especially if it's not in
the<00:00:48.030> court<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.600> got<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> maintain<00:00:49.440> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the court you got to maintain and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
the court you got to maintain and
remember<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:50.940> no<00:00:51.120> matter<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.329> we

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
remember that you know no matter what we

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
remember that you know no matter what we
do<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> ball<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.559> still<00:00:52.770> go<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.460> hit

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
do the ball has to still go in if we hit

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.100 
do the ball has to still go in if we hit
it<00:00:53.699> hard<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:54.480> in<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.780> can't<00:00:54.960> just

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
it hard it has to go in we can't just

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.439 
it hard it has to go in we can't just
hit<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.260> hard<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.460> expect<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.120> win

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
hit it hard and be out and expect to win

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.200 
hit it hard and be out and expect to win
matches<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.410> having<00:00:58.770> consistent<00:00:59.730> margins

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
matches so having consistent margins

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.849 
matches so having consistent margins
will<00:01:00.629> help<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.050> consistent<00:01:01.559> while<00:01:01.680> being

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
will help you be consistent while being

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.650 
will help you be consistent while being
aggressive<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> mean<00:01:03.300> by<00:01:03.449> consistent

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
aggressive so what I mean by consistent

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.160 
aggressive so what I mean by consistent
margins<00:01:05.030> what<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.060> mean<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.630> aiming

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
margins what I mean is I'm aiming

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
margins what I mean is I'm aiming
usually<00:01:07.619> halfway<00:01:08.189> between<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.670> service<00:01:09.090> line

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
usually halfway between the service line

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
usually halfway between the service line
and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.840> base<00:01:10.049> line<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.100> halfway

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and the base line and then halfway

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.880 
and the base line and then halfway
between<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.030> side<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:13.020> double<00:01:13.439> side<00:01:13.650> line

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
between the side the double side line

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
between the side the double side line
and<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.580> center<00:01:14.909> tea<00:01:15.119> line<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.540> continued

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and the center tea line if it continued

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.719 
and the center tea line if it continued
what<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.799> does<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> gives<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.490> great

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
what this does is it gives me great

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.240 
what this does is it gives me great
margins<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.530> maintain<00:01:20.009> my

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
margins so I'm going to maintain my

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249 
margins so I'm going to maintain my
consistency<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.020> still<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
consistency and I can still be

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
consistency and I can still be
aggressive<00:01:22.799> now<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.580> other<00:01:24.000> things<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.390> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
aggressive now two other things I like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
aggressive now two other things I like
to<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.930> about<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.560> trying<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.430> put

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to think about is I'm trying to put

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.179 
to think about is I'm trying to put
together<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> good<00:01:27.750> shots<00:01:28.020> okay<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
together a lot of good shots okay and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.410 
together a lot of good shots okay and
what<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> mean<00:01:29.520> by<00:01:29.640> good<00:01:29.790> shots<00:01:30.060> they're

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
what I mean by good shots they're

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.510 
what I mean by good shots they're
quality<00:01:30.869> shots<00:01:31.079> they're<00:01:31.259> not<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.619> shots

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
quality shots they're not like shots

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310 
quality shots they're not like shots
that<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.729> foot<00:01:33.000> away<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> baseline<00:01:34.049> or

bunch of good shots usually is I have
what<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> call<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> good<00:01:42.420> accident<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
what I call a good accident you know I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
what I call a good accident you know I
make<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> good<00:01:43.890> mistake<00:01:44.280> which<00:01:44.490> means<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
make a good mistake which means I go a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.289 
make a good mistake which means I go a
little<00:01:45.540> bit<00:01:45.720> deeper<00:01:46.250> sometimes<00:01:47.250> by<00:01:47.640> accident

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
little bit deeper sometimes by accident

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.910 
little bit deeper sometimes by accident
then<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:48.899> good<00:01:49.110> shot<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> winds<00:01:49.740> up<00:01:49.860> being

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
then my good shot and it winds up being

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.710 
then my good shot and it winds up being
very<00:01:50.369> close<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> baseline<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.450> usually

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
very close to the baseline and I usually

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210 
very close to the baseline and I usually
get<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> short<00:01:52.140> ball<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.439> call<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> good

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
get a short ball I call that a good

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.910 
get a short ball I call that a good
accident<00:01:53.610> I'm<00:01:54.090> not<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:55.020> for<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
accident I'm not really going for the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
accident I'm not really going for the
the<00:01:56.280> ball<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.850> foot<00:01:57.060> inside<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
the ball that's a foot inside the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.880 
the ball that's a foot inside the
baseline<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> foot<00:01:58.110> inside<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.469> sidelines

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
baseline a foot inside the sidelines

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
baseline a foot inside the sidelines
because<00:01:59.310> if<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> make

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
because if I do that I'm going to make

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
because if I do that I'm going to make
too<00:02:00.420> many<00:02:00.509> mistakes<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:01.500> by<00:02:01.680> staying

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
too many mistakes but by staying

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
too many mistakes but by staying
consistent<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:02.880> good<00:02:03.060> margins<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.719> lot<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
consistent with my good margins a lot of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.270 
consistent with my good margins a lot of
times<00:02:04.350> I'll<00:02:04.500> hit<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> ball<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.159> bit

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
times I'll hit the ball a little bit

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.660 
times I'll hit the ball a little bit
deeper<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.850> then<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.170> turns<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.979> being<00:02:08.220> even<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
deeper and then it turns to being even a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
deeper and then it turns to being even a
better<00:02:09.060> shot<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:10.020> problem<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.470> with<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> lot

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
better shot the problem I see with a lot

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.400 
better shot the problem I see with a lot
of<00:02:11.069> players<00:02:11.420> or<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.720> may<00:02:12.840> be<00:02:12.900> having<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
of players or that you may be having is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
of players or that you may be having is
to

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
to
aiming<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.250> foot<00:02:14.490> inside<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.880> baseline<00:02:15.240> and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
aiming a foot inside the baseline and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.870 
aiming a foot inside the baseline and
you<00:02:16.020> think<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.710> good<00:02:16.860> shot<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.310> then

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you think that's your good shot and then

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.220 
you think that's your good shot and then
when<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.270> have<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.569> accident<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:19.110> hit

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
when you have that accident of hit

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.660 
when you have that accident of hit
aiming<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.590> little<00:02:19.740> bit<00:02:19.860> too<00:02:19.950> deep<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.400> out

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
aiming a little bit too deep it's out

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670 
aiming a little bit too deep it's out
and<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.150> lost<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.510> point<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.260> keep<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.620> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
and you lost a point so keep that in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.090 
and you lost a point so keep that in
mind

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
mind

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040 
mind
between<00:02:23.550> aiming<00:02:23.880> for<00:02:24.030> consistent<00:02:24.540> good<00:02:24.720> shots

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
between aiming for consistent good shots

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.170 
between aiming for consistent good shots
and<00:02:25.350> then<00:02:25.770> having<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.190> accident<00:02:26.760> or<00:02:26.850> having

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and then having the accident or having

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.120 
and then having the accident or having
the<00:02:27.300> margin<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.110> you're<00:02:28.560> good<00:02:28.740> shots<00:02:28.980> turn

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
the margin that you're good shots turn

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.360 
the margin that you're good shots turn
into<00:02:29.340> great<00:02:29.520> shots<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.720> by<00:02:31.260> having<00:02:32.010> this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
into great shots so by having this

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.550 
into great shots so by having this
mindset<00:02:32.790> allows<00:02:33.209> us<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.570> more<00:02:33.810> consistent

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
mindset allows us to be more consistent

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.490 
mindset allows us to be more consistent
but<00:02:35.070> also<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.550> or<00:02:36.450> also<00:02:36.930> maintain<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
but also be or also maintain the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
but also be or also maintain the
aggressiveness<00:02:38.100> we<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.550> we're<00:02:38.970> playing<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
aggressiveness we want we're playing and

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.580 
aggressiveness we want we're playing and
we<00:02:39.510> don't<00:02:39.630> have<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.840> feel<00:02:39.989> like<00:02:40.140> we're<00:02:40.290> aiming

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
we don't have to feel like we're aiming

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.110 
we don't have to feel like we're aiming
so<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> middle<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.910> court

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
so much in the middle of the court

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.820 
so much in the middle of the court
that's<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> bad<00:02:42.750> thing<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.410> at<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> high

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
that's not a bad thing but at a high

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.710 
that's not a bad thing but at a high
level<00:02:43.860> aiming<00:02:44.489> in<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.640> middle<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:44.970> court<00:02:45.180> will

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
level aiming in the middle of court will

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.240 
level aiming in the middle of court will
cause<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.440> lose<00:02:46.590> points<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
cause you to lose points because you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.220 
cause you to lose points because you
won't<00:02:47.370> be<00:02:47.550> able<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.700> control<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> points<00:02:48.420> so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
won't be able to control the points so

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.170 
won't be able to control the points so
in<00:02:49.440> review<00:02:49.800> what<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.610> want<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> make<00:02:51.150> sure

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
in review what I want you to make sure

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.020 
in review what I want you to make sure
you're<00:02:51.570> doing<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.959> aiming<00:02:52.560> with<00:02:52.920> big<00:02:53.340> margins

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
you're doing is aiming with big margins

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.310 
you're doing is aiming with big margins
the<00:02:54.180> bigger<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> shots<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.930> bigger<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
the bigger the shots the bigger the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.810 
the bigger the shots the bigger the
margins<00:02:55.680> meaning<00:02:55.980> we're<00:02:56.250> aiming<00:02:56.370> halfway

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
margins meaning we're aiming halfway

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.250 
margins meaning we're aiming halfway
between<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.209> baseline<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.900> service

between the baseline and the service

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.560 
between the baseline and the service
line<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.590> halfway<00:02:59.190> between<00:02:59.519> the<00:03:00.269> double
