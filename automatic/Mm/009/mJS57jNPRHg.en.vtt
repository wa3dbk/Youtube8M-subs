finish there another volley it's just
really<00:03:21.540> frustrating<00:03:21.780> playing<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.560> these

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
really frustrating playing in these

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.100 
really frustrating playing in these
laggy<00:03:22.950> games<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.600> for<00:03:24.600> some<00:03:24.750> reason<00:03:24.780> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
laggy games and for some reason it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.660 
laggy games and for some reason it
didn't<00:03:25.320> really<00:03:25.410> like<00:03:25.650> when<00:03:25.890> he<00:03:26.070> had<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.430> but

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
didn't really like when he had it but

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.509 
didn't really like when he had it but
when<00:03:26.820> I<00:03:26.850> had<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.570> lagged<00:03:28.079> hard<00:03:28.440> so<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.400> was

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
when I had it it lagged hard so that was

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.610 
when I had it it lagged hard so that was
really<00:03:29.579> frustrating<00:03:30.420> but<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.140> only<00:03:31.230> just

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
really frustrating but you can only just

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.009 
really frustrating but you can only just
like<00:03:32.370> play<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.820> out<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.180> if<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.450> play<00:03:33.780> really

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
like play it out and if I play really

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.170 
like play it out and if I play really
badly<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.560> lag<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.160> I'm<00:03:35.670> pretty<00:03:35.880> sure<00:03:36.000> most

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
badly and lag as I'm pretty sure most

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.420 
badly and lag as I'm pretty sure most
people<00:03:36.540> do<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> did<00:03:37.650> find<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.010> hard<00:03:38.220> and

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
people do so I did find it hard and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.190 
people do so I did find it hard and
menace<00:03:38.790> gets<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.120> nice<00:03:39.269> good<00:03:39.510> scissoring

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
menace gets a nice good scissoring

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.720 
menace gets a nice good scissoring
therefore<00:03:40.500> goal<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.130> just<00:03:41.310> look<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:41.610> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
therefore goal but just look at that I

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.310 
therefore goal but just look at that I

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
lagging or my bad rendering this is just

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.349 
lagging or my bad rendering this is just
his<00:03:46.140> awful<00:03:46.859> connection<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:48.030> know<00:03:48.180> it's

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
his awful connection and you know it's

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.590 
his awful connection and you know it's
tough<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:49.079> play<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.440> he's<00:03:49.560> getting<00:03:49.769> goals<00:03:50.190> and

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
tough to play and he's getting goals and

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.090 
tough to play and he's getting goals and
but<00:03:51.600> fortunately<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.109> managed<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.560> make<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.709> 3-2

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100

but fortunately I managed to make it 3-2
I<00:03:53.519> was<00:03:53.910> really<00:03:54.180> relieved<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.570> get<00:03:54.690> just

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
I was really relieved to get just

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.840 
I was really relieved to get just
straight<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:55.530> game<00:03:55.709> is<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.160> is

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850
