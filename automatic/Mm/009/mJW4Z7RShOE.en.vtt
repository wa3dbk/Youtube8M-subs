00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
courses are going to be a standard size

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.480 
courses are going to be a standard size
so<00:02:05.910> if<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.320> 31<00:02:08.040> inch<00:02:08.070> natural

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
so if you have say a 31 inch natural

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.210 
so if you have say a 31 inch natural
waist<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.570> would<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:10.110> fit<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.649> size

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
waist then you would probably fit a size

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.940 
waist then you would probably fit a size
26<00:02:11.730> standard<00:02:12.420> size<00:02:12.570> corset<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.710> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
26 standard size corset and this is the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
26 standard size corset and this is the
amount<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.460> curve<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.150> expect<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
