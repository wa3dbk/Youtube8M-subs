ago<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.149> remember<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
ago that I don't really remember so it's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
ago that I don't really remember so it's
from<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> those<00:01:54.000> places<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
from one of those places but it's just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
from one of those places but it's just
kind<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.860> nice<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.159> silky<00:01:56.850> jumper

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
kind of really nice like silky jumper

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
kind of really nice like silky jumper
but<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.110> wanted<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.469> start<00:01:58.740> trying<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> wear

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
but I wanted to start trying to wear

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.679 
but I wanted to start trying to wear
prints<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:01.049> wanted<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
prints so I just wanted to use it as the

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.850 
prints so I just wanted to use it as the
shorts<00:02:03.689> because<00:02:03.899> i<00:02:04.110> felt<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.649> way

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
shorts because i felt like it was way

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.999 
shorts because i felt like it was way
too<00:02:04.890> difficult<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:06.090> wear<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.140> whole

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
too difficult to wear it as the whole

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.910 
too difficult to wear it as the whole
like<00:02:08.159> jumper<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.299> like<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:10.049> think<00:02:10.409> the<00:02:10.500> print<00:02:10.769> is

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
like jumper is like I think the print is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.949 
like jumper is like I think the print is
overwhelming<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.299> thought<00:02:12.480> I'd<00:02:12.629> throw<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
overwhelming so I thought I'd throw a

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.050 
overwhelming so I thought I'd throw a
sweater<00:02:13.409> on<00:02:13.500> top<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.069> just<00:02:14.159> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.730> make<00:02:14.909> it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
sweater on top and just kind of make it

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.630 
sweater on top and just kind of make it
a<00:02:15.150> bit<00:02:15.329> more<00:02:15.709> casual<00:02:16.709> doubt<00:02:17.069> for<00:02:17.250> this<00:02:17.400> less

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
a bit more casual doubt for this less

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.460 
a bit more casual doubt for this less
about<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.239> prints<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.079> of<00:02:19.170> just<00:02:19.319> a

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
about the prints and it's kind of just a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.250 
about the prints and it's kind of just a
bit<00:02:19.620> more<00:02:19.829> subtle<00:02:20.129> and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.519> really<00:02:20.819> like<00:02:21.000> that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
bit more subtle and I really like that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.110 
bit more subtle and I really like that
and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> bottom<00:02:22.890> I've<00:02:23.220> just<00:02:23.280> paired

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
and then on the bottom I've just paired

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.460 
and then on the bottom I've just paired
it<00:02:24.299> with<00:02:24.329> I<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:24.989> if<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.290> tell
