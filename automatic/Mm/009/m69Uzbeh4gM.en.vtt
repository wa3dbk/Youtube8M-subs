00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the high priest of the association community i will erase 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 which exists in Iceland from the beginning 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.710
 seventies help from green hill mars he 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.420
 said we don't believe that someone believes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 in the one-eyed man who drives 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.110
 riding on 8 is much the end they are rather 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.790
 see these stories more like poetic 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 metaphors and manifestations of the forces of nature and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.240
 human psychology and yes they are 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.100
 going to build a temple where they will 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.699
 various rites are held here 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.500
 they are funny guys hello my name is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.849
 Elena Rasokhina and I want to share with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.310
 your thoughts about some 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.960
 strange and not so recent events 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.460
 The first thing I've heard is probably even 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.469
 lazy it's about how hardboiled 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 the egg again made with raw well that is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.770
 like australian american scientists 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
 chemists have reversed the process 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.790
 protein denaturation boiled eggs here like 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.530
 example demonstration process professor 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.120
 chemistry and molecular biology and biochemistry 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 gregori weiss from california 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.239
 university you rabbi says in 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.250
 reality for example exists 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 plenty of sticky proteins required 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.489
 plenty of time to clear them 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.840
 test tubes many would like to get 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.350
 means to recover this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.059
 of the material 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.890
 if using conventional methods which 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.719
 costly process takes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.399
 a few days the new thing returns 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.589
 protein its raw state for a few 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.510
 minutes into the walkie talkie are urea and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.950
 centrifuge rotating at a speed of 5 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.540
 kilometers per minute this method 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 significantly reduce the cost of various 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.409
 biochemistry research rejoice a 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.420
 German and Japanese scientists presented 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.040
 prototype e- skin which will 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.630
 make it possible to feel magnetic 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.100
 wave card files represents 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 drill magnet resistive sensors 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 which are invisible means 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 for orientation in space 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 for example bird insects bacteria and 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.799
 other sharks are used in the ghetto reception 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.240
 for orientation in space can be 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.250
 she makes anyone think of him 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.840
 and the fig he needs but you see 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 you will try and then you will be perplexed 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.880
 how is it so many years without this thing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.229
 was getting along 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.939
 if he really turns out to be so 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.070
 useful to be it can be useful to those 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.110
 same to blind people sensors themselves in thickness 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 does not exceed two microns weights small 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.220
 and if their memory is functionality they are not 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.710
 lose would you such try me 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.509
 yes and finally it's time to dilute 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.890
 kaleidoscope of fancy history 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.290
 a century of old adventures 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 what happened when recovering one 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.560
 from research huts in the Antarctic 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.689
 guys from new zealand discovered in 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.610
 a piece of ice a hundred year old box with 22 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.670
 negatives further laborious 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.619
 cooking work 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.180
 digitizing them defrosting offices 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.280
 one negative from another cleaning 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.080
 mold removal and so on and voila 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.459
 photo documented shia life 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.470
 researchers of the heroic age 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.209
 antarctic research and he's shah 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 negatives of that time were likely 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.840
 left in captain robert's hut 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.510
 Scott members of that part of the expedition 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.520
 Ernest Shackleton 1914 seventeenth year 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.230
 that came from the sea of ​​ross we kind of 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.730
 so just in case if anyone suddenly 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.140
 suddenly monstrously interesting 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.980
 heroic age of antarctic 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.690
 Research is the period from 1897 to 1922 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.250
 year when a series of expeditions took place 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.380
 research from arctis in time 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.800
 conquest of the south pole died 19 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.330
 person 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.920
 all very extreme conditions with 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.959
 wooden sail on steamboats and 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.940
 dog sledding on this is probably all 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.930
 with you was elena rasokhina 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.980
 subscribe put huskies if suddenly 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.930
 comet ride for anything 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.130
 Interestingly boldly throw it in
