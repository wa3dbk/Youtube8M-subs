is we want to put all the bottoms
towards<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> middle<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.430> work<00:02:06.090> our<00:02:06.390> way

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
towards the middle and work our way

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.800 
towards the middle and work our way
around<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.550> perimeter<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:09.179> flower<00:02:09.509> like

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
around the perimeter of the flower like

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.650 
around the perimeter of the flower like
