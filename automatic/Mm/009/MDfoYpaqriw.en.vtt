00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 hi guys my network today will be 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.210
 his and kiko hi tech eyeshadow these 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.910
 five color I bought and the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.730
 trade there are 18 many of you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 they will get confused because for example I 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.980
 I bought it and paid them 5 euros and 90 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.750
 one then looking at the kiko site 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.099
 like a couple of days ago I saw a 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.359
 offer type 2 euros 90 for porn sites 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.670
 shocked of good what the hell I have them 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 paid for double actually not but not there 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.960
 I paid where because these are the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.880
 formula new release and now there are 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.890
 discounted the old ones of the formula 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 old the packaging from the same then 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.489
 if you see it it happened when at 5 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.120
 times to understand the difference will be 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.789
 new ones 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 if they had taken me for a ride but 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.730
 this ones those new old ones 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.050
 they are two euros and 90 but they are not there 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.289
 lots of colors of old ones 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.690
 however it is a hair of a cat in the nose 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.840
 the product knows only in the part here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 of the cap therefore practically 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.010
 looking good inside there are 0.8 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 grams of product and the product 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.400
 practically this is good of course 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.320
 for example a bullshit a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.820
 this chemical eye shadow this is this 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.250
 a 3 grams of product four times 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 in short, less than this then there is 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.750
 really very little product 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.280
 inside to take it you must then there is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.960
 a kind of spring so you have to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.990
 put the tip in this way 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 soak the product I was paying for it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.979
 you can use and use it of course 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.409
 just a little duretta then apply 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.350
 the product quite well 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.490
 intense you see fade a little more 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.409
 difficult because being anyway 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 duretta but it bothers me about 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.030
 eyelids make too much pressure 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.890
 of course you have to have to take a little the 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.829
 patience to put in close each 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.049
 Once you feel that you do not there is 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.830
 more color on the Apennines 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.560
 so my vote for this product is 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.390
 drum roll 7 I give 7 because in 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.730
 a valid product, however, does not exist 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.780
 like this pack don't like doing it 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.780
 you have to stay there to put in 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.200
 close take is a bit one 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.940
 flapping is a job in more respect 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200
 to what we do anyway when 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.550
 we have an open pack with 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.590
 brush we simply take 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.840
 we put up but each time to take 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.590
 put it will close but you lose so much time 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 however it is not bad little product but it is not 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.400
 bad hello 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.550
 I was about to forget to show you the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.050
 colors that I have and this is then the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.270
 end the final result 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.510
 I must admit only the color 103 then 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:45.190
 only this nuanced and with mascara enough 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.120
 and this point number 103 104 116 113 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.400
 112 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.340
 the positive thing is that the release of 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.580
 color is immediate so you see 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.709
 not immediately not that it serves two stanley 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.010
 hours but have an intense color of 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.010
 this is positive
