00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
obviously that's going to vary from

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.510 
obviously that's going to vary from

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
Dreamland three pounds 60 which is it's

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.480 
Dreamland three pounds 60 which is it's
okay<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.460> suppose<00:04:36.920> price-wise<00:04:37.920> it's<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.310> good

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
okay I suppose price-wise it's a good

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.590 
okay I suppose price-wise it's a good
game<00:04:39.020> might<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.140> that<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:41.580> Double<00:04:41.970> Dragon

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
game might do that and Double Dragon

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.540 
game might do that and Double Dragon
for<00:04:42.870> instance<00:04:43.170> in<00:04:43.290> get<00:04:43.440> forty<00:04:43.710> pound<00:04:43.950> seventy

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
for instance in get forty pound seventy

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.720 
for instance in get forty pound seventy
I<00:04:44.900> guess<00:04:45.900> that's<00:04:46.110> about<00:04:46.230> four<00:04:47.190> dollars<00:04:47.400> or

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
I guess that's about four dollars or

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.130 
I guess that's about four dollars or
something<00:04:48.030> like<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:50.000> Donkey<00:04:51.000> Kong<00:04:51.270> 3<00:04:51.540> pound

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
something like that Donkey Kong 3 pound

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.930 
something like that Donkey Kong 3 pound
60<00:04:53.750> Legend<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.840> Zelda<00:04:55.320> 450<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.190> leeway<00:04:56.460> so<00:04:56.490> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
60 Legend of Zelda 450 a leeway so the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.790 
60 Legend of Zelda 450 a leeway so the
prices<00:04:57.270> aren't<00:04:57.420> too<00:04:57.720> bad<00:04:58.170> a<00:04:58.230> space<00:05:00.170> 270<00:05:01.170> not

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
prices aren't too bad a space 270 not

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.690 
prices aren't too bad a space 270 not
bad

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.440 

hopefully<00:05:05.540> they're<00:05:05.720> going<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.930> tag<00:05:06.170> in<00:05:06.380> the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
hopefully they're going to tag in the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.780 
hopefully they're going to tag in the
the<00:05:08.450> points<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.080> can<00:05:09.110> get<00:05:09.610> from<00:05:10.610> buying

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
the points that you can get from buying

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.140 
the points that you can get from buying
games<00:05:11.120> etc<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:11.990> think<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.490> star<00:05:13.490> system<00:05:14.030> in

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
games etc I think it's a star system in

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.560 
games etc I think it's a star system in
the<00:05:14.710> US<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.920> Canada<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.580> other<00:05:17.030> parts<00:05:17.390> of<00:05:17.450> the

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
the US and Canada and other parts of the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.280 
the US and Canada and other parts of the
world<00:05:17.690> and<00:05:18.280> Europe<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.490> Australia<00:05:20.270> it's<00:05:21.170> got

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
world and Europe and Australia it's got

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.720 
world and Europe and Australia it's got
the<00:05:21.350> point<00:05:21.620> system<00:05:21.830> where<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:22.190> get<00:05:22.310> I<00:05:22.520> think

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
the point system where you get I think

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.480 
the point system where you get I think
it's<00:05:22.850> 250<00:05:23.570> points<00:05:23.960> you<00:05:24.860> can<00:05:24.980> only<00:05:25.130> use<00:05:25.310> them

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
it's 250 points you can only use them

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.330 
it's 250 points you can only use them
for<00:05:25.640> buying<00:05:26.150> we<00:05:26.510> stuff<00:05:26.870> at<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.110> moment<00:05:27.340> I

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
for buying we stuff at the moment I

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.790 
for buying we stuff at the moment I
think<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:29.240> hopefully<00:05:30.230> they're<00:05:30.470> going<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.650> tie

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
think and hopefully they're going to tie

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.140 
think and hopefully they're going to tie
