separate seafood at better pages and

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.690 
separate seafood at better pages and
it's<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:55.329> as<00:00:55.510> simple<00:00:55.690> as<00:00:56.140> having<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.190> page

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
it's just as simple as having the page

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.830 
it's just as simple as having the page
open<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.600> when<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.559> put<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.860> glass<00:01:00.130> down<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
open and when you put the glass down it

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.829 
open and when you put the glass down it
will<00:01:02.140> keep<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.040> pages<00:01:03.460> down<00:01:03.730> and<00:01:04.059> all<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.660> do

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
will keep the pages down and all you do

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.249 
will keep the pages down and all you do
is<00:01:04.989> push<00:01:05.320> this<00:01:05.560> button<00:01:05.800> and<00:01:06.690> it<00:01:07.690> scans<00:01:08.050> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
is push this button and it scans the

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:10.710 
is push this button and it scans the
page<00:01:08.560> and<00:01:08.920> it<00:01:09.100> will<00:01:09.130> show<00:01:09.399> up<00:01:09.580> on<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:10.240> computer

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
page and it will show up on the computer

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.770 
page and it will show up on the computer
and<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:11.530> actually<00:01:11.710> makes<00:01:12.160> an<00:01:12.520> image<00:01:13.030> for<00:01:13.630> each

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
and it actually makes an image for each

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.560 
and it actually makes an image for each
page<00:01:14.170> separately<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:18.729> fairly<00:01:19.090> quick

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
page separately and it's fairly quick

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.100 
page separately and it's fairly quick
and<00:01:19.869> easy<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:21.009> do<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:22.000> can<00:01:22.210> do<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.539> almost<00:01:22.869> as

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
and easy to do you can do it almost as

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.810 
and easy to do you can do it almost as
fast<00:01:23.350> as<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.650> can<00:01:23.890> turn<00:01:24.159> the<00:01:24.310> pages<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:26.820> easy

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
fast as you can turn the pages an easy

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.130 
fast as you can turn the pages an easy
book<00:01:28.150> with<00:01:28.450> somebody<00:01:28.840> who<00:01:28.930> knows<00:01:29.080> what

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
book with somebody who knows what

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.370 
book with somebody who knows what
they're<00:01:29.380> doing<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.830> can<00:01:30.220> do<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.970> 300<00:01:31.750> pages<00:01:32.020> an

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
they're doing you can do to 300 pages an

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.820 
they're doing you can do to 300 pages an
hour<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:34.659> not<00:01:34.869> as<00:01:34.990> fast<00:01:35.229> as<00:01:35.439> some<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
hour it's not as fast as some of the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.710 
hour it's not as fast as some of the
mechanical<00:01:36.820> ones<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.180> do<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.420> on<00:01:37.510> their<00:01:37.659> own

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
mechanical ones that do it on their own

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.230 
mechanical ones that do it on their own
but<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.170> fairly<00:01:38.409> quick<00:01:38.830> considering<00:01:39.549> most

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
but it's fairly quick considering most

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.109 
but it's fairly quick considering most
of<00:01:40.479> the<00:01:40.840> missionaries<00:01:41.439> or<00:01:41.680> the<00:01:41.970> 70s<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.470> it's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
of the missionaries or the 70s so it's

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.640 
of the missionaries or the 70s so it's
simple<00:01:46.119> enough<00:01:46.180> to<00:01:46.570> do<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.990> what<00:01:47.530> are<00:01:47.590> you

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
simple enough to do and what are you

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.310 
simple enough to do and what are you
looking<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.189> honestly<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.930> screens

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
looking for honestly on the screens

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.480 
looking for honestly on the screens
we're<00:01:50.590> looking<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.250> make<00:01:51.430> sure<00:01:51.790> that<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
we're looking to make sure that the the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.880 
we're looking to make sure that the the
lines<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.600> are<00:01:55.810> there<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> red<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.619> green

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
lines that are there a red and green

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.390 
lines that are there a red and green
that<00:01:57.790> shows<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.240> outer<00:01:58.450> limit<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.140> the<00:02:00.100> page

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
that shows the outer limit of the page

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.230 
that shows the outer limit of the page
and<00:02:00.790> so<00:02:01.570> we<00:02:01.780> want<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.079> make<00:02:02.259> sure<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:03.240> like

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and so we want to make sure that like

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.069 
and so we want to make sure that like
here<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:04.840> don't<00:02:04.990> want<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.159> words<00:02:06.400> cut<00:02:06.880> off<00:02:07.079> or

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
here we don't want the words cut off or

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.230 
here we don't want the words cut off or
too<00:02:08.590> much<00:02:08.739> black

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
too much black

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.620 
too much black
and<00:02:10.360> then<00:02:10.840> when<00:02:11.080> we<00:02:11.110> scan<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:13.060> going<00:02:13.510> to

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
and then when we scan it it's going to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.200 
and then when we scan it it's going to
pop<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.900> bigger<00:02:14.610> giving<00:02:15.610> us<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.880> better<00:02:16.090> chance

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
pop up bigger giving us a better chance

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.510 
pop up bigger giving us a better chance
to<00:02:17.110> make<00:02:17.380> sure<00:02:17.620> we're<00:02:17.860> not<00:02:17.890> cutting<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.400> off

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
to make sure we're not cutting it off

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.690 
to make sure we're not cutting it off
and<00:02:18.820> it<00:02:18.970> gives<00:02:19.210> us<00:02:19.420> an<00:02:19.750> image<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.620> what<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and it gives us an image of what the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.760 
and it gives us an image of what the
words<00:02:21.910> look<00:02:22.240> like<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.960> make<00:02:23.110> sure<00:02:23.320> they<00:02:23.470> didn't

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
words look like to make sure they didn't

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.210 
words look like to make sure they didn't
get<00:02:23.920> blurred<00:02:24.960> because<00:02:25.960> eventually<00:02:26.740> what

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
get blurred because eventually what

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.550 
get blurred because eventually what
these<00:02:27.520> books<00:02:27.880> we<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.360> only<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.960> books<00:02:29.170> that

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
these books we do only the books that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.090 
these books we do only the books that
are<00:02:30.040> out<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.640> copyright<00:02:31.180> right<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.320> so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
are out of copyright right now and so
