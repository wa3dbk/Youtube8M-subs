00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.940

 and a shorts short end of days 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.010
 each side that the band launches two volumes 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.079

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.799
 2006 by michael bendis and david mec 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.840
 only in 2013 as if it was released there 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.759
 off being critically acclaimed 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.009

 You first have to read by eyes. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:23.729
 closed because it is a story of the 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.960
 demon to the globe 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.369
 this story is one of the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.560
 recently in history because the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.450
 debtor is one of the heroes of marvel who 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 There are more classics and this one is 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.869
 different is that a compilation of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.000
 all the demolisher mythology all 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.979
 linked to a plot in the art is happening 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.940
 the demolisher who finally measures edge 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.940
 was killed if he has no middle ground and died 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.740
 it shows the end of everything as it would be 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.049
 last story of the demolisher showing 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.119
 death of club doctor michael bendis 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.860
 and 80 showed the vision of how the 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.780
 world losing one of its largest 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.780
 marvel heroes in the case of the demolisher 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.280
 here is no middle ground mexico than 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.170
 he really died and last word 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.269
 who told him that he pronounced it was 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.970
 maicon nobody knows the meaning of this 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.829
 the medium where the word said by means 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.690
 before dying it becomes so strong that 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.239
 His revelation is not even done 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.250
 impressive was just an excuse to 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.840
 today who discovered who was mete murdock 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.700
 really 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.470
 and then that went well in the link to who 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.880
 meet a reporter from the marvel universe 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.650
 that would be equivalent to a hobby like 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.780
 spider man the reporter spent his life 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.340
 involved with the deeds of the hero to the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.090
 end of days that brings another tale 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.430
 about the for the ultimate hero demolisher 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.760
 From the kitchen of hell he died and then 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.819
 the story begins to show the whole life of 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.099
 residents 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:50.019
 in franchise format on your uniform 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.150
 we clearly think of him as someone 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.439
 gloomy though demolisher pass 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.280
 far from being one of the heroes of the 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.989
 marvel universe 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.879
 although its most known phases have 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.040
 he as tired hero revolted with 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.709
 something but it's not the sad face and 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.329
 yes, cheerful but realistic looking and 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.280
 said the team of artists in a somber tone 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.909
 brought back as a backdrop for 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.859
 the story 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.419
 but when everything with the main seasoning 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.090
 of the 80 's character 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.950
 your human side so here it already shows 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.750
 several hero with serious noise 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
 you 're old enough you're trying to do the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.010
 Of course his last job is 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.900
 To unravel this death here is about stir and 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.500
 the impact of his death on the city of new 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.569
 york 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.699
 the dive that stars the series and 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.260
 collecting every piece his life and 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.750
 interviews in interrogations with 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
 characters that were part of the routine 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.260
 from mette murdoch 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.599
 there is an imminent danger about the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.400
 urique in which he is sinking then 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.900
 he goes there and goes on the elektro and see the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.579
 panic and turned sort of a hannibal 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.129
 lecter did not want to take people but he 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.109
 is very reclusive o the parties like the 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.269
 Scenarios are excellent even with the 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.530
 dirt darkness after the hero's death 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.989
 the only one who seems to be walking in a 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.939
 light in the kitchen of hell every 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.379
 haunted alley where the hero passed 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.509
 has something to show him 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.629
 so this whole thing has several points 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:03.340
 tall face is a clear tribute to life 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.169
 the demolishing everything he went with 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.879
 frank mille's writer safar 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.859
 including who draws the couple here 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.109
 danced accompanying miller in the failure of 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.840
 motor in open areas and everything and 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.849
 This one is really a tribute. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.590
 biological build the entire image 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.229
 hell kitchen hero ben hur 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.759
 he became obsessed with this thing so 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.430
 and the most religious characters in the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.229
 Close marvel for a picky boxer 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.750
 out of the standards of any parent of the year 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:31.180
 very kind, dead in cold blood 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.229
 I was lost, the guy always had his 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.229
 random beliefs 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.930
 moved by revenge at the time trained 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.550
 by stretching the blind to learn discipline 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.320
 in combat form was soon walking 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.159
 alleys and buildings 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.289
 The strange that the kitchen of hell 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:45.880
 always showed something for medium 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.830
 in theory that neighborhood became their 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.590
 eyes he knows everything that happened 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.719
 in that place conquering friends and 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.219
 making many enemies through 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:59.800
 various elements that have made man 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:05:03.389
 without fear of getting resolved were divided 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.389
 because of this 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.449
 divided this one into two parts would be 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.889
 much cooler to put everything in a 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:17.919
 hardcover notebook I would pay 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.810
 easily 40 contos 66 would charge this and 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.339
 because the story really is very good 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.010
 especially for those who are fans and know 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.839
 take some time because I do not 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.639
 I'll tell you that you need 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.500
 law is here but really if you 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.479
 You want to get here and demolition has 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.490
 various clues of the whole past is 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.930
 a cool way for you to get to know 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.960
 the story of the hero they talk a little 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.940
 of past stories have representations 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.130
 own pace here is totally 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.469
 standardized a climate in the air all this is 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.419
 all serious really all that 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.210
 macu breaker must be a character 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.419
 dark though macworld is not a 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.969
 person that will go funny and friend of 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.039
 spider man canton has a whole spirit 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:59.710
 This is not where the fans will like the cover. 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.779
 which shows the demolisher already dead in 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.580
 one of the cool covers on several covers has 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.380
 alex brown's cases just chose 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.630
 furlan was the promo that was well 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.849
 Nice to see the second part. 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.529
 art needs no comment has the cloud 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.169
 loop which is the phase took himself 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.690
 free miner Alex without a barrier in the 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.669
 Raven Moon Knight and also 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.229
 own demolisher of recent times has 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.900
 the bill sienkiewicz fantastic artist 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.639
 made adaptations of classic books of the 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.039
 drawings are always above expectation 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.690
 and here he looks so good or still 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.300
 better than we expected 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:33.580
 although he thinks that his work moby 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.289
 dick is the most flawless thing and to live and 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.180
 It 's Mac's duty. I do not know if you can help me. 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.830
 wrote the artist also for whom 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.520
 know of developed machines that are 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.259
 very good 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.880
 he designed the covers and the good of 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:44.650
 write nothing then the pair is 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.520
 returning to the demolisher for that 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.949
 phase 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.139
 the elector that the demon of the body goes 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.759
 win the series now netflix will call 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.830
 since jonas I do not know why not put 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.190
 the name is because it already has up to a number 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.470
 The most expensive company you have 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.599
 what to see that means is not you have 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.919
 what laws here is really the same thing 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:04.629
 for anyone who has never read anything from a book 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.060
 You can take the one that forms you. 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.919
 They will stay until I recommend that you take 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.389
 You can be curious and try 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:13.060
 look for another character for whom 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.099
 It's getting a lot of cheap tap 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.569
 cloakrooms already in the first edition and handle 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.520
 the second volume and I do not know if it will leave 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:20.830
 but who won this month but it is very 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.889
 Worthwhile face is the love story is one 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.440
 a history totally focused on the 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:27.400
 public of the guy I but all the legend that 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.680
 he became right 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.520
 after death the ecobank brought here from 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.690
 A well-informed way is beautiful. 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.270
 end- of-day teaser without an excellent 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.740
 return to fashionable life with memories of 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.969
 a bygone era that's still worth it 

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.069
 visit 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:44.219
 no matter that you're worth it 

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:46.060
 meet the hero of the kitchen of hell 

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:48.900
 as a deviation from c 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.900
 death is the only certainty
