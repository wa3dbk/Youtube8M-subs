00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.460
 what goes down because I only times 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.320
 Roger that 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.120
 Today I want you to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.469
 Inferno may show the fanatic 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.969
 some may already know some 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.330
 not and accordingly I will you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.250
 Show the three smogs he needs and 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.840
 yes, it works again 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.730
 once again the whole thing should work 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.980
 goal is finished when tees the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 of course, it makes sense that he bombs 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.500
 could be distracted so plan on 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.759
 Bring it and then from banana to 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.920
 spreads easily from the area of 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.559
 The bomb might be planned for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.360
 fanatics which she needs show her 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 I need you once who knows you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.780
 all the nice smoky counts 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.570
 the here in the area lands umpteen 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 Direct morning then needed a smoke 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.829
 to the Rhine dazzling there and one lands 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 smog landing there, why you clearly 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.430
 want the player and the player the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.079
 take a look at the plan and blomes 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.410
 went through safe or good is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.559
 this circus around the bomb too 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 finish that is three smog a310 then 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.559
 the bomb by dazzling with luck 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 defend in it if you do not win 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.070
 The next bomb blinding only good 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.030
 played eco that is more important for the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.100
 but mankind I'll show you now 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.750
 first box and catch the tan the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.650
 behind the grill should be here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 because it puts you in the back corner 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.610
 and then you see now that much is clear 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.860
 but there you have this still you see that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.390
 yes and take a little further to the right 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.880
 this hole is about where I am now 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.479
 who smoke on the smoke because then here flies 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.869
 wide on the roof off so against the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.560
 grill and from terrorism, of course, heads 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.060
 times experts is ne gap brings 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.229
 yes it was not risk not see 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.119
 they would have to drip down if they did 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 under drops you can see that quite simply 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.479
 and could defense it's about it 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.890
 more really that you there your 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.990
 your bomb can dazzle so that the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.560
 first smoke the second half here 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.780
 behind 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 the important thing is that they still exist 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.490
 On the top you see, man, you are after you 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.350
 Above it says so and then just with 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.350
 The trend here is the style here 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.960
 yes and there with the customers is the smog 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.030
 then go out the day 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.770
 and lands her where she should land 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.200
 so now we do it again in 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.480
 interplay I will be problem this time 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.099
 the 10 km h also covered the cs mobbt 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.720
 or do you have the several options 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.849
 throw the cds i throw the for 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.140
 usually always from here yes chimney 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.360
 transient on the cable today 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.930
 some of them are doing that too 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.190
 here 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.580
 then he is so easy on the 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.720
 aim chimney there you have yours 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.680
 citizen box or a little like 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.170
 i'm sorry for putting it on here 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.269
 right then over the chance then 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.709
 pull and you have csu too 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.370
 rifles variants to throw the 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.900
 I'll show you this again 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.010
 play together so we start with 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.030
 The jewelry for the grill so go there 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:58.950
 zack then dct 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
 zack and then the dazzle 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.840
 and then give it to the spot peter bombs 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.900
 The interaction looks like this with turboprop 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:13.510
 and then you can be quite safety 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.100
 blanton you see you will see yeah 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.720
 and then you can banana from here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.190
 from all over the place defend this 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.680
 like fields you can use cable drum 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.870
 care they care can one here 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.340
 put up a bit of cover, too 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.420
 maybe still has power 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.670
 doing so etc then you can cover and 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.840
 that's all the econetic finds 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.640
 was imposed against Japan seems 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 I invented has wanted ever 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.459
 might show in some 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.970
