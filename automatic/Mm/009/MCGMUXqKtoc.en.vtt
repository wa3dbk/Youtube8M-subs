 a pass and go with light 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 changes to the recipe 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.680
 traditional in order to make this dessert 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.480

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.910
 this video you have links 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.009
 so let's go for the preparation I 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.719
 will start by preparing the cream 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.670
 called kiev to and for that I say naked of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.200
 cornstarch in 2 tablespoons 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.480
 of cold milk I used a spoon 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.559
 a good soup spoon well rounded 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:54.180
 cornstarch I pour the leftovers of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:05.960
 milk in a saucepan to do it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:05.960
 to boil by now I add sugar 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.549
 the stick of kamel 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.650
 I also add cornstarch 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.360
 diluted in milk and I continue to 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.130
 mix over low heat without stopping 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:39.890
 for five minutes 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:41.750
 the cream must thicken towards the end you 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.119
 add a tablespoon of water of 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 Orange Blossom 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.200
 to make this cream smoother 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.940
 play the girl in a small strainer and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:58.550
 I reserve it at the expense thereafter 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:02:00.110
 time then it's the second step of 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.030
 our recipe would be the facts of 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.250
 bricks or filo paste that we go 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.170
 cut into a circle you can 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.750
 help a handsome returned or a big 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.700
 glass or a cookie cutter you 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.810
 also preheated the oven to 180 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.489
 degrees using a brush I'm going 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.239
 start a no breakfast but a 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.190
 sorrow of cut leaves the pose 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.010
 on the plate of the banknote oven 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.510
 parchment paper and every time I 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.510
 go bunk three circles 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.450
 cover the sheets with paper 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.239
 greaseproof and put a plate on it 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.700
 before baking that it will prevent 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.459
 leaves to separate in cooking a 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.290
 once in the oven it will have to keep a 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.610
 look on because it's going very fast 5 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.150
 10 minutes is enough for them 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.440
 take a nice color 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.900
 so here we see the effect came out of the 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.910
 well crispy golden brown oven and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
 have stayed well right this is thanks to 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.630
 the plate we put on it I find 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.720
 that it's more aesthetic level of the 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.440
 presentation and we will go to editing 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.220
 of our bastia which is very simple 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.260
 besides it must be done at the 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.049
 last minute for the leaves 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.819
 keep it up so we're just going 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.329
 internals and layers I put a 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.220
 spoon a sheet of brick over 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:37.230
 I will put a good spoon to 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.290
 cream soup some almonds 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.299
 crushed grilled and so on 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.299
 we can do three to four layers 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.659
 so we come to the end of our recipe 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.250
 I just have to decorate a little bit 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.919
 the plate with a little powder of 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.949
 cinnamon and to serve without waiting 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.569
 I hope this recipe has fled 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.669

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.669
