00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
like my head the photoshop mock-up and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.030 
like my head the photoshop mock-up and
it<00:00:33.540> was<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> four-part<00:00:34.559> tutorial

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it was actually a four-part tutorial

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.720 
it was actually a four-part tutorial
what<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> did<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.960> opened<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.710> movie<00:00:38.129> HD

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
what I did is I opened up I movie HD

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
what I did is I opened up I movie HD
because<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.540> found<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.020> one<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.350> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because I found that one to be the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
because I found that one to be the
easiest<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.219> was<00:00:41.370> easier<00:00:41.670> than<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.940> movie<00:00:42.270> 08

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
easiest it was easier than I movie 08

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.529 
easiest it was easier than I movie 08
mainly<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.829> has<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> timeline<00:00:44.789> right

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
mainly because it has the timeline right

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
mainly because it has the timeline right
here<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.989> it's<00:00:46.170> easier<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> export<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
here and it's easier to export it and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.020 
here and it's easier to export it and
split<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.210> all<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.570> fun<00:00:49.320> stuff<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.280> if

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
split it and all that fun stuff so if

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.750 
split it and all that fun stuff so if
you<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:51.629> movie<00:00:51.930> HD<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.610> have

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.960 
just now we can see the entire video and
I'm<00:02:05.780> going<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:05.930> make<00:02:06.050> my<00:02:06.200> video<00:02:06.500> smaller<00:02:07.070> using

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
I'm going to make my video smaller using

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.320 
I'm going to make my video smaller using
these<00:02:08.090> little<00:02:08.450> nails<00:02:08.680> because<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.880> makes<00:02:11.180> it

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
these little nails because it makes it

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.480 
these little nails because it makes it
easier<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.600> drag<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.440> I'm<00:02:12.920> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.250> stop

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
easier to drag and I'm going to stop

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.150 
easier to drag and I'm going to stop
this<00:02:13.520> video<00:02:14.060> about<00:02:14.620> 152<00:02:15.620> because<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.950> think

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
this video about 152 because I think

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.460 
this video about 152 because I think
that's<00:02:16.280> where<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.430> stopped<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.910> on<00:02:17.470> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
that's where I stopped to get on the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.400 
that's where I stopped to get on the
actual<00:02:18.770> video<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:21.020> should<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.290> good

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
actual video so that should be good

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.070 
actual video so that should be good
right<00:02:21.590> there<00:02:21.830> oh<00:02:22.070> now<00:02:22.790> i<00:02:22.820> can<00:02:23.120> zoom<00:02:23.150> into<00:02:23.690> it

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
right there oh now i can zoom into it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.480 
right there oh now i can zoom into it
and<00:02:24.770> i<00:02:25.459> can<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.820> more<00:02:26.000> precise<00:02:27.310> position<00:02:28.310> on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
and i can get a more precise position on

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.260 
and i can get a more precise position on
this<00:02:29.120> I'm<00:02:29.420> gonna<00:02:29.600> stop<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.959> about<00:02:30.110> right<00:02:31.270> there

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
over back over here then ice now you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.260 
over back over here then ice now you
have<00:02:43.700> two<00:02:43.970> videos<00:02:44.330> one<00:02:44.890> way<00:02:45.910> longer<00:02:46.910> than<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
have two videos one way longer than I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.560 
have two videos one way longer than I
want<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.600> be<00:02:47.720> so<00:02:48.200> I'll<00:02:48.320> just<00:02:48.350> undo<00:02:48.950> that

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
want it to be so I'll just undo that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.510 
want it to be so I'll just undo that
come<00:02:50.570> back<00:02:50.780> over<00:02:51.260> here

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:03.640 

29<00:02:55.520> 52<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.290> should<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.740> just<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> make

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
29 52 so it should be just going to make

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.980 
29 52 so it should be just going to make
this<00:03:03.830> smaller<00:03:04.130> I<00:03:04.550> think<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.420> got<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.720> point

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
this smaller I think you got the point

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.530 
this smaller I think you got the point
right<00:03:06.590> I'll<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.520> stop<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.850> there<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
right I'll just stop it there just so I

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.880 
right I'll just stop it there just so I
can<00:03:08.660> go<00:03:08.990> ahead<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:10.100> this<00:03:11.710> should<00:03:12.710> have

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
can go ahead and do this should have

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.280 
can go ahead and do this should have
done<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:13.160> there<00:03:13.970> we<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.210> okay<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:14.990> now<00:03:15.230> we

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
done that there we go okay so now we

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.370 
done that there we go okay so now we
have<00:03:15.380> our<00:03:15.530> two<00:03:15.710> Clips<00:03:15.980> again<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:17.600> export

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
have our two Clips again and to export

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.760 
have our two Clips again and to export
this<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:19.540> maybe<00:03:20.540> HD<00:03:20.870> will<00:03:21.110> not<00:03:21.230> automatically

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
this I maybe HD will not automatically

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.120 
this I maybe HD will not automatically
split<00:03:22.280> each<00:03:22.730> clip<00:03:23.300> into<00:03:23.570> its<00:03:23.810> own<00:03:23.990> video<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.950> I

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
split each clip into its own video and I

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.250 
split each clip into its own video and I
don't<00:03:25.370> think<00:03:25.580> you<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:26.030> do<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.420> from

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
don't think you can do that from

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.650 
don't think you can do that from
everywhere<00:03:27.830> that<00:03:28.100> I've<00:03:28.220> looked<00:03:28.520> on<00:03:28.700> here<00:03:29.000> so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660
