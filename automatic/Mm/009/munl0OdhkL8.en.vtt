especially when you're swapping the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
especially when you're swapping the
manipulators<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> off<00:01:16.619> at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.950> end<00:01:17.280> of

manipulators on and off at the end of
the<00:01:17.580> forearms<00:01:18.060> that's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.840> huge<00:01:19.140> issue<00:01:19.350> those

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the forearms that's a huge issue those

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
the forearms that's a huge issue those
parts<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.310> fit<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:20.729> very<00:01:20.759> well<00:01:21.060> so

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
parts don't fit in there very well so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.690 
parts don't fit in there very well so
you've<00:01:22.049> got<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.280> careful

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
you've got to be really really careful

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.660 
you've got to be really really careful
now<00:01:24.630> another<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:26.070> goes<00:01:26.100> along<00:01:26.400> with

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
now another thing that goes along with

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.569 
now another thing that goes along with
the<00:01:26.909> losing<00:01:27.600> parts<00:01:28.020> thing<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.250> when

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the losing parts thing is that when

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
the losing parts thing is that when
you've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.759> these<00:01:30.090> hands<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.900> master

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
you've got these hands that are master

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.429 
you've got these hands that are master
great<00:01:31.530> quality<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:32.369> high-grade<00:01:33.270> size<00:01:33.600> you're

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
great quality but high-grade size you're

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
great quality but high-grade size you're
gonna<00:01:34.619> end<00:01:34.860> up<00:01:34.979> having<00:01:35.040> lost<00:01:35.850> digits<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> my

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gonna end up having lost digits and my

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.109 
gonna end up having lost digits and my
real<00:01:37.170> great<00:01:37.439> Gundam<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> has<00:01:38.310> already<00:01:38.700> lost<00:01:38.909> a

real great Gundam it has already lost a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.999 
real great Gundam it has already lost a
couple<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.810> anyway<00:01:40.439> you've<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> be

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
couple and anyway you've just got to be

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
couple and anyway you've just got to be
pretty<00:01:41.250> much<00:01:41.400> careful<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.180> whatever

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
pretty much careful with this whatever

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.649 
pretty much careful with this whatever
you<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.399> now<00:01:44.399> along<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> same<00:01:44.970> lines<00:01:45.240> when<00:01:45.540> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you do now along the same lines when you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
you do now along the same lines when you
try<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> balance<00:01:46.170> them<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> ground<00:01:46.920> again

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
try to balance them on the ground again

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.490 
try to balance them on the ground again
because<00:01:48.119> you've<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.509> legs<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:49.200> their

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
because you've got the legs with their

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.469 
because you've got the legs with their
multiple<00:01:50.220> moving<00:01:50.430> positions<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
multiple moving positions and then you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.700 
multiple moving positions and then you
can<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> feet<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.439> three

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
can have the feet and it's three

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
can have the feet and it's three
different<00:01:52.860> things<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.479> something<00:01:54.479> as

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
different things just something as

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
different things just something as
simple<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.170> putting<00:01:55.409> them<00:01:55.710> flush<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
simple as just putting them flush on the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.080 
simple as just putting them flush on the
ground<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:57.090> seem<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.840> little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.409> annoying<00:01:59.280> no

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
ground can seem a little bit annoying no

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.340 
ground can seem a little bit annoying no
it's<00:02:00.299> not<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> end<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> world<00:02:01.079> it's<00:02:01.320> only

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it's not the end of the world it's only

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.660 
it's not the end of the world it's only
gonna<00:02:01.560> take<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> few<00:02:02.100> seconds<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.579> get

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
gonna take you a few seconds to get

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.069 
gonna take you a few seconds to get
everything<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.689> old<00:02:03.840> high

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
everything right but with the old high

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.660 
everything right but with the old high
grades<00:02:04.350> were<00:02:04.500> used<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.219> having

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
grades were used to just having

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.399 
grades were used to just having
everything<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.270> ball-joint<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:07.049> an<00:02:07.170> ankle

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
everything on a ball-joint on an ankle

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.059 
everything on a ball-joint on an ankle
and<00:02:07.560> that's<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.279 
and that's it
bang<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.849> flat<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> ground<00:02:09.539> here<00:02:10.080> you've

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
bang it's flat on the ground here you've

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.630 
bang it's flat on the ground here you've
just<00:02:10.500> got<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> little<00:02:11.250> bit<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
just got to take that a little bit of

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.700 
just got to take that a little bit of
time<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.349> upper

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
time that if you're at the upper

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.490 
time that if you're at the upper
the<00:02:13.950> posing<00:02:14.510> spectrum<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.990> will<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.320> no

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the posing spectrum you will have no

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.130 
the posing spectrum you will have no
problems<00:02:16.950> doing<00:02:17.250> now<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.510> couple<00:02:18.810> other<00:02:18.990> things

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
problems doing now a couple other things

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.710 
problems doing now a couple other things
the<00:02:19.620> arms<00:02:20.220> came<00:02:20.580> across<00:02:20.880> as<00:02:21.210> being<00:02:21.240> really

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the arms came across as being really

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
the arms came across as being really
flimsy<00:02:21.990> especially<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.800> bend<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.220> that's

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
flimsy especially the bend and that's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.330 
flimsy especially the bend and that's
mostly<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.240> fault<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.380> bicep<00:02:26.160> in

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
mostly the fault here of the bicep in

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.250 
mostly the fault here of the bicep in
the<00:02:26.430> back<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.720> again<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.990> Ben

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the back of that but again the Ben

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.840 
the back of that but again the Ben
mechanism<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:28.950> good<00:02:29.160> but<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.460> arms<00:02:29.700> don't

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
mechanism is good but the arms don't

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.240 
mechanism is good but the arms don't
come<00:02:30.060> across<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.600> being<00:02:30.780> as<00:02:31.020> good<00:02:31.230> or<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.530> solid

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
come across as being as good or as solid

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
come across as being as good or as solid
off<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.580> legs<00:02:32.820> which<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.930> bit

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
off the legs which is a little bit

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.190 
off the legs which is a little bit
disappointing<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.950> then<00:02:35.760> what<00:02:36.450> else<00:02:36.630> well

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
disappointing and then what else well

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500 
disappointing and then what else well
the<00:02:37.290> heat<00:02:37.500> axe<00:02:37.710> is<00:02:38.010> dull<00:02:38.700> though<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.330> put<00:02:39.480> a

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
the heat axe is dull though if you put a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.820 
the heat axe is dull though if you put a
little<00:02:39.720> bit<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.930> shiny<00:02:40.140> silver<00:02:40.350> paint<00:02:40.650> on

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
little bit of shiny silver paint on

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.440 
little bit of shiny silver paint on
there<00:02:40.980> I'm<00:02:41.160> sure<00:02:41.490> you<00:02:41.640> could<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.270> up

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
there I'm sure you could just that up

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.550 
there I'm sure you could just that up
without<00:02:43.350> too<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:43.740> difficulty<00:02:45.320> seriously<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
without too much difficulty seriously I

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.460 
without too much difficulty seriously I
didn't<00:02:47.490> put<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.700> decals<00:02:47.940> on<00:02:48.330> here<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.170> on

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
didn't put the decals on here because on

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.320 
didn't put the decals on here because on
my<00:02:49.680> Gundam<00:02:50.010> they<00:02:50.130> look<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:50.700> good<00:02:50.970> although<00:02:51.210> a

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
my Gundam they look very good although a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.540 
my Gundam they look very good although a
few<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:52.050> decided<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.530> peel<00:02:52.680> off<00:02:52.890> so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
few of them have decided to peel off so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.950 
few of them have decided to peel off so
I'll<00:02:53.640> probably<00:02:53.790> put<00:02:54.090> them<00:02:54.180> on<00:02:54.300> later<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.780> for

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
I'll probably put them on later but for

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.720 
I'll probably put them on later but for
now<00:02:55.020> I'm<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.680> gonna<00:02:55.950> stay<00:02:56.190> neutral<00:02:56.580> although

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
now I'm just gonna stay neutral although

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
now I'm just gonna stay neutral although
it's<00:02:57.030> great<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.780> give<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.050> decals<00:02:58.440> of

kits fun things like the piping when you

kits fun things like the piping when you
take<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.640> used<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.120> take<00:04:21.270> the<00:04:21.390> time<00:04:21.540> to<00:04:21.570> run

a lining marker over everything and I

a lining marker over everything and I
remember<00:04:24.510> how<00:04:24.630> annoying<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.169> could<00:04:25.350> be

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
remember how annoying that could be

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.370 
remember how annoying that could be
and<00:04:25.770> in<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.910> case<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.900> don't<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.290> do

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
and in this case you don't have to do

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.200 
and in this case you don't have to do
any<00:04:28.560> lining<00:04:28.860> because<00:04:29.160> they<00:04:29.310> had<00:04:29.490> such<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.820> good

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
any lining because they had such a good

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.930 
any lining because they had such a good
design<00:04:30.720> for<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.500> piping<00:04:31.919> or<00:04:32.340> you<00:04:32.520> just<00:04:32.669> take

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
design for the piping or you just take

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.460 
design for the piping or you just take
the<00:04:33.120> parts<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.600> stick<00:04:33.840> them<00:04:33.990> right<00:04:34.230> through

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the parts you stick them right through

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.620 
the parts you stick them right through
it's<00:04:34.830> even<00:04:35.100> got<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.520> little<00:04:35.550> bumps<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.480> that

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
it's even got the little bumps so that

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.150 
it's even got the little bumps so that
you<00:04:36.720> can<00:04:36.870> just<00:04:37.050> slide<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.410> part<00:04:37.620> right<00:04:37.800> inside

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
you can just slide the part right inside

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.940 
you can just slide the part right inside
there<00:04:38.370> everything<00:04:39.300> works<00:04:39.510> out<00:04:39.690> well<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.290> they

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
there everything works out well and they

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.010 
there everything works out well and they
even<00:04:41.250> have<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.610> appropriate<00:04:42.060> bends<00:04:42.660> built

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
even have the appropriate bends built

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.720 
even have the appropriate bends built
into<00:04:43.380> them<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:43.830> you<00:04:43.919> want<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.130> get<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> head

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
into them so if you want to get the head

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.420 
into them so if you want to get the head
piping<00:04:45.660> matching<00:04:46.080> up<00:04:46.200> left<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.620> right<00:04:46.710> you

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
piping matching up left and right you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.860 
piping matching up left and right you
can<00:04:47.610> do<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.850> if<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.090> take<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.419> time<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.630> get

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
can do that if you take the time to get

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.800 
can do that if you take the time to get
everything<00:04:49.410> better<00:04:50.300> twisted<00:04:51.300> into<00:04:51.480> just<00:04:51.690> the

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
everything better twisted into just the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.750 
everything better twisted into just the
right<00:04:51.960> place<00:04:52.230> so<00:04:52.440> that<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:53.100> little<00:04:53.340> cutouts

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
right place so that the little cutouts

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.210 
right place so that the little cutouts
on<00:04:53.940> each<00:04:54.090> corner<00:04:54.389> match<00:04:54.810> up<00:04:55.220> brilliant

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
on each corner match up brilliant

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.810 
on each corner match up brilliant
overall<00:04:57.200> now<00:04:58.200> another<00:04:58.500> positive<00:04:58.740> thing<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.310> had

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
to leave one off just to show my

annoyance though the individual skirts

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.940 
annoyance though the individual skirts
because<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:04.020> have<00:05:04.200> that<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.560> can<00:05:04.740> get<00:05:04.830> the
