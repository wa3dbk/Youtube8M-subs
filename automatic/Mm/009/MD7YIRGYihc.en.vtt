00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so let me show you the latest thing I've

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.889 
so let me show you the latest thing I've
been<00:00:04.080> working<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:05.210> got<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> couple<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.629> cars

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
been working on I got a couple of cars

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.459 
been working on I got a couple of cars
and<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:08.099> the<00:00:08.340> keys<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.120> one<00:00:10.460> have<00:00:11.460> this<00:00:11.670> nice

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
and on the keys for one have this nice

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.049 
and on the keys for one have this nice
you're<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> thing<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.250> deal<00:00:14.460> with<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> locks

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you're the thing to deal with the locks

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.930 
you're the thing to deal with the locks
and<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:16.230> alarm<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.920> integrated<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.640> key

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and the alarm is integrated with the key

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.599 
and the alarm is integrated with the key
and<00:00:18.840> then<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.710> where

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
and then I have this other one where

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.279 
and then I have this other one where
it's<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.939> integrated<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.779> key<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
it's not integrated with the key and in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.470 
it's not integrated with the key and in
fact<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:22.859> broken<00:00:23.160> off<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.180> doesn't<00:00:24.420> even

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
fact it's broken off and it doesn't even

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.000 
fact it's broken off and it doesn't even
touch<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.050> keys<00:00:25.260> are<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> carry<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
touch the keys are going to carry this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.509 
touch the keys are going to carry this
stupid<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.430> around<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.900> key<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.590> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
stupid thing around and a key and I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.720 
stupid thing around and a key and I
would<00:00:29.699> really<00:00:30.000> like<00:00:30.320> these<00:00:31.320> two<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.279> like

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
would really like these two to be like

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.310 
would really like these two to be like
this<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.480> it's<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.710> better<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.309> way<00:00:36.320> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
this one it's much better this way so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.700 
this one it's much better this way so
how<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.730> well<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> could

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
how to do this well you know I could

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.840 
how to do this well you know I could
just<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.100> super<00:00:41.820> glue<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.739> I

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
just like super glue it on there but I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
just like super glue it on there but I
also<00:00:44.850> may<00:00:45.239> have<00:00:45.270> wrangled<00:00:45.960> access<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> kind

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
also may have wrangled access to a kind

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.970 
also may have wrangled access to a kind
of<00:00:47.250> 3d<00:00:47.640> printer<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> these<00:00:49.500> rapid

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
of 3d printer one of these rapid

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.160 
of 3d printer one of these rapid
prototyping<00:00:50.579> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.969> machines<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.079> I've

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
prototyping kind of machines so I've

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.740 
prototyping kind of machines so I've
been<00:00:52.289> messing<00:00:52.469> around<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:53.300> found<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.510> little

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
been messing around I found this little

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
been messing around I found this little
program<00:00:55.020> called<00:00:56.270> open<00:00:57.270> s<00:00:57.480> CAD<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.850> don't

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
program called open s CAD and I don't

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.729 
program called open s CAD and I don't
know<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.149> you've<00:01:00.300> ever<00:01:00.329> tries<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.899> use<00:01:01.079> blender

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
know if you've ever tries to use blender

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.390 
know if you've ever tries to use blender
or<00:01:02.039> art<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.609> Illusion<00:01:03.710> I've<00:01:04.710> messed<00:01:05.189> around

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
or art of Illusion I've messed around

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.950 
or art of Illusion I've messed around
with<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.030> bit<00:01:06.330> but<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:06.810> very

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
with them a little bit but it's very

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.760 
with them a little bit but it's very
hard<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.560> found<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:09.030> create<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:10.409> sort<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.650> get

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
hard I found to create to sort of get

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
hard I found to create to sort of get
things<00:01:10.979> lined<00:01:11.369> up<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:12.030> proper<00:01:12.420> dimensions

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
things lined up with proper dimensions

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
things lined up with proper dimensions
and<00:01:13.650> sort<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.930> very<00:01:15.930> hard<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.590> open<00:01:16.950> s

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
and sort of very hard to use this open s

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
and sort of very hard to use this open s
CAD<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.729> programmatic<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> can

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
CAD is a much more programmatic you can

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
CAD is a much more programmatic you can
see<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.600> see

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
see here I don't know if you can see

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.990 
see here I don't know if you can see
this<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.790> little

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
this or not but it's just a little

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.560 
this or not but it's just a little
script<00:01:27.479> when<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> sort<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> tell<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> make

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
script when you sort of tell it to make

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
script when you sort of tell it to make
cubes<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.909> cylinders<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.420> cones<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.890> add

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
cubes and cylinders and cones and add

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.300 
cubes and cylinders and cones and add
and<00:01:35.970> subtract<00:01:36.390> them<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> becomes<00:01:38.040> much

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and subtract them and so it becomes much

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850 
and subtract them and so it becomes much
easier<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:39.119> construct<00:01:39.450> something<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.530> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
easier to construct something like this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
easier to construct something like this
and<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.700> part<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.149> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> make

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and this is the part I'm going to make

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.160 
and this is the part I'm going to make
you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:48.840> kind<00:01:49.049> of

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
you can see this kind of this kind of

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.210 
you can see this kind of this kind of
cup<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.770> here<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> imagined

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
cup right here this is what I imagined

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.039 
cup right here this is what I imagined
this<00:01:53.220> piece<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.970> go<00:01:54.180> into<00:01:54.360> i'm<00:01:54.780> probably

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
this piece will go into i'm probably

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
this piece will go into i'm probably
going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.470> modify<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.189> bit<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
going to modify it a little bit so it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.420 
going to modify it a little bit so it
will<00:01:57.030> fit<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.360> there<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.840> then<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.860> course

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.469 

this<00:02:05.210> key<00:02:06.190> will<00:02:07.190> go<00:02:07.400> right<00:02:07.670> right<00:02:07.940> there

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
this key will go right right there

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.320 
this key will go right right there
basically<00:02:08.990> is<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.830> idea<00:02:10.160> now<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.000> don't<00:02:11.240> know

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
basically is the idea now I don't know

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.330 
basically is the idea now I don't know
that<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.840> perfectly<00:02:12.500> made<00:02:12.800> or<00:02:13.070> whatever

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
that this is perfectly made or whatever

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.760 
that this is perfectly made or whatever
perfectly<00:02:13.880> designed<00:02:14.060> I'll<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:15.680> to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
perfectly designed I'll probably have to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.790 
perfectly designed I'll probably have to
go<00:02:15.950> through<00:02:16.190> several<00:02:16.490> iterations<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:18.080> I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
go through several iterations and I

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.190 
go through several iterations and I
don't<00:02:18.980> know<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.640> can<00:02:19.700> actually<00:02:20.030> print<00:02:20.720> out

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
don't know that I can actually print out

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.690 
don't know that I can actually print out
with<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.040> little<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:25.100> would<00:02:25.250> be<00:02:25.370> like<00:02:25.550> an

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
with this little this would be like an

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.250 
with this little this would be like an
overhang<00:02:26.209> here<00:02:26.240> I<00:02:26.510> don't<00:02:26.780> know<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
overhang here I don't know that this

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.650 
overhang here I don't know that this
will<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.709> probably<00:02:28.190> won't<00:02:28.400> print<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.420> I'm

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
will this probably won't print so I'm

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.320 
will this probably won't print so I'm
probably<00:02:29.870> going<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:31.150> modify<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
probably going to have to modify the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.020 
probably going to have to modify the
design<00:02:32.600> still<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.680> is<00:02:33.890> pretty<00:02:34.070> neat<00:02:34.340> and

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
design still this is pretty neat and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.180 
design still this is pretty neat and
then<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.240> can<00:02:35.390> export<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:36.050> thing<00:02:36.320> as<00:02:36.560> an<00:02:36.680> STL

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
then you can export this thing as an STL

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.330 
then you can export this thing as an STL
file<00:02:37.580> whatever<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.630> then<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:40.100> can

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
file whatever that is and then you can

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.870 
file whatever that is and then you can
also<00:02:41.709> import<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.860> into<00:02:42.950> blender<00:02:43.310> here's<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
also import it into blender here's the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.020 
also import it into blender here's the
same<00:02:44.330> thing<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.989> blender<00:02:45.440> I<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:46.280> imported<00:02:46.880> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
same thing in blender I just imported it

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.510 
same thing in blender I just imported it
and<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:51.410> can<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.120> mesh<00:02:53.510> view

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
and you can see there is the mesh view

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.970 
and you can see there is the mesh view
so<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.230> export<00:02:57.709> this

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
so I think I just have to export this

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.810 
so I think I just have to export this
and<00:02:58.370> then<00:02:58.489> run<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:58.910> scan<00:02:59.209> forge<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.050> then

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
and then run it to scan forge and then

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.910 
and then run it to scan forge and then
then<00:03:01.820> then<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.510> real<00:03:02.959> problem<00:03:03.380> will<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.590> how

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
then then the real problem will be how

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.120 
then then the real problem will be how
do<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.100> deal<00:03:04.310> with<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.459> overhang<00:03:05.800> but<00:03:06.800> anyway

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
do I deal with this overhang but anyway

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.860 
do I deal with this overhang but anyway
there's<00:03:07.459> pretty<00:03:07.730> neat<00:03:07.910> little<00:03:08.090> program<00:03:08.300> here

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
there's pretty neat little program here

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.539 
there's pretty neat little program here
and<00:03:09.019> pretty<00:03:09.200> neat<00:03:09.440> little<00:03:09.650> pretty<00:03:10.070> neat<00:03:10.250> stuff

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
and pretty neat little pretty neat stuff

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.530 
and pretty neat little pretty neat stuff
I<00:03:11.019> thought<00:03:12.019> so<00:03:12.230> anyway
