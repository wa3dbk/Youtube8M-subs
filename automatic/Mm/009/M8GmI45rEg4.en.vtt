mainly used for long-distance race where

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
mainly used for long-distance race where
you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.390> plan<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:50.420> firebirds

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
you have to plan and firebirds

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.740 
you have to plan and firebirds
in<00:00:52.730> such<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:55.699> the<00:00:56.699> bird<00:00:56.940> will<00:00:57.600> be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
in such a way that the bird will be

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.500 
in such a way that the bird will be
sitting<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> egg<00:00:58.530> after<00:00:59.370> sitting<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
sitting on the egg after sitting on the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.870 
sitting on the egg after sitting on the
egg<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.899> 10<00:01:01.109> days<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:03.049> before<00:01:04.049> 14<00:01:04.439> days

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.390 

because<00:01:07.600> when<00:01:07.930> they<00:01:08.560> are<00:01:08.650> sitting<00:01:08.979> on<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.220> egg

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
because when they are sitting on the egg

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.520 
because when they are sitting on the egg
the<00:01:09.790> homing<00:01:10.180> instinct<00:01:10.630> is<00:01:10.780> much<00:01:11.020> higher

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
the homing instinct is much higher

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.160 
the homing instinct is much higher
because<00:01:12.460> they<00:01:12.790> have<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:13.120> come<00:01:13.330> back<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:13.810> sit<00:01:14.020> on

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
because they have to come back to sit on

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.430 
because they have to come back to sit on
the<00:01:14.290> eggs<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.790> hatch<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.270> eggs<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.850> then

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
the eggs to hatch the eggs but then

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.260 
the eggs to hatch the eggs but then
after<00:01:20.440> laying<00:01:20.650> eggs<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.220> hen<00:01:21.760> tends<00:01:22.060> to

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
after laying eggs the hen tends to

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
after laying eggs the hen tends to
become<00:01:22.420> little<00:01:22.840> weak<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.540> should<00:01:25.960> be<00:01:26.080> after

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
become little weak so it should be after

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.950 
become little weak so it should be after
ten<00:01:26.650> days<00:01:26.680> of<00:01:26.920> laying<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.369> eggs<00:01:27.490> and<00:01:28.000> for<00:01:28.869> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
ten days of laying the eggs and for the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.719 
ten days of laying the eggs and for the
 also<00:01:29.560> at<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.770> same<00:01:29.950> time<00:01:30.009> before<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
 also at the same time before the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.430 
 also at the same time before the
hen<00:01:31.119> lay<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.869> eggs

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
hen lay the eggs

when<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.670> hen<00:01:36.880> has<00:01:37.030> had<00:01:37.509> not<00:01:37.750> laid<00:01:37.960> their<00:01:38.110> eggs

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
when the hen has had not laid their eggs

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.380 
when the hen has had not laid their eggs

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.310 
after sitting on the egg for 14 days
then<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.720> milk<00:02:20.019> gland<00:02:20.350> start<00:02:21.100> forming<00:02:22.320> when

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
then the milk gland start forming when

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.020 
then the milk gland start forming when
the<00:02:23.440> ones<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.829> milk<00:02:24.070> glands<00:02:24.340> start<00:02:24.459> forming

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the ones the milk glands start forming

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.449 
the ones the milk glands start forming
then<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.989> bird<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.620> less<00:02:26.890> stamina

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
then the bird will have less stamina

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.430 
then the bird will have less stamina
they<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.180> not<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:28.510> able<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.780> fly<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.140> long

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
they will not be able to fly the long

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.009 
they will not be able to fly the long
distance<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.880> video<00:02:33.880> rate<00:02:34.150> system<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.840> a

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
distance so this video rate system is a

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.310 
distance so this video rate system is a
bit<00:02:35.380> complicated
