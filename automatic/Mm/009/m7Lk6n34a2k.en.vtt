 now the clutch is released and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 you turn those three screws of the

 the other mushroom from the clutch 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.420
 take out the lid to take away the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.730
 other plate these errors 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.010
 press together 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.710
 and the fuse sheet of the crone 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.329
 mother to raise 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.059
 one of the screws right now 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.780
 a turn as far as possible and 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.100
 then approaches the Kunduz holder 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 insert the crohn nut key 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.820
 and the co 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.820
 solve the problem 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.020
 should not the clutch now 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.700
 can be drawn easily out 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.120
 to use a clown puller to help 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.400
 to take 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.200
 This facilitates this work in the 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 Normally, it is so that one the 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.950
 Clutch readily by hand

 push through the clutch compressor 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.940
 and fix the coupling 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.940
 Compress by pressing the compress 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.920
 then you can screw together 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.960
 these backup errors easily 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.320
 remove 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.530
 reopen the compressor

 dismantle 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.970
 To assemble you put the clutch 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.390
 sit down the plates again 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.540
 the springs drive the bush more 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.480
 then slices and the clutch 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 evidence here you have to pay attention that 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.920
 the noses of these documents the one on the edge 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.630
 draws I press together now 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.820
 If this is the case, lie on top of each other 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.640
 you can put the whole thing in the basket 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.710
 reinstate 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 the point 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 that was set again before the whole 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.030
 turn it to the feathers 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.500
 Sit down properly 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.000
 if that is the case you can 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.220
 finally squeeze coupling and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.540
 insert the security certificate again 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.069
