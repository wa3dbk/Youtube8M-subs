the sound input and output controls on
your<00:00:07.020> rack<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:11.639> may<00:00:11.790> have<00:00:11.940> multiple<00:00:12.269> audio

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
your rack so you may have multiple audio

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.110 
your rack so you may have multiple audio
output<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.500> input<00:00:13.920> devices<00:00:14.130> on<00:00:14.580> your<00:00:14.610> Mac<00:00:14.849> for

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
output and input devices on your Mac for

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.240 
output and input devices on your Mac for
instance<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.900> could<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.139> speakers<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.770> a

instance you could have speakers and a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.519 
instance you could have speakers and a
USB<00:00:17.550> headset<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.600> could<00:00:18.750> also<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:19.140> multiple

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
USB headset you could also have multiple

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
USB headset you could also have multiple
mics<00:00:19.800> including<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> built-in<00:00:21.180> mic<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.689> your

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
mics including the built-in mic on your

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.439 
mics including the built-in mic on your
Mac<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.680> here's<00:00:22.920> how<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> choose<00:00:23.490> between<00:00:24.060> them

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
Mac so here's how to choose between them

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.300 
Mac so here's how to choose between them
you<00:00:24.960> want<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> go<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> system<00:00:25.830> preferences

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you want to go to the system preferences

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.570 
you want to go to the system preferences
and<00:00:26.460> look<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.269> sound<00:00:28.519> understanding<00:00:29.519> you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and look for sound understanding you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
and look for sound understanding you
have<00:00:29.670> three<00:00:29.939> tabs<00:00:30.179> we're<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:30.990> to

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
have three tabs we're just going to

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.870 
have three tabs we're just going to
focus<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> output<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.070> input<00:00:32.309> tap<00:00:32.700> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
focus on the output and input tap it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.389 
focus on the output and input tap it
right<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.120> so<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> output<00:00:34.469> tab<00:00:34.649> you've<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
right now so the output tab you've got a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
right now so the output tab you've got a
list<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.420> devices<00:00:36.719> hooked<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
list of all the devices hooked up that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.010 
list of all the devices hooked up that
can<00:00:38.250> support<00:00:38.640> sound<00:00:38.879> output<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.750> instance

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
can support sound output so for instance

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
can support sound output so for instance
you've<00:00:40.140> got<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.410> internal<00:00:40.950> speakers<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> you

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you've got the internal speakers and you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.479 
you've got the internal speakers and you
also<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.450> line<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.440> external<00:00:43.980> speakers

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
also have line out the external speakers

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
also have line out the external speakers
you<00:00:45.300> can<00:00:45.329> also<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> different<00:00:46.050> things<00:00:46.170> like

you can also have different things like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.290 
you can also have different things like

so I've got line in digital in a blue

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
so I've got line in digital in a blue
snowball<00:01:17.670> microphone<00:01:18.110> also<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.530> fast-track

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
snowball microphone also the fast-track

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
snowball microphone also the fast-track
device<00:01:20.220> where<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.580> hook<00:01:20.670> up<00:01:20.850> any<00:01:21.000> external

device where I can hook up any external

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
device where I can hook up any external
microphone<00:01:22.259> -<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.619> here's<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.189> headset<00:01:23.670> below

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
microphone - and here's my headset below

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.820 
microphone - and here's my headset below
the<00:01:24.780> list<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> inputs<00:01:25.380> I've<00:01:25.470> got<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the list of inputs I've got one of the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
the list of inputs I've got one of the
most<00:01:25.860> important<00:01:26.430> things<00:01:26.610> which<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> input

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
most important things which is the input

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
most important things which is the input
volume<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.320> different<00:01:28.979> devices<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
volume so different devices are going to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
volume so different devices are going to
give<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> different<00:01:30.659> level<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.590> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
give you a different level so for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
give you a different level so for
instance<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.070> I've<00:01:32.159> got<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:32.700> blue<00:01:33.119> snowball

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
instance here I've got my blue snowball

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.770 
instance here I've got my blue snowball
microphone<00:01:33.780> selected<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.850> adjust<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
microphone selected so I can adjust the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
microphone selected so I can adjust the
volume<00:01:36.810> here<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.829> too
