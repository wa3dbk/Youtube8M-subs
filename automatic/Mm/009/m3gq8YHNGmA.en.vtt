00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.680
 new video 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.569
 Today I want you mine 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.300
 show care products for my skin 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.290
 because I really like her very much 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.820
 I think the last few years have so much 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.520
 tested drogerie heyenn poked that and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.779
 I'm finally at barbara 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.029
 got stuck 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.430
 you know that I am currently in one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.320
 Cosmetic studio works and everyone 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 Boardpartner I think I already have 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
 times one mentioned in my videos and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.940
 There I am on these products 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 became aware and I was always like that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.149
 a bit torn 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 between he tried tried now 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.260
 it is not gutted now thought oh what 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.989
 I'll call it because our customers 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.660
 always very excited about it, too 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.550
 our beauticians are mega of 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 inspired me and baroque products 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.469
 thought yes come because if it does 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.359
 all of you think it's great 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 be a part of it and have me for the skin 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.689
 first to clean 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.760
 Two things are taken and that is 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.439
 the two babies are in there 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.869
 Of course, you can also combine it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.830
 buy individually , however, they act on 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 best if you use them together 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.750
 one is an oil that is called a dog in it 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 So that's what's inside so it is 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.610
 a cleaning oil in combination with 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.189
 this feature is active and that is one 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.049
 for active base for dry skin because 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.060
 I really have a dry skin and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.909
 it is also available again for sensitive 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.020
 skin for me and I have them 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.060
 taken for the dry skin and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.850
 this is 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.100
 oil which you also remove for make-up 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.530
 It can be easy to use 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 I always take two bumps and 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.350
 what all this in my face if you 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.360
 Now think oil is fat and fat 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.910
 yes, not so good for the skin 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.180
 because of impurities or something else 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.180
 this one in the reigns together with water 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.069
 and usually oil and oil 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.000
 Do not water the concept together 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.730
 is so that it connects with water 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.319
 and my skin does not have to be before 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.170
 somehow be moist but I take 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.360
 really two times what of this oil here 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.269
 and then I'll give it to you 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:39.319
 whole face and what is the whole here 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.080
 then really nice to read it afterwards 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.650
 the height on my face on it 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.319
 next to me two pump surges of this for 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.620
 active base and this is a herb 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.070
 Extracts in it and thus the skin 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.769
 again clean pore deep cleaned and 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.970
 you take it a bit and over 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.980
 The height you practically pass this 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.319
 introduced active base and you notice 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.160
 already that emitted together and 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.560
 that is soap-like wiso and this 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.049
 feeling of skin when you led this active 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.760
 base on it makes me feel sensational 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.489
 because that takes you all this 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.660
 stress out of the skin 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.700
 it feels very nourishing 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.739
 refreshing and it really feels 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.160
 really pure others i like this one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.600
 Feeling of the skin and that's what I'm doing here 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 also really nice and then takes 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.489
 Her cold water so far has been water 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.370
 Water should not be hot and take 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.730
 the whole country 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.989
 face down and cold water serves 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.319
 to that the pores again 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.750
 to contract and somehow none 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.170
 impurities or impurities or 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.299
 other things come in and then that 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.220
 Feeling of the skin is so great 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.900
 usually I know that I know 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.790
 my face with someone else 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.440
 cleaning and then I have this 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.750
 face tense and I have to go now 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.879
 definitely a kilo clerk in my 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.579
 smear face so feel this 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.340
 I have that after this cleaning 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:21.289
 not at all anymore i dry my face 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.530
 then off and then I use 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.840
 cream 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.000
 I have now also of the babor 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.780
 is simply a bat balancing them 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.169
 prime 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.210
 and there are so many good lipids in there 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.570
 the rents are just the ones we need 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.639
 For our skin, that's the skin 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.590
 stabilized and builds well with 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.139
 moisture is supplied and I have 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.720
 one where a lot of love is in there for 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.200
 a dry skin and need it 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.270
 we really very little so the great 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.919
 in this book creams are the are 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.580
 well focused that one there now 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.470
 finally a lot of needs and the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.289
 by then stop as a final cream yet 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.919
 I'm done with it 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:07.820
 care routine in the morning from the circle yes 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.820
 Kasami tend to be in a higher one 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:15.030
 price segment gabor is now none 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.560
 The drugstore you get in online 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.110
 trade or in different 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.229
 Cosmetic studios in your city I will 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.980
 again the left post where each 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.830
 just then you can order or 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.880
 You would have to get that via Amazon 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.890
 as far as I know 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.910
 and there you can all the time 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.230
 so watch in the higher price segment 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:43.250
 Let's talk about that now 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:46.670
 example so in combination of order 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.860
 the 30 euro costs approximately as cream 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.510
 then come again and if so 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.880
 cheap is the whole course now 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.870
 not but I am meanwhile on the 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:59.390
 arrived point where I say for now 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.700
 I just give a little more skin 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.430
 raise money and do not take these anymore 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.230
 cheap products where i know the 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.900
 ingredients are just not okay 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.540
 And I just notice my skin 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.350
 it just needs it now and 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:18.140
 dear store nowhere else and 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:21.200
 then would rather spend the money for good 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.810
 products and that 's it with the video 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.910
