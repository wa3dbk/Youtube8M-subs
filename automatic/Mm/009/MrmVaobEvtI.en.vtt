don't forget the washers now there are
off<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.920> all<00:02:26.100> knees<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:33.090> physically<00:02:33.630> get<00:02:33.810> out

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.259 

you<00:02:38.130> probably<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.609> well<00:02:38.790> leaving<00:02:39.090> it<00:02:39.329> until

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
you probably as well leaving it until

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.480 

now<00:03:07.620> there<00:03:07.770> is<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.920> space<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.370> fitted<00:03:10.460> to<00:03:11.460> my

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
now there is a space of fitted to my

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.910 
now there is a space of fitted to my
material<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:15.620> down<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
material to the to the not down in the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.680 
material to the to the not down in the
bottom<00:03:17.660> which<00:03:18.660> meant<00:03:18.960> just<00:03:19.200> as<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:20.120> as<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> washer

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
bottom which meant just as I as a washer

00:03:21.690 --> 00:04:09.620 
bottom which meant just as I as a washer
I<00:03:21.720> think<00:04:03.440> should<00:04:04.440> pull<00:04:04.770> off<00:04:06.590> there<00:04:07.590> are<00:04:08.630> some

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
I think should pull off there are some

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.300 
I think should pull off there are some
lever<00:04:09.930> points<00:04:10.970> you'll<00:04:11.970> see<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.210> tab<00:04:13.190> to<00:04:14.190> the

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
lever points you'll see a tab to the

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.990 
lever points you'll see a tab to the
back<00:04:14.490> of<00:04:14.520> the<00:04:14.670> barrel<00:04:16.340> that<00:04:17.340> doesn't<00:04:17.670> seem<00:04:17.850> to

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
back of the barrel that doesn't seem to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.840 
back of the barrel that doesn't seem to
be<00:04:18.090> doing<00:04:18.239> anything<00:04:20.330> it<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.600> it's<00:04:21.900> actually<00:04:22.080> a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
be doing anything it is it's actually a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.370 
be doing anything it is it's actually a
leader<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:28.010> there's<00:04:29.010> one<00:04:29.250> at<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.400> front<00:04:29.520> just

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
leader and there's one at the front just

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:39.670 
leader and there's one at the front just
in<00:04:31.380> front<00:04:31.650> of<00:04:31.890> the<00:04:34.610> main<00:04:35.610> block<00:04:35.910> engine<00:04:36.390> mount

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.520 

so<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.830> can<00:04:40.980> get<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.160> screwdriver<00:04:41.520> in

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:05:08.850 

I'm<00:04:46.530> leave<00:04:46.800> it<00:04:46.980> oh

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:19.060 

it's<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.920> little<00:05:10.400> bit<00:05:10.550> awkward<00:05:17.500> if<00:05:18.500> you<00:05:18.650> need<00:05:18.830> to

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
it's a little bit awkward if you need to

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:30.420 
it's a little bit awkward if you need to
pop<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.400> bit<00:05:19.640> of<00:05:19.760> oil<00:05:19.910> down<00:05:21.010> into<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.130> barrel<00:05:22.460> to

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.100 

let<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.520> piston<00:05:31.940> slide<00:05:32.210> oh<00:05:32.240> that's<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.960> that's

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
let the piston slide oh that's it that's

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:55.820 
let the piston slide oh that's it that's
the<00:05:33.260> head<00:05:33.470> off

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:06.600 

remove<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:56.949> base<00:05:57.159> gasket<00:06:04.949> and<00:06:05.949> that's<00:06:06.159> it<00:06:06.369> if

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
remove the base gasket and that's it if

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.019 
remove the base gasket and that's it if
we're<00:06:06.999> removing<00:06:07.299> the<00:06:07.629> pesto<00:06:08.549> which<00:06:09.549> I<00:06:09.759> don't

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
we're removing the pesto which I don't

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.999 
we're removing the pesto which I don't
need<00:06:10.209> to<00:06:10.329> do<00:06:10.449> at<00:06:10.569> the<00:06:10.629> moment<00:06:13.529> take<00:06:14.529> clips<00:06:14.799> out

and a push rod you can try and anything

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.540 
and a push rod you can try and anything
at<00:06:47.199> this<00:06:47.349> point<00:06:48.569> what<00:06:49.569> if<00:06:50.439> it<00:06:50.649> doesn't<00:06:50.860> don't

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
at this point what if it doesn't don't

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.949 
at this point what if it doesn't don't
worry<00:06:51.759> about<00:06:51.849> it<00:06:52.239> because<00:06:52.479> it<00:06:52.599> will<00:06:52.719> fall<00:06:52.929> out

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:52.959

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 
now next job is to split the cajun I'm

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.860 
now next job is to split the cajun I'm
going<00:07:15.510> to<00:07:15.570> turn<00:07:16.350> the<00:07:16.500> video<00:07:16.620> off<00:07:17.570> and<00:07:18.570> we'll<00:07:18.720> go

through will go through actually

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.770 
through will go through actually
splitting<00:07:23.070> it<00:07:23.310> when<00:07:23.460> I've<00:07:23.610> loosened<00:07:24.390> all<00:07:24.660> the

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 
splitting it when I've loosened all the

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.140 
splitting it when I've loosened all the
bolts
