00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.950 
way is it gives you it has a little bit
of<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:51.010> pink<00:01:51.430> undertone<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.540> which<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:52.930> know

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
of a pink undertone to it which I know

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.690 
of a pink undertone to it which I know
that<00:01:53.290> sounds<00:01:53.650> weird<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.460> if<00:01:54.580> you're

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
that sounds weird but if you're

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.060 
that sounds weird but if you're
naturally<00:01:54.910> out<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.930> Sun<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.560> daylight

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
naturally out in the Sun in the daylight

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.130 
naturally out in the Sun in the daylight
and<00:01:57.250> you're<00:01:57.460> getting<00:01:57.790> color<00:01:58.210> most<00:01:58.660> people<00:01:58.990> get

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and you're getting color most people get

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.200 
and you're getting color most people get
a<00:01:59.170> little<00:01:59.350> bit<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.740> pink<00:02:00.010> warm<00:02:00.430> undertone<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
a little bit of a pink warm undertone to

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.750 
a little bit of a pink warm undertone to
them<00:02:01.480> and<00:02:01.750> I<00:02:02.620> think<00:02:02.830> that's<00:02:03.070> pretty<00:02:03.340> cool<00:02:03.520> I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
them and I think that's pretty cool I

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.790 
them and I think that's pretty cool I
really<00:02:03.790> like<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.450> it's<00:02:05.260> been<00:02:05.410> doing<00:02:05.530> really

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
really like it it's been doing really

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260
