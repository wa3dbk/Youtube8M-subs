00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
let's take a look at the organ plugin

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.240 
let's take a look at the organ plugin
and<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:20.750> what<00:00:21.750> what's<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.070> here's

that brings up another aspect of the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.060 
that brings up another aspect of the
organ<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:54.720> are<00:01:54.899> some<00:01:55.140> additional<00:01:55.470> features

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
organ there are some additional features

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
organ there are some additional features
that<00:01:56.490> add<00:01:56.700> extra<00:01:57.030> tones<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.509> they're<00:01:57.600> mostly

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that add extra tones and they're mostly

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
that add extra tones and they're mostly
for<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> attack<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> sound<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.880> a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.889 
this case and a percussion parameter
also<00:02:04.590> turned<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:06.060> percussion<00:02:06.509> parameter

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
also turned on the percussion parameter

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.109 
also turned on the percussion parameter
adds<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.290> clicky<00:02:07.619> sound<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> pitch<00:02:08.399> however

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
adds a clicky sound with a pitch however

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.460 
adds a clicky sound with a pitch however
so<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> turn<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.080> off<00:02:10.140> with<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so we're going to turn that off with a

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.400 
so we're going to turn that off with a
second<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.700> nothing<00:02:12.180> competing

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
second so we have nothing competing

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
second so we have nothing competing
we<00:02:13.740> don't<00:02:13.920> hear<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> pitch<00:02:14.340> anymore<00:02:14.610> let's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
we don't hear the pitch anymore let's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.200 
we don't hear the pitch anymore let's
bring<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.200> first<00:02:16.860> white<00:02:17.340> drawbar<00:02:17.820> down<00:02:18.000> over

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
bring the first white drawbar down over

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.440 
bring the first white drawbar down over
here<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.660> town<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:20.550> can<00:02:20.700> demonstrate<00:02:20.850> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
here a town and we can demonstrate the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.080 
here a town and we can demonstrate the
pitches<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.930> drawbars<00:02:22.380> they<00:02:23.310> follow<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
pitches of the drawbars they follow the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.080 
pitches of the drawbars they follow the
overtone<00:02:24.540> series<00:02:24.750> or<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.140> harmonic<00:02:25.740> series

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
overtone series or the harmonic series

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.550 
overtone series or the harmonic series
pretty<00:02:27.090> closely<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.990> if<00:02:28.080> we<00:02:28.170> start<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.440> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
pretty closely so if we start with that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.960 
pretty closely so if we start with that
is<00:02:28.860> our<00:02:29.150> first<00:02:30.150> tone<00:02:31.370> octave<00:02:33.290> fifth<00:02:34.970> second

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
is our first tone octave fifth second

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.100 
is our first tone octave fifth second
octave<00:02:36.360> third<00:02:37.640> fifth<00:02:38.640> and<00:02:38.880> now<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.690> next

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
octave third fifth and now the next

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.960 
octave third fifth and now the next
harmonic<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> overtone<00:02:41.160> series<00:02:41.250> would

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
harmonic and the overtone series would

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
harmonic and the overtone series would
be<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.240> flat<00:02:42.450> seven<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:42.990> it's<00:02:43.230> not<00:02:43.440> included

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
be the flat seven but it's not included

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.290 
be the flat seven but it's not included
in<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.040> b3<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.490> skipped<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.910> one<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.240> go

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
in the b3 they skipped that one and go

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.920 
in the b3 they skipped that one and go
straight<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.850> next<00:02:47.850> octave<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.360> then

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
straight to the next octave and then

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
straight to the next octave and then
there<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.260> sub<00:02:49.680> octave<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:52.160> then<00:02:53.160> there's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
there is a sub octave and then there's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.520 
there is a sub octave and then there's
something<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.330> fifth<00:02:54.630> it's<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
something that's the fifth it's the a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.230 
something that's the fifth it's the a
fourth<00:02:55.830> below<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.310> fundamental<00:02:56.910> or<00:02:57.090> it's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
fourth below this fundamental or it's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.620 
fourth below this fundamental or it's
the<00:02:57.360> fifth<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:58.310> series<00:03:00.020> below<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:02.630> so

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the fifth of the series below that so

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.450 
the fifth of the series below that so
you<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.170> add<00:03:04.410> them<00:03:04.500> together<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.980> mix<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
you just add them together you mix and

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.700 
you just add them together you mix and
match<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:05.970> your<00:03:06.150> tones<00:03:06.360> but<00:03:07.350> because

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
match you get your tones but because

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:08.660 
match you get your tones but because
they're<00:03:07.830> all<00:03:07.920> part<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.220> harmonic<00:03:08.640> series

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
they're all part of the harmonic series

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.050 
they're all part of the harmonic series
the<00:03:09.480> tones<00:03:09.720> are<00:03:09.930> kind<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.670> boring<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.970> know

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the tones are kind of boring you know

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.610 
the tones are kind of boring you know
and<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> rest<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.170> this<00:03:13.230> stuff<00:03:13.440> that

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
and it's the rest of this stuff that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.440 
and it's the rest of this stuff that
makes<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.980> little<00:03:14.100> more<00:03:14.250> interesting<00:03:14.850> to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
makes it a little more interesting to

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.360 
makes it a little more interesting to
click<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.900> percussion<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.310> the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
click the percussion and some of the

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.680 
click the percussion and some of the
other<00:03:17.520> modulations<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.920> we're<00:03:20.790> gonna<00:03:20.910> go<00:03:21.540> back

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
other modulations so we're gonna go back

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.030 
other modulations so we're gonna go back
to<00:03:21.750> our<00:03:21.960> original<00:03:22.020> patch<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.710> second

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
to our original patch for a second

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.620 
to our original patch for a second
there's<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.430> little<00:03:23.670> compare<00:03:24.030> button<00:03:24.240> and<00:03:24.480> it's

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
there's a little compare button and it's

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.330 
there's a little compare button and it's
lit<00:03:25.170> up<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:25.740> indicates<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.190> I've

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
lit up now it indicates that I've

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.950 
lit up now it indicates that I've
changed<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.910> passion<00:03:27.300> I<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.540> get<00:03:27.690> back<00:03:27.900> to

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
changed the passion I can get back to

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.770 
changed the passion I can get back to
where<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.350> was<00:03:28.770> with<00:03:29.550> an<00:03:29.670> a/b<00:03:30.000> comparison<00:03:30.210> by

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
where I was with an a/b comparison by

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.750 
where I was with an a/b comparison by
clicking<00:03:31.140> on<00:03:31.320> that<00:03:31.350> button<00:03:31.740> so<00:03:32.250> let's<00:03:32.400> go<00:03:32.550> back

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
clicking on that button so let's go back

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.520 
clicking on that button so let's go back
to<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.780> original<00:03:35.870> percussion<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:36.960> back<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.380> it

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
to the original percussion is back on it

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.950 
to the original percussion is back on it
adds<00:03:37.710> a<00:03:37.830> little<00:03:37.950> extra<00:03:38.160> tone<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.840> that

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
adds a little extra tone and that

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.680 
adds a little extra tone and that
percussive<00:03:40.500> tone<00:03:40.940> it's<00:03:41.940> up<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.420> can

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
percussive tone it's up to you you can

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.890 
percussive tone it's up to you you can
actually<00:03:42.840> make<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.200> last<00:03:43.950> longer<00:03:44.160> or<00:03:44.900> shorter

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
actually make it last longer or shorter

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.380 
actually make it last longer or shorter
and<00:03:46.380> decide<00:03:46.800> whether<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.880> second<00:03:48.300> or

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
and decide whether it's the second or

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.390 
and decide whether it's the second or
the<00:03:48.480> third<00:03:48.630> harmonic<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.890> overtone

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
the third harmonic in this overtone

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.370 
the third harmonic in this overtone
series<00:03:50.580> here<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:50.940> actually<00:03:51.060> borrows<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.020> tone

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
series here it actually borrows the tone

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.130 
series here it actually borrows the tone
from<00:03:52.650> one<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.830> these<00:03:52.920> draw<00:03:53.100> bars<00:03:54.140> during

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
from one of these draw bars during

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.940 
from one of these draw bars during
harmonic<00:03:55.850> second<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:58.560> can<00:03:58.710> make<00:03:58.860> it

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
harmonic second you can make it

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.530 
harmonic second you can make it
velocity-sensitive<00:03:59.670> with<00:04:00.090> these<00:04:00.240> sliders

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
velocity-sensitive with these sliders

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.190 
velocity-sensitive with these sliders
and<00:04:00.870> increase

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
and increase

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.190 
and increase
decrease<00:04:03.069> its<00:04:03.250> volume<00:04:03.400> as<00:04:03.700> well<00:04:04.140> now<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
decrease its volume as well now the

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.160
