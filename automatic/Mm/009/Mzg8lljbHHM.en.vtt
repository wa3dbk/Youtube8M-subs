00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.949
 culture in childhood we loved very much 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 the menu here probably buckets 45 and for what 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.110
 you left him the fact that here is the promise 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 like a weird very good thing with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.969
 hypertension is very good 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 reduces pressure if you litter just 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.200

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.969
 say about speaking ordinary jam 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.309
 clearly add it lemon or zest 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.430
 an orange to give it a specific 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.699
 fruit tree scent because 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.339
 Nightshade is a family of the kin of

 Eggplant Vegetable Tomato Potatoes 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.570
 so to boil the jam saved us 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.540
 it is necessary to add 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.040
 lemon fitness with the Hindus will then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.770

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.740
 You can invite as a cucumber to you alone 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.100
