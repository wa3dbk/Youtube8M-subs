another<00:02:37.349> button<00:02:37.650> down<00:02:37.890> no<00:02:38.129> surprise<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.940> was

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
another button down no surprise this was

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.580 
another button down no surprise this was
just<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> gene<00:02:39.720> kind<00:02:40.019> of<00:02:40.079> denim<00:02:40.349> button-down

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
just a gene kind of denim button-down

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.009 
just a gene kind of denim button-down
it's<00:02:41.099> very<00:02:41.280> very<00:02:41.519> soft<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.180> thin<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.629> like<00:02:42.900> this

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
it's very very soft and thin I like this

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.600 
it's very very soft and thin I like this
one<00:02:43.079> because<00:02:43.349> it<00:02:43.500> doesn't<00:02:43.920> have<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> collar<00:02:44.400> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
one because it doesn't have a collar and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.890 
one because it doesn't have a collar and
I<00:02:44.849> think<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.120> more<00:02:45.180> feminine<00:02:45.690> when<00:02:45.810> it

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
I think it's more feminine when it

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.869 
I think it's more feminine when it
doesn't<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.319> color<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.769> it<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.549> it's

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
doesn't have the color on it and it's

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.339 
doesn't have the color on it and it's
just<00:02:48.060> really<00:02:48.150> cute<00:02:48.629> i<00:02:48.750> think<00:02:48.930> i'm<00:02:49.049> going<00:02:49.230> to
