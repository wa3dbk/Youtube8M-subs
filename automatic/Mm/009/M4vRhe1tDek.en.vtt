hey guys I'm be teaching you a trick

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.960 
hey guys I'm be teaching you a trick
that<00:00:04.259> I<00:00:04.290> just<00:00:04.740> found<00:00:04.890> out<00:00:05.130> about<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.549> little

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
that I just found out about a little

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.690 
that I just found out about a little
while<00:00:06.089> ago<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.450> Virtual<00:00:06.810> DJ<00:00:06.990> arm<00:00:07.500> if<00:00:08.460> you've

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
while ago on Virtual DJ arm if you've

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.620 
while ago on Virtual DJ arm if you've
ever<00:00:08.910> seen<00:00:09.300> real<00:00:10.260> DJ's<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.480> doing<00:00:12.480> their

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
ever seen real DJ's on doing their

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.790 
ever seen real DJ's on doing their
scratching<00:00:13.259> they<00:00:14.070> usually<00:00:14.849> use<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.800> cross

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
scratching they usually use the cross

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.570 
scratching they usually use the cross
fader<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.869> user<00:00:19.020> cross<00:00:19.410> fader<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.039> they

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
fader to the user cross fader and they

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.960 
fader to the user cross fader and they
scratch<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.660> same<00:00:21.840> time<00:00:22.160> just<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.760> they

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
scratch at the same time just so they

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.710 
scratch at the same time just so they
can<00:00:24.029> hear<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:25.710> don't<00:00:26.039> hear<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
can hear the just so they don't hear the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.859 
can hear the just so they don't hear the
backwards<00:00:27.830> mixing<00:00:28.849> because<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.480> sounds

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
backwards mixing because it just sounds

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.220 
backwards mixing because it just sounds
sloppy<00:00:31.230> when<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.980> um<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.870> let's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
sloppy when you do that um so like let's

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.060 
sloppy when you do that um so like let's
say<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> don't<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> hear<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:36.680> but<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.800> want

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
say I don't want to hear this but I want

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.510 
say I don't want to hear this but I want
to<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.489> want<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.879> mix<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> scratch<00:00:40.020> them

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
to I want to mix I want to scratch them

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.319 
to I want to mix I want to scratch them
um<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.360> found<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> shortcut<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.399> make<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
um I found out a shortcut to make it so

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.200 
um I found out a shortcut to make it so
it<00:00:45.690> mutes<00:00:46.170> when<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.680> backwards<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it mutes when you go backwards and it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.630 
it mutes when you go backwards and it
plays<00:00:48.420> when<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.780> forwards<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.520> do

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
plays when you go forwards so you can do

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.720 
plays when you go forwards so you can do
something<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.070> then<00:00:59.250> put<00:00:59.489> both

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
something like this and then put both

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
something like this and then put both
techniques<00:01:00.180> together<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.140> cool

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
techniques together to make cool

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.549 
techniques together to make cool
scratching<00:01:02.190> noises<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> um<00:01:03.809> instead<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
scratching noises so um instead of

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.490 
scratching noises so um instead of
having<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.339> forwards<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.380> change<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
having to go forwards and change the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 
having to go forwards and change the
cross<00:01:07.650> fader<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.240> opposite<00:01:09.810> side<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
cross fader to the opposite side and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.830 
cross fader to the opposite side and
then<00:01:10.350> go<00:01:10.470> backwards<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.970> keep<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
then go backwards you can keep it on in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.649 
then go backwards you can keep it on in
the<00:01:12.930> middle<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.610> it'll<00:01:14.610> go<00:01:15.000> forwards<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the middle and it'll go forwards and

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.179 
the middle and it'll go forwards and
then<00:01:15.780> I'll<00:01:15.930> mute<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.530> your<00:01:16.619> words<00:01:16.979> again

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
then I'll mute and then your words again

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.499 
then I'll mute and then your words again
and<00:01:17.430> mute<00:01:17.750> and<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> how<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.240> by

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
and mute and so how you do this is by

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.660 
and mute and so how you do this is by
going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> top<00:01:22.740> right<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.220> clicking<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
going to the top right and clicking on

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
going to the top right and clicking on
configuration<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.799> click<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> mapper

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
configuration and click on the mapper

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.410 
configuration and click on the mapper
mappers<00:01:27.860> section<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.040> then<00:01:29.909> you're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.240> to

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
mappers section and then you're going to

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.359 
mappers section and then you're going to
go<00:01:31.140> click<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.880> add<00:01:32.880> new<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.720> add<00:01:34.500> new<00:01:34.920> button

like this they don't sound like this
when<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.940> turn<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.209> on<00:02:13.720> and<00:02:14.720> I'm<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.740> cool<00:02:16.190> little

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
when I turn it on and I'm a cool little

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.190 
when I turn it on and I'm a cool little
technique<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.209> would<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.660> something<00:02:18.050> doing

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
technique it would be something doing

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:44.290 
technique it would be something doing
something<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:18.530> this<00:02:41.380> yeah<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:42.709> um<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.340> hope

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
something like this yeah so um I hope

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.240 
something like this yeah so um I hope
you<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:44.720> technique<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.440> should<00:02:46.040> help

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
you like this technique it should help

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.740
