spinning reel really nice and smooth pen
added<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> techno<00:00:59.879> balanced<00:01:00.210> rotor<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> as

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
added a techno balanced rotor to this as

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.319 
added a techno balanced rotor to this as
well<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.670> reduce<00:01:02.760> any<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
