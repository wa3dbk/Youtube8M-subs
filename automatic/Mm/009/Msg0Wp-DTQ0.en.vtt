00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
need to start killing these guys to get

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.050 
need to start killing these guys to get
my<00:02:01.810> pouches<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.920> during<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.460> live<00:02:03.610> stream<00:02:03.940> I

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
my pouches so during the live stream I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.370 
my pouches so during the live stream I
basically<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.600> just<00:02:04.840> getting<00:02:05.050> some<00:02:05.229> of<00:02:05.290> the

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
basically was just getting some of the

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.740 
basically was just getting some of the
requirements<00:02:05.500> done<00:02:06.130> for<00:02:06.520> doing<00:02:06.850> heroes<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.540> I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
requirements done for doing heroes and I

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.719 
requirements done for doing heroes and I
did<00:02:07.900> complete<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.470> here<00:02:08.619> not<00:02:08.800> too<00:02:09.009> long<00:02:09.039> ago<00:02:09.250> I

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
did complete it here not too long ago I

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.889 
did complete it here not too long ago I
had<00:02:10.659> to

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
had to

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
had to
find<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.379> partner<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.769> he<00:02:12.010> was<00:02:12.129> looking<00:02:12.280> on

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
find a partner and he was looking on

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.569 
find a partner and he was looking on
forms<00:02:13.569> for<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> partner<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> do<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.530> with<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.980> I

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
forms for a partner to do it with and I

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:17.399 
forms for a partner to do it with and I
think<00:02:15.640> it's<00:02:16.000> probably<00:02:16.450> more<00:02:16.780> efficient<00:02:17.349> to

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
think it's probably more efficient to

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.170 
think it's probably more efficient to
kill<00:02:17.680> these<00:02:17.860> level<00:02:18.159> 41<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:18.790> I'll<00:02:18.849> kill<00:02:19.030> this

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
kill these level 41 so I'll kill this

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.899 
kill these level 41 so I'll kill this
level<00:02:19.450> 81<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:20.079> in<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> second<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.280> just

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
level 81 here in a second but I just

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.069 
level 81 here in a second but I just
need<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.299> these<00:02:22.390> are<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.659> crafting

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:23.079 
need to get these are in crafting

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.740 
need to get these are in crafting
pouches<00:02:23.579> pretty<00:02:24.579> close<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.909> 50<00:02:25.180> room<00:02:25.360> crafting

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
pouches pretty close to 50 room crafting

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.770 
pouches pretty close to 50 room crafting
so<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.760> what<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.879> it<00:02:28.030> called<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.359> small

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
so the what is it called the small

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.440 
so the what is it called the small
medium<00:02:29.409> large<00:02:29.849> extra<00:02:30.849> or<00:02:31.120> something<00:02:31.390> like

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
medium large extra or something like

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.509

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
that I don't know that will help out a

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.470 
that I don't know that will help out a
ton<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.569> I<00:02:35.069> need<00:02:36.069> to<00:02:36.189> get<00:02:36.340> those<00:02:36.519> pouches<00:02:37.090> so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
ton so I need to get those pouches so

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.020 
ton so I need to get those pouches so
that<00:02:37.659> it<00:02:37.900> makes<00:02:38.140> your<00:02:38.290> crafting<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:39.010> lot<00:02:39.730> easier

a high range level but a decently good

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.599 
a high range level but a decently good
range<00:03:39.519> level<00:03:39.879> is<00:03:40.060> because<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.569> can<00:03:41.199> um<00:03:41.609> Jesus
