used<00:00:21.920> 2004<00:00:22.920> cts-v<00:00:23.519> now<00:00:24.330> watch<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.140> channel<00:00:25.529> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
used 2004 cts-v now watch a channel you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.820 
used 2004 cts-v now watch a channel you
know<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> had<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> 2005<00:00:27.300> GTO<00:00:27.930> before<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.619> had

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
know I had a 2005 GTO before this I had

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
know I had a 2005 GTO before this I had
that<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.130> two<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> half<00:00:29.670> years<00:00:29.970> missed

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

that for two and a half years missed
that<00:00:30.779> car<00:00:31.019> dearly<00:00:31.820> unfortunately<00:00:32.820> didn't<00:00:33.120> end

that car dearly unfortunately didn't end

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.430 
that car dearly unfortunately didn't end
so<00:00:33.390> well<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.050> one

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
so well with that one

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.340 
so well with that one
and<00:00:34.700> behind<00:00:35.700> me<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.059> replacement<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and behind me is the replacement now the

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
and behind me is the replacement now the
GTO<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.309> probably<00:00:38.550> know<00:00:38.910> had<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.180> ls2

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
GTO as you probably know had an ls2

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.420

numbers<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> most<00:00:49.950> common<00:00:50.370> question<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
numbers now the most common question I

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.060 
numbers now the most common question I
get<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.469> like<00:00:52.530> better

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
get is which one do you like better

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.569 
get is which one do you like better
I<00:00:53.250> mean<00:00:53.820> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> surface<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.440> CTSV<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
I mean on the surface the CTSV and the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.389 
I mean on the surface the CTSV and the
GTO<00:00:56.969> seem<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.719> very<00:00:57.989> similar<00:00:58.350> cars<00:00:58.800> at

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
GTO seem to be very similar cars at

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.220 
GTO seem to be very similar cars at
least<00:00:59.489> when<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> first<00:01:00.390> gen<00:01:00.719> CTS

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
least when you look at the first gen CTS

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.569 
least when you look at the first gen CTS
after<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.770> behind<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> wheel<00:01:02.250> they're

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
after you get behind the wheel they're

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.399 
after you get behind the wheel they're
completely<00:01:02.969> different<00:01:03.210> animals<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.960> I'll

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
completely different animals and I'll

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
completely different animals and I'll
tell<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> which<00:01:05.070> one's<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.729> alright<00:01:05.970> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
tell you which one's for you alright so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.820 
tell you which one's for you alright so
what's<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> better<00:01:06.689> place<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> start<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
what's a better place to start out that

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.190 
what's a better place to start out that
under<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> hood<00:01:08.220> as<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:09.630> pop<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> hood<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
under the hood as we pop the hood and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
under the hood as we pop the hood and
take<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.439> look<00:01:10.619> underneath<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.430> looks<00:01:11.760> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
take a look underneath it looks like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730 
take a look underneath it looks like
pretty<00:01:12.210> much<00:01:12.299> every<00:01:12.810> other<00:01:12.840> LS<00:01:13.350> engine

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

starting off with the intake the LS six
is<00:01:16.259> probably<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.580> far<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.420> factory<00:01:18.840> intakes<00:01:19.229> go

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

is probably as far as factory intakes go
one<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> best<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> LS<00:01:21.210> series<00:01:21.540> of

um the only thing about the interior

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.010 
um the only thing about the interior
that<00:06:14.460> I<00:06:14.520> don't<00:06:14.789> like<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.240> that<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.510> back<00:06:15.720> seat

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
that I don't like is that the back seat

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.310 
that I don't like is that the back seat
is<00:06:16.200> very<00:06:16.770> very<00:06:17.250> small<00:06:17.669> for<00:06:18.479> a<00:06:18.510> four-door<00:06:18.990> sedan

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
is very very small for a four-door sedan

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.130 
is very very small for a four-door sedan
I<00:06:19.620> think<00:06:20.430> about<00:06:20.580> a<00:06:20.640> cts-v<00:06:21.090> is<00:06:21.600> everything

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
I think about a cts-v is everything

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:24.440 
I think about a cts-v is everything
costs<00:06:22.500> a<00:06:22.560> lot<00:06:22.650> the<00:06:22.860> brakes<00:06:23.130> you<00:06:23.729> have<00:06:23.850> 14<00:06:24.300> inch

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
costs a lot the brakes you have 14 inch

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.779 
costs a lot the brakes you have 14 inch
rotors<00:06:24.900> which<00:06:25.410> are<00:06:25.620> expensive<00:06:26.160> as<00:06:26.460> hell<00:06:26.640> to

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
rotors which are expensive as hell to

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.210 
rotors which are expensive as hell to
replace<00:06:27.180> like<00:06:27.840> I<00:06:27.990> said<00:06:28.289> there's<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:28.919> lot<00:06:29.130> of

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 
replace like I said there's a lot of

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.680 
replace like I said there's a lot of
maintenance<00:06:29.460> things<00:06:29.940> you<00:06:30.090> have<00:06:30.180> to<00:06:30.270> do<00:06:30.419> like

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
maintenance things you have to do like

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.930 
maintenance things you have to do like
mounts<00:06:31.200> and<00:06:31.350> bushings<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:31.979> stuff<00:06:32.250> like<00:06:32.430> that

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
mounts and bushings and stuff like that

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.460 
mounts and bushings and stuff like that
if<00:06:33.180> you're<00:06:33.360> not<00:06:33.510> beating<00:06:33.750> it<00:06:33.960> too<00:06:34.080> hard<00:06:34.320> the

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
if you're not beating it too hard the

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.710 
if you're not beating it too hard the
rear<00:06:34.650> should<00:06:34.860> be<00:06:34.950> fine<00:06:35.220> but<00:06:36.030> it's<00:06:36.450> an

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
rear should be fine but it's an

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.450 
rear should be fine but it's an
expensive<00:06:37.260> car<00:06:37.440> to<00:06:37.560> maintain<00:06:37.950> and<00:06:38.220> you<00:06:38.280> should

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
expensive car to maintain and you should
