00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.510

 By the way, you can also win 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.940
 Just my channel I have an extra 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.750
 Video also a little game that 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.030
 you play the animal, so to speak 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.550
 minutes with us talent so play 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.980
 with us means with me and the car mode 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.760
 with the audi and in these few minutes 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.040
 You must not say yes or no or 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.550
 or near or otherwise synonymous for yes 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.370
 or no is not really like that 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.810
 easy but so difficult we do it 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.099
 Do not worry so we will not be there 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.379
 the whole time with questions holes where you 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.720
 So would have to answer yes or no 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:07.810
 so yes, here again to this 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.490
 So play this legendary chainsaw 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.610
 Let me explain this game for a short time 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.470
 I am in the case of the pid mosch 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.110
 yes you must belong to my orders 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.380
 for example, suppose you are now standing 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.650
 here in front of me I say fit has to say 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.140
 jumps then you have to jump all 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.390
 if I say without Whitmarsh 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.200
 says example jumps and someone jumps 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.260
 you're out of the game 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.660
 as three people can play along 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.290
 yes, the last one that remains 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.550
 from me the chainsaw quite easy 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:48.590
 Now we make the game flat 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.140
 and then we'll do it with mine 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.170
 beautiful beaches 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.850
 that was a bit late drawn that 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.880
 Incidentally, the public's favorite too 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.040
 his makes the name all honor 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.150
 a really fat shotgun so the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.459
 makes harm absolute hammer we can 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.330
 possibly at a later date 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.530
 also win 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.950
 there we have to do a little more 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.450
 to come up with games like that 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.239
 said in the video is now only time 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.500
 just about the chainsaw so my 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.169
 favorite subject is one of these times 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.169
 heavy sniper rifle 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:36.080
 which subtracts one hits like myself 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.310
