00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello youtube friends here is the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.670
 second part of errors and curiosities 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.240
 of pokemon I hope you like it let's start 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.090
 episode 10 in a scene you see him in 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.220
 the red eyes the gloves of the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.230
 they turn completely green 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 clear after having gotten him 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.580
 and misty did not fall into the river after 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.699
 breaking the bridge the gloves of the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.830
 they are always dark green 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.900
 ears of the level you have rockets are 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.300
 they turn a light brown color when 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.090
 fall into another trap should be 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.640
 black color part of the bolt powder 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.909
 bashar disappears just before he 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.680
 push to help you move the piece 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.339
 what is missing is actually the gap that 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.839
 will occupy the other hand of roasting push 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.850
 when you have captured wall bazar the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.400
 Melanie's shirt turns color 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.729
 red when in the rest of the episode is 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.070
 pink when pikachu sign pack 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.460
 thunder against ball basauri the eyes of 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.020
 ball basauri are completely red 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.020
 here we can see the good impact 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.610
 good 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.830
 Episode 13 Newt's ears are 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.500
 they turn blue when the dean 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.320
 Roque discusses how to infiltrate 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.780
 the lighthouse when bill tells that the 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.390
 planet created 4 trillion years ago 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.490
 and so he turns to look at the visor of his 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.690
 cap turns white instead 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.450
 of the eye episode 14 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.610
 when so my will have the pokemon center 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 the straps of mishti become 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.300
 sky blue instead of red episode 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 17 when jeans grabs her co fin 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.030
 doll was drawn with so much twist 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.950
 that seems broken in the scene after 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.170
 that the pokemon jump towards the cart 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.569
 jesse james do not have their gloves 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.330
 brooke says that cruel tries can not 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.450
 measure more than 15 centimeters when your 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.720
 height is 16 meters in the pokÃ©dex 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.989
 we can see that delta way is 16 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.880
 meters and not 1.5 centimeters so if 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.340
 it's a serious mistake that they made to the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.350
 time to tell him that good guys 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.510
 I hope you liked the video
