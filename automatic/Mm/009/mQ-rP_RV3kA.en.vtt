when you were not video um there is
somehow<00:00:13.769> I<00:00:14.009> can't<00:00:14.700> honestly<00:00:14.880> say<00:00:15.150> how<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.509> got

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
somehow I can't honestly say how it got

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.450 
somehow I can't honestly say how it got
started<00:00:15.839> or<00:00:16.199> why<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.590> exists<00:00:17.070> but<00:00:17.160> there<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.430> a

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
started or why it exists but there is a

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.720 
started or why it exists but there is a
big<00:00:17.820> stigma<00:00:18.119> against<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.289> skin<00:00:19.800> within<00:00:20.490> the

big stigma against a on skin within the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.420 
big stigma against a on skin within the
golf<00:00:20.939> community<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:22.199> course<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.859> probably

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
golf community of course this probably

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.950 
golf community of course this probably
stems<00:00:23.789> from<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.060> fact<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.510> Victorian

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
stems from the fact that in Victorian

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.810 
stems from the fact that in Victorian
times<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.380> was<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> sign<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> nobility<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.490> you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
times it was a sign of nobility and you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.269 
times it was a sign of nobility and you
know<00:00:26.939> being<00:00:27.180> very<00:00:27.810> well-off<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.769> very<00:00:28.980> pale

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
know being very well-off to be very pale

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.880 
know being very well-off to be very pale
because<00:00:29.580> if<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.599> were<00:00:30.720> well-to-do<00:00:31.260> then<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because if you were well-to-do then you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.100 
because if you were well-to-do then you
had<00:00:32.099> parasols<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.090> whatnot<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.660> things<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
had parasols and whatnot and things to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.720 
had parasols and whatnot and things to
avoid<00:00:34.350> getting<00:00:34.710> tan<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> never<00:00:35.460> had

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
avoid getting tan for it you never had

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.830 
avoid getting tan for it you never had
to<00:00:35.850> be<00:00:35.969> outside<00:00:36.090> because<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.630> had<00:00:36.719> other

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to be outside because you had other

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
to be outside because you had other
people<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> do<00:00:37.230> everything<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.399> Anila

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
people to do everything for you Anila

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.270 
people to do everything for you Anila
people<00:00:39.600> who<00:00:39.660> are<00:00:39.719> tan<00:00:39.989> who<00:00:40.410> were<00:00:40.829> people<00:00:41.129> who

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
people who are tan who were people who

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.819 
people who are tan who were people who
were<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.030> well-off<00:00:42.360> or<00:00:42.570> workers<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
were not so well-off or workers so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.470 
were not so well-off or workers so
that's<00:00:44.399> probably<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.879> comes<00:00:45.059> from

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
that's probably where that comes from

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
that's probably where that comes from
but<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.710> sort<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.190> those<00:00:47.309> things

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
but it is sort of one of those things

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
but it is sort of one of those things
you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.780> about<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.469> cliched<00:00:50.219> stereotypical
