from<00:00:13.320> Eagle<00:00:13.679> optics<00:00:14.070> today<00:00:14.370> we're<00:00:14.549> going<00:00:14.700> to

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
from Eagle optics today we're going to

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.730 
from Eagle optics today we're going to
talk<00:00:15.030> about<00:00:15.179> choosing<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.780> tripod<00:00:16.260> that's<00:00:16.440> best

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
for you when we talk about tripods

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.870 
for you when we talk about tripods
there's<00:00:19.289> two<00:00:19.500> fundamental<00:00:20.130> components<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
there's two fundamental components of it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
there's two fundamental components of it
first<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.750> have<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> tripod<00:00:22.350> leg<00:00:22.619> set<00:00:22.890> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
first you have the tripod leg set and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.529 
first you have the tripod leg set and
then<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.340> top<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.730> leg<00:00:23.970> set<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> need<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
then on top of that leg set you need to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.750 
then on top of that leg set you need to
attach<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.840> tripod<00:00:25.350> head<00:00:25.680> today<00:00:26.430> we're<00:00:26.670> going

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
attach a tripod head today we're going

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.099 
attach a tripod head today we're going
to<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.090> focus<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.599> leg<00:00:28.199> sets<00:00:29.900> tripods<00:00:30.900> come

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
to really focus on leg sets tripods come

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.959 
to really focus on leg sets tripods come
in<00:00:31.230> various<00:00:31.590> styles<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.250> sizes<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:32.790> like

straight bodied scope you can see I'm

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
straight bodied scope you can see I'm
where<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> need<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> taller<00:00:51.899> tripod<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
where I need to have a taller tripod the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260 
where I need to have a taller tripod the
equipment<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:53.730> sensitive<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
equipment is much more sensitive to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
equipment is much more sensitive to
being<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.510> eye<00:00:54.690> level<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> end-user<00:00:56.329> now

if I'm using an angle bodied scope I can

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.369 
if I'm using an angle bodied scope I can
use<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> shorter<00:01:00.090> tripod<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.170> bend

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
use a shorter tripod because I can bend

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
use a shorter tripod because I can bend
down<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.920> meet<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.730> angle<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> spotting

going to talk about is the leg locking
mechanisms<00:01:59.969> we<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.299> three<00:02:00.509> basic<00:02:00.659> types<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
mechanisms we have three basic types you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.039 
mechanisms we have three basic types you
have<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> twist<00:02:01.979> lock<00:02:02.189> mechanism<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> lever<00:02:03.780> lock

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
have a twist lock mechanism a lever lock

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.800 
have a twist lock mechanism a lever lock
mechanism<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.430> collar<00:02:05.759> locking<00:02:06.270> mechanism

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810

the<00:02:07.439> twist<00:02:07.740> lock<00:02:07.950> mechanism<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the twist lock mechanism is a very

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.210 
the twist lock mechanism is a very
simple<00:02:09.390> design<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.289> very<00:02:10.649> fast<00:02:10.950> or

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.900 
you've got a tripod with lever locks
rather<00:03:56.080> than<00:03:56.320> opening<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:56.830> tripod<00:03:57.310> one<00:03:57.640> lever

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
rather than opening the tripod one lever

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.780 
rather than opening the tripod one lever
at<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.090> time<00:03:59.220> but<00:04:00.220> I'd<00:04:00.310> recommend<00:04:00.430> doing

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
at a time but I'd recommend doing

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.319 
at a time but I'd recommend doing
is<00:04:02.780> using<00:04:03.200> all<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.099> levers<00:04:04.400> at<00:04:04.579> once<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:05.150> let

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
is using all the levers at once and let

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.610 
is using all the levers at once and let
gravity<00:04:05.480> do<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:05.870> work<00:04:06.019> I'm<00:04:06.349> going<00:04:06.469> to<00:04:06.530> open

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
gravity do the work I'm going to open

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.009 
gravity do the work I'm going to open
the<00:04:06.769> levers<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.129> this<00:04:07.250> tripod<00:04:07.640> like<00:04:07.879> set<00:04:08.120> turn

the levers on this tripod like set turn

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.709 
the levers on this tripod like set turn
upside<00:04:09.290> down<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.920> close<00:04:13.280> it<00:04:13.430> up<00:04:13.549> quite<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.569> bit

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:14.719 
upside down and close it up quite a bit

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.050 
upside down and close it up quite a bit
quicker<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.319> lot<00:04:15.590> simpler<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.070> do<00:04:16.190> likewise

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
quicker and a lot simpler to do likewise

take<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.250> same<00:04:34.430> concept<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:35.090> apply<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.419> to

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
take the same concept and apply it to

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.360 
take the same concept and apply it to
how<00:04:35.660> we<00:04:35.720> might<00:04:35.930> use<00:04:36.139> these<00:04:36.349> Collard<00:04:36.740> leg<00:04:37.099> locks

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
how we might use these Collard leg locks

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.460 
how we might use these Collard leg locks
on<00:04:37.580> this<00:04:37.669> tripod<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.389> set<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.020> once<00:04:39.199> again<00:04:39.349> I

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
on this tripod like set so once again I

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.939 
on this tripod like set so once again I
