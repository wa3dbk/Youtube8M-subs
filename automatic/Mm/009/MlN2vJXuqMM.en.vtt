00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.440 
have the same pretty and dark corridors
that<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.550> many<00:02:08.640> these<00:02:08.759> games<00:02:09.000> have<00:02:09.269> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that so many these games have you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
that so many these games have you
running<00:02:09.750> around<00:02:09.810> shooting<00:02:10.229> aliens<00:02:10.500> and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
running around shooting aliens and

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
running around shooting aliens and
fighting<00:02:11.640> monsters<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:12.750> wanted<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.260> be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
bit of vividness and the colors were

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.820

has a legacy to try and put its mark in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.440 
has a legacy to try and put its mark in
the<00:02:32.910> art<00:02:33.090> world<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.720> games<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.370> shapes<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the art world in games so shapes and

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.420 
the art world in games so shapes and
color<00:02:36.599> both<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:37.049> a<00:02:37.079> lot<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.829> with<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
color both have a lot to do with the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.880 
color both have a lot to do with the
readability<00:02:38.819> of<00:02:38.849> an<00:02:39.810> environment<00:02:40.079> leading

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
readability of an environment leading

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.860 
readability of an environment leading
the<00:02:40.920> player<00:02:41.310> into<00:02:41.640> an<00:02:41.760> environment<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.540> how

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the player into an environment and how

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.089 
the player into an environment and how
you're<00:02:43.049> supposed<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.380> feel<00:02:43.470> inside<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
you're supposed to feel inside of that

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.250 
you're supposed to feel inside of that
so<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.299> power<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.599> PlayStation<00:02:46.019> 3

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
so with the power of the PlayStation 3

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
so with the power of the PlayStation 3
we<00:02:46.380> really<00:02:46.680> felt<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.220> could<00:02:47.459> create

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
we really felt like we could create

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.569 
we really felt like we could create
environments<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.930> were<00:02:49.440> believable<00:02:50.250> and

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
environments that were believable and

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.000 
environments that were believable and
authentic<00:02:50.760> so<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.930> did<00:02:52.079> a<00:02:52.110> lot<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.530> research

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
authentic so we did a lot of research

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.130 
authentic so we did a lot of research
and<00:02:53.190> tons<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.610> tons<00:02:53.790> of<00:02:53.970> photo<00:02:54.269> reference<00:02:54.510> but

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
and tons and tons of photo reference but

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
and tons and tons of photo reference but
we<00:02:55.230> also<00:02:55.349> tried<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.829> put<00:02:56.310> twist<00:02:56.579> on<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
we also tried to put twist on it and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.629 
we also tried to put twist on it and
give<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.510> our<00:02:57.750> own<00:02:57.989> style<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.069> our<00:02:59.459> concept

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
give it our own style so our concept

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.729 
give it our own style so our concept
artists<00:03:00.269> would<00:03:00.569> take<00:03:00.959> these<00:03:01.139> photos<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
artists would take these photos and

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.500 
artists would take these photos and
embellish<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.549> really<00:03:03.150> set<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
embellish them and really set the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.330 
embellish them and really set the
direction<00:03:03.690> for<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.620> overall<00:03:05.010> look<00:03:05.220> of

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
direction for the overall look of

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.479 
direction for the overall look of
Uncharted<00:03:06.049> we<00:03:07.049> invested<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> lot<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.829> time<00:03:07.950> in

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
Uncharted we invested a lot of time in

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.430 
Uncharted we invested a lot of time in
our<00:03:08.639> rendering<00:03:09.030> engine<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.690> make<00:03:09.870> sure<00:03:10.139> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
our rendering engine to make sure that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.340 
our rendering engine to make sure that
the<00:03:10.560> differences<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.130> texture<00:03:11.819> between<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
the differences in texture between a

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.559 
the differences in texture between a
glossy<00:03:13.350> palm<00:03:13.650> frond<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.579> rough<00:03:14.970> surface

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
glossy palm frond and the rough surface

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.420 
glossy palm frond and the rough surface
of<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:15.989> stone<00:03:16.319> would<00:03:16.709> really<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> good

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
of some stone would really be a good

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.640 
of some stone would really be a good
clear<00:03:18.060> read<00:03:18.329> for<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.660> player<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.260> lend

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
clear read for the player and just lend

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.920 
clear read for the player and just lend
all<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.130> believability<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:21.299> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
all of this believability to the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.520 
all of this believability to the
environment<00:03:22.760> we<00:03:23.760> always<00:03:23.910> try<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> have<00:03:24.900> with

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
environment we always try to have with

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.710 
environment we always try to have with
some<00:03:25.739> things<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.340> any<00:03:27.060> games<00:03:27.389> that<00:03:27.540> never

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
some things that any games that never

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.479 
some things that any games that never
been<00:03:27.959> done<00:03:28.139> before<00:03:28.260> water<00:03:28.739> was<00:03:29.010> one<00:03:29.220> of<00:03:29.340> them

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
been done before water was one of them

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.610 
been done before water was one of them
and<00:03:29.700> we're<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.269> happy<00:03:30.540> because<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.989> adds<00:03:31.380> a

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
and we're really happy because it adds a

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.849 
and we're really happy because it adds a
lot<00:03:31.889> to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.220> realism<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.970> jungle<00:03:33.859> whether

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
lot to the realism of jungle whether

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.650 
lot to the realism of jungle whether
it's<00:03:35.040> ocean<00:03:35.400> whether<00:03:35.609> it's<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.819> river<00:03:36.000> stream<00:03:36.630> a

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
it's ocean whether it's a river stream a

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.110 
it's ocean whether it's a river stream a
puddle<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.470> waterfall<00:03:38.069> we<00:03:38.579> really<00:03:38.790> wanted<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
puddle a waterfall we really wanted to

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.030 
puddle a waterfall we really wanted to
make<00:03:39.359> sure<00:03:39.389> that<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.260> know<00:03:40.349> water<00:03:40.620> was

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
make sure that you know water was

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.800 
make sure that you know water was
everywhere<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.670> that<00:03:41.760> we<00:03:41.849> were<00:03:42.150> going<00:03:42.569> to<00:03:42.660> try

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
everywhere and that we were going to try

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.080 
everywhere and that we were going to try
to<00:03:42.900> display<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.130> a<00:03:44.250> way<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.910> never

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
to display it in a way that is never

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.600 
to display it in a way that is never
possible<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.840> form

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
possible to form

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
possible to form
hardware

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.050 

so<00:03:50.470> we<00:03:50.560> wanted<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.040> story<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.610> uncharted<00:03:51.910> to

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
so we wanted the story and uncharted to

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.180 
so we wanted the story and uncharted to
have<00:03:52.180> historical<00:03:52.720> relevance<00:03:52.990> so<00:03:53.380> we<00:03:53.950> decided

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
have historical relevance so we decided

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.700 
have historical relevance so we decided
to<00:03:54.310> focus<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:55.000> historical<00:03:55.480> figure<00:03:55.630> that<00:03:56.140> you

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
to focus on a historical figure that you
