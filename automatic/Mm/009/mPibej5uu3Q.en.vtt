00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
envelope but it's just smaller because

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.679 
envelope but it's just smaller because
it's<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.470> more<00:00:22.590> square<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.480> I'm<00:00:24.480> going

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
