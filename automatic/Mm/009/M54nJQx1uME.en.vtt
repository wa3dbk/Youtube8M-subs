00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.990
 Today I'm going to show you how this is done 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.080
 sample of this lace fabric has the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:25.810
 great advantage that comes out right 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.860
 and on the reverse it says 22 points that are 18 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.470
 of the lace 2 of the beginning and 2 of the end 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.670
 these 2 of the beginning and the two of 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.460
 final along all the fabric go 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.620
 tissues in a right spot after 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.130
 have assembled the 22 points 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.580
 I made a line 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.770
 all right from the beginning to the end and 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.060
 the next stitch begins 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.480
 Following way 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:58.360
 a right point a right point two 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.300
 two times right points which are the 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.290
 let's say the edge below we do 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:10.470
 a loop we pass a point and we do 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.470
 two points together rights 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.290
 we started a loop again 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.180
 happened to a point two points together in 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.350
 right point that's the whole stitch 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 a loop of peace begins again 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.080
 point without knitting I put the needle through the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.370
 half of the point the steps without knitting to the 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.120
 right hand needle 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.920
 then I make two points together in 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.210
 right point again a loop step 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.230
 a point without having two points together in 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:53.060
 right point and there it ends again 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:56.870
 a loop passed a point without knitting I do 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.920
 two points together in right point and the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:06.260
 teros and the steps finished again a 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.259
 lazada step 1.2 points together in a 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.590
 right point 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.950
 and there ends what is the part of the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 lace next I have the edge 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.870
 final that is in two points at one point 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.530
 right that's the whole stitch 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.450
 the next race and all the others 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.540
 they are made exactly the same 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.220
 records in the channel tell me how 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.760
 they went with the stitch that what 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.760
 applied
