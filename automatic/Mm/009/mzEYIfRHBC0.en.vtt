00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.880 
ok now we're going to put a cover on
this<00:02:04.500> jar<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.670> yogurt<00:02:06.509> cultures<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.350> tends<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
this jar as yogurt cultures it tends to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
this jar as yogurt cultures it tends to
put<00:02:08.189> off<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.909> gas<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.629> we

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
put off a little bit of gas and so we

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
put off a little bit of gas and so we
want<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.140> gas<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.590> able<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.799> escape<00:02:11.009> we

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
want that gas to be able to escape we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.500 
want that gas to be able to escape we
don't<00:02:11.400> want<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.579> put<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> tight<00:02:12.000> lid<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.360> this

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
don't want to put a tight lid on this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.360 
don't want to put a tight lid on this
jar<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.049> we<00:02:13.140> also<00:02:13.260> want<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.709> keep<00:02:13.890> things<00:02:14.159> like

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
jar but we also want to keep things like

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.729 
jar but we also want to keep things like
bugs<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.909> because<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.319> sitting<00:02:16.620> on

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
bugs out because this is not sitting on

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.160 
bugs out because this is not sitting on
the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.020 
the
so<00:02:17.319> we're<00:02:18.100> going<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.280> go<00:02:18.340> ahead<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> put<00:02:18.790> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
so we're going to go ahead and put the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.670 
so we're going to go ahead and put the
paper<00:02:19.390> coffee<00:02:19.630> filter<00:02:20.140> over<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.560> could

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
paper coffee filter over it you could

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.040 
paper coffee filter over it you could
also<00:02:20.800> use<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> tight<00:02:21.910> weave<00:02:22.120> tea<00:02:22.840> towel

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
also use a tight weave tea towel

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.840 
also use a tight weave tea towel
something<00:02:23.440> like<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:24.490> then<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> rubber

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
something like this and then a rubber

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.059 
something like this and then a rubber
band<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.420> keep<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.780> safe<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.800> want<00:02:26.980> to

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
band to keep it safe and you want to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.980 
band to keep it safe and you want to
find<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.490> relatively<00:02:28.060> warm<00:02:28.510> spot<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:28.870> your

want this to stay out of the dress so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.370 
want this to stay out of the dress so
you're<00:02:52.270> going<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.480> go<00:02:52.540> ahead<00:02:52.600> and<00:02:52.780> set<00:02:52.989> this<00:02:53.170> in

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you're going to go ahead and set this in

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.770 
you're going to go ahead and set this in

that warm spot for the next 12 to 18
hours<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.769> amount<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.160> time<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.580> need

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
hours and the amount of time you need

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.930 
hours and the amount of time you need
will<00:02:57.940> depend<00:02:57.970> on<00:02:58.690> how<00:02:59.500> warm<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.310> room<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.700> so

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
will depend on how warm the room is so

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.400 
will depend on how warm the room is so
if<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.300> warmer<00:03:01.630> room<00:03:01.780> it<00:03:02.019> may<00:03:02.110> go<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> little

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
if it's a warmer room it may go a little

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.470 
if it's a warmer room it may go a little
bit<00:03:02.709> faster<00:03:03.040> be<00:03:03.160> closer<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.550> 12<00:03:03.820> hours<00:03:04.180> if<00:03:04.360> it's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
bit faster be closer to 12 hours if it's

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.390 
bit faster be closer to 12 hours if it's
a<00:03:04.540> cooler<00:03:04.780> room<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.110> may<00:03:05.230> take<00:03:05.470> closer<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.010> 18

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
a cooler room it may take closer to 18

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.580 
a cooler room it may take closer to 18
hours<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.450> most<00:03:07.750> common<00:03:08.200> though<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.530> to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
hours it is most common though for it to

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.870 
hours it is most common though for it to
take<00:03:08.769> on<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.010> longer<00:03:09.310> end<00:03:09.489> of<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.700> time

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
take on the longer end of that time

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.449 
take on the longer end of that time
spectrum<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:11.110> once<00:03:11.380> this<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.709> set<00:03:11.890> for<00:03:12.070> 12<00:03:12.190> to

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
spectrum so once this is set for 12 to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.240 
spectrum so once this is set for 12 to
18<00:03:12.850> hours<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.040> we

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
18 hours we have this one that we

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.800 
18 hours we have this one that we
prepared<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.880> few<00:03:16.840> hours<00:03:16.989> ago<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:18.600> melt<00:03:19.600> will

prepared a few hours ago the melt will

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.170 
prepared a few hours ago the melt will
thicken<00:03:20.110> into<00:03:20.470> yogurt<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.519> not<00:03:21.640> crazy<00:03:21.850> no
