comm here's a quick look at how and why

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.009 
comm here's a quick look at how and why
I<00:00:06.540> use<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> bulk<00:00:07.680> film<00:00:08.010> loader<00:00:11.030> so<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
I use a bulk film loader so this is a

I use a bulk film loader so this is a
bulk<00:00:13.590> film<00:00:13.889> loader<00:00:14.330> basically<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.420> holds<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
bulk film loader basically it holds a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.410

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
of buying each individual cassette then

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.300 
of buying each individual cassette then
you<00:00:23.100> load<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> onto<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.970> these<00:00:25.310> they're

for<00:02:26.140> each<00:02:26.200> photo<00:02:27.040> when<00:02:27.700> you're<00:02:27.849> doing<00:02:28.000> bulk

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
for each photo when you're doing bulk

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.589 
for each photo when you're doing bulk
load<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.690> that's<00:02:28.810> one<00:02:29.019> way<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> look<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
load and that's one way to look at it

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.569 
load and that's one way to look at it
the<00:02:31.599> reason<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.590> got<00:02:32.829> into<00:02:33.069> bulk

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
the reason I really got into bulk

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.050 
the reason I really got into bulk
loading<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.410> sad<00:02:35.410> buy<00:02:36.220> a<00:02:36.250> new<00:02:36.489> camera<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.910> just
