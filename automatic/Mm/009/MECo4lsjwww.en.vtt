00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.690
 I just came back 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.690
 what years ago had it stopped 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.400
 cipriani here or in the city above half kakÃ¡ flood 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.769
 if you do not pay, go to the island and win 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.150

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.390
 the card even as those parties so 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.480
 about an hour he cut off some of their audio 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 this is the result of fishing areas 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.940
 are now sticking to talking about shipping ports 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.000
 hockenheim 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.280
 I know I'll never understand any English 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.380
 here on the plate and tccc this also said 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.870
 besides now 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.729
 if you see that behind 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.340
 in the presence here 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.240
 the team is doing this so many times 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 because if you do it 50 times 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.230
 the segment 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.570
 paulo paim 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.600
 which is a 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.770
 no default 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.240
 well then I will rudder everything is not that I whole of the judgment of the cattle 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.520
 Ah, questioning question. 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 What I was doing 50 months ago 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.550
 fifty months 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.890
 I only do 50 hours of shows here. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 port 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.400
 but I do not know who is typical if I find it from here 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.790
 now I did it here 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.790
 I got the movie 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.200
 stretched film 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.200
 the fil 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.059
 Do you want anything with Eliana? 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.569

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.569
 in which I've been a friend again limit 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.769
 if it was stuck by tymoshchuk who has back by the same way 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.389
 I think the coach wants more cited these doors 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.539
 but I'm going to start Wednesday 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.059
 the doors open 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:34.059
 starting with this video 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:56.109
 cezinha that by the same way who wants to come here and send 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.429
 and already reveals some videos may reveal 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.749
 want me to come here in the chest 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.749
 former guard 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:16.729
 dd 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.479
 is the wine from the wood the expectation was expected 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 garbage that does not work at the premiere 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 let chatting missions 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.849
 I came back here 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.359
 and I'm going to reveal that 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.349
 the film 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.299
 a hot 100 everton beauty that redetv photo 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 the redetv who does not know how to repeat in this paradise 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:49.769
 That she is from the Brazilian team. 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.769
 This is the Fluminense that has several others 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.779
 the former mayor and chose the inputs 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.059
 we just came back dead 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.059
 door 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.049
 I think the sonangol korthals punk bands 30 but we have a year 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.649
 I'm not going to cut it anymore 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.649
 because it will give a scare of loading 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.840
 in short used 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.109
 Kim but a doctor who says so far 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.229
 that I did not have 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.830
 here is the parturient 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.129
 now that agents to the team 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:42.129
 We can kill myself. 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.930
 and this is it 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.960
 at first 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.129
 campus-headquarters two than the front 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:54.840
 the day of cholera 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.840
 I took mickey rourke or inter 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.680
 colonel what work 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.129
 not 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:17.129
 She still wants to see 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:21.189
 here playing 

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:26.229
 not the recent mistake 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.370
 the same mistake 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.589
 in scope 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:30.360
 I feel bad 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.930
 silly 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.930
 We have not passed the last races yet 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.869
 your first minute dead the idea is good I already gave it 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.520
 4th 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.740
 the attacker knows that here in 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.199
 all 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.199
 that they are that by the same way of sine-mt 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.339
 what the salad 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:58.629
 reception to the sea 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.629
 the opponent is the 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.520
 What about 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.419
 That's it 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.419
 the public as unisul has to spare ammunition 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.309
 our commitment is a rather serious problem 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.169
 to indicate 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.229
 to erc 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:22.680
 they did here 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.509
 six one way 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:27.520
 and it's going to roll without anyone 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.520
 dropped 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.400
 this was James having accepted 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.599
 that's the way it is 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.599
 all the small charm and that in it 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.539
 and she changed the name lira insistently who instead of 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.260
 called breastfeeding no earlier 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.059
 and now 

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:56.059
 against the victory which means very great 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:00.169
 then that's it 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.819
 I presume people are coming back as usual 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.559
 in the meantime short 

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:09.819
 because 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:12.819
 it's a bit like in classic time with the bridge now 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.719
 of the ten members of the entity 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:19.009
 then that's it 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:20.439
 it was 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.619
 I personally met him
