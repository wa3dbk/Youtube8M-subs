00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
pretty much just use two by fours and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.310 
pretty much just use two by fours and
frame<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:19.260> put<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.910> structure<00:00:20.910> beam

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
frame it out and we put a structure beam

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.009 
frame it out and we put a structure beam
structure<00:00:22.320> by<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.830> know<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.070> ribbing<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
structure by the you know a ribbing in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.640 
every foot and from here we're going to
pond<00:00:29.099> liner<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.660> will<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.500> back

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
also once we put the liner in place we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.359 
also once we put the liner in place we
put<00:01:03.300> two<00:01:03.629> by<00:01:03.750> sixes<00:01:04.140> around<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> screwed<00:01:05.189> those

put two by sixes around it screwed those

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.830 
put two by sixes around it screwed those
in<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.030> helps<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.510> create<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
in and that helps you create the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.240 
in and that helps you create the
pressure<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.439> hold<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.119> liner<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.950> did

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
pressure to hold the liner in we did

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.250 
pressure to hold the liner in we did
this<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.700> wife<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> built<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.630> together
