things so let's say we've had that five

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
things so let's say we've had that five
hours<00:01:21.330> air<00:01:21.780> time<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.350> back<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> pilot<00:01:23.130> in

now we're going up and down the ridge

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
now we're going up and down the ridge
got<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> ridge<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.710> rides<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.670> these

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
got the ridge on the rides and all these

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
got the ridge on the rides and all these
sort<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> things<00:01:27.360> are<00:01:27.750> going<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.229> I've<00:01:28.979> got<00:01:29.189> 50

thermal the vera is going BPI yeah
that's<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.840> I'll<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> turn<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> why<00:01:50.250> not

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that's it I'll put a turn in why not

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580 
that's it I'll put a turn in why not
let's<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:50.939> what<00:01:51.119> happens<00:01:51.509> well<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.380> most

let's see what happens well you most

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
let's see what happens well you most
probably<00:01:52.740> cut<00:01:53.100> everybody<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.939> shocked

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
probably cut everybody up and shocked

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
probably cut everybody up and shocked
everybody<00:01:54.600> who's<00:01:54.960> ridge<00:01:55.229> soaring<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> put

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
everybody who's ridge soaring you put

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
everybody who's ridge soaring you put
yourself<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.579> jeopardy<00:01:56.610> because<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.479> behind

yourself in jeopardy because you behind

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
yourself in jeopardy because you behind
the<00:01:57.960> ridge<00:01:58.170> which<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.770> spine<00:01:59.130> back<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the ridge which is a spine back to

were just fly with who are rich soaring

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.790 
were just fly with who are rich soaring
so<00:02:19.090> thermally<00:02:19.660> non<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> rich<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> good

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
so thermally non the rich not a good

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.640 
so thermally non the rich not a good
idea<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:21.489> lot<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.180> problems<00:02:22.630> plus<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.200> can<00:02:23.380> hit

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
idea a lot of problems plus you can hit

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.220 
idea a lot of problems plus you can hit
it<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.970> if<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.680> want<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.040> go<00:02:27.250> out<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.849> front

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
it so if you want to go out the front

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.740 
it so if you want to go out the front
you'll<00:02:29.230> find<00:02:29.620> an<00:02:29.830> awful<00:02:30.670> lot<00:02:30.880> more<00:02:31.209> space<00:02:31.720> to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
you'll find an awful lot more space to

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.440 
you'll find an awful lot more space to
play<00:02:32.200> with<00:02:32.620> there's<00:02:33.459> not<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> lot<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.940> hit<00:02:34.239> out

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
play with there's not a lot to hit out

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.320 
play with there's not a lot to hit out
there's<00:02:34.750> quite<00:02:34.959> flat<00:02:35.290> as<00:02:35.500> well<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.610> what<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.180> do

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
there's quite flat as well so what we do

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.080 
there's quite flat as well so what we do
is<00:02:37.360> establish<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.170> pilots<00:02:38.620> in<00:02:38.769> play<00:02:39.069> blue<00:02:40.060> and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
is establish the pilots in play blue and

gliders<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.180> just<00:03:01.900> explained<00:03:02.380> as<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.620> did<00:03:02.769> at

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
gliders so I just explained as I did at

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.410 
gliders so I just explained as I did at
the<00:03:02.950> beginning<00:03:03.040> we've<00:03:03.400> rehearsed<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.299> the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
the beginning we've rehearsed it so the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.270 
the beginning we've rehearsed it so the
video<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:04.780> things<00:03:05.260> turned<00:03:05.620> out<00:03:05.830> pretty<00:03:06.130> well

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
video I things turned out pretty well

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.490 
video I things turned out pretty well
it's<00:03:06.790> more<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> demonstration<00:03:07.720> of<00:03:08.080> what<00:03:08.260> not<00:03:08.440> to

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
it's more a demonstration of what not to

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.009 
it's more a demonstration of what not to
do<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.739> how<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.099> do<00:03:09.580> things<00:03:09.849> properly<00:03:09.970> so<00:03:10.900> I've

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
do and how to do things properly so I've

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.839 
do and how to do things properly so I've
radiated<00:03:11.590> Dean<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:12.010> say<00:03:12.190> give<00:03:12.400> me<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.549> bit<00:03:12.730> of

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
radiated Dean to say give me a bit of

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.729 
radiated Dean to say give me a bit of
space<00:03:13.090> let<00:03:13.390> me<00:03:13.510> push<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.140> front<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.560> then

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
space let me push out the front and then

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.009 
space let me push out the front and then
come<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.010> join<00:03:15.370> me<00:03:15.400> to<00:03:15.760> simulate<00:03:16.359> what

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
come and join me to simulate what

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.380 
come and join me to simulate what
actually<00:03:17.440> happens<00:03:17.890> usually<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.880> pilots<00:03:19.299> out

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
actually happens usually the pilots out

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.259 
actually happens usually the pilots out
the<00:03:19.570> front<00:03:19.900> they<00:03:20.290> go<00:03:20.560> up<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:22.030> want<00:03:22.209> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
the front they go up and you want to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.270 
the front they go up and you want to
make<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.450> turn<00:03:22.870> now<00:03:23.290> sometimes<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.799> can't<00:03:24.010> turn

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
make a turn now sometimes you can't turn

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.590 
make a turn now sometimes you can't turn
because<00:03:24.760> when<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.000> look<00:03:25.120> over<00:03:25.299> your<00:03:25.540> shoulder

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
because when you look over your shoulder

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.080 
because when you look over your shoulder
there's<00:03:26.380> somebody<00:03:26.769> in<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> way<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.910> is

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
there's somebody in the way that is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.280 
there's somebody in the way that is
quite<00:03:28.359> annoying<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.049> you're<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.230> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
quite annoying so if you're going to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.990 
quite annoying so if you're going to
join<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.859> thermal<00:03:30.220> cause<00:03:30.340> somebody's<00:03:30.700> going

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
join the thermal cause somebody's going

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.780 
join the thermal cause somebody's going
up<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.329> usually<00:03:31.810> they<00:03:31.989> put<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.620> right<00:03:33.579> hand

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
up and usually they put in a right hand

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.699 
up and usually they put in a right hand
turn<00:03:34.000> bond<00:03:34.299> deliberately<00:03:35.019> going<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.350> put<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.620> a

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
turn bond deliberately going to put in a

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.400

that's<00:03:48.010> flowing<00:03:48.280> into<00:03:48.670> each<00:03:49.000> other<00:03:49.299> so<00:03:50.200> we're

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
that's flowing into each other so we're

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.920 
that's flowing into each other so we're
going<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:51.010> demonstrate<00:03:51.220> some<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.600> not<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
mid air obviously but I'm looking around

mid air obviously but I'm looking around
there's<00:03:55.930> nobody<00:03:56.410> in<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.650> way<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:57.130> could<00:03:57.400> be<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
there's nobody in the way I could be a

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.520 
there's nobody in the way I could be a
foreign<00:03:57.850> pilot<00:03:58.389> on<00:03:58.510> these<00:03:58.720> sites<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.290> don't

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
foreign pilot on these sites and don't

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.289 
foreign pilot on these sites and don't
know<00:03:59.709> some<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.190> rules<00:04:00.400> which<00:04:00.700> generally

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
know some of the rules which generally

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.930 
know some of the rules which generally
would<00:04:01.480> turn<00:04:01.750> right<00:04:02.400> 360<00:04:03.400> right<00:04:03.549> so

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
would turn right 360 right so

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.479 
would turn right 360 right so
everything's<00:04:04.690> okay<00:04:05.230> away<00:04:05.620> from<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.950> hill<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
everything's okay away from the hill and

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.530 
everything's okay away from the hill and
often<00:04:06.850> too<00:04:07.000> hip<00:04:08.160> left<00:04:09.160> hand<00:04:09.489> turn<00:04:09.880> thinking

often too hip left hand turn thinking

often too hip left hand turn thinking
that<00:04:10.810> pilot<00:04:11.260> almost<00:04:11.500> probably<00:04:12.040> turn<00:04:12.280> left

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
that pilot almost probably turn left

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.590 
that pilot almost probably turn left
obviously<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:14.200> carry<00:04:14.889> on<00:04:15.069> turning<00:04:15.519> left<00:04:15.790> I'm

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
obviously I I carry on turning left I'm

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.560 
obviously I I carry on turning left I'm
not<00:04:16.959> locals<00:04:17.919> or<00:04:18.190> a<00:04:18.370> local<00:04:18.669> on<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.060> side<00:04:19.239> let's

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
not locals or a local on the side let's

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.539 
not locals or a local on the side let's
say<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.049> look<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.530> think<00:04:20.709> what's<00:04:21.400> going

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
say and I look and I think what's going

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.150 
say and I look and I think what's going
on<00:04:21.729> here<00:04:21.970> he's<00:04:22.510> turning<00:04:23.020> right<00:04:23.200> that

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
on here he's turning right that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.830 
on here he's turning right that
that<00:04:24.490> is<00:04:24.580> coming<00:04:24.880> too<00:04:25.030> close<00:04:25.240> he's<00:04:25.570> coming

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
that is coming too close he's coming

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.150 
that is coming too close he's coming
really<00:04:25.960> close<00:04:26.050> what's<00:04:26.440> going<00:04:26.650> on<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:26.920> don't

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
really close what's going on I don't

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.960 
really close what's going on I don't
like<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.920> as<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:30.130> said<00:04:30.190> we've<00:04:30.640> rehearsed

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
like that so as I said we've rehearsed

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.570 
like that so as I said we've rehearsed
this<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.690> i<00:04:31.720> vas<00:04:31.990> dented<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.920> do<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.310> so

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
this so i vas dented it to do this so

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
this so i vas dented it to do this so
now<00:04:34.560> Dean<00:04:35.560> bird<00:04:35.830> he<00:04:36.280> puts<00:04:36.730> in<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:37.060> right-hand

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
now Dean bird he puts in a right-hand

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.410 
now Dean bird he puts in a right-hand
turn<00:04:37.690> I<00:04:37.840> think<00:04:38.110> we'll<00:04:38.530> are<00:04:38.680> follow<00:04:39.210> this<00:04:40.210> is

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
turn I think we'll are follow this is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.660 
turn I think we'll are follow this is
how<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.780> should<00:04:40.960> be<00:04:41.020> done<00:04:41.140> you<00:04:41.890> turn<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.400> same

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
how it should be done you turn the same

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.880 
how it should be done you turn the same
way<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:45.580> pilot<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.150> there<00:04:46.500> 108<00:04:47.500> degrees

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
way and the pilot is there 108 degrees

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.390 
way and the pilot is there 108 degrees
opposite<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.610> me<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:50.470> everything's<00:04:50.890> moving<00:04:51.160> a

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
opposite to me so everything's moving a

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.770 
opposite to me so everything's moving a
lot<00:04:51.760> slower<00:04:53.580> visually<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.610> can<00:04:55.030> see<00:04:55.270> them<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.510> lot

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
lot slower visually I can see them a lot

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.170 
lot slower visually I can see them a lot
clearer<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.620> want<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.400> concentrate<00:04:57.550> on<00:04:57.910> them

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
clearer I want to concentrate on them

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.730 
clearer I want to concentrate on them
too<00:04:58.420> much<00:04:58.660> you<00:04:58.900> want<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.140> be<00:04:59.230> looking<00:04:59.380> below

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
too much you want to be looking below

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.960 
too much you want to be looking below
and<00:05:00.220> possibly<00:05:00.870> down<00:05:01.870> there<00:05:02.530> above<00:05:03.010> but<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.670> see

across country we're just learning here

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.910 
across country we're just learning here
to<00:05:31.120> thermal<00:05:31.630> and<00:05:31.810> what<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.260> do<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.680> I'm<00:05:32.770> going

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
to thermal and what to do so I'm going

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.370 
to thermal and what to do so I'm going
to<00:05:32.980> teach<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.550> next<00:05:33.850> bit<00:05:34.210> of<00:05:34.420> what<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.200> do

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
to teach you the next bit of what to do

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.660 
to teach you the next bit of what to do
because<00:05:35.560> remember<00:05:35.800> if<00:05:36.010> you're<00:05:36.100> not<00:05:36.190> pilot

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670

rated<00:05:37.060> don't<00:05:37.270> go<00:05:37.480> off<00:05:37.660> on<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.840> cross-country<00:05:38.790> so

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
rated don't go off on a cross-country so

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.150 
rated don't go off on a cross-country so
I<00:05:40.240> can<00:05:40.840> share<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:41.230> open<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.680> deems<00:05:41.919> close

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
I can share it open it deems close

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.190 
I can share it open it deems close
enough<00:05:42.520> now<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.730> can<00:05:42.970> shout<00:05:43.210> over<00:05:43.419> why<00:05:43.780> don't<00:05:43.840> we

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
enough now I can shout over why don't we

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.440 
enough now I can shout over why don't we
push<00:05:44.470> out<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.860> front<00:05:45.160> there's<00:05:45.669> no<00:05:45.850> point<00:05:46.210> in

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
push out the front there's no point in

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.020 
push out the front there's no point in
going<00:05:46.930> over<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.440> back<00:05:47.830> of<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.220> hill<00:05:48.430> because

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
going over the back of the hill because

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.700 
going over the back of the hill because
there<00:05:49.300> would<00:05:49.419> be<00:05:49.450> more<00:05:49.720> compressed<00:05:50.290> over

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
there would be more compressed over

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.159 
there would be more compressed over
there<00:05:50.890> you<00:05:51.580> all<00:05:51.940> find<00:05:52.210> all<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.540> films<00:05:52.900> come

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
there you all find all the films come

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.900 
there you all find all the films come
through<00:05:53.530> there's<00:05:53.770> not<00:05:53.919> suitable<00:05:54.400> land<00:05:54.669> unless

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
through there's not suitable land unless

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.190 
through there's not suitable land unless
you<00:05:55.270> fly<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.780> a<00:05:55.930> mile<00:05:56.410> or<00:05:56.620> so<00:05:56.650> away<00:05:56.919> and

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
you fly and a mile or so away and

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.930 
you fly and a mile or so away and
dingoes<00:05:59.200> off<00:05:59.410> it's<00:05:59.770> a<00:05:59.890> nice<00:06:00.040> wing<00:06:00.430> you<00:06:00.610> notice

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
dingoes off it's a nice wing you notice

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.880 
dingoes off it's a nice wing you notice
that<00:06:01.240> the<00:06:01.419> factor<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:02.020> their<00:06:02.260> shrimp<00:06:02.560> it's

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
that the factor to their shrimp it's

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.760 
that the factor to their shrimp it's
gone<00:06:03.130> so<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.330> winds<00:06:04.600> are<00:06:04.660> not<00:06:04.810> only<00:06:05.620> about

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
gone so the winds are not only about

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.740 
gone so the winds are not only about
eight<00:06:05.950> miles<00:06:06.190> an<00:06:06.400> hour<00:06:06.520> today<00:06:06.790> I<00:06:06.940> think<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.630> it

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
eight miles an hour today I think and it

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.400 
eight miles an hour today I think and it
Nix<00:06:08.080> off<00:06:08.260> as<00:06:08.470> well<00:06:08.650> he<00:06:09.010> chases<00:06:09.580> so<00:06:10.360> all<00:06:11.110> off

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
Nix off as well he chases so all off

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.700 
Nix off as well he chases so all off
together<00:06:11.680> we're<00:06:12.160> flying<00:06:12.430> out<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.820> front<00:06:13.710> so

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
together we're flying out the front so

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.100 
together we're flying out the front so
let's<00:06:14.890> just<00:06:15.160> put<00:06:16.120> some<00:06:16.270> bullet<00:06:16.600> points<00:06:16.630> in

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
let's just put some bullet points in

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.290 
let's just put some bullet points in
here<00:06:17.410> if<00:06:17.590> you're<00:06:17.950> going<00:06:18.130> going<00:06:18.730> to<00:06:18.790> go<00:06:19.060> and<00:06:19.180> do

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
here if you're going going to go and do

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.650 
here if you're going going to go and do
a<00:06:19.330> 360<00:06:20.080> one<00:06:20.919> do<00:06:21.250> it<00:06:21.370> away<00:06:21.520> from<00:06:21.730> the<00:06:21.790> ridge<00:06:22.000> to

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
a 360 one do it away from the ridge to

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.510 
a 360 one do it away from the ridge to
thermal<00:06:23.470> in<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.620> same<00:06:23.830> direction<00:06:24.010> as<00:06:24.490> the

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
thermal in the same direction as the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
thermal in the same direction as the
other<00:06:24.820> pilot<00:06:25.350> 3<00:06:26.350> keep<00:06:26.770> looking<00:06:27.190> at<00:06:27.340> all<00:06:27.540> times

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:28.540 
other pilot 3 keep looking at all times

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.730 
other pilot 3 keep looking at all times
and<00:06:29.700> four<00:06:30.700> if<00:06:31.060> you<00:06:31.660> really<00:06:31.960> really<00:06:32.380> think

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
and four if you really really think

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.740 
and four if you really really think
you're<00:06:33.130> safe<00:06:33.460> and<00:06:33.760> doing<00:06:34.180> any

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
you're safe and doing any

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.480 
you're safe and doing any
think<00:06:34.930> in<00:06:35.140> the<00:06:35.260> way<00:06:35.440> of<00:06:35.620> turning<00:06:35.830> left<00:06:36.010> and

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
think in the way of turning left and

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.550 
think in the way of turning left and
right<00:06:36.760> in<00:06:36.910> your<00:06:37.030> films<00:06:37.480> well<00:06:37.720> you<00:06:37.990> know<00:06:38.110> do<00:06:38.320> so

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
right in your films well you know do so

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.920 
right in your films well you know do so

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
but do so with safety so she's got to be

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.340 
but do so with safety so she's got to be
the<00:06:41.260> the<00:06:41.560> top<00:06:41.830> on<00:06:42.310> the<00:06:42.550> lists<00:06:42.880> here<00:06:43.200> so<00:06:44.200> I'm
