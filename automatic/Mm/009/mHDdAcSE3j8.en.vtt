what I want to teach you guys over the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.660 
what I want to teach you guys over the
next<00:00:09.820> 10<00:00:10.059> weeks<00:00:10.240> is<00:00:10.510> the<00:00:11.170> concept<00:00:12.070> of<00:00:12.219> the<00:00:12.460> arch

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:12.670 
next 10 weeks is the concept of the arch

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.150 
next 10 weeks is the concept of the arch
and<00:00:13.180> the<00:00:13.719> concept<00:00:14.290> of<00:00:14.410> the<00:00:14.559> arch<00:00:14.740> is<00:00:15.100> the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
and the concept of the arch is the

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.310 
and the concept of the arch is the
ability<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:16.150> take<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.450> muscle<00:00:16.810> through<00:00:17.170> its

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
ability to take a muscle through its

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.710 
ability to take a muscle through its
greatest<00:00:17.680> range<00:00:18.099> of<00:00:18.340> motion<00:00:18.760> so<00:00:19.210> today<00:00:19.540> we're

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
greatest range of motion so today we're

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.300 
greatest range of motion so today we're
going<00:00:19.810> to<00:00:19.869> be<00:00:20.020> taking<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.439> look<00:00:20.590> at<00:00:20.740> chin-ups

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
and everyone wants to build a bigger

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.920 
and everyone wants to build a bigger
back<00:00:23.680> but<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.460> problem<00:00:24.970> with<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.270> term<00:00:25.540> chin

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.940 
up and I hate the word chin up because
it's<00:00:27.759> misleading<00:00:28.329> and<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:29.169> gets<00:00:29.349> people<00:00:29.649> to

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
it's misleading and it gets people to

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.370 
it's misleading and it gets people to
think<00:00:30.189> about<00:00:30.520> what<00:00:30.759> pulling<00:00:31.570> their<00:00:31.779> chin<00:00:32.110> up

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380
