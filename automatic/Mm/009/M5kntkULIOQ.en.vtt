00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.150
 hello friends my name is angel villegas and this occasion we will perform the 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.869
 simulation in the wolf program for a traffic light in a hero 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.039
 Mr. two years 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:18.099
 we'll start with a counter normally closed one open and one 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.099
 closed connection for a country - 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.359
 a magic 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.430
 as kenneth 1 i 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.440
 you feel our 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.289
 simulation with 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.780
 i 2 our brand is activated 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.470
 which it's 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.740
 p automatically 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.200
 will allow us closed connection Zionist 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.280
 is ours the red censables collation or first traffic light I will explain 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.190
 timerman 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.500
 the tri 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.160
 one side and then the other 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.110
 i once 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.120
 source the trainer one is going to count to ten 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.020
 when it is immersed one reaches who will open this connection what 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 which we turn red light 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.310
 i in this part n what is closed well mind 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.750
 and this connection of the open mind to be in it 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.180
 it will close 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.840
 which turn off the red if we have the direct connections 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.080
 the green light will come on 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.700
 the green light will count 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.530
 for 10 seconds yes for 8 seconds 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530
 once its eight seconds pass, this connection closes 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.460
 Now that our 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.680
 the Greens 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.090
 of this team 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.120
 kyl every half second 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.070
 pure four seconds 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.150
 so 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.370
 ships to unlock 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.480
 I found it ine 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.710
 villa 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.500
 her 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.550
 if it closes what is it embraces with actions sometimes had here this opens 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.320
 Connection 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 so that the light but that you know 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.910
 but also once it arrives like that in qom you have to get to four in your 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.160
 first cycle closes this connection 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.499
 and we turn on our yellow light 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.939
 by pocho seconds 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.459
 and once its eight seconds pass, this salus connection opens 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459
 yellow goes out 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.399
 hunting 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.209
 yes 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.449
 the main thing 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:26.819
 here we have a workshop 3 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.170
 but good that explained externally because 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.989
 once it arrives 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.329
 the rest is in 6 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:36.369
 for its eight seconds 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.309
 you see that this connection 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:42.789
 but automatically 9 so lamented because it's for everyone 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.610
 then those places in your system are restarting quito 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 go continuously and do not have a foot 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.739
 had this is because the two majors finish on time 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.539
 only that here, because first writing for 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:03:00.069
 now here we have for the second we have 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:04.989
 spitzer nantes from above 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.469
 once this n 1 activated is going to us atiba 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.439
 directly if we can follow this line for closed contracts 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.889
 our green light 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.359
 of in the other breast 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:17.589
 us to the greens 

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:19.249
 when our 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.209
 the country costs 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.359
 here we have a permanent contact 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.129
 ana open which 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.189
 closed 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.369
 because it is to cover 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.519
 then working together 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.929
 once it reaches 4 it will start adn 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.429
 from now 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:41.379
 nikisch active 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.039
 when I arrived 4 this one closed to start before clear villa 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.559
 Half a second 

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.039
 which will give you hanson green light the flash 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.779
 and this will count 8 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:55.499
 four seconds will be 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.539
 kelly undertaken jointly four seconds 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.119
 flash to 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.449
 i after 4 and 4 this opinion of reaching 8 will open 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.359
 these with this one made to see text connection sierra 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.479
 and it lights our q5 yellow pesos 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.870
 and now the last part is for our red light 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.650
 g here we have a country 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.909
 naco recent model normally open 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.080
 which 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.930
 that closes automatically 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.400
 when it turns green because 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.889
 what 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.930
 this workshop if we see a month that is counting up to 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.259
 so he is counting nothing 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.740
 clinton is between the connection 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.640
 c 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.780
 will close this this open permanent collection 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.189
 and good 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:49.749
 this connection everything is that all this being learned 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:53.229
 so our connection normally closed 20 6 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.449
 that will be 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.680
 closed 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.220
 and will allow our red light from the other traffic light to be on 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.809
 when the first yellow traffic light is lit 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.259
 and I got poch seconds then 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.020
 this red sabrina connection will be paid 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.119
 and the last country will be working correctly these traffic lights 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 now we'll see let's see the simulation 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.520
 ahmsa activate the 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.039
 intopress 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.279
 let's see now only the first part 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.169
 it was red on 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.159
 ten seconds 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.279
 then it will be green for eight seconds let's just see the first 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.620
 so that we get confused will be for 8 seconds 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.150
 and then it will change 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.409
 part of the east was already for four more seconds 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.409
 candia yellow position 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.469
 and it repeats chic 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.339
 country 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.369
 now let's see the second part is green for four seconds 

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:03.319
 flash to 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.639
 it will change yellow 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.639
 and subsequently 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:13.449
 now go to the two together to be able to understand 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:17.499
 already started a hundred after this and 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:20.839
 from zara 

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:23.580
 We were going to have courage 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.580
 let's do our part 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:30.749
 in this part of the term on the pointer 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.180
 mendoza red 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.240
 and albert 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.969
 using hall the other 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.819
 when the other red armchair 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.069
 l a pot changed 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.069
 dennis warned red did not pass on a throne 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:51.110
 hugo berdÃ©n may already be yellow ahmadi yellow that is this side 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.110
 keep going from this one not 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.139
 ibarra well at rest 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.169
 red does not pass from one side if they pass 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.110
 after this side 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.110
 from this side it starts to be the assange change too 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.499
 if you change green 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.639
 iguanas in this way how our traffic lights work in crossings 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.919
 it's all friends see you later
