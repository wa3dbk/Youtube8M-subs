okay<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.360> definitely<00:02:13.690> more<00:02:14.690> like<00:02:15.140> a

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
okay so this is definitely more like a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.350 
okay so this is definitely more like a
bomb<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:17.390> not<00:02:18.460> giving<00:02:19.460> me<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.850> lot<00:02:20.210> of

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
bomb it's not giving me a lot of

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.040 
bomb it's not giving me a lot of
coverage<00:02:20.870> at<00:02:21.170> all<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.420> as<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.990> see

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
coverage at all so as you can see

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.140 
coverage at all so as you can see
there's<00:02:24.620> really<00:02:25.070> not<00:02:25.340> a<00:02:25.400> lot<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.700> coverage

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
there's really not a lot of coverage

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.480 
there's really not a lot of coverage
happening<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.780> did<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.350> use<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.800> entire<00:02:28.160> one

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
happening I did just use that entire one

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.000 
happening I did just use that entire one
pump<00:02:28.850> just<00:02:29.660> on<00:02:29.810> this<00:02:29.930> area<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.680> hasn't

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
pump just on this area and it hasn't

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.650 
pump just on this area and it hasn't
done<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.370> lot<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:34.130> I'll<00:02:34.370> see<00:02:34.670> if<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.390> build

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
done a lot but I'll see if I can build

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.700 
done a lot but I'll see if I can build
it<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.230> may<00:02:36.560> be<00:02:36.620> buildable<00:02:37.870> okay<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.200> have

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
it up it may be buildable okay so I have

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.800 
it up it may be buildable okay so I have
just<00:02:40.010> finished<00:02:40.220> applying<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.360> liquid

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
just finished applying the liquid

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.910 
just finished applying the liquid
foundation<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:44.150> not<00:02:44.570> unhappy<00:02:45.320> with<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
foundation and I'm not unhappy with the

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400 
foundation and I'm not unhappy with the
product<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.970> feel<00:02:47.750> like<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.080> shouldn't<00:02:48.320> be

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
product but I feel like it shouldn't be

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.370 
product but I feel like it shouldn't be
called<00:02:48.680> a<00:02:49.040> liquid<00:02:49.640> foundation<00:02:49.880> I<00:02:50.720> think<00:02:50.900> this

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
called a liquid foundation I think this

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.880 
called a liquid foundation I think this
should<00:02:51.590> be<00:02:51.740> used<00:02:52.040> as<00:02:52.540> either<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.780> BB<00:02:54.260> cream<00:02:54.590> on

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
should be used as either a BB cream on

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.370 
should be used as either a BB cream on
your<00:02:55.700> makeup<00:02:56.540> free<00:02:56.900> days<00:02:57.170> or<00:02:58.040> as<00:02:58.640> a<00:02:58.700> primer<00:02:59.380> it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
your makeup free days or as a primer it

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.280 
your makeup free days or as a primer it
does<00:03:00.620> give<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.980> a<00:03:01.040> really<00:03:01.490> nice<00:03:01.760> bar<00:03:02.480> me<00:03:02.750> Julie

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
does give you a really nice bar me Julie

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.920 
does give you a really nice bar me Julie
base<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.100> very<00:03:04.310> hydrating<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:05.630> it's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
base so it is very hydrating but it's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.470 
base so it is very hydrating but it's
definitely<00:03:06.230> not<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.980> liquid<00:03:07.190> foundation<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.209> on
