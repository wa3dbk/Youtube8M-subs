clearance there for my center back so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.170 
clearance there for my center back so
you<00:03:10.980> will<00:03:11.129> see<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> goals<00:03:11.910> are<00:03:12.120> the

defending<00:03:49.739> lies<00:03:49.919> only<00:03:50.220> problem<00:03:50.940> maybe<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
defending lies only problem maybe in the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.620 
defending lies only problem maybe in the
year<00:03:52.430> attackers<00:03:53.430> don't<00:03:53.730> have<00:03:54.000> too<00:03:54.389> high

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630
