I'm gonna begin of his biggest negative

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
I'm gonna begin of his biggest negative
and<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.629> all<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.739> days<00:00:44.010> he<00:00:44.340> is<00:00:44.489> our

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and that is all my days he is our

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.020 
and that is all my days he is our
position<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.719> many<00:00:46.530> times<00:00:47.010> actually<00:00:47.700> he's<00:00:47.850> out

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
position so many times actually he's out

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.020 
position so many times actually he's out
positioned<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> whole<00:00:48.840> time<00:00:49.170> basically<00:00:50.100> even

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
positioned the whole time basically even

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.299 
positioned the whole time basically even
though<00:00:51.059> he<00:00:51.360> has<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:52.050> high<00:00:52.260> positioning<00:00:53.039> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
though he has really high positioning I

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.970 
though he has really high positioning I
don't<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.750> even<00:00:54.989> true<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.829> mean

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
don't know if that's even true I mean

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
don't know if that's even true I mean
look<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.340> his<00:00:56.579> 89<00:00:57.180> overall<00:00:57.629> card<00:00:57.899> where<00:00:58.079> he's<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
look at his 89 overall card where he's a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660 
look at his 89 overall card where he's a
striker

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
striker

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
striker
if<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.059> pay<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.600> sense<00:01:00.809> attacking<00:01:01.199> mid<00:01:01.410> I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
if I pay them in a sense attacking mid I

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
if I pay them in a sense attacking mid I
thought<00:01:01.859> he's<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.340> bearable<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
thought he's more bearable in that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.570 
thought he's more bearable in that
position<00:01:03.629> rather<00:01:04.170> than<00:01:04.320> anywhere<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
position rather than anywhere on the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
position rather than anywhere on the
right<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.479> seemed<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.830> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
right because he seemed to be a lot in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.630 
right because he seemed to be a lot in
central<00:01:08.970> defensive<00:01:09.390> mid<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.260> he<00:01:11.010> was<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
central defensive mid so he was just

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.580 
central defensive mid so he was just
really<00:01:12.060> weird<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> pay<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
really weird to pay off on the right

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.950 
really weird to pay off on the right
hand<00:01:13.799> side<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.340> could<00:01:15.060> explain<00:01:15.600> why<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
hand side and that could explain why I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.859 
hand side and that could explain why I
don't<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.650> him<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.580> squads<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
don't see him that much in squads on the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
don't see him that much in squads on the
right<00:01:18.990> hand<00:01:19.200> side<00:01:19.290> rather<00:01:19.740> than<00:01:19.890> robbing<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
right hand side rather than robbing and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.850 
right hand side rather than robbing and
so<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.540> forth<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.350> Bundesliga

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
so on and so forth in the Bundesliga

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.789 
so on and so forth in the Bundesliga
teams<00:01:23.159> he<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.060> don't<00:01:24.299> see<00:01:24.509> him<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.140> it's

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
teams he I don't see him much and it's

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.800 
teams he I don't see him much and it's
basically<00:01:26.220> self-explanatory<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:27.540> him<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
basically self-explanatory with him on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.249 
basically self-explanatory with him on
the<00:01:27.900> rights

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the rights

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.870 
the rights
he's<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.770> positioned<00:01:29.280> way<00:01:29.460> too<00:01:29.520> much

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
he's now positioned way too much

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210 
he's now positioned way too much
unreliable<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> counter-attack

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
unreliable if you want to counter-attack

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.999 
unreliable if you want to counter-attack
three-star<00:01:33.000> skills<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.350> weak<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
three-star skills and he is weak so a

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
three-star skills and he is weak so a
couple<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.490> things<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> same<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.600> his<00:01:36.840> 89

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
couple of things are the same as his 89

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.969 
couple of things are the same as his 89
card<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.090> his<00:01:39.299> amazing<00:01:40.079> stats<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.710> his

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
card but one of his amazing stats is his

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.789 
card but one of his amazing stats is his
dribbling<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> his<00:01:42.180> passing<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.409> good

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
dribbling and his passing is so good

think you get some

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.050 
think you get some
more<00:02:14.220> opportunities<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.250> shoot<00:02:15.610> with<00:02:15.760> him<00:02:15.879> as

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
more opportunities to shoot with him as

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.300 
more opportunities to shoot with him as
a<00:02:16.120> right<00:02:16.390> forward<00:02:16.870> rather<00:02:17.470> than<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.860> strike<00:02:18.160> or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
a right forward rather than a strike or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.729 
a right forward rather than a strike or
Santa<00:02:18.610> attack<00:02:18.849> in<00:02:19.030> mid<00:02:19.239> but<00:02:19.810> he<00:02:19.989> still<00:02:20.230> suits<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
Santa attack in mid but he still suits a

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.280 
Santa attack in mid but he still suits a
sense<00:02:21.040> attack<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.489> mid<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.910> lot<00:02:22.330> more<00:02:22.720> than

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
sense attack in mid a lot more than

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.170 
sense attack in mid a lot more than
right<00:02:23.590> forward<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.280> middle<00:02:24.580> even<00:02:25.000> right

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
right forward right middle even right

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.960 
right forward right middle even right
winger<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:25.959> that's<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.830> huge<00:02:27.069> disadvantage<00:02:27.459> for

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
winger so that's a huge disadvantage for

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.970 
winger so that's a huge disadvantage for
me<00:02:28.030> he<00:02:28.300> gets<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.930> couple<00:02:29.379> of<00:02:29.470> headers<00:02:29.800> he's

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
me he gets you a couple of headers he's

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.800 
me he gets you a couple of headers he's
okay<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> heading<00:02:30.849> he<00:02:30.940> has<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.239> full<00:02:31.510> star

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
okay a heading he has that full star

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.990 
okay a heading he has that full star
weak<00:02:32.049> foot<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.709> 99<00:02:33.340> finishing<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:33.910> the

with<00:02:36.129> him<00:02:36.310> he's<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.150> pace<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.599> well<00:02:37.629> not

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
with him he's got good pace as well not

another<00:02:41.349> thing<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.310> into

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
another thing that you have to take into

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.369 
another thing that you have to take into
consideration<00:02:43.180> some<00:02:43.209> people<00:02:43.690> prefer<00:02:43.900> really

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
consideration some people prefer really

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.559 
consideration some people prefer really
for<00:02:44.620> swingers<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.730> guy<00:02:45.880> isn't<00:02:46.150> really

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
for swingers and this guy isn't really

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.690 
for swingers and this guy isn't really
fast<00:02:46.840> at<00:02:47.049> all<00:02:47.079> even<00:02:47.680> though<00:02:47.829> his<00:02:48.069> Cod<00:02:48.400> stats

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
fast at all even though his Cod stats

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.150 
fast at all even though his Cod stats
show<00:02:48.940> he's<00:02:49.180> quite<00:02:49.420> fast<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:49.989> didn't<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.709> don't

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
show he's quite fast I didn't I don't

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.490 
show he's quite fast I didn't I don't
