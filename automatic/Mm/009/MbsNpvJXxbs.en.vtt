00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.420
 but also crit 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.420
 also known as a producer and not one 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.079
 first communicator 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.079
 companies are looking for on the android platform 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.739
 in this region 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.329
 appearance of the device 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.240
 Immediately I want to note h 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.529
 somewhat unusual arrangement 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.949
 element which especially those who st 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.579
 use with pump device 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.539
 what reason is left 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.240
 volume keys with a dip 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.620
 but in other way 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.620
 their comfortable schmal 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 and more 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.640
 so he can't get used 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.800
 there is a button 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.750
 camera activation 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 actually chechnya 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 removed 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100
 what day usa 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.810
 an economic ment plan like this 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.920
 no buttons 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.880
 call her cancel 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.260
 no hassle 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990
 here not to 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.370
 start dialing the number you need to press 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.030
 phone icon 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.880
 met marmots 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.230
 but also during the incoming call 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.010
 and withdraw liver pressed 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.750
 button screens 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.870
 but there is 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.870
 quick jump to task manager 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 search button only back 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.760
 menu button 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
 different 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 before the show 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.450
 still 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.150
 truck cover me a sample of red 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.190
 colors 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.190
 I'll start the Komsomol windows 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.260
 the first thing he would point out who took 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.800
 in hand 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.660
 long could not understand 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.020
 how to remove the cover 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530
 still grandpa removed the lower part 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.640
 because the top pyshma nexus 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.370
 also not worth it 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.080
 compositions 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.260
 if i tried to pull the book covers the meniscus 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.629
 top cover 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.219
 the other day 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.209
 it all seemed very simple 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.679
 so there is such a thing 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:16.919
 cabbage 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.539
 one who wants 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.999
 need more often and the cover is removed 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.049
 the cap sits securely 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.009
 that is, there is no increase in claims 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:29.139
 surface takes its 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 there is still such an attack 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.909
 looks spectacular 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.299
 get dirty and scratched 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.299
 About scratching more in the review 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.359
 of which remain minor scratches which 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.040
 invisible but I think in a year 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.839
 of use 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.839
 they will become well visible 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.049
 getting dirty 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.239
 but not very much 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.489
 plus the device is to saints on 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.769
 the screen 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.639
 it is very unnoticeable 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.509
 you can see them all up to variables 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:02.409
 angle there 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.249
 losing a finger 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.149
 therefore it can be considered advantages 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:10.429
 in size 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:12.899
 cell device 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 the reader could himself 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.599
 in the first pages 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.229
 together with the current big 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.229
 Tuva Chamber 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:34.870
 an example of such constructions
