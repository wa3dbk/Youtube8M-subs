depth<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.450> field<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.050> used<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
depth of field that we used to with the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
depth of field that we used to with the
large<00:00:40.829> sensor<00:00:41.160> cameras<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.940> put<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
large sensor cameras but put it in a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.610 
large sensor cameras but put it in a
really<00:00:42.480> small<00:00:42.780> package<00:00:43.200> that's<00:00:43.410> about

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
really small package that's about

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.190 
really small package that's about
fifteen<00:00:43.980> percent<00:00:44.250> smaller<00:00:44.399> than<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> c300<00:00:45.210> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
fifteen percent smaller than the c300 so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
fifteen percent smaller than the c300 so
it's<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.530> mobile<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.550> light<00:00:47.730> easy<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it's really mobile really light easy to

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.869 
it's really mobile really light easy to
use<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.649> some<00:00:49.800> automatic<00:00:50.190> features<00:00:50.730> as

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
mic as well for the same purpose if

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.540 
mic as well for the same purpose if
people<00:00:57.449> are<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> move<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> core

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
people are really on the move the core

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
people are really on the move the core
difference<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.059> well<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.960> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
difference as well is that this is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
great and is it also fifteen percent

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
great and is it also fifteen percent
lighter<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.760> well<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.600> sizes<00:01:13.020> around

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
lighter as well or the sizes around

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.200 
lighter as well or the sizes around
fifteen<00:01:13.590> cents<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.190> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.970> lighter

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
fifteen cents for it is a bit lighter

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.070 
fifteen cents for it is a bit lighter
than<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.470> sizes<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.640> around<00:01:18.060> obviously<00:01:18.780> we

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
than the sizes right around obviously we

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.570 
than the sizes right around obviously we
still<00:01:19.230> have<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.350> same<00:01:19.560> modular<00:01:19.980> concepts<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
still have the same modular concepts and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
still have the same modular concepts and
we<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.790> remove<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:22.140> handle<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.920> you'll<00:01:23.100> end

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.740 
we can remove the handle and you'll end
up<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.000> tiny<00:01:24.270> core<00:01:24.570> body

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
up with just this really tiny core body

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380 
up with just this really tiny core body
as<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> minimum<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.550> now<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.240> this<00:01:27.330> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
as the minimum right right now is this a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.300 
as the minimum right right now is this a
kit<00:01:27.870> lens<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> comes<00:01:28.470> with<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
kit lens that comes with it no it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.860 
kit lens that comes with it no it
doesn't<00:01:29.580> come<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.850> lens<00:01:30.030> okay<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.840> a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
doesn't come to the lens okay this is a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.670 
doesn't come to the lens okay this is a
nice<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:31.920> female<00:01:32.250> 1<00:01:32.640> point<00:01:32.850> 2<00:01:32.970> prime

nice two female 1 point 2 prime
obviously<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.800> fast<00:01:35.010> lenses<00:01:35.460> are<00:01:35.580> really

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
obviously the fast lenses are really

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.010 
obviously the fast lenses are really
great<00:01:35.940> for<00:01:36.060> these<00:01:36.210> large<00:01:36.390> sensor<00:01:36.690> cameras

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
great for these large sensor cameras

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
great for these large sensor cameras
could<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.230> get<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.410> ring<00:01:37.710> each<00:01:37.830> other

falsely of lenses are grateful so yeah
the<00:01:46.080> sensor<00:01:46.440> is<00:01:46.560> something<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.979> want<00:01:47.160> to<00:01:47.250> talk

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
the sensor is something I want to talk

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.300 
the sensor is something I want to talk
about<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.970> super<00:01:48.630> 35<00:01:49.170> millimeter<00:01:49.680> CMOS<00:01:50.130> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
about it's a super 35 millimeter CMOS is

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
about it's a super 35 millimeter CMOS is
what<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.550> guys<00:01:50.700> call<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.770> explain<00:01:52.770> how

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
what you guys call it now explain how

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.440 
what you guys call it now explain how
that's<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.400> different<00:01:53.580> than<00:01:53.910> maybe<00:01:54.300> the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that's a little different than maybe the

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.820 
that's a little different than maybe the

super<00:02:21.129> 35<00:02:21.489> millimeter<00:02:21.849> sensors<00:02:22.269> okay<00:02:22.719> so

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
super 35 millimeter sensors okay so

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.509 
super 35 millimeter sensors okay so
that's<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.469> the<00:02:23.560> core<00:02:23.739> reasons<00:02:24.099> that<00:02:24.249> we

so<00:02:29.260> much<00:02:30.129> lower<00:02:30.370> noise<00:02:30.579> much<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.299> sensitivity

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
so much lower noise much I sensitivity

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.110 
so much lower noise much I sensitivity
beautiful<00:02:32.469> color<00:02:32.680> rendition<00:02:33.040> still<00:02:33.849> really

quite<00:02:36.159> as<00:02:36.280> shallow<00:02:36.430> as<00:02:36.609> a<00:02:36.730> full-frame<00:02:37.150> sensor

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
quite as shallow as a full-frame sensor

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.160
