 very common problem in samsung notebook 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.230
 of model RV 415 is a problem that 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.689
 when we installed windows 7 on it 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.480
 especially the team here I believe 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.529
 that if all 27 that I saw is in the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.560
 Internet 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.650
 a lot of people complaining is any 87 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:36.879
 When we were on this notebook, you have 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.210
 a very common problem that is the brightness 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:45.090
 people can not change the brightness or 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.090
 he always keeps that screen off 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.660
 You understand, it 's very simple.

 Ã“ does not appear this option does not appear 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.090
 You can give a lot of headaches there 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.200
 several users because I really do not even 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.840

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:55.480
 This is the strength of a year out. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.990
 here is saying that it is for 64 bits 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.930
 but this does not matter nure 32 bits 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.280
 also works this is a little pack of 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.840
 drive that comes with many auxiliary drives 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.959
