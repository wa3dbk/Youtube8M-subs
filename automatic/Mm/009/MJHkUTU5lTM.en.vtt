 once finished you can safely 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.900
 open it, however, once the first is opened 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.820
 time will ask you to perform 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.680
 updates and then you absolutely must 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.820
 don't do them because otherwise you don't 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.370
