that is so unusual we just had to do a

about as commonplace as it can be we

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.700 
about as commonplace as it can be we
hardly<00:00:16.880> give<00:00:17.090> a<00:00:17.119> thought<00:00:17.330> to<00:00:17.599> it<00:00:17.750> because<00:00:18.380> we

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
hardly give a thought to it because we

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.950 
hardly give a thought to it because we
almost<00:00:18.860> always<00:00:19.220> have<00:00:19.610> plenty<00:00:19.849> of<00:00:20.150> good<00:00:20.660> clean

and<00:00:24.320> we<00:00:25.039> start<00:00:25.369> out<00:00:25.519> with<00:00:25.699> something<00:00:26.180> you

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
and we start out with something you

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:34.060

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
it from here the water goes out into the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.060 
it from here the water goes out into the

that the city started for the fair they

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.500 
that the city started for the fair they
add<00:05:08.560> coagulants<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.490> then<00:05:10.090> they<00:05:10.210> let<00:05:10.390> the

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
add coagulants and then they let the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.240 
add coagulants and then they let the
water<00:05:10.720> sit<00:05:11.020> awhile<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.650> let<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.980> big

that matter middle chamber there you can

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.720 
that matter middle chamber there you can
see<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.680> water<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.010> much<00:05:18.220> darker<00:05:18.700> a

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
see the water is much darker a

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.180 
see the water is much darker a
chocolatey<00:05:19.390> brown<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:20.080> that<00:05:20.110> is<00:05:20.830> where<00:05:21.010> all

almost immediately right in that first
chamber<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.820> if<00:05:27.910> you<00:05:28.000> look<00:05:28.180> at<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.360> contrast

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
chamber and if you look at the contrast

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.320 
chamber and if you look at the contrast
between<00:05:29.080> the<00:05:29.650> dark<00:05:29.890> brown<00:05:30.130> in<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.760> center<00:05:31.120> and

between the dark brown in the center and

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.210 
between the dark brown in the center and
what's<00:05:31.930> falling<00:05:32.170> over<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.620> where<00:05:32.890> you<00:05:33.070> can

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
what's falling over this where you can

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.770 
what's falling over this where you can
see<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.700> clarity<00:05:33.940> of<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.270> water<00:05:34.300> is

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
see that the clarity of the water is

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.100 
see that the clarity of the water is
much<00:05:35.500> improved<00:05:35.980> and<00:05:36.300> so<00:05:37.300> now<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.570> water<00:05:37.870> is

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
much improved and so now the water is

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.830 
much improved and so now the water is
clear<00:05:38.500> but<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:39.040> clear<00:05:39.460> or<00:05:39.760> clean<00:05:40.270> enough<00:05:40.570> not

clear but not clear or clean enough not

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.580 
clear but not clear or clean enough not
even<00:05:41.080> close

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590

disinfect the water kill bacteria and

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.230 
disinfect the water kill bacteria and
they<00:05:46.750> add<00:05:46.960> more<00:05:47.200> coagulants<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.760> water<00:05:49.000> is

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
they add more coagulants the water is

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.810 
they add more coagulants the water is
very<00:05:49.600> slowly<00:05:50.110> stirred<00:05:50.710> in<00:05:51.040> these<00:05:51.250> basins

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.290 
together the particles that are left in
a<00:05:56.290> process<00:05:56.770> called<00:05:56.820> flocculation

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
a process called flocculation

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.680 
a process called flocculation
and<00:05:59.420> so<00:05:59.840> those<00:06:00.140> slow<00:06:00.440> mixing<00:06:00.910> particles<00:06:01.910> get

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
and so those slow mixing particles get

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.180 
and so those slow mixing particles get
larger<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.230> larger<00:06:03.290> through<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.890> mixing

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
larger and larger through the mixing

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.980 
larger and larger through the mixing
process<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:05.090> then<00:06:05.210> they<00:06:05.330> move<00:06:05.540> into<00:06:05.750> the

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
process and then they move into the

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.080 
process and then they move into the
primary<00:06:06.440> settling<00:06:06.920> area<00:06:07.250> where<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.820> heavier

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
primary settling area where the heavier

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.380 
primary settling area where the heavier
particles<00:06:08.420> drop<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.230> bottom<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:10.390> still

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
particles drop to the bottom and still

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.940 
particles drop to the bottom and still
it's<00:06:11.570> not<00:06:11.750> ready<00:06:12.110> but<00:06:12.350> it's<00:06:12.500> getting<00:06:12.800> close

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
it's not ready but it's getting close

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.880 
it's not ready but it's getting close
the<00:06:13.730> water<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.270> then<00:06:14.510> pumped<00:06:14.540> indoors<00:06:15.530> and

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
the water is then pumped indoors and

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.770 
the water is then pumped indoors and
here<00:06:16.130> in<00:06:16.250> the<00:06:16.340> treatment<00:06:16.760> plant<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:17.300> will<00:06:17.570> get

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
here in the treatment plant it will get

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.530 
here in the treatment plant it will get
its<00:06:18.020> final<00:06:18.560> filtering<00:06:19.130> and<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.970> best<00:06:20.240> thing

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
its final filtering and the best thing

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.900 
its final filtering and the best thing
for<00:06:20.570> that<00:06:20.840> well<00:06:21.740> you<00:06:21.890> can't<00:06:22.220> do<00:06:22.430> much<00:06:22.610> better

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
for that well you can't do much better

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.480 
for that well you can't do much better
than<00:06:23.240> what's<00:06:23.480> found<00:06:23.780> in<00:06:23.960> nature<00:06:24.200> this<00:06:25.160> water

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 
than what's found in nature this water

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.150 
than what's found in nature this water
will<00:06:25.880> seep<00:06:26.150> down<00:06:26.420> through<00:06:26.870> sand<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:27.560> gravel

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
will seep down through sand and gravel

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.420 
will seep down through sand and gravel
before<00:06:29.060> it<00:06:29.390> gets<00:06:29.720> pumped<00:06:29.960> out<00:06:30.140> to<00:06:30.200> us<00:06:30.560> most<00:06:31.160> of

before it gets pumped out to us most of

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.430 
before it gets pumped out to us most of
the<00:06:31.520> turbidity<00:06:31.970> and<00:06:32.420> the<00:06:32.600> final<00:06:32.990> step<00:06:33.230> is

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
the turbidity and the final step is

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.350 
the turbidity and the final step is
taken<00:06:33.830> out<00:06:33.980> in<00:06:34.100> the<00:06:34.190> first<00:06:34.460> few<00:06:34.760> inches<00:06:34.970> of<00:06:35.240> the

taken out in the first few inches of the
sand<00:06:35.630> and<00:06:35.930> then<00:06:36.080> flows<00:06:36.350> clean<00:06:36.770> down<00:06:37.070> to<00:06:37.340> the

rest of the filter you don't need to

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.510 
rest of the filter you don't need to
change<00:06:41.540> those<00:06:41.990> filters<00:06:42.320> you<00:06:42.710> just<00:06:43.010> do<00:06:43.280> a

change those filters you just do a

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.610 
change those filters you just do a
