fast<00:02:30.350> or<00:02:30.770> break<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.850> figured<00:02:32.450> I'd<00:02:32.570> go<00:02:32.750> through

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
fast or break I figured I'd go through

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.930 
fast or break I figured I'd go through
the<00:02:33.650> first<00:02:33.830> one<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.100> get<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> field<00:02:34.760> of

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
the first one just get the field of

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.699 
the first one just get the field of
course<00:02:35.180> my<00:02:35.360> strats<00:02:35.660> do<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.930> correctly<00:02:36.410> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
course my strats do it correctly and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.770 
course my strats do it correctly and
then<00:02:37.340> after<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.580> got<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:37.910> confident<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> forgot

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
then after I got more confident I forgot

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.960 
then after I got more confident I forgot
punching<00:02:39.230> through<00:02:39.470> our<00:02:39.830> it<00:02:40.459> was<00:02:40.580> quite

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
punching through our it was quite

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.000 
punching through our it was quite
technical<00:02:41.540> since<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.230> had<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.470> lot<00:02:42.980> of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
technical since I had a lot of

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
expect it to be a little bit different

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.240 
expect it to be a little bit different
