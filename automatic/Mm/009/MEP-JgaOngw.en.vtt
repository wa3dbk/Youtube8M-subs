00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.199

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.640
 relational 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.710

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.920
 see who is on the train 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 not just once again from the neighborhood 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.150

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.220
 just had a little bit 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.820
 for the muscles to come back to life, political tingling in your entire body 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.120
 you read in lightly for years and you notice work 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.620
 the world top 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.090
 clothes end up in your body 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.800
 make an unstable image of the environment in the two eighties, but you are me 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.730
 know exactly where your percentage where you are sirte person jameerah are in 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.970
 the libertines the selection all from sassenheim 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.210
 as if dragged into the drawer 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.360
 usually the muscles 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.090

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 that will rise 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.880
 the four-yearly here 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.610
 in names are of course the numbers are meaningful 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.900
 with all the person playing the role 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.810

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.350

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.730
