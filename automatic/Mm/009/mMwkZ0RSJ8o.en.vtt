00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.919
 hello reviews driver san francisco messerer in 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.800
 the area of ​​the village is the fact that we continue 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.779
 pass in that the third part seemed 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.149
 put an end to all northern it 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.000
 Sakub about the Georgian civil service 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.529
 the territory of the Samara region volume 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.199
 transshipment in ports to help in the work 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.189
 curve 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.579
 we did not want to make a parody of china 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.019
 but then everything is better by the continuation of the same 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:34.050
 way year 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.410
 in the Bundesliga 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.010
 this way around 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.410
 nobody really expected the same said 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 think and what can be lost 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.360
 when football sounds terrible but in reality it's 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.460
 really cool because you nobody 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.250
 is limited 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.680
 you can't taxi ran into this you 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.170
 can yourself knock your opponent 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.720
 oncoming cars 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.000
 intervene in a meeting 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.930
 Enough that no one thinks 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.540
 he will not say so 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.490
 yes of course it bothers with time 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.470
 labs workers tried to diversify missions 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.300
 over time, be apart from you 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.390
 the main villain, too, can be self-manners 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.800
 special forces trying usually 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.990
 why it just gave one example 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.490
 took a moment in which can 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.190
 plant I'm not going to argue 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.790
 the director is just going 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:20.509
 unimaginable 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.139
 so I was very pinned looked 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.469
 dialogue when the protagonist means such 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.369
 politicians begin to publish the law 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.349
 human especially in this regard the apparatus 

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:29.459
 mission in which the main character 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.060
 moved into the body of one of the Chinese 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.060
 teenagers 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 who became that against Poland 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.410
 participating in the competition with the fact that the main 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.680
 hero helped they win and every 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.850
 Once in the EU is the last time 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 at this time again they participate in it 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.710
 sense that the matter is taken what is 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.630
 but apparently after the throw 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.210
 ok now we will win and all this 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 exactly the last how much is already possible 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 interlocutor daring one voice 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.770
 city ​​volume earned 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.420
 hijack win race score in game me 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.450
 of course I liked about difficult 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.499
 but after the seizure of enterprise utilities 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.459
 moments plus everything that happens in 2008 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:04.999
 year said the protagonist who 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.790
 phone but 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.809
 what is going on 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.019
 defined by the chapter screen 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.769
 litov game console earlier in 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.639
 driver since it is sharp 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.199
 increasing the events of the road workers 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.999
 the list is an interesting point 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.219
 There are a lot of videos in the game 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.579
 pretty outdated what they did 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.729
 developers during tilt rollers 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.389
 economist parts overnight comes entered 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.729
 in bishkek request for verification of these machines 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.619
 yeah show faces there is one video made 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.909
 of the best practitioners who congress inspection 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.039
 structures I have never before 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.869
 saw games 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.949
 it can be assigned differently 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:40.979
 the judge was the developer 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.469
 which rages in tegusigalpe ga in 2010 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.699
 I was the same year in this 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.409
 some rub 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.709
 but very simply azar that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.079
 get out of the situation because such 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:51.989
 videos really 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.359
 nice if kindergarten engine 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 machines as leadership they are there 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.219
 Russian gas 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.419
 if only fit 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.419
 I set the task 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.959
 enjoy 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.379
 There are a lot of challenges in the game 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.659
 garages drug machine can buy 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:16.889
 imagine for example audi and development dreaming 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.899
 lovers 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:19.969
 intelligible 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.649
 in the game everything is available even after 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.110
 the passage of the plot is therefore an institution 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.060
 I want longer October 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.029
 do that 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.799
 in many occupations 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.959
 physicist cars of course very neat 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.769
 can admit wall cladding especially 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.909
 It will turn out of course considering that of the cars 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.709
 you can not open permanently of course 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.209
 something quickly annoys 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.389
 but the teacher group will even make some 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.059
 time and then you want to play again 

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.449
 There is a lot to learn 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.960
 Migrations went to the game for the benefit 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960
 because all 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.109
 being a new opportunity for 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.749
 forecast queue will be made with 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:55.929
 plots 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.929
 given the relevance 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.979
 most likely six 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.429
 and empty who plays 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.429
 two months the culprits and she 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.519
 so if you want something new 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.489
 suppliers gave 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.359
 play for sure 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.439
 but if you don't like it, don't 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:24.550
 lose 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.930
 my assessment by the departments 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.979
 it's really 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.689
 first half in the last 10 years 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:31.420
 which are too good 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.340
 and it makes everyone happy thank you for your attention 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.580
 so as mania
