and<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.410> mirage<00:00:58.710> drive<00:00:59.100> gets

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and as you can see the mirage drive gets

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
and as you can see the mirage drive gets
in<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:02.520> know<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.699> one<00:01:03.180> average<00:01:03.719> peddler<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
in we know that one average peddler can

in we know that one average peddler can
be<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.890> average<00:01:05.460> paddlers<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.630> how<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
be to average paddlers but how would I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.440 
be to average paddlers but how would I
do<00:01:07.080> against<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.400> best<00:01:08.610> paddlers<00:01:09.270> ever

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
mirage drive ok here we go go these guys

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.609 
mirage drive ok here we go go these guys
are<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.780> looks<00:01:27.990> like

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:40.880 

let's<00:01:31.619> go<00:01:31.880> nigga

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.620 

well<00:01:41.890> obviously<00:01:42.100> I'm<00:01:42.550> not<00:01:42.730> as<00:01:42.880> strong<00:01:43.060> as<00:01:43.360> Greg

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
well obviously I'm not as strong as Greg

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.560 
well obviously I'm not as strong as Greg
Barton<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.680> what<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:44.860> going<00:01:45.190> on<00:01:45.310> as<00:01:46.120> it<00:01:46.360> turns

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
Barton so what is going on as it turns

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.540 
Barton so what is going on as it turns
out<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.960> Mirage<00:01:47.230> drive<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.740> just<00:01:47.920> remarkably

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
out the Mirage drive is just remarkably

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.670 
out the Mirage drive is just remarkably
efficient<00:01:49.120> at<00:01:49.300> converting<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.990> energy<00:01:50.440> and

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
efficient at converting the energy and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.280 
efficient at converting the energy and
motion<00:01:51.310> of<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.970> human<00:01:52.300> body<00:01:52.480> into<00:01:52.930> forward

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
motion of the human body into forward

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.770 
motion of the human body into forward
thrust<00:01:53.620> the<00:01:54.550> Mirage<00:01:54.760> drive<00:01:55.090> does<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> number<00:01:55.630> of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
thrust the Mirage drive does a number of

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.320 
thrust the Mirage drive does a number of
things<00:01:55.900> well<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:56.650> primarily<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.730> fins<00:01:57.970> sweep

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
things well but primarily the fins sweep

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.630 
things well but primarily the fins sweep
a<00:01:58.450> large<00:01:58.690> area<00:01:59.290> therefore<00:02:00.220> they<00:02:00.370> move<00:02:00.550> a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
a large area therefore they move a

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.610 
a large area therefore they move a
tremendous<00:02:01.120> volume<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.570> water<00:02:01.720> while<00:02:02.560> the

tremendous volume of water while the
Mirage<00:02:02.980> drive<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.520> very<00:02:03.760> efficient<00:02:04.300> the<00:02:04.750> main

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
Mirage drive is very efficient the main

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.020 
Mirage drive is very efficient the main
benefits<00:02:05.470> of<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.680> Mirage<00:02:05.950> drive<00:02:06.370> have<00:02:06.700> to<00:02:06.910> do

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
benefits of the Mirage drive have to do

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.300 
benefits of the Mirage drive have to do
with<00:02:07.210> ergonomic<00:02:07.540> seeeeee<00:02:07.950> number<00:02:08.950> one<00:02:09.130> you
