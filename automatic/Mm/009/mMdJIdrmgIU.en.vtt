00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.029
 the web I in about beams 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.189
 black bars not among criminals 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.980
 beam but it is about black beams 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 actually is from bamboo screens 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 no black bars for the top 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 both ears are the divorce i have i 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.859
 did they just did not see him that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.199
 can also follow because my television 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.330
 else set up others 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.740
 screen size that you own at 20 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.590
 at 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.840
 well i have but the beer is already help red 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 screen becomes a lot of code cutting head 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.019
 taboos kind of about he thinks of it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.610
 that that project to this would 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.950
 namely being fat when those games are so smart 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 was on who records what type or 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.910
 resolution then he goes even higher 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.469
 black bar but the living god oh yes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 which will get you to yell his 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.420
 just watch that you give up 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.160
 so gaming that would be crazy 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.789
 very small if you register it 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.100
 year of 21 at brother is fencing 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.899
 well you come in pumped down that i think 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 that there was no style choice at the time 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.800
 black bars but he got that 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 online something in luck technique too late 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.289
 are we now have everything against them 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.870
 basically everything they do 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.460
 have invented wound that core then come 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.360
 people behind it did n't sit under like and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.360
 I think indeed 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.150
 that's just pumped them more 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.600
 having to render the family processor 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.100
 career and that is why they have one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.909
 bit the pinched each other and follow them 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.380
 thought you know what 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.850
 ok yes we just say it is 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 language choice that is a movie music game 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 a clever lie lie and what tjee 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 don't lie that hot for finding 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.990
 he pose differently than it is he now 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
 I find that rather lightly lille and 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 the spr that is because yes but the here 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.070
 enters that it is also one that they do not 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.920
 really a very beautiful one 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.530
 so not you on mountains but maybe 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.880
 now all of those guests would have violence 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.229
 we are working smoothly 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.490
 with a game you get technically 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.710
 out of order 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.170
 south had black bars will 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.600
 less beautiful and I fell 30 which is also one 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.610
 thing that i do here tricks to take care of 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.930
 that they do not have everything but also a small one 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.880
 guest says then you know i do it too 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.660
 and then master can only have one 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.710
 stay we are used to it and he will 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.270
 is a very interesting discussion 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.460
 that I don't say that to people below 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.289
 the cradle of the order this Friday was that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.610
 I think on Saturday morning where quite 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.870
 great was a really nice role fun 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.670
 discussion and that went on to understand it 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.720
 also get on twitter on conversation with a 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.340
 someone who loves what I think 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.820
 is it indeed lying or is it 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.290
 occur differently than or is the PRM and and 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.700
 boy who said yes but you can teenagers 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.230
 is never believing because they make it 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.610
 always more beautiful than anything but better 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.130
 then it is something different then 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.390
 just promise something that is not there then 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.739
 kind of a dividing line 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.450
 yes but he would, but that's it 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.670
 the media to go to village 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.650
 yes that you are promised something is not there 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.660
 someday they didn't do with i say 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.700
 we just very selective part of the 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.970
 game really shows you this is the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.500
 game what is true martin 60% because yes 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.360
 rest of the game did not get late 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.769
 she doesn't open my heart no so exactly 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.900
 and what he said yes with them to the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.610
 media the controlling task to such a hype 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.280
 taken out problem is only there 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.570
 can your young ear on the basis of what you 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.130
 to see 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.110
 and we actually always have 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.829
 we see roughly the same kind of gameplay 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.329
 never have 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.920
 so say the total picture of what 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.570
 the end of words it's relevant to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.070
 Do not pick out beautiful life if you 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.989
 does not see all that though from the start 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.180
 All said that uninspired 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.380
 hired for clone was what me 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.910
 quite right 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.650
 but we will everything is not very much 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.209
 I think they have it anyway 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.220
 fairly consciously sent 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.530
 well have something it was not 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.150
 don't want to show up 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.530
 call essen creed unity there too 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.769
 wrong we basically have the idea 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.390
 that david and jelle have seen something 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.220
 In the end the game was already working 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.720
 then rather sweater we were very shocking 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.200
 its also a completely different game 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.200
 was antlers 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.810
 no , I still think so 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.940
 appreciated if they just got it 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.780
 wrapping paper 6 is names we do something 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.430
 do very different 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.069
 yes no okay but you have to sing well 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.180
 I think you see what there I would 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.459
 not the six is ​​name 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.959
 have been if it had anything to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.970
 it wasn't men in his speak and 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.209
 I write that the real issues 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.940
 is not telling something is lying 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.220
 That is a question if you have money to it as well 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.420
 not visible from a very whole like 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.250
 I conceal something 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.650
 Then you come and keep silent 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.209
 other than specify another reason for 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.610
 the fact that the black bar is this as 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.080
 they say it's a style choice and now 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.419
 turns out it's not my style crossed 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.250
 but in technical rescue is possible 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.870
 blue manner of eden that is it is one 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.459
 assumption and you will probably get it 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.760
 in half a year then it comes from 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.320
 the comes there becomes the order 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.180
 Announced in 1741 and then the man says yes 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.440
 that black bar in a bit because that 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.660
 is not going to happen must be in the hand 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.669
 hits a contract sign he's got in 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.530
 the contract states that if he is the 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.510
 tells the truth about black bar and suit 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.940
 to insert one of the six werewolf 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.830
 we have enough but five werewolves 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630
 no that's the way it is 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.580
 They have us whole the whole time 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.500
 very manipulated the direction may 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.750
 werewolf vampire's that his mother is 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.390
 again no diapers it is not a lie 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.039
 but it does sometimes i agree with it 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.750
 hear me and i'm not trying to be good 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.400
 but it is clear what helps 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.530
 they have done two they started happily 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.140
 the strategy chosen from okay we are going 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.880
 most don't tell yes and we leave 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.710
 See what we think what's best for 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.910
 come and if it already lets it own 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.250
 photos that grammar 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.900
 that I I I really just too brand 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.580
 to the comments that this is really the 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.020
 game of the year in terms of confusion 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.370
 people are really just totally confused 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.020
 for what it now essentially what the end 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.150
 is just people bought the game 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.740
 every so what the fuck i have i am now 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.750
 playing his people the game 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.130
 thought it was very different and that it was 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.630
 ultimately find home great because 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.580
 something totally different has been that I have 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.020
 with no other I think that's one 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.970
 game is not good or and I worked 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.710
 service does not work or that bad but 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.419
 just that something is totally different than it 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.680
 is a bit like the one she got 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.660
 always tell half a story here 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.930
 and it does it all, so that comes out nicely 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.510
 from 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.310
 but you know like I can with you 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.230
 that I do 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.310
 who can work within a thermite year 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.770
 the lightning can 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.060
 yes quote point where that term i am now 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.830
 Let me tell you these are the only fact 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.810
 favors are almost spelled out 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.670
 no, that is something like archives ninja 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.550
 associate the essential longer it is 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.500
 just don't tell things what 's in it 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.810
 in there you like him with fries and I give 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.490
 me a second and then they take it away again 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.620
 and can get their same lounge too 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.360
 we already have their 38 million 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.890
 This is really a game boy about the by one 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.110
 can write a book about that whole 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.840
 trajectory x as knowing all that 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.880
 meetings in it really must be a whole 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.530
 there is no need to saw good shit 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.180
 game have also determined and the choice is 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.460
 according to made so I think very much 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.230
 He says that those guests are the ones who do him 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.240
 have always made this 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:27.450
 sold 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.100
 no with my point so that you have 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.750
 People who have game maker have the marketing 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.220
 the parkuule who are no longer hunting or hunting 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.990
 each other who has the marketing 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.400
 looked at what the game was and which would 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.890
 I have suits that point we get there 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.330
 out and then yes but still sell yes and 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.680
 when they have nice looks year trailer
