cities or states to view current locate
current<00:01:21.119> conditions<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.110> different

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
current conditions for different

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.760 
current conditions for different
locations<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.080> radar<00:01:25.380> tab

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
locations you can go to this radar tab

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.740 
locations you can go to this radar tab
and<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.280> obviously<00:01:27.150> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> give<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
little radar preview for kind of gives

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
little radar preview for kind of gives
you<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> radar<00:01:36.570> preview<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> entire

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you a radar preview for the entire

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.700 
you a radar preview for the entire
country<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> zoom<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:40.290> your

country and then you can zoom in to your

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
country and then you can zoom in to your
location<00:01:41.009> only<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.939> far<00:01:42.180> though<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.450> doesn't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
location only this far though it doesn't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.319 
location only this far though it doesn't
let<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> zoom<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.170> any<00:01:43.290> further<00:01:44.030> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
let you zoom in any further it's kind of

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.620 
let you zoom in any further it's kind of
bland<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.310> satellite<00:01:47.990> image<00:01:48.990> which<00:01:49.500> is

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
bland you got satellite image which is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.149 
bland you got satellite image which is
again<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.750> can<00:01:51.869> only<00:01:51.990> assume<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
again you can only assume in like that

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.240 
again you can only assume in like that
far<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.240> much<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.750> then<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
far it doesn't do much for you then you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.490 
far it doesn't do much for you then you
can<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:57.060> settings<00:01:58.460> just<00:01:59.460> some<00:01:59.969> random
