00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970
 they say that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.270
 however someone who thinks a lot without saying anything just like writing his 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.260
 own history 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.170
 and that he has decided to delay his destiny has to be the one that life put him 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 since he is a fighter 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.400
 i that story

 enrique speaks through the voice of joseph 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.370
 the eldest of his four brothers 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.860
 he also needs your support to move 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.210
 just paradise 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.189
 willpower is clear that you have leftover

 hong quan strange illness diana cifa litis kept him two months in a coma 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.689
 when I was twenty 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.149
 we will see ourselves at the moment when he remains a 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.329
 mystery 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.959

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.669
 when suddenly 8% enters 

00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:34.579
 efe our customers 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.039
 like any 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.209
 there was a lot of intention 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.280
 who imagines that his project is in a week or two 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.499
 and thus a state of coma should be understood without further ado 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.289
 enrique fought and managed to get out of the coma 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.899
 but he had already suffered a brain damage that mobilized almost his entire body 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.049
 but it's not far behind 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.649
 colotl experts explained 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:02.789
 Kirchner 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.789
 because he thinks he could not write 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.909
 how do you look 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.519
 it's easy maybe days 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.589
 the one that is destroyed 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.589
 as the one who does not take on his 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.619
 3 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.259

 headquarters 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.759
 yesterday old 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.709
 but in the midst of all the muscles of his body that refused to obey and 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.759
 none decided to be their main weapon to try the same rhythm 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.759
 the little finger of his left hand 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.840
 like any 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.370
 person 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.370
 is 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.050
 we go 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.050
 on covers 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.740
 that little finger of the hand that I had never used to write before 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.250
 enrique was right-handed for two years now he has become the feather for 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.120
 write his work there in the distant Spain where he studied economics 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.060
 at some point you get discouraged 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.060
 with the opposite maybe 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.740
 many 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.360
 times 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.159
 He says 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.159
 leave it alone 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.689
 but it 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:58.430
 it was repeated 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.619
 now 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:03.580
 what 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.809
 CD 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:07.809
 no more 

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:12.599
 The key 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.010
 Enrique did not rest and robberies were not allowed 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.010
 because the delete key is very far from your left hand 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.179
 Nights and dawns passed until finally the 103 pages of voice 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:25.990
 they were ready 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.909
 and it was him 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.289
 for us it is not a month in the dissimulation 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:32.289
 I'm satisfied one afternoon when ni jon 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:35.819
 I have finished writing 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.979
 we made a weight that we started an impressive without 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.559
 like crazy 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.559
 the young woman was therefore khumalo hindered the one who was 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.819
 the experience in something 

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:52.159
 very pretty 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.819
 why 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.819
 no building of the new park 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:06:59.939
