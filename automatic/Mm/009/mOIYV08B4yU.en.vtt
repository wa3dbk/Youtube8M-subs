the<00:02:00.570> garage<00:02:00.750> door<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> when<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.560> gets<00:02:01.890> close

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
the garage door and when it gets close

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.800 
the garage door and when it gets close
to<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> reed<00:02:02.490> switch<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.119> closes<00:02:03.689> the
