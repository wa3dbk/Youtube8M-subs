00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
had trouble with this easiest way is to

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.479 
had trouble with this easiest way is to
find<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.390> tape<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.710> it's<00:00:31.009> pointing<00:00:31.369> a

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
find the tape and it's pointing a

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.130 
find the tape and it's pointing a
certain<00:00:31.820> direction<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.390> you<00:00:32.540> literally<00:00:32.960> just

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
certain direction and you literally just

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.580 
certain direction and you literally just
unclip<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.870> all<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.290> way<00:00:36.380> around<00:00:38.170> okay

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
unclip it all the way around okay

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.270 
unclip it all the way around okay
I've<00:00:40.550> again<00:00:41.480> I've<00:00:41.930> just<00:00:42.199> messed<00:00:42.620> up<00:00:42.890> with<00:00:43.039> this

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
I've again I've just messed up with this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.380 
I've again I've just messed up with this
and<00:00:44.710> torn<00:00:45.710> up<00:00:45.890> thus<00:00:46.039> I<00:00:46.219> try<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.760> scrape<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.239> out

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
and torn up thus I try to scrape it out

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.459 
and torn up thus I try to scrape it out
not<00:00:47.750> that<00:00:47.780> difficult

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
not that difficult

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.729 
not that difficult
oh<00:00:49.960> there<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.109> go<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:53.870> just<00:00:54.019> lifts<00:00:54.500> right

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
oh there we go and it just lifts right

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.329 
oh there we go and it just lifts right
out<00:00:54.800> just<00:00:55.250> like<00:00:55.670> that<00:00:57.370> you<00:00:58.370> know<00:00:58.539> how<00:00:59.539> are<00:00:59.809> you

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
out just like that you know how are you

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:07.270 
out just like that you know how are you
so<00:01:01.339> there<00:01:01.579> it<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.989> and<00:01:05.170> at<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.440> point<00:01:06.800> there

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
so there it is and at this point there

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.020 
so there it is and at this point there
is<00:01:07.460> another<00:01:07.790> film<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.630> plastic<00:01:09.730> so<00:01:10.730> we'll<00:01:10.910> just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
is another film of plastic so we'll just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.820 
is another film of plastic so we'll just
grab<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:13.330> yeah<00:01:14.330> there<00:01:15.260> it<00:01:15.440> is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.850 

it's<00:01:18.830> clipped<00:01:19.250> in<00:01:19.430> here<00:01:20.440> so<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.500> actually

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
it's clipped in here so you actually

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.860 
it's clipped in here so you actually
have<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.190> pull<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.820> layer<00:01:23.060> off<00:01:23.360> first

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
have to pull this layer off first

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.530 
have to pull this layer off first
because<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:24.350> actually<00:01:24.500> tapes<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
because it actually tapes it to the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.910 
because it actually tapes it to the
plastic<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:27.230> now<00:01:27.380> that<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.650> off<00:01:28.330> we<00:01:29.330> can

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
plastic so now that that's off we can

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440 
plastic so now that that's off we can
get<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.130> iPhone<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:31.850> still<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.120> little
