after<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.450> first<00:01:52.720> November<00:01:53.140> it's<00:01:53.710> always

after the first November it's always

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.600 
after the first November it's always
sensible

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.400

since out on the road the cold weather

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.050 
since out on the road the cold weather
tires<00:02:00.680> make<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.010> greatest<00:02:01.190> sense<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.640> all<00:02:01.820> as

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
tires make the greatest sense of all as

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.700 
tires make the greatest sense of all as
soon<00:02:02.210> as<00:02:02.300> you<00:02:02.390> hit<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.810> magic<00:02:03.170> seven<00:02:03.440> degrees

everything<00:02:04.580> about<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> car<00:02:05.240> works<00:02:05.750> more

everything about the car works more

reduced the steering becomes more

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
precise and most importantly of all

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.820

chances<00:02:11.900> are<00:02:12.020> wheel<00:02:12.170> spin<00:02:12.440> or<00:02:12.560> lot<00:02:12.680> of

chances are wheel spin or lot of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.370 
chances are wheel spin or lot of
traction<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.310> greatly<00:02:13.580> reduced<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.320> a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
traction are greatly reduced so just a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
traction are greatly reduced so just a
case<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.560> when<00:02:15.770> they're<00:02:15.860> gonna<00:02:15.950> get<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.160> work

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
case of when they're gonna get to work

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.130

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
or not with cold weather tires it could

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
or not with cold weather tires it could
be<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.290> difference<00:02:18.530> between<00:02:18.590> having<00:02:18.830> an

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
accident or not and when you put it like

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.350 
accident or not and when you put it like
that<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.310> no-brainer

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.520

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
appropriately for bad weather she was

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.559 
appropriately for bad weather she was
right<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:34.980> course<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.480> the
