00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.110
 we will not wait five days because u 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.760
 we have already finished sourdough we take 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:24.070
 her out of the fridge and doing with her 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.070
 in 5 days you will do the same with 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:34.579
 leaven new of why we are just and and 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:37.340
 pouring a cup of it is not 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.370
 surely the same can be a cup 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.420
 bigger and smaller 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:49.000
 the most important thing is the volume of how much u 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.000
 you ferment but it does not depend much 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.900
 because sourdough bites her 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.150
 any volume in about the same time 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.480
 sculpture 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.480
 distributed in any quantity 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.439
 the unit dough drive your ego can be 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.280
 a little more a little less time it 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.530
 It will take but the volume is not particularly important 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.990
 it could be a cup more two more 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.860
 three times we have now 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 the amount of leaven and we will increase it 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.570
 now using water 2 times and add 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.190
 flour sifted flour 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.190
 so much will we have 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.840
 and couples 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:55.170
 and always in Russia asked 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:59.030
 you to feed 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.030
 her air 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:08.070
 all that we get is not solid 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.070
 passing through the sieve we add here 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.060
 Here and bring our couple to 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:24.040
 the consistency of thick cream 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.720
 just like we did it during 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.720
 cooking our leaven 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:49.140
 Now we've got a pair of consistency 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.800
 thick cream and here 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.360
 this couple we should stand around 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.020
 12 hours 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:03.540
 roughly speaking you put a sponge in the evening 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:07.230
 and in the morning you can already make bread and a couple 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.880
 us for the night will rise increase in 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.530
 volume but in this case we have it 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.430
 will take 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.430
 probably the whole cup and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.160
 in 12 hours it will fall before 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.820
 volume this is the process which 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.269
 must come from the test there is a process 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.750
 which is akin to the fermentation of bacteria they 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:42.150
 recycle 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:43.810
 flour and flour in the case becomes more 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.940
 let's say u with you 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.480
 digestible by our mage on your your 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:54.150
 the body and this yeast they become 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:59.420
 stronger and able to lift 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.420
 our dough our dough will 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.710
 more able to increase in volume
