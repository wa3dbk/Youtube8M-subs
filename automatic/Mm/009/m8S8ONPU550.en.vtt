00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.430 
also arm a way to level up really really
fast<00:02:24.920> look<00:02:25.190> at<00:02:25.340> each<00:02:25.820> revive<00:02:26.270> is<00:02:26.570> basically<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
fast look at each revive is basically a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.370 
fast look at each revive is basically a
kill<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:29.240> more<00:02:29.480> dinner<00:02:29.720> kill<00:02:29.960> actually<00:02:30.290> how

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
kill or more dinner kill actually how

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.610 
kill or more dinner kill actually how
much<00:02:30.530> kills<00:02:30.860> ah<00:02:31.070> alright<00:02:32.060> forget<00:02:32.450> but<00:02:32.930> right

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
much kills ah alright forget but right

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.950 
much kills ah alright forget but right
so<00:02:34.250> basically<00:02:34.580> each<00:02:35.150> revive<00:02:35.510> you're<00:02:35.750> getting

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
so basically each revive you're getting

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.140 
so basically each revive you're getting
a<00:02:36.020> hundred<00:02:36.260> points<00:02:36.380> 110<00:02:37.010> points<00:02:37.190> depending<00:02:38.000> on

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
a hundred points 110 points depending on
