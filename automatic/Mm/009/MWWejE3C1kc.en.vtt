00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.629
 hello to all the guys but who are there 205 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.139
 that speaks to you I'm doing a video on 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 fishing like me do not guess the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.490
 fishing line in a reel but how to do the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:20.430
 node of the terminal as you see here as 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.119
 the races or the spoon some or 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.840
 some artificial bait to the line 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.840
 then they position the camera here 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.560
 ok 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.260
 I already have the biological illuminator 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:46.180
 recently completed and I only miss the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.830
 how to put a teaspoon bait 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.610
 then to the float all that 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.030
 want 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.540
 I put a teaspoon of 0 3 ie not 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.590
 03 and I'm going to do this 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 procedure here now performs it with 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.960
 a line but then if not given that not 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 I think you see well I'll do it with gods 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.990
 earphones that are thicker so yes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.649
 sees the process better 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.100
 then 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.630
 meanwhile we make a kind of knot like this 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 put the left thumb of an ice si 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.030
 show that it touches they block the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.580
 line with the line with the line that 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.340
 succeeds for the takes I turn 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.600
 He did turn around to the node for 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.990
 three four times 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.990
 after which you wait for peace to turn 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:47.680
 then a long 3 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.680
 4 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.860
 ok perfect after that after removing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 after making the third fourth node 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.659
 we remove the thumb and forefinger from 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:08.429
 from the alliance and you see a little one 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.130
 circle that came to us form 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.450
 we put value at the terminal of 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.260
 renzo in it is like you see it was made 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.860
 the noose as a garment is not a noose 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.799
 but the knot has been formed as you can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.600
 seeing is a is a node that can be 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:35.000
 enlarge to force as you want e 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:41.850
 serves is very useful for stretching or al 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.640
 tighten the line ok now since 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.069
 I don't think the passage is right 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.080
 I'll show you how the earphones 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:57.239
 wait a moment longer cutting valence 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:57.810
 that advances ok then I use these 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.760
 earphones 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:06.269
 how can you see these earphones 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 normal blacks to show you how I got 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:15.440
 done 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:18.209
 then this we don't use as like 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.019
 as a teaspoon as a cousin's dress 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.890
 we slip the dense one in here 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.890
 after which those who leave this species of 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.590
 knot here as I showed you before 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.260
 Now we take the line a bit the 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.150
 thread because since it is thicker 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.370
 will serve much longer more vivid 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.599
 then now since we did the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.060
 thread we made the knot we carry the 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.870
 terminal of the line of sisters from 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.910
 vehicular you see the inches 15 inches 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:02.459
 perfect let's pass this way 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:05.099
 behind under back on the back fruit 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.769
 back under 3 4 times 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.780
 I did 4 now we remove the 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.730
 thumb forefinger and venice that one has been 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.220
 formed this one here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:21.049
 ok now the terminal we put here 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:24.090
 inside and pull you can see that 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:29.880
 now I help this cure so you can 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:32.880
 to see better after removing that 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:39.630
 it succeeds perfectly to close or 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.180
 reopen the expected node ok 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.479
 this is a very simple step from 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:50.100
 do and do not do it in 20 seconds if you are 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:52.680
 already good at it if not the 30 35 for whom 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.860
 maybe it's the first time we do it 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.260
 managed to do it this way 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.470
 squeezes expands that you don't want e 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.710
 I just hope this video is there 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.160
 liked it if you used it to do the 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.880
 node to your line and to the next one 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.880
 Hi everyone
