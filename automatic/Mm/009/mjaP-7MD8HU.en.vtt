00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
of harsh on the midsoles so I'm sticking

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.630 
of harsh on the midsoles so I'm sticking

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
works just just as well so let's get

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.420 
works just just as well so let's get
into<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.790> tutorial<00:01:24.360> real<00:01:24.540> fast<00:01:25.250> pretty<00:01:26.250> much

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
into the tutorial real fast pretty much

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
into the tutorial real fast pretty much
the<00:01:26.580> idea<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> we're<00:01:27.720> going<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
the idea for this is that we're going to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.679 
the idea for this is that we're going to
file<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.950> black<00:01:29.220> part<00:01:29.549> down<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> metal

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
file the black part down with the metal

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.380 
file the black part down with the metal
file<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.380> from<00:01:31.650> home<00:01:31.890> depot<00:01:32.390> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
file that you got from home depot and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.999 
file that you got from home depot and
when<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> ensure

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
when you do this it's going to ensure

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
when you do this it's going to ensure
that<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.490> smear<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> black<00:01:36.210> parts

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
that you don't smear the black parts

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
that you don't smear the black parts
over<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> white<00:01:37.290> parts<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> shoe<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.310> will

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
over the white parts of the shoe it will

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.149 
over the white parts of the shoe it will
give<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> clean<00:01:39.180> look<00:01:39.509> when<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.049> strip<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
give it a clean look when you strip the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.520 
give it a clean look when you strip the
paint<00:01:41.369> off<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.850> white<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.840> we're<00:01:42.990> filing<00:01:43.259> the

Megatron

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.580 

I'm<00:02:21.150> using<00:02:21.330> my<00:02:21.450> other<00:02:21.630> camera<00:02:21.930> now<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.410> if<00:02:22.500> I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
I'm using my other camera now so if I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.200 
I'm using my other camera now so if I
sound<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.190> bit<00:02:23.460> different<00:02:23.850> that's<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
sound a little bit different that's the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.570 
sound a little bit different that's the
reason<00:02:24.510> why<00:02:24.540> but<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.410> idea<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.460> I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
reason why but the idea of this like I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.340 
reason why but the idea of this like I
said<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.090> remove<00:02:27.330> all<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> black<00:02:27.960> parts

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
said is to remove all the black parts

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.660 
said is to remove all the black parts
right<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.560> so<00:02:28.950> I'm<00:02:29.040> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> keep<00:02:29.340> doing

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
right here so I'm going to keep doing

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.450 
right here so I'm going to keep doing
that<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.060> don't<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.780> guys<00:02:31.190> really<00:02:32.190> need

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
that I don't think you guys really need

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.460 
that I don't think you guys really need
to<00:02:32.610> see<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> because<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:33.810> pretty<00:02:34.260> much<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
to see it because it's pretty much the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.560 
to see it because it's pretty much the
same<00:02:34.800> old<00:02:35.070> stuff<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.370> start<00:02:35.940> scraping<00:02:36.240> it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
same old stuff just start scraping it

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.230 
same old stuff just start scraping it
and<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.170> would<00:02:37.320> also<00:02:37.440> start<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.760> edges<00:02:39.120> up

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and I would also start on the edges up

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.990 
and I would also start on the edges up
here<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:39.600> well<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:40.400> sometimes<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.760> you're

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
here as well because sometimes if you're

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600 
here as well because sometimes if you're
trying<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.450> get<00:02:42.710> get<00:02:43.710> up<00:02:43.830> here<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.280> might<00:02:44.460> get

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
trying to get get up here you might get

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.320 
trying to get get up here you might get
it<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.940> upper<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.510> scrape<00:02:46.020> like<00:02:46.850> half<00:02:47.850> half

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
it on the upper so scrape like half half

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.500 
it on the upper so scrape like half half
way<00:02:48.510> probably<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:49.260> little<00:02:49.800> bit<00:02:50.010> off

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
way probably a little bit off

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.820 
way probably a little bit off
twenty-five<00:02:51.510> percent<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.110> scrape<00:02:52.620> all

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
twenty-five percent of it scrape all

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.130 
twenty-five percent of it scrape all
this<00:02:53.280> off<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.360> pretty<00:02:54.540> much<00:02:54.630> scrape<00:02:54.990> the

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
this off so pretty much scrape the

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
this off so pretty much scrape the
borders<00:02:55.590> that's<00:02:56.490> how<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> make<00:02:56.880> sure<00:02:57.060> you
