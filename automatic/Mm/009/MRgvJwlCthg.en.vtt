00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
tight for largest in its class we like

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.400 
tight for largest in its class we like
to<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.029> power<00:00:21.300> tongue<00:00:21.600> jack<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:22.050> these<00:00:22.230> so

to put the power tongue jack on these so

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.450 
to put the power tongue jack on these so
that<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.680> easy<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.010> hook<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> unhook

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
that it's easy to hook and unhook

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.830 
that it's easy to hook and unhook
especially<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.449> have<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> weight

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
especially if you have a weight

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.920 
especially if you have a weight
distribution<00:00:25.019> system<00:00:26.599> they<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
distribution system they have the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.089

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
largest front storage in class I think

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.280 
largest front storage in class I think
this<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.420> equivalent<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this is basically the equivalent of a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.680 
this is basically the equivalent of a
3/4<00:00:34.890> ton<00:00:34.920> trucks<00:00:35.460> bed<00:00:35.730> now

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
3/4 ton trucks bed now

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.470 
3/4 ton trucks bed now
you<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.530> those<00:00:37.649> aluminum<00:00:38.010> studs<00:00:38.550> they

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you see all those aluminum studs they

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
you see all those aluminum studs they
have<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> lot<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> structure<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:40.770> but

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
have a lot of structure in these but

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.170 
have a lot of structure in these but
they<00:00:41.100> keep<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> weight<00:00:41.520> down<00:00:41.579> by<00:00:41.969> using

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
they keep the weight down by using

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.810 
they keep the weight down by using
aluminum<00:00:43.110> anywhere<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:43.770> can<00:00:44.040> now

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
aluminum anywhere that they can now

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.250 
aluminum anywhere that they can now
another<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:45.809> keep<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> weight

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
another way that they keep the weight

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
another way that they keep the weight
down<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:48.210> by<00:00:48.480> using<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:49.410> tell<00:00:49.890> as<00:00:50.129> bail<00:00:50.640> pardon

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
down is by using as tell as bail pardon

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.510 
down is by using as tell as bail pardon
