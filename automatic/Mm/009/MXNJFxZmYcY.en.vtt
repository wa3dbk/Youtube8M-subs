yeast<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.469> gonna<00:00:34.559> let<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.739> sit<00:00:34.890> there

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
yeast so we're gonna let that sit there

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
yeast so we're gonna let that sit there
for<00:00:35.250> about<00:00:35.430> 15<00:00:35.700> minutes<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.690> that'll

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
just give a chance for the yeast to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
just give a chance for the yeast to
activate<00:00:38.640> okay<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:39.960> our<00:00:40.200> yeast

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
activate okay as you can see our yeast

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.619 
activate okay as you can see our yeast

minutes ok now that we finished kneading

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.920 
minutes ok now that we finished kneading
out<00:01:31.200> dough<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> floured<00:01:32.280> surface<00:01:32.930> we're

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
out dough on a floured surface we're

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170 
out dough on a floured surface we're
just<00:01:34.110> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.409> stretch<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.310> our<00:01:35.610> dough<00:01:35.939> just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
just going to stretch out our dough just

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
just going to stretch out our dough just
like<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.439> we're<00:01:37.619> going<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> cut<00:01:38.159> it

like so and then we're going to cut it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.389 
like so and then we're going to cut it
into<00:01:38.549> 12<00:01:38.939> equal<00:01:39.299> pieces<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:43.040> once<00:01:44.040> done<00:01:44.250> we're

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
into 12 equal pieces and once done we're

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.620 
into 12 equal pieces and once done we're
just<00:01:44.549> kind<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.700> let<00:01:44.850> them<00:01:45.000> sit<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.450> this

ok<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.140> been<00:01:49.170> 10<00:01:49.470> minutes<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
ok so it's been 10 minutes and I have a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.700 
ok so it's been 10 minutes and I have a
greased<00:01:50.610> baking<00:01:51.030> tray<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
greased baking tray so just going to

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.069 
greased baking tray so just going to
place<00:01:52.890> our<00:01:53.040> rolls<00:01:53.310> onto<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.210> tray<00:01:54.479> now<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
place our rolls onto the tray now the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.749 
place our rolls onto the tray now the
reason<00:01:55.409> why<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> didn't<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.920> earlier<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
reason why I didn't do it earlier is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
reason why I didn't do it earlier is
because<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.360> they're<00:01:57.570> rising<00:01:57.780> they're<00:01:58.229> just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
because as they're rising they're just

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
because as they're rising they're just
going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.619> form<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.219> together<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.850> sort<00:02:00.030> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
going to form up together and sort of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.819 
going to form up together and sort of
stick<00:02:00.360> together<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.259> best<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> let<00:02:01.680> them

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
stick together so it's best to let them

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
stick together so it's best to let them
rise<00:02:02.009> first<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:03.060> place<00:02:03.360> them<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
rise first and then place them on the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.870 
rise first and then place them on the
tray<00:02:03.979> ok<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.040> now<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> place

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
tray ok so now we're going to place

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.419 
tray ok so now we're going to place
these<00:02:06.060> into<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.360> pre<00:02:06.659> heated<00:02:06.689> oven<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.429> 210

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
