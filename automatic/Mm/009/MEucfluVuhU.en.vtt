00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:18.310 

okay<00:00:12.050> here<00:00:12.380> it<00:00:12.530> is<00:00:13.030> with<00:00:14.030> poison<00:00:14.660> ivy<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:17.320> it

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
okay here it is with poison ivy and it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.109 
okay here it is with poison ivy and it
is<00:00:18.590> big<00:00:19.900> it<00:00:20.900> goes<00:00:21.140> on<00:00:21.500> with<00:00:21.890> just<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.250> little<00:00:22.610> bit

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
is big it goes on with just a little bit

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.529 
is big it goes on with just a little bit
of<00:00:23.410> snugness<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.400> that's<00:00:25.670> pretty<00:00:25.910> close<00:00:26.300> I

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
of snugness but that's pretty close I

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.300 
of snugness but that's pretty close I
don't<00:00:26.570> know<00:00:26.750> if<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:26.930> can<00:00:27.080> see<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.590> but<00:00:27.800> that

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
don't know if you can see that but that

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.310 
don't know if you can see that but that
ropes<00:00:29.119> right<00:00:29.420> there<00:00:29.690> it<00:00:29.840> won't<00:00:30.050> hit<00:00:30.199> the

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
ropes right there it won't hit the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:43.570 
ropes right there it won't hit the
carabiner<00:00:30.859> but<00:00:31.130> it's<00:00:31.279> close<00:00:31.609> I<00:00:42.220> think<00:00:43.220> this<00:00:43.370> is

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
carabiner but it's close I think this is

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.310 
carabiner but it's close I think this is
really<00:00:43.850> over<00:00:44.239> its<00:00:45.100> intended<00:00:46.100> limit<00:00:48.519> but<00:00:49.519> I

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
really over its intended limit but I

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.920 
really over its intended limit but I
think<00:00:51.320> we've<00:00:51.710> all<00:00:51.920> used<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.930> original

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
think we've all used the original

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:14.279 
think we've all used the original
Gregory's<00:00:58.210> out<00:00:59.210> of<00:00:59.449> spec<00:00:59.750> too<00:01:00.019> so<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:13.180> think

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
Gregory's out of spec too so I think

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.429 
Gregory's out of spec too so I think
there's<00:01:15.289> a<00:01:15.380> little<00:01:15.530> more<00:01:15.619> drag<00:01:16.719> but<00:01:17.719> it's<00:01:18.140> not

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
there's a little more drag but it's not

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.219 
there's a little more drag but it's not
significant<00:01:20.680> enough<00:01:21.680> -<00:01:22.240> yeah<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.450> can<00:01:23.780> get

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
significant enough - yeah I can get

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.669 
significant enough - yeah I can get
until<00:01:24.500> there's<00:01:24.799> more<00:01:24.859> drag<00:01:27.880> what<00:01:29.530> came<00:01:30.530> from

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
until there's more drag what came from

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.749 
until there's more drag what came from
the<00:01:30.770> life<00:01:31.009> of<00:01:31.189> me<00:01:31.600> figure<00:01:32.600> out<00:01:32.810> why<00:01:32.929> anybody

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the life of me figure out why anybody

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.289 
the life of me figure out why anybody
would<00:01:34.759> want<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.060> use<00:01:35.179> that<00:01:35.210> bigger<00:01:35.600> rope<00:01:37.299> of

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
would want to use that bigger rope of

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.390 
would want to use that bigger rope of
course<00:01:38.539> that's<00:01:38.780> just<00:01:39.020> me

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.980 

it's<00:01:42.400> not<00:01:42.640> as<00:01:42.880> efficient<00:01:43.420> I<00:01:43.570> can<00:01:43.720> tell<00:01:43.900> you

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
it's not as efficient I can tell you

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:56.120 
it's not as efficient I can tell you
that<00:01:44.550> I'm<00:01:46.260> sensing<00:01:47.260> extra<00:01:47.830> drag<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.960> rope

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.380 

of<00:01:57.130> course<00:01:57.340> it<00:01:57.490> get<00:01:57.670> me<00:01:57.820> I'm<00:01:58.000> getting<00:01:58.180> tired

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390

there you go
heavy<00:02:05.200> rope<00:02:06.090> hard<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.390> water<00:02:07.690> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
