that now one thing that I will address
while<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.320> doing<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.340> importance

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
while we're doing this is the importance

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.580 
while we're doing this is the importance
of<00:01:53.909> making<00:01:54.060> sure<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.780> properly<00:01:54.990> take

times guys people will go and try and

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
times guys people will go and try and
just<00:02:01.140> pop<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> there's<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.969> solder

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
just pop this off and there's for solder

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.230 
just pop this off and there's for solder
joints<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> hold<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.770> battery<00:02:05.579> terminal<00:02:05.969> to

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
if you break those solder joints it is

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.750 
if you break those solder joints it is
extremely<00:02:10.679> expensive<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.250> fix<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.700> know

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
extremely expensive to fix I know

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
on it which will release it now what

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.780 
on it which will release it now what
that<00:02:49.500> did<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.159> even<00:02:50.549> pressure

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
that did is it put even pressure

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.970 
that did is it put even pressure
downwards<00:02:51.449> on<00:02:51.719> the<00:02:51.989> connector<00:02:52.439> and<00:02:52.590> then

upwards to remove that connection now by

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.280 
upwards to remove that connection now by
doing<00:02:56.699> that<00:02:57.120> you're<00:02:57.269> not<00:02:57.299> putting<00:02:57.599> any<00:02:57.810> type

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
doing that you're not putting any type

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.780 
doing that you're not putting any type
of<00:02:59.299> pressure<00:03:00.299> on<00:03:00.659> the<00:03:01.379> solder<00:03:01.590> joints<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.549> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
of pressure on the solder joints this is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.459 
of pressure on the solder joints this is
these<00:03:03.180> four<00:03:03.449> solder<00:03:03.689> joints<00:03:04.019> right<00:03:04.169> here<00:03:04.379> are

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
these four solder joints right here are

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.080 
these four solder joints right here are
the<00:03:04.560> only<00:03:04.590> things<00:03:05.099> holding<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.699> to<00:03:05.969> the

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the only things holding that to the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970 
the only things holding that to the
motherboard<00:03:06.329> so<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.409> break<00:03:07.650> very<00:03:07.680> easily

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
motherboard so they break very easily

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.640 
motherboard so they break very easily
and<00:03:08.579> then<00:03:08.879> your<00:03:09.659> phone's<00:03:09.900> useless<00:03:10.379> or<00:03:10.530> it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
and then your phone's useless or it's

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.800 
and then your phone's useless or it's
very<00:03:10.680> expensive<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.370> fix<00:03:11.639> so<00:03:11.849> again<00:03:12.329> guys<00:03:12.510> be

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
very expensive to fix so again guys be

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.699 
very expensive to fix so again guys be
very<00:03:13.379> very<00:03:13.590> careful<00:03:14.299> right<00:03:15.299> here<00:03:15.500> we<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.680> a

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
very very careful right here we have a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.379 
very very careful right here we have a
little<00:03:16.919> antenna<00:03:17.250> connector<00:03:17.759> this<00:03:17.970> goes<00:03:18.180> to

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
little antenna connector this goes to

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.379 
little antenna connector this goes to
the<00:03:18.509> back<00:03:18.659> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.900> phone<00:03:19.049> if<00:03:19.169> you<00:03:19.259> take<00:03:19.919> a<00:03:19.949> look

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
the back of the phone if you take a look

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.330 
the back of the phone if you take a look
the<00:03:21.389> back<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.989> phone<00:03:22.169> has<00:03:22.199> metal<00:03:22.949> where<00:03:23.220> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the back of the phone has metal where it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
the back of the phone has metal where it
connects<00:03:23.669> right<00:03:23.909> there<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.720> lot<00:03:25.229> of<00:03:25.349> people

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
connects right there a lot of people

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.890 
connects right there a lot of people
think<00:03:25.859> that<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.099> might<00:03:26.729> be<00:03:26.790> where<00:03:27.180> Apple

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
think that that might be where Apple

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.929 
think that that might be where Apple
tells<00:03:28.409> if<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.889> backs<00:03:29.069> ever<00:03:29.280> been<00:03:29.549> removed

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
tells if you the backs ever been removed

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:32.749 
tells if you the backs ever been removed
it's<00:03:30.569> not<00:03:31.169> true<00:03:31.470> they<00:03:31.799> don't<00:03:32.189> use<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.430> for<00:03:32.549> that

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:32.759 
it's not true they don't use it for that

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:36.289 
it's not true they don't use it for that
it's<00:03:33.090> actually<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.019> connects<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.299> antenna

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
it's actually just connects the antenna

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.420 
it's actually just connects the antenna
to<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.959> back<00:03:37.229> here<00:03:37.530> which<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.919> all<00:03:38.099> metal

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
to the back here which is all metal

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.979 
to the back here which is all metal
plated<00:03:38.759> underneath<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.269> then<00:03:39.479> turns<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
plated underneath here then turns the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.949 
plated underneath here then turns the
back<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.489> your<00:03:41.489> plate<00:03:41.970> or<00:03:42.329> your<00:03:42.509> rear<00:03:42.720> plate

back of your plate or your rear plate

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.879 
back of your plate or your rear plate
into<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:44.009> antenna<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:44.579> well<00:03:44.780> anyways<00:03:45.889> moving

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
into the antenna as well anyways moving

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.979 
into the antenna as well anyways moving
right<00:03:47.159> along<00:03:47.310> right<00:03:48.000> here<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.449> can<00:03:48.629> see<00:03:48.810> where

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
right along right here you can see where

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.710 
right along right here you can see where
it<00:03:49.109> connects<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:50.189> motherboard<00:03:50.629> let<00:03:51.629> me

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
it connects to the motherboard let me

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.149 
it connects to the motherboard let me
see<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:51.989> can<00:03:52.109> focus<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.560> just<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.799> little<00:03:52.829> bit

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
see if I can focus in just a little bit

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.379 
see if I can focus in just a little bit
