Hey guys,

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.520
Today, I'll be showing you how to make these
super easy mushroom lentil burgers.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.210
As always the ingredients are in the description
below, but this recipe is fairly flexible

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.400
so feel free to experiment!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm using portobello as they have a great
juicy bite to them but feel free to use other

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.570
mushrooms if you like.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.270
The first step is to cook down the mushrooms.
I'm just adding them to a hot pan. And then

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.860
marmite. The smarter thing would have been
to dissolve the marmite in water before adding

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.250
it so maybe do that instead of messing around like
I did here. Use about a quarter cup of water

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.230
or broth if you like

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.610
The marmite gives the mushroom a rich flavour.
If you don't have it, you can use vegemite

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.760
or miso paste instead.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.370
Now we add more flavour in the form of paprika,
onion and garlic powder, and black pepper.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.390
Feel free to use any kind of burger spice
blend that you like.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.940
In only a few minutes, the mushrooms have
gotten very soft and most of the water has

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.820
evaporated.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759
Into the mixing bowl they go.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:11.340
Add a cup of cooked lentils and brown sugar.
I got these out of a can but feel free to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.860
use any kind of lentils you like. Beans can
also work but I like using these little lentils

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.060
because they seem to form burgers more easily.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.820
Separately, combine a quarter cup of water
or broth with a tablespoon of ground flax

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.150
seed and another quarter cup of lentils. Blend
that until smooth and now we this super delicious

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.280
looking goop. OK, it looks gross but trust,
guys. It will all work out.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.220
Stir that in and now everything is sticking
together but it's too wet to form into patties.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.710
I'm adding a quarter cup of breadcrumbs. This
will act as the binder. You can test it now

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.210
to see if it holds together well. Add a bit
more if you need to but try not to add too

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.530
much.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.820
Make sure to taste it and add any seasonings
you like. That's one of the nice things about

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.930
making vegan burgers; you can taste as you
go without worrying too much about ecoli or

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.799
salmonella.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.679
I'm adding two tablespoons of nooch. Which,
by the way, is a very veganish way of saying

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.200
nutritional yeast. It's a form of inactive
yeast that has a umami flavour. Sounds weird

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.639
but used right it tastes great.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:27.980
When making the patties, just scoop up a bunch
and pat it into shape with your clean hands.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.409
When they are all ready, it's time to cook.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:38.059
You'll need a little oil to get a nice browning
on these burgers. Once your pan is hot, place

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:44.329
the patties on and cook for about three minutes.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:52.709
Flip and cook for another three minutes or
until each side is as brown as you'd like.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.659
And that's it.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.419
I'm using these little homemade sweet potato
burger buns that have been toasted in a pan.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.230
A well toasted bun makes all the difference,
in my opinion.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.090
Add whatever toppings you like, and there
you have a super easy to make, vegan mushroom

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.419
lentil burger.

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:13.719
The lentils make this burger super filling
while the mushrooms add a satisfying bite

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.059
and little bursts of juicy deliciousness.
It's a pretty basic recipe so I hope you take

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.930
it and run with it. Let me know how you would
dress up this burger in the comments below.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.400
Thanks so much for watching and Happy Forth
of July Weekend to all of my American friends.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.109
Bye for now!
