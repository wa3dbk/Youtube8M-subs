00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello everyone welcome for a new 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.309
 episode of the monsters garage then 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 today we are at satory fief of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.130
 renault trucks defense and we will 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.619
 take the wheel of a vehicle while 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.119
 is extraordinary the fmi ds then 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.150
 what are we seeing that all of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.150
 after 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.900
 here is the myth this truck raven color 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.670
 was designed for the missions of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.000
 internal security and maintenance of 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.620
 order 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.240
 it is aimed at both ministries 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.770
 only to individuals and yes renault 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.540
 defense trucks is not married to the state 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.800
 and offers its services everywhere in the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.090
 world is in europe 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 Central and Middle East that the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 French manufacturer flies the biggest 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 many of his babies 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 and then we kept an architecture 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 of civilian vehicles finally what 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 allows him to go fast enough on the road 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
 to take the highway naturally 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.190
 it's unlike a vehicle 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.100
 purely military who is it a lot 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.210
 more constrained by because of his 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.210
 mass and its specificities 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.740
 the museum has all the equipment 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.550
 needed to clean up 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.530
 hostile environment 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.060
 starting with its armored body 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.800
 from head to toe she is able to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.440
 withstand very large shots 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.730
 calibres type 7.62 ie 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.590
 bullets the size of a stack of 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.940
 remote control 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.290
 the cockpit thought for more comfort 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 can accommodate 12 men and their 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.130
 protection equipment totally 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.960
 configurable this myth can be thought 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.490
 for the assault or simply arranged 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.500
 in monitoring and 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.820
 command deterrence is assured 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.710
 by a release blade the front one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.940
 muffling siren and loopholes 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.610
 arranged on the sides 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.740
 mobility it is guaranteed by a 6 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.620
 300 horsepower diesel cylinders capable 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.540
 to propel him to over 100 km h 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.040
 chassis 4 4 and a rolling system to 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.330
 dish this myth made in France 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.220
 could maybe one day do the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.210
 happiness of the raid of the gign 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.069
 we can imagine that one day or the other 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.630
 the police or the gendarmerie will be 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.490
 interested in versions of this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.690
 vehicle 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.240
 today she has no vehicle 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.580
 with this level of protection and this 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.580
 level of ergonomics too strong inside
