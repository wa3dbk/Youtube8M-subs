point<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.580> we<00:02:42.820> release<00:02:43.060> one<00:02:43.270> arm<00:02:43.450> now<00:02:43.900> we

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
point is that we release one arm now we

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.660 
point is that we release one arm now we
make<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> twist<00:02:44.560> with<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> second<00:02:45.310> arm<00:02:45.459> and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
make a twist with the second arm and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.190 
make a twist with the second arm and
strike<00:02:46.090> here<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:49.360> see<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.570> first<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
strike here we see the first and the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.420 
strike here we see the first and the
second<00:02:50.530> point<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.950> force<00:02:51.190> application

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
second point of the force application

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.420 
second point of the force application
here<00:02:55.110> we<00:02:56.110> apply<00:02:56.350> our<00:02:56.500> mass<00:02:56.739> and<00:02:57.040> use<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
here we apply our mass and use the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.680 
here we apply our mass and use the
second<00:02:57.760> hand<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.000> help<00:02:58.090> ourselves<00:03:00.690> when

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
second hand to help ourselves when

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.940 
second hand to help ourselves when
you're<00:03:01.810> trying<00:03:01.959> to<00:03:02.050> overbalance<00:03:02.410> him<00:03:02.709> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
you're trying to overbalance him and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.680 
you're trying to overbalance him and
can't<00:03:03.130> estimate<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.610> situation<00:03:04.150> or<00:03:04.390> when

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
can't estimate the situation or when

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.390 
can't estimate the situation or when
it's<00:03:04.810> impossible<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.260> release<00:03:05.560> yourself<00:03:05.920> it's

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
it's impossible to release yourself it's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.710 
it's impossible to release yourself it's
exactly<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.910> element<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.300> helps<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.630> to

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
exactly the element that helps you to

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.539 
exactly the element that helps you to
pass<00:03:07.900> from<00:03:08.140> one<00:03:08.260> body<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.590> another<00:03:11.519> when<00:03:12.519> I

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
pass from one body to another when I

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.000 
pass from one body to another when I
applied<00:03:12.850> force<00:03:13.150> here<00:03:13.420> pressed<00:03:14.200> him<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.680> when

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
applied force here pressed him and when

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.160 
applied force here pressed him and when
I<00:03:15.040> went<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.430> turn<00:03:15.730> him<00:03:15.970> his<00:03:16.360> arm<00:03:16.600> even<00:03:16.840> more<00:03:16.989> I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
I went to turn him his arm even more I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.509 
I went to turn him his arm even more I
can<00:03:17.470> face<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.799> fact<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.040> there's<00:03:18.250> not<00:03:18.340> much

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
can face the fact that there's not much

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.729 
can face the fact that there's not much
space<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.820> act<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:22.260> see<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.440> make<00:03:23.650> an

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
space to act I see that I make an

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.990 
space to act I see that I make an
obstacle<00:03:24.070> for<00:03:24.310> myself<00:03:26.670> when<00:03:27.670> there's<00:03:27.850> some

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
obstacle for myself when there's some

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.030 
obstacle for myself when there's some
combination<00:03:28.540> for<00:03:28.720> example<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.350> pull<00:03:29.830> him<00:03:29.950> aside

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
combination for example I pull him aside

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.130 
combination for example I pull him aside
and<00:03:30.250> turn<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.850> arm<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.630> works<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:34.140> applied

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
and turn the arm then it works I applied

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.229 
and turn the arm then it works I applied
more<00:03:35.350> force<00:03:35.650> there<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.040> use<00:03:36.190> his<00:03:36.370> weight<00:03:36.610> then

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
more force there to use his weight then

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.820 
more force there to use his weight then
I<00:03:37.269> need<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.840> use<00:03:37.989> minor<00:03:38.350> effort<00:03:38.709> and

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
I need just to use minor effort and

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.039 
I need just to use minor effort and
understand<00:03:39.580> where<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.030> apply<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:41.910> in<00:03:43.049> my

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
understand where to apply it in my

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.420 
understand where to apply it in my
opinion<00:03:44.350> it<00:03:44.680> depends<00:03:45.070> on<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> situation

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
opinion it depends on the situation

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.060 
opinion it depends on the situation
itself<00:03:46.030> I<00:03:46.360> saw<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.470> possible<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.890> act

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
itself I saw that it's possible to act

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.460 
itself I saw that it's possible to act
in<00:03:48.160> one<00:03:48.310> way<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:49.030> situation<00:03:49.510> changed<00:03:49.959> now

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
in one way but the situation changed now

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.160 
in one way but the situation changed now
I<00:03:50.500> see<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:51.010> impossible

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.260 

then<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> should<00:03:55.250> act<00:03:55.340> in<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.550> different<00:03:55.849> way<00:03:56.000> I

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
then I should act in a different way I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.270 
then I should act in a different way I
should<00:03:56.900> apply<00:03:57.110> some<00:03:57.319> rules<00:03:57.530> and<00:03:57.770> Lord<00:04:00.280> for

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
should apply some rules and Lord for

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.979 
should apply some rules and Lord for
example<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.030> pull<00:04:02.300> these<00:04:02.390> arm<00:04:02.630> in<00:04:02.870> that

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
example I can pull these arm in that

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.110 
example I can pull these arm in that
direction<00:04:03.319> then<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.160> work<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:07.310> could<00:04:07.880> act<00:04:08.000> this

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
direction then it work I could act this

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.630 
direction then it work I could act this
way<00:04:08.180> from<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.630> very<00:04:08.810> beginning<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.830> see<00:04:10.069> but

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
way from the very beginning you see but

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.340 
way from the very beginning you see but
I<00:04:10.670> passed<00:04:10.970> there<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:11.690> seems<00:04:11.900> to<00:04:11.959> be<00:04:12.110> at<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
I passed there and it seems to be at the

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.900 
I passed there and it seems to be at the
end<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:12.890> thought<00:04:13.100> everything<00:04:13.400> over<00:04:13.760> and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
end but I thought everything over and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.210 
end but I thought everything over and
pulled<00:04:14.150> one<00:04:14.300> on<00:04:14.330> there<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.170> second<00:04:15.500> here

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.800 

now<00:04:19.220> I<00:04:19.250> catch<00:04:19.549> his<00:04:19.730> arm<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.480> there<00:04:20.690> is

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
now I catch his arm so that there is

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.070 
now I catch his arm so that there is
some<00:04:20.989> contact<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.769> turn<00:04:22.250> his<00:04:22.400> body<00:04:26.080> that

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
some contact and turn his body that

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.240 
some contact and turn his body that
means<00:04:27.290> that<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.500> acted<00:04:27.889> in<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.070> direction

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
means that I acted in the direction

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.740 
means that I acted in the direction
which<00:04:28.520> seems<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.880> be<00:04:28.970> useless<00:04:29.300> at<00:04:29.570> first<00:04:31.690> but<00:04:32.690> I

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
which seems to be useless at first but I

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.060 
which seems to be useless at first but I
used<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.139> because<00:04:33.260> it<00:04:33.530> appeared<00:04:33.830> to<00:04:33.889> be<00:04:33.950> the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
used it because it appeared to be the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:45.060 
used it because it appeared to be the
easiest<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.639> out

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.130 

you
