00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.330
 I would like to talk about manipulators at ipa 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.299
 It is this that I gave it to the theme I think 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.990
 This reaction to make the project sound like this 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.500
 Was the x axis then the green was the y axis then the face was z10 like this 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.929
 To feel 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.949
 The icon given during this time is the icon here 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.859
 The example is in order from the left 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 Opening 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449
 That each one in the wind of scaling 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.579
 Move, rotate, zoom in and out 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.270
 The handle is switched 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.570
 Yes this is the switching between the display and non-display of the reality that was between 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.030
 I will 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.870
 Become familiar with them and use shortcuts 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.020
 Joji Natsuki is not necessary when it comes to 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.110
 One might be smoother at work 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.500
 In the beginning, the response is more responsive to the user 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.780
 It may be easy to understand and displayed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 Move or buy / sell expansion / contraction 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.610
 I think it is better to use 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.610
 It is the scaling of etf ぇ like this 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.830
 z axis scaling 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.920
 Then Iwai heavy direction expansion 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.490
 Or separated in 19 days of each zax axial direction Koizumi school 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.920
 Because it can be scaled 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.900
 You said that you want to make that plate 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.590
 If you have a cosmos one by one and lift and go to a filial son 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 Such an easy way to make things from Erik Thai 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.640
 Can do 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.300
 It is a child of the data rotation. 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.150
 This is a rotation around x10, and then this is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.700
 Meeting that there is z axis 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.830
 It's like this I've been back to life now 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.930
 Control z It is the same as ordinary day operation that is Maitake or 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440
 Use the computer's basic control z to restore 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 It's an operation that you use it below 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.680
 Well the role of being able to enjoy this kind of thing was cut in between 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.070
 When 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.400
 To say 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 Closed school here 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.399
 I talked about the front, but it was a shortcut 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.080
 Well then move is g then there is a turn then it's flat 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.270
 It can be estimated because scaling can be estimated 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.799
 I already have this for my customers 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.479
 I think that it is stable if it is in the form of 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.779
 That's all about the manipulator
