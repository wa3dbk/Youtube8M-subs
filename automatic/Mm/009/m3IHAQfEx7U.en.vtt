around 45 watt mark with Wi-Fi on which

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.040 
around 45 watt mark with Wi-Fi on which
is<00:02:05.800> actually<00:02:05.980> very<00:02:06.130> very<00:02:06.580> good<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.930> if<00:02:07.990> we

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
is actually very very good and if we

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.109 
is actually very very good and if we
look<00:02:08.320> here<00:02:08.590> we've<00:02:08.770> got<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.980> medium<00:02:09.880> screen
