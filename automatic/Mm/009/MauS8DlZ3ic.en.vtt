machine<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.370> designed<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:36.000> impressed<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
machine is designed I was impressed so I

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.910 
machine is designed I was impressed so I
think<00:00:36.809> you'll<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> video<00:00:37.590> even<00:00:37.770> though

explain to me how this works out
we<00:01:06.270> already<00:01:06.390> sort<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.689> went<00:01:06.869> over<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
we already sort of went over how it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.230 
we already sort of went over how it
sharpens<00:01:07.770> but<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> show<00:01:08.700> me<00:01:08.820> sort<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.090> inner

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
sharpens but I show me sort of the inner

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.649 
sharpens but I show me sort of the inner
workings<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.689> machine<00:01:09.960> ok<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:11.010> between

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
workings the machine ok in between

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.880 
workings the machine ok in between
sharpening<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.840> may<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.290> change<00:01:13.530> out

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

the<00:01:14.250> grinding<00:01:14.670> ring<00:01:14.880> yep<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:15.420> grinding<00:01:15.750> ring

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the grinding ring yep this grinding ring

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.830 
the grinding ring yep this grinding ring
for<00:01:16.200> example<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.710> 5/8<00:01:17.189> wheel<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.689> one

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
for example is a 5/8 wheel and the one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
for example is a 5/8 wheel and the one
that's<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> machine<00:01:19.619> right<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> 1/2

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
that's in the machine right now is a 1/2

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's in the machine right now is a 1/2
inch<00:01:20.580> radius<00:01:20.850> yep<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
inch radius yep so this this this

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.920 
inch radius yep so this this this
grinding<00:01:23.820> ring<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.420> be<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.750> bit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
grinding ring it would be a little bit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
grinding ring it would be a little bit
flatter<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.009> glide<00:01:26.369> less

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
flatter and a little more glide less

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.310 
flatter and a little more glide less
bite<00:01:27.210> than<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> ring<00:01:27.810> that's<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.290> now

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
bite than the ring that's in there now

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
bite than the ring that's in there now
if<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> wanted<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> change<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> grinding

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
if you wanted to change out the grinding

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.780 
if you wanted to change out the grinding
ring<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.140> open<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> front<00:01:32.460> door<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
ring you would open this front door on

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.330 
ring you would open this front door on
the<00:01:33.030> machine<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.869> again<00:01:34.530> similar<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
the machine and again similar to the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.460 
the machine and again similar to the
whole<00:01:35.460> printer<00:01:35.850> analogy<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.840> grinding<00:01:37.259> ring

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
whole printer analogy the grinding ring

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.289 
whole printer analogy the grinding ring
moves<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:38.040> into<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.280> position<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
moves over into a position now where you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.179 
moves over into a position now where you
can<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.600> loosen<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.170> nut<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> remove<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

then<00:02:00.899> there's<00:02:01.020> also<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.380> HEPA<00:02:01.649> filter<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
then there's also a HEPA filter in the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.310 
then there's also a HEPA filter in the
back<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.640> unit<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.719> helping<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
back of the unit so in this helping this

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
back of the unit so in this helping this
HEPA<00:02:04.560> filter<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:06.409> all<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.920> skates

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
HEPA filter is what all of the skates

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.130 
HEPA filter is what all of the skates
deal<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.789> being<00:02:08.970> filtered<00:02:09.390> through<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.830> that

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
deal is being filtered through so that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.510 
deal is being filtered through so that
it<00:02:11.350> gets<00:02:11.530> into<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.830> environment<00:02:12.370> where

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
it gets into the environment where

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.680 
it gets into the environment where
you're<00:02:12.640> operating<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.090> skate<00:02:13.300> sharpener<00:02:13.630> so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
you're operating the skate sharpener so

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.660 
you're operating the skate sharpener so
this<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.110> run<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.980> actually<00:02:15.100> have<00:02:15.400> run

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
this can run and we actually have run

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.490 
this can run and we actually have run

with the door open I'm try to start with

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
with the door open I'm try to start with
the<00:03:20.560> door<00:03:20.739> open<00:03:21.040> it'll<00:03:21.400> give<00:03:22.060> you<00:03:22.150> an<00:03:22.239> audible

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the door open it'll give you an audible

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.590 
the door open it'll give you an audible
alert<00:03:22.930> telling<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> doors<00:03:23.739> open<00:03:24.130> yep<00:03:24.600> and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
alert telling you the doors open yep and

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.289 
alert telling you the doors open yep and
then<00:03:26.410> one<00:03:26.530> extra<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.190> there's<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.549> filter

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
then one extra one is there's a filter

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.390 
then one extra one is there's a filter
in<00:03:28.390> the<00:03:28.420> back<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.989> if<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.350> filter<00:03:29.799> is<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.130> or

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
in the back and if the filter is out or

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.610 
in the back and if the filter is out or
not<00:03:30.820> in<00:03:31.030> properly<00:03:31.630> then<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.170> won't<00:03:32.320> start<00:03:32.530> as

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
not in properly then it won't start as

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.080 
not in properly then it won't start as
well<00:03:32.799> because<00:03:33.130> if<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.430> filter<00:03:33.820> isn't<00:03:33.940> in

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
well because if that filter isn't in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.190 
well because if that filter isn't in
there<00:03:34.209> it's<00:03:34.299> going<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.480> blow<00:03:34.630> dust<00:03:34.870> everywhere

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
there it's going to blow dust everywhere

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.009 
there it's going to blow dust everywhere
so<00:03:35.560> you're<00:03:36.430> pretty<00:03:36.850> much<00:03:36.970> foolproof<00:03:37.269> skate

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
so you're pretty much foolproof skate

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.810 
so you're pretty much foolproof skate
sharpening<00:03:38.350> so<00:03:38.680> Russ<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.160> just<00:03:39.310> explaining<00:03:39.670> me

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
sharpening so Russ is just explaining me

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.970 
sharpening so Russ is just explaining me
about<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.180> wheel<00:03:40.690> how<00:03:41.079> it<00:03:41.200> works<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.620> I'm

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
about the wheel how it works is I'm

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.130 
about the wheel how it works is I'm
asking<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.850> about<00:03:43.060> 50<00:03:43.450> skate<00:03:43.660> sharpening

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
asking you about 50 skate sharpening

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.660 
asking you about 50 skate sharpening
with<00:03:44.380> it<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:44.890> how<00:03:45.040> do<00:03:45.100> you<00:03:45.280> know<00:03:45.489> when<00:03:45.640> to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
with it but how do you know when to

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.400 
with it but how do you know when to
replace<00:03:46.030> it<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.930> thought<00:03:47.200> it's<00:03:47.320> pretty

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
replace it so I thought it's pretty

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.850 
replace it so I thought it's pretty
interesting

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
interesting

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.360 
interesting
so<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.760> this<00:03:49.450> wheel<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:50.110> being<00:03:50.470> used<00:03:51.250> to

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
so as this wheel is being used to

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640 
so as this wheel is being used to
sharpen<00:03:51.610> skates<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.390> abrasive<00:03:53.019> coating<00:03:53.470> that

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
sharpen skates the abrasive coating that

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.400 
sharpen skates the abrasive coating that
is<00:03:53.769> on<00:03:53.920> steel<00:03:54.579> we<00:03:55.299> call<00:03:55.420> it<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.540> substrate<00:03:56.170> this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
is on steel we call it a substrate this

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.890 
is on steel we call it a substrate this
ring<00:03:56.799> kind<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.549> see<00:03:57.730> this<00:03:57.880> ring<00:03:58.180> shape<00:03:58.570> here

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
ring kind of see this ring shape here

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.229 
ring kind of see this ring shape here
here<00:03:59.260> there's<00:03:59.769> there's<00:04:00.160> a<00:04:00.250> steel<00:04:00.610> base<00:04:00.910> layer

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
here there's there's a steel base layer

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.420 
here there's there's a steel base layer
and<00:04:01.570> then<00:04:02.170> there's<00:04:02.350> an<00:04:02.470> abrasive<00:04:02.769> coating<00:04:03.340> on

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
and then there's an abrasive coating on

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.740 
and then there's an abrasive coating on
here<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:03.820> abrasive<00:04:04.060> quoting<00:04:04.480> wears

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
here and this abrasive quoting wears

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.259 
here and this abrasive quoting wears
away<00:04:05.049> as<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.680> sharpen<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.130> skates<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.610> as

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
away as you sharpen the skates and as

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.720 
away as you sharpen the skates and as
you<00:04:07.600> sharpen<00:04:08.109> we<00:04:08.709> call<00:04:08.890> this<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.190> light<00:04:09.400> bar

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
you sharpen we call this the light bar

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.050 
you sharpen we call this the light bar
this<00:04:10.329> life<00:04:10.660> bar<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:11.200> counts<00:04:11.709> down<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.400> life

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
this life bar here counts down the life

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.390 
this life bar here counts down the life
of<00:04:13.329> the<00:04:13.570> grinding<00:04:13.900> ring<00:04:14.140> until<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.950> get<00:04:15.280> all

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
of the grinding ring until you get all

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.219 
of the grinding ring until you get all
the<00:04:15.489> way<00:04:15.579> down<00:04:15.760> here<00:04:16.120> which<00:04:16.269> will<00:04:16.419> be<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:17.109> know

the way down here which will be you know

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.500 
the way down here which will be you know
there's<00:04:18.039> there's<00:04:18.370> ten<00:04:18.640> lights<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.390> you'll

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
there's there's ten lights and so you'll

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.240 
there's there's ten lights and so you'll
be<00:04:19.539> in<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.810> ten<00:04:20.019> five<00:04:20.349> to<00:04:20.500> ten<00:04:20.650> percent<00:04:20.799> range

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
be in the ten five to ten percent range

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.390 
be in the ten five to ten percent range
of<00:04:21.519> life<00:04:21.700> of<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.940> wheel<00:04:22.120> this<00:04:22.660> will<00:04:22.840> turn<00:04:23.050> red

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
of life of the wheel this will turn red

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.960 
of life of the wheel this will turn red
learning<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.550> that

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
learning you that

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.120 
learning you that
you<00:04:25.240> need<00:04:25.420> to<00:04:25.540> replace<00:04:25.780> your<00:04:25.900> dining<00:04:26.410> yeah<00:04:26.890> and

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
you need to replace your dining yeah and

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.620 
you need to replace your dining yeah and
you<00:04:27.400> said<00:04:27.550> there's<00:04:27.730> a<00:04:27.790> microchip<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.420> there

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you said there's a microchip in there

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.460 
you said there's a microchip in there
that's<00:04:28.840> how<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:28.990> reads<00:04:29.170> it

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
that's how it reads it

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.260 
that's how it reads it
yeah<00:04:29.620> there's<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.950> chip<00:04:30.250> inside<00:04:30.730> this<00:04:30.970> wheel

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
yeah there's a chip inside this wheel

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.070 
yeah there's a chip inside this wheel
that<00:04:31.990> tells<00:04:32.920> the<00:04:33.520> Machine<00:04:33.970> how<00:04:34.330> much<00:04:34.510> life<00:04:34.840> is

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that tells the Machine how much life is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.900 
that tells the Machine how much life is
left<00:04:35.320> in<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.740> wheel<00:04:35.920> if<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> great<00:04:36.730> thing

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
left in the wheel if the great thing

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.350 
left in the wheel if the great thing
about<00:04:37.000> this<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.450> allows<00:04:37.750> for<00:04:38.500> example<00:04:39.090> one<00:04:40.090> guy

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
about this is allows for example one guy

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.020 
about this is allows for example one guy
on<00:04:40.720> block<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.350> buy<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.560> machine<00:04:41.890> and<00:04:42.430> all<00:04:42.850> the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
on block to buy a machine and all the

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.670 
on block to buy a machine and all the
kids<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.540> block<00:04:43.660> can<00:04:44.140> buy<00:04:44.380> their<00:04:44.650> own

kids on the block can buy their own
grinding<00:04:45.280> rings<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.420> share<00:04:46.900> them<00:04:47.140> onto

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
grinding rings so and share them onto

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.780 
grinding rings so and share them onto
the<00:04:47.470> machine<00:04:47.770> oh<00:04:47.920> I<00:04:47.980> see<00:04:48.310> I<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.640> it's

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
the machine oh I see I so it's

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.940 
the machine oh I see I so it's
interchangeable<00:04:49.050> yeah<00:04:50.050> me<00:04:50.350> entertained<00:04:50.770> it

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
interchangeable yeah me entertained it

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.520 
interchangeable yeah me entertained it
knows<00:04:51.160> which<00:04:51.550> wheel<00:04:52.030> is<00:04:52.240> being<00:04:52.390> used<00:04:52.750> correct

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
knows which wheel is being used correct

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.650 
knows which wheel is being used correct
ah<00:04:53.620> that's<00:04:54.280> that's<00:04:54.850> so<00:04:55.030> everybody<00:04:55.390> can<00:04:55.510> have

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
ah that's that's so everybody can have

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.860 
ah that's that's so everybody can have
their<00:04:55.720> own<00:04:56.020> radius<00:04:56.500> follow<00:04:56.920> right<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:57.870> the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
their own radius follow right and the

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.750 
their own radius follow right and the
length<00:04:59.320> of<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> wheel<00:04:59.920> is<00:05:00.070> being<00:05:00.280> tracked<00:05:00.580> by

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
length of the wheel is being tracked by

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.730 
length of the wheel is being tracked by
the<00:05:00.820> wheel<00:05:01.060> itself<00:05:01.420> holy<00:05:01.810> that's<00:05:02.320> smart

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
the wheel itself holy that's smart

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.950 
the wheel itself holy that's smart
it's<00:05:03.010> finger<00:05:03.760> tight<00:05:03.790> there's<00:05:04.210> no<00:05:04.360> tools<00:05:04.600> we

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
it's finger tight there's no tools we

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.620 
it's finger tight there's no tools we
try<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:05.200> get<00:05:05.350> rid<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.530> any<00:05:05.680> tools<00:05:05.950> yeah<00:05:06.310> um<00:05:07.210> so

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
try to get rid of any tools yeah um so

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.090 
try to get rid of any tools yeah um so
yeah<00:05:07.840> just<00:05:08.080> finger<00:05:08.320> tight<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:08.770> don't<00:05:08.860> want<00:05:09.040> to

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
yeah just finger tight you don't want to

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.470 
yeah just finger tight you don't want to
go<00:05:09.160> too<00:05:09.220> tight<00:05:09.550> yeah<00:05:09.910> just<00:05:10.720> close<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:12.390> she<00:05:13.390> can

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
go too tight yeah just close it she can

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.540 
go too tight yeah just close it she can
kind<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.720> see<00:05:13.990> how<00:05:14.200> hacked<00:05:14.650> up<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.310> oh

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
kind of see how hacked up this is oh

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.170 
kind of see how hacked up this is oh
yeah<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:16.240> it's<00:05:16.480> a<00:05:16.630> bad<00:05:16.810> blade<00:05:17.350> pick<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:18.490> I<00:05:18.760> was

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
yeah it's it's a bad blade pick so I was

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.620 
yeah it's it's a bad blade pick so I was
uh<00:05:20.220> yeah<00:05:21.220> just<00:05:21.490> skating<00:05:22.000> on<00:05:22.090> synthetic<00:05:22.360> ice

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
uh yeah just skating on synthetic ice

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.960 
uh yeah just skating on synthetic ice
for<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:22.900> while<00:05:23.050> which<00:05:23.740> pretty<00:05:24.400> much<00:05:24.460> rounds<00:05:24.730> the

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
for a while which pretty much rounds the

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.909 
for a while which pretty much rounds the
edges<00:05:25.300> that's<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.230> rest<00:05:26.440> gave<00:05:26.650> me<00:05:26.800> the

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
edges that's a rest gave me the

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.550 
edges that's a rest gave me the
intensive<00:05:27.490> 30<00:05:27.820> sec<00:05:28.090> returning<00:05:28.510> session<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.110> was

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
intensive 30 sec returning session I was

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.980 
intensive 30 sec returning session I was
you<00:05:29.710> know<00:05:29.740> I<00:05:30.010> can<00:05:30.190> remember<00:05:30.280> all<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.610> steps

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
you know I can remember all the steps

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.350 
you know I can remember all the steps
step<00:05:31.990> one<00:05:32.200> push<00:05:32.740> down<00:05:32.919> here<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:34.980> let's<00:05:35.980> get<00:05:36.190> it

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
step one push down here and let's get it

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.750 
step one push down here and let's get it
like<00:05:37.360> oh<00:05:37.570> she's<00:05:38.320> in<00:05:38.470> there<00:05:38.590> let's<00:05:38.830> burn<00:05:39.040> that

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
like oh she's in there let's burn that

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.530 
like oh she's in there let's burn that
dude<00:05:39.970> push<00:05:40.390> here<00:05:40.630> I'm<00:05:41.590> skating<00:05:42.330> seems<00:05:43.330> pretty

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
dude push here I'm skating seems pretty

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.659 
dude push here I'm skating seems pretty
good<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.110> step<00:05:44.680> three<00:05:45.010> do<00:05:45.070> you<00:05:45.130> push<00:05:45.430> this

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
good and step three do you push this

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.000 
good and step three do you push this
button<00:05:45.960> there<00:05:46.960> we<00:05:47.080> go<00:05:47.169> on<00:05:47.320> an<00:05:47.410> expert<00:05:47.800> skate

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
button there we go on an expert skate

00:05:48.010 --> 00:06:06.780 
button there we go on an expert skate
sharpener

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.750 

there<00:06:07.790> were<00:06:07.850> none<00:06:08.050> like<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.140> toaster<00:06:09.500> oven<00:06:09.760> and

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
there were none like a toaster oven and

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.370 
there were none like a toaster oven and
I<00:06:10.910> guess<00:06:11.090> there's<00:06:11.300> one<00:06:11.420> more<00:06:11.630> step<00:06:11.870> now<00:06:12.080> as<00:06:12.260> I

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
I guess there's one more step now as I

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.930 
I guess there's one more step now as I
have<00:06:12.620> to<00:06:12.770> go<00:06:12.890> I<00:06:12.950> run<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.250> stone<00:06:13.460> up<00:06:13.700> and<00:06:13.820> down

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
have to go I run the stone up and down

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.530 
have to go I run the stone up and down
right<00:06:14.120> correct<00:06:14.750> all<00:06:15.260> right<00:06:16.390> then<00:06:17.390> you<00:06:17.510> can

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
right correct all right then you can

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.820 
right correct all right then you can
talk<00:06:18.110> to<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.380> edge<00:06:18.800> checker<00:06:19.070> on<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:20.830> last

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
talk to the edge checker on the last

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.130 
talk to the edge checker on the last
step<00:06:22.130> is<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.460> edge<00:06:23.000> checker<00:06:23.360> I'm<00:06:23.720> assuming

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
step is the edge checker I'm assuming

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.840 
step is the edge checker I'm assuming
that<00:06:24.350> most<00:06:24.500> people<00:06:24.770> out<00:06:24.830> there<00:06:25.040> don't<00:06:25.640> know

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
that most people out there don't know

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.710 
that most people out there don't know
how<00:06:25.970> this<00:06:26.090> thing<00:06:26.300> works

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
how this thing works

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.450 
how this thing works
so<00:06:26.900> you<00:06:26.990> toss<00:06:27.200> on<00:06:27.380> your<00:06:27.530> blade<00:06:27.710> and<00:06:27.980> it's<00:06:28.370> going

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
so you toss on your blade and it's going

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.340 
so you toss on your blade and it's going
to<00:06:28.520> measure<00:06:28.850> how<00:06:29.090> level<00:06:29.510> those<00:06:29.630> edges<00:06:29.960> are<00:06:30.050> and

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
to measure how level those edges are and

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.140 
to measure how level those edges are and
having<00:06:30.860> level<00:06:31.220> edges<00:06:31.460> is<00:06:31.610> important<00:06:32.060> in

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
having level edges is important in

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.850 
having level edges is important in
skating<00:06:32.840> so<00:06:33.170> I'm<00:06:33.230> just<00:06:33.320> going<00:06:33.440> to<00:06:33.500> exaggerate

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
skating so I'm just going to exaggerate

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.890 
skating so I'm just going to exaggerate
this<00:06:34.340> the<00:06:34.580> short<00:06:34.790> point<00:06:35.060> if<00:06:35.210> your<00:06:35.360> edges<00:06:35.870> are

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
this the short point if your edges are

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.330 
this the short point if your edges are
like<00:06:36.080> that<00:06:36.230> you<00:06:36.410> can<00:06:36.500> see<00:06:36.650> a<00:06:36.680> bunch<00:06:36.890> of<00:06:36.980> dots<00:06:37.130> on

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
like that you can see a bunch of dots on

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.890 
like that you can see a bunch of dots on
the<00:06:37.400> one<00:06:37.520> side<00:06:37.700> not<00:06:37.940> on<00:06:37.970> the<00:06:38.120> other<00:06:38.210> that<00:06:38.750> means

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
the one side not on the other that means

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.690 
the one side not on the other that means
you<00:06:39.530> don't<00:06:39.620> have<00:06:39.770> even<00:06:40.010> edges<00:06:40.430> so<00:06:40.550> I'm<00:06:40.610> just

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
you don't have even edges so I'm just

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.970 
you don't have even edges so I'm just
going<00:06:40.820> to<00:06:40.880> let<00:06:41.000> this<00:06:41.120> sit<00:06:41.420> flush<00:06:41.690> and<00:06:42.590> push<00:06:42.860> it

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
going to let this sit flush and push it

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.330 
going to let this sit flush and push it
up<00:06:43.070> there<00:06:44.020> alright<00:06:45.020> so<00:06:45.260> that<00:06:45.470> is<00:06:45.500> level<00:06:46.250> you

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
up there alright so that is level you

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.360 
up there alright so that is level you
can<00:06:46.460> see<00:06:46.660> the<00:06:47.660> dots<00:06:47.870> right<00:06:48.380> along<00:06:48.590> there<00:06:48.800> just

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.370 
can see the dots right along there just

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.400 
can see the dots right along there just
showing<00:06:49.640> a<00:06:49.700> levelness<00:06:50.000> of<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.270> edge<00:06:50.410> I'll

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
showing a levelness of the edge I'll

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.750 
showing a levelness of the edge I'll
wrap<00:06:51.590> this<00:06:51.740> up<00:06:51.920> while<00:06:52.130> I'm<00:06:52.220> skating<00:06:52.430> let<00:06:52.670> you

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
wrap this up while I'm skating let you

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.820 
wrap this up while I'm skating let you
know<00:06:52.850> how<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.150> sharpening<00:06:54.020> felt<00:06:54.320> so

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
know how the sharpening felt so

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.920 
know how the sharpening felt so
basically<00:06:55.220> it<00:06:55.490> felt<00:06:55.850> just<00:06:56.090> how<00:06:56.570> you'd<00:06:56.780> expect

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
basically it felt just how you'd expect

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.200 
basically it felt just how you'd expect
a<00:06:57.350> good<00:06:57.590> Sharpie<00:06:58.040> to<00:06:58.160> feel<00:06:58.340> like<00:06:58.550> from<00:06:58.850> any

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
a good Sharpie to feel like from any

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.770 
a good Sharpie to feel like from any
skate<00:06:59.570> shop<00:06:59.810> good<00:07:00.770> edges<00:07:01.190> no<00:07:01.820> flat<00:07:02.240> spots<00:07:02.570> no
