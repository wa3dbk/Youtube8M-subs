are playing out there and that is to no
surprise<00:00:20.640> because<00:00:21.090> currently<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:21.990> are<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
surprise because currently we are the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.490 
surprise because currently we are the
third<00:00:22.980> best<00:00:23.400> team<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> NBA<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.289> was

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
third best team in the NBA and I was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.470 
third best team in the NBA and I was
certainly<00:00:25.859> surprised<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.449> I

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
certainly surprised to see that so I

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
certainly surprised to see that so I
decided<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.019> sort<00:00:28.349> these<00:00:28.619> stats<00:00:28.949> by<00:00:29.400> our<00:00:29.609> point

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
decided to sort these stats by our point

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.240 
decided to sort these stats by our point
differential<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.289> turns<00:00:31.500> out<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.009> we

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
differential and it turns out that we

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970 
differential and it turns out that we
are<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.850> seventh<00:00:33.420> best<00:00:33.809> team<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.860> are

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
are the seventh best team so we are

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.580 
are the seventh best team so we are
pretty<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.399> performing<00:00:36.180> above

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
pretty much performing above

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.959 
pretty much performing above
expectations<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.879> looking

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
expectations as of now if we're looking

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.600 
expectations as of now if we're looking
at<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.360> from<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.690> statistical<00:00:39.989> standpoint<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
at it from a statistical standpoint but

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
at it from a statistical standpoint but
I'll<00:00:41.730> take<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.030> I'll<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.020> we<00:00:43.350> are

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
I'll take it I'll take it that we are

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.709 
I'll take it I'll take it that we are
currently<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.309> third<00:00:44.610> best<00:00:44.969> team<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.570> NBA

game but for some reason some things are
going<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.959> change<00:03:31.050> towards<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.920> end<00:03:32.070> right

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
going to change towards the end right

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.940 
going to change towards the end right
there<00:03:32.940> we<00:03:33.209> got<00:03:33.360> boogie<00:03:33.870> missed<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.620> layup

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
there we got boogie missed that layup

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
there we got boogie missed that layup
that's<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.670> shot<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.330> he<00:03:36.450> usually<00:03:36.720> converts

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that's a shot that he usually converts

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
that's a shot that he usually converts
every<00:03:37.830> single<00:03:38.190> time<00:03:38.459> but<00:03:38.910> with<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.150> being

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
every single time but with that being

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.199 
every single time but with that being
said<00:03:39.570> we<00:03:39.959> got<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.290> Houston<00:03:40.709> Rockets<00:03:40.980> going<00:03:41.880> on

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
said we got the Houston Rockets going on

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.080 
said we got the Houston Rockets going on
a<00:03:42.239> run<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.050> close<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:44.010> first<00:03:44.220> half<00:03:44.430> now

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
a run to close out the first half now

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.300 
a run to close out the first half now
usually<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> type<00:03:46.620> of<00:03:46.650> thing<00:03:47.070> that<00:03:47.100> I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
usually that is the type of thing that I

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.880 
usually that is the type of thing that I
want<00:03:47.580> to<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:48.030> ending<00:03:48.630> quarters<00:03:49.110> and<00:03:49.410> starting

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
want to do ending quarters and starting

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.430 
want to do ending quarters and starting
quarters<00:03:50.310> with<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.700> bang<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.480> right<00:03:51.780> there

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
quarters with a bang but right there

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.380 
quarters with a bang but right there
we<00:03:52.650> got<00:03:52.860> James<00:03:53.130> Harden<00:03:53.640> ending<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.120> first

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
we got James Harden ending the first

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.300 
we got James Harden ending the first
half<00:03:54.510> were<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.840> use<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.230> Rockets<00:03:55.680> with<00:03:55.830> a<00:03:56.010> bang

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
half were to use the Rockets with a bang

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.699 
half were to use the Rockets with a bang
and<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.239> certainly<00:03:57.450> not<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.500> my<00:03:58.680> liking

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
and that is certainly not to my liking

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.070 
and that is certainly not to my liking
not<00:03:59.489> at<00:03:59.670> all<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.090> let's<00:04:00.300> start<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.750> second

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
not at all so let's start the second

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.620 
not at all so let's start the second
half<00:04:01.260> with<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.890> bang<00:04:02.160> as<00:04:02.400> well<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.090> we<00:04:03.209> got<00:04:03.360> Kent

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
half with a bang as well and we got Kent

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.900

Bazemore<00:04:03.870> taking<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> all<00:04:04.830> the<00:04:04.860> way<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.519> this

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
Bazemore taking it all the way and this

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.630 
Bazemore taking it all the way and this
game<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.660> has<00:04:06.930> been<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.620> has<00:04:07.799> been<00:04:07.830> tremendous

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
a shooting guard that isn't too

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.360

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
difficult to acquire in this game mode

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.849 
difficult to acquire in this game mode
definitely<00:04:15.060> go<00:04:15.300> after<00:04:15.480> Kent<00:04:15.930> face<00:04:16.200> more<00:04:16.560> his

offense
it<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:20.729> certainly<00:04:21.120> improvement<00:04:21.780> with<00:04:22.169> every
