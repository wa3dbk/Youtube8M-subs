00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
legitimate simulation one on one online

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.800 
legitimate simulation one on one online
ranked<00:01:26.460> game<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.659> many

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
ranked game because there was so many

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
ranked game because there was so many
problems<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.470> those<00:01:28.650> games<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:29.310> just

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
problems in those games that just

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
problems in those games that just
hindered<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> ability<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.290> me<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> take<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
hindered the ability for me to take the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.179 
hindered the ability for me to take the
game<00:01:32.159> seriously<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.439> took<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.740> lot<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
game seriously and so it took a lot in

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.300 
game seriously and so it took a lot in
order<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.970> game<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.270> evolve<00:01:37.100> for<00:01:38.100> me<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
order for this game to evolve for me to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
order for this game to evolve for me to
consider<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.150> game<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.110> play<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
consider it a game that I could play you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.240 
consider it a game that I could play you
know<00:01:41.250> competitively<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.070> one<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> those

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
know competitively and so one of those

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
know competitively and so one of those
big<00:01:44.490> changes<00:01:44.939> are<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.329> things<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
big changes are one of the things that I

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.920

harped<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.649> much<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.490> physics<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.149> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
harped on so much was the physics and I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.440 
harped on so much was the physics and I
was<00:01:49.079> such<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> big<00:01:49.500> fan<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> NFL<00:01:50.189> 2k5<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.180> also

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.490 
do believe that 2k sports put out the
greatest<00:02:48.879> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.090> best<00:02:49.450> football<00:02:49.930> games<00:02:50.200> in

this regard I think since we only have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.300 
this regard I think since we only have
one<00:02:53.889> football<00:02:54.700> game<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.480> count<00:02:55.989> on<00:02:56.200> or<00:02:56.530> one
