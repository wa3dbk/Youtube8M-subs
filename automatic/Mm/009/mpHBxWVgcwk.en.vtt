00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.690 
are pretty inexpensive the curl
activator<00:00:27.450> is<00:00:27.960> 595<00:00:28.620> for<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> little<00:00:29.340> over<00:00:29.430> three

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.940 
activator is 595 for a little over three
ounces<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.510> here<00:00:31.200> I'm<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.350> showing<00:00:31.530> you<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
ounces and here I'm just showing you the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
texture of it it's really thick and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950 
texture of it it's really thick and
creamy<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.730> does<00:00:36.180> add<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.449> lot<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> moisture

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
creamy so it does add a lot of moisture

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
smoothing I'm scrunching it in kind of

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.939 
smoothing I'm scrunching it in kind of
like<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.819> gel<00:00:57.179> because<00:00:57.569> for<00:00:58.229> this<00:00:58.379> product<00:00:58.620> I

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:02.249 
use it as both a leave-in and a styler

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.820 
use it as both a leave-in and a styler
because<00:01:02.639> it<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.969> has<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> texture<00:01:03.830> and

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
because it kind of has that texture and

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.289 
because it kind of has that texture and
then<00:01:05.280> some<00:01:05.460> people<00:01:05.729> said<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.000> didn't<00:01:06.270> like

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the smell in other reviews but I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.110 
the smell in other reviews but I

smell<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> kind<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> fresh<00:01:11.240> smell

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
smell it's kind of like a fresh smell

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.810 
smell it's kind of like a fresh smell
but<00:01:12.539> it<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.719> pretty<00:01:12.899> strong<00:01:13.399> so<00:01:14.399> here<00:01:14.670> are<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
but it is pretty strong so here are the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.429 
but it is pretty strong so here are the
results<00:01:14.969> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.719> actually<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> different

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
results this is actually a different

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.870 
results this is actually a different
time<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.619> use<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.950> product<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
time I use this product and in this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
time I use this product and in this
these<00:01:18.240> clips<00:01:18.539> I<00:01:18.750> had<00:01:19.409> used<00:01:19.680> my<00:01:20.130> regular

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
these clips I had used my regular

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
these clips I had used my regular
styling<00:01:20.939> products<00:01:21.270> underneath<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> think

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
styling products underneath so I think

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.170 
styling products underneath so I think
my<00:01:23.039> hair<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.640> bit<00:01:23.759> way<00:01:23.909> down

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
my hair was a little bit way down

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.770 
my hair was a little bit way down
because<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because of that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.690 
because of that
but<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.469> product<00:01:25.680> gave<00:01:25.920> excellent

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
but this product gave excellent

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.200 
but this product gave excellent
definition<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.509> shine<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:28.710> my<00:01:28.829> hair<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
definition and shine to my hair so the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.490 
definition and shine to my hair so the
second<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.899> I<00:01:31.079> didn't<00:01:31.289> even<00:01:31.380> use

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
second time I use it I didn't even use

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.340 
second time I use it I didn't even use
my<00:01:31.859> normal<00:01:32.299> leave-in<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.990> still<00:01:34.200> worked

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
my normal leave-in and it still worked

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.469 
my normal leave-in and it still worked
great

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
shiny and bouncy and mainly because of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this product especially in that section

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.529 
this product especially in that section
right<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> next<00:01:48.179> I'm<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> be

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
right there so next I'm going to be

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.300 
right there so next I'm going to be
using<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.289> 30<00:01:49.590> second<00:01:49.950> curl<00:01:50.159> spray<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:53.070> is

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
using the 30 second curl spray this is

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.969 
using the 30 second curl spray this is
also<00:01:53.460> pretty<00:01:53.759> cheap<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.270> $4.99<00:01:54.810> for<00:01:55.140> 5

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
also pretty cheap it's $4.99 for 5

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.359 
also pretty cheap it's $4.99 for 5
ounces<00:01:56.569> but<00:01:57.569> the<00:01:58.170> stream<00:01:58.590> comes<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.069> very

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
ounces but the stream comes out very

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.300 
ounces but the stream comes out very
concentrated<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> would<00:02:00.479> recommend

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
concentrated so I would recommend

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
concentrated so I would recommend
spraying<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.490> into<00:02:02.700> your<00:02:02.819> hand<00:02:03.119> first<00:02:05.869> so<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
spraying it into your hand first so this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.320 
spraying it into your hand first so this
is<00:02:07.319> some<00:02:07.590> old<00:02:07.829> hair<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.910> a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.750 
actually don't scrunch when I use this
product<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.319> my<00:02:59.129> hair<00:02:59.280> tends<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.519> really

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.000 

so<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.599> are<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.900> results<00:03:22.409> it<00:03:22.560> added<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> lot

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
so here are the results it added a lot

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.550 
so here are the results it added a lot
of<00:03:23.090> volume<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.209> life<00:03:24.390> back<00:03:24.629> into<00:03:24.840> my<00:03:24.930> hair<00:03:25.170> it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
of volume and life back into my hair it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.309 
of volume and life back into my hair it
didn't<00:03:25.890> define<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.879> type<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.510> wavy<00:03:27.870> hair<00:03:28.170> as

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
didn't define this type of wavy hair as

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.920 
didn't define this type of wavy hair as
much<00:03:28.349> as<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:29.280> defined<00:03:29.730> my<00:03:29.909> natural<00:03:30.420> curls<00:03:30.750> when

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
much as it defined my natural curls when

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.449 
much as it defined my natural curls when
I<00:03:30.959> had<00:03:31.170> them<00:03:31.349> on<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> second<00:03:31.860> or<00:03:31.980> third<00:03:32.010> day<00:03:32.189> so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
I had them on the second or third day so

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.339 
I had them on the second or third day so
I<00:03:32.939> did<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.510> how<00:03:33.659> this<00:03:33.810> worked<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.110> little<00:03:34.200> bit

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
I did like how this worked a little bit

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.350 
I did like how this worked a little bit
better<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.680> my<00:03:35.040> natural<00:03:35.340> texture<00:03:35.879> more<00:03:36.090> so

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
better on my natural texture more so

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.539 
better on my natural texture more so
than<00:03:36.599> my<00:03:36.690> stretched<00:03:37.049> texture<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.340> still

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
than my stretched texture but it still

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:52.190 
than my stretched texture but it still
did<00:03:38.700> provide<00:03:39.030> volume

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.750 

so<00:03:53.200> overall<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.770> give<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> curl<00:03:54.250> activator<00:03:54.400> of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
so overall I give the curl activator of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.820 
so overall I give the curl activator of
4.5<00:03:55.450> out<00:03:55.600> of<00:03:55.630> 5<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:56.020> really<00:03:56.350> loved<00:03:56.560> it<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.710> I

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
would repurchase in the 30 second spray

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.450
