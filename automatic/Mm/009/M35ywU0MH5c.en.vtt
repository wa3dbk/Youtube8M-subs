00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
the treadmill for 30 minutes because I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.010

hoping it'll fade away over time the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.199 
hoping it'll fade away over time the
doctor<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.380> surgeon<00:03:33.620> said<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.760> could<00:03:35.000> take

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
doctor the surgeon said that could take

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.160
