00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.270 
and then you're going to move your
pointer<00:02:03.750> finger<00:02:04.200> from<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.829> fourth<00:02:05.070> string

middle<00:02:07.740> finger<00:02:08.009> open

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.610 

and<00:02:10.700> then<00:02:11.450> you're<00:02:11.600> going<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.900> go<00:02:12.050> back<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.470> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
and then you're going to go back to that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
pointer finger in the G chord position

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.670 
pointer finger in the G chord position
but<00:02:17.240> instead<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.750> 6th<00:02:18.080> and<00:02:18.200> 5th<00:02:18.230> gonna

but instead of the 6th and 5th gonna
meet<00:02:18.800> 4th<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.100> 5th<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:21.440> then<00:02:22.100> you're<00:02:22.280> going

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
meet 4th and 5th and then you're going

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.520

to move your middle finger again and
that's<00:02:27.680> every<00:02:28.010> chord<00:02:28.250> you're<00:02:28.370> going<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.580> need

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
that's every chord you're going to need

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.360 
that's every chord you're going to need
there's<00:02:28.970> actually<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.770> part<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.130> verse

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
there's actually the part of the verse

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.620 
there's actually the part of the verse
you're<00:02:31.610> actually<00:02:31.970> supposed<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.270> do<00:02:32.450> like<00:02:32.600> a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
you're actually supposed to do like a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.840 
you're actually supposed to do like a
power<00:02:32.900> chord<00:02:33.260> position<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.310> 3rd<00:02:34.580> fret

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
power chord position on the 3rd fret

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.110 
power chord position on the 3rd fret
starting<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.960> fifth<00:02:36.170> string<00:02:36.350> down<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.970> can

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
starting the fifth string down you can

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870 
starting the fifth string down you can
use<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.480> chord<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:39.050> kind<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.070> sounds<00:02:40.520> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
use that chord it kind of sounds the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.060 
use that chord it kind of sounds the
same<00:02:41.980> as<00:02:43.840> what<00:02:44.840> instead<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.350> using<00:02:45.560> that<00:02:45.770> is

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
same as what instead of using that is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.360 
same as what instead of using that is
you<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.340> chord<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.830> sounds<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.100> little<00:02:49.190> bit

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
you this chord so it sounds a little bit

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.730 
you this chord so it sounds a little bit
better<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.600> easier<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.990> move<00:02:51.440> from

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
better and it's easier to move from

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.650 
better and it's easier to move from
chord<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.160> chord<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.580> know<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.300> was<00:02:53.390> kind<00:02:53.510> of

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
chord to chord I know that was kind of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.200 
chord to chord I know that was kind of
confusing<00:02:54.140> but<00:02:54.920> I'm<00:02:55.130> going<00:02:55.490> to<00:02:55.550> go<00:02:55.820> through

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
confusing but I'm going to go through

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:26.060 
confusing but I'm going to go through
the<00:02:56.570> chords<00:02:56.930> really<00:02:57.110> slow

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.200 

that's<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.250> opening<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:29.580> then<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.760> chorus

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
that's the opening and then the chorus

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.620 
that's the opening and then the chorus
is<00:03:31.450> going<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.560> have<00:03:33.400> these<00:03:33.550> chords<00:03:33.910> we're

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
is going to have these chords we're

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.660 
is going to have these chords we're
going<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:34.990> start<00:03:35.350> Sanji<00:03:36.040> chord<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.490> did

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going to start Sanji chord you did

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.040 
going to start Sanji chord you did
before<00:03:36.850> pretty<00:03:37.420> much<00:03:37.540> everything<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:37.900> going

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
before pretty much everything is going

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:56.400 
before pretty much everything is going
to<00:03:38.080> be<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.290> same<00:03:54.480> pretty<00:03:55.480> much<00:03:55.600> it's<00:03:55.930> exactly

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
to be the same pretty much it's exactly

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.990 
to be the same pretty much it's exactly
the<00:03:56.620> same<00:03:56.800> thing<00:03:57.100> but<00:03:57.490> you're<00:03:57.640> going<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.820> play

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
the same thing but you're going to play

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.020 
the same thing but you're going to play
it<00:03:58.120> a<00:03:58.240> different<00:03:58.600> speed<00:03:58.840> when<00:03:59.380> you<00:03:59.500> play<00:04:00.030> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
it a different speed when you play the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.350 
it a different speed when you play the
opening<00:04:01.620> it's<00:04:02.620> kind<00:04:02.890> of<00:04:02.920> hard<00:04:03.130> to<00:04:03.190> just

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
opening it's kind of hard to just

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.150 
opening it's kind of hard to just
describe<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.390> strumming<00:04:04.990> pattern<00:04:05.020> you<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.130> a

not palm you're just going to let them

00:04:47.400 --> 00:05:20.480 
not palm you're just going to let them
ring<00:04:47.610> out<00:04:47.730> like<00:04:47.880> this<00:05:19.010> it<00:05:20.010> goes<00:05:20.130> on<00:05:20.280> like<00:05:20.460> that

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
ring out like this it goes on like that

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.840 
ring out like this it goes on like that
if<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.240> want<00:05:21.920> toward<00:05:22.920> the<00:05:23.100> very<00:05:23.280> end<00:05:23.400> instead

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
if you want toward the very end instead

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.470 
if you want toward the very end instead
of<00:05:23.910> playing<00:05:24.420> this<00:05:24.750> chord<00:05:25.020> again<00:05:26.060> I'm<00:05:27.060> slightly

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
of playing this chord again I'm slightly

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.150 
of playing this chord again I'm slightly
amusing<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:30.390> can<00:05:30.630> move<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:31.350> actually<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:32.040> the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
amusing you can move it actually to the

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.530 
amusing you can move it actually to the
third<00:05:32.460> string<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.910> makes<00:05:33.060> it<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.240> little<00:05:33.390> bit

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
third string it makes it a little bit

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.340 
third string it makes it a little bit
higher<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.450> actually<00:05:36.600> probably<00:05:36.990> sounds

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
higher and I actually probably sounds

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.470 
higher and I actually probably sounds
better<00:05:37.500> you're<00:05:38.130> going<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.460> use<00:05:38.670> that<00:05:38.910> for

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
better you're going to use that for
