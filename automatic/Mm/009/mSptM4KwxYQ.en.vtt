00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.470
 fakers but there are two who do not kiss 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:07.810
 plus one is hopper federico I do not know if you 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.580
 it sounds colom it sounds to me and that 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.580
 it also sounds like it's the fernandez hour 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 it's over love they separated they tell 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.170
 because we want to know how it is 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.050
 your heart 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:27.640
 let's say alone of heart if 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.070
 yes no we are not more with feder a little 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.419
 less than a month equal to a little 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.820
 little he named 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.550
 we were in some terms and super 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.440
 well although we give everything comes in addition that 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 it's not good to look bad because 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.170
 inevitably out there we are not going to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.629
 keep crossing and others and the truth that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.360
 I do not like to end badly 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.129
 because it was for some matter let's say 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.070
 that they do not agree on issues 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.050
 of the age 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.640
 I prefer to reserve it for myself for the first 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.620
 out of respect for him and also out of respect for 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.750
 me because the machine sir you that if 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.610
 everything that happens to me after I 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.780
 saved to count because one thing is to tell 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.040
 when you're good with someone and another 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.330
 thing is when you're no longer I'm not going to 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.890
 go out and count the reasons that a diva 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.460
 which is me the truth is that I 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.930
 I reserve but also that we are 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.509
 recontra well the same is a great person 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.720
 and we still love each other very much and 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.179
 in this month they are separated I do not know 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:31.700
 They were talking texting cut 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:34.310
 directly all this I ask and it is 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.810
 difficult to finish when you finish well 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 with someone it's hard not to follow 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.710
 Speaking I 'll wait for you when they finish 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.140
 wrong or something happened that he did as he 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.750
 cut all good ready you do not speak anymore 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.970
 endure no matter how much you feel like not 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.729
 you speak more I say when everything is fine is 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.330
 difficult to cut at all you saw more than 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.590
 they are still searching is still talking about 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:01.159
 there after there is a chance of maybe going back 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.310
 they come back to see I'm going to eat I do not know what 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.530
 it can be no no I do not know that the truth is 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.800
 what is and is difficult to finish with someone 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.300
 when you finish well how to take the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 strength and the decision to say good 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.720
 dress not speak anymore because the truth is 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 that it was a long time that we did 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.040
 very good I do not know what I know to you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.290
 like let's say have this good relationship 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.620
 you would not have preferred or preferred 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.629
 cut it and not have more contact no no 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.580
 no I'm fine I prefer so 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.890
 let's finish well imagined for that because 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.790
 I also more will happen that we 're going 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.680
 to cross again somewhere or not 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.049
 and it's good to finish well when 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.859
 you end up wrong because of something that always happened 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.310
 it's easier because you do not have no 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:48.890
 something happened to you and well you see it's like 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 you force yourself to put a cut to the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.579
 relationship when it ends well it's like a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.680
 little more complicated to cut 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.640
 definitely but good 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.239
 Finally you still love him or not 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.239
 they say to abode 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.620
 until the word of life finishes its 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.790
 relationship with hopper federico and the waves 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.790
 celebrate the human 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.970
 and if you are really in love with a company 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:15.970
 hard 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:41.359
 on the other hand I wanted to lift something else 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:42.739
 but hey, do not fall in love with pampita 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.420
 because the bauza and will discard them 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.470
 who is of age opening southern roads and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.980
 They told me what they are doing 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.410
 spare parts 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.580
 idea because there's going to be news moving 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.380
 there is moving 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.570
 are going to work several things in reality 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.670
 of surfing they told me not only the 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:06.470
 television but that 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.470
 other other means in the study 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.260
 talking about television and television more 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.150
 television action functions 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.800
 obviously they are losing radio 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.910
 we are talking about radios we have 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.150
 talking about radio if we're talking about 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.570
 internet portals and we are talking 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.920
 that more than the shoe factory 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.800
 it ends we are not talking about signals 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.620
 cable cable signals or other than 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.050
 the southern ideas building that looks from 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.740
 front for the heros if you want more 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:53.450
 yes clear properties 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.020
 to see cable signals several radios 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:02.620
 several ones that change format and 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.620
 maybe it 's very defined 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.830
 sick pink doctor is chatting with 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.810
 the list that I was reading your book on 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.190
 terror of the husbands in a while ana 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.950
 rosenfeld here with us in a while 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.930
 we mess with the fake kiss what 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.600
 let's analyze now if carefully 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:29.330
 It was short, I missed saliva, I heard everything 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:31.190
 It's been a while since a kiss I think it's from 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.720
 rock if bread and gas and did not generate as much 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.550
 revolution so many feelings 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.980
 found there are people fascinated people very 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.570
 angry because it lasted very few people who 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.830
 he said is unreal because there is more passion in 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.120
 a good kiss now we are going to beat it 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.120
 all in a little while after
