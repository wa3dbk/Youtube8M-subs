00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the way the both box tied together and

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.100 
the way the both box tied together and
the<00:04:33.730> overall<00:04:33.970> storyline<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.660> would<00:04:35.020> recommend

both I would read everything matters
first<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.900> then<00:04:38.320> read<00:04:38.530> this<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.950> think<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.190> will

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
first and then read this I think it will

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.920 
first and then read this I think it will
make<00:04:39.370> more<00:04:39.640> sense<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:40.150> way<00:04:40.300> around<00:04:40.690> but

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
make more sense that way around but

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.170 
make more sense that way around but
definitely<00:04:41.440> recommend<00:04:42.310> those<00:04:42.460> another<00:04:42.970> thing

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
