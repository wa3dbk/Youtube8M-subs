are<00:01:17.840> pretty<00:01:18.840> much<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> same<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:20.400> were

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
are pretty much the same and we were

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.420 
are pretty much the same and we were
going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.870> see<00:01:23.060> how<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:25.440> friendly<00:01:25.860> fire<00:01:26.100> works

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
going to see how the friendly fire works

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
going to see how the friendly fire works
so<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.440> will<00:01:28.680> shoot<00:01:28.950> both<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
so because the they will shoot both and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.440 
so because the they will shoot both and
line<00:01:31.200> infantry<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.860> colon<00:01:33.770> so<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> plan<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
line infantry and colon so the plan is

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.890 
line infantry and colon so the plan is
that<00:01:37.430> if<00:01:39.229> enemy<00:01:40.229> decided<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.040> attack<00:01:41.880> her<00:01:42.119> then

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
that if enemy decided to attack her then

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.020 
that if enemy decided to attack her then
when<00:01:43.290> III<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.900> bayonet<00:01:45.900> we<00:01:46.410> will<00:01:46.820> fight<00:01:47.820> in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
when III with a bayonet we will fight in

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.260 
when III with a bayonet we will fight in
close<00:01:48.240> combat<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.490> cozy<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.670> were<00:01:50.880> slightly

close combat and cozy here were slightly
bigger<00:01:52.140> range<00:01:52.440> so<00:01:53.660> they<00:01:54.660> don't<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.200> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
