00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello this tutorial is to do this 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.010
 makeup that is a makeup rather 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.780
 at night with super bright colors so 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.780
 I hope you like it and we start 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.050
 well I already have a base on my eyelid 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.840
 more or less pearled and now what we're going 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.710
 to start doing is this base dora 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.919
 apply it in the inner area of ​​our 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.400
 and now with this 15 the smallest we go 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:33.600
 to direct a line 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.329
 towards the end of the eyebrow and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.660
 then on the eye bone towards 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660
 in 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.340
 with the softest brush and with a little 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.909
 of the brown we are going to begin to fill 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.380
 the space between and with the most 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:01:00.610
 dark let's deepen and darken 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.610
 the account of our 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.820
 we can reapply the golden one 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 little in the inner zone to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.910
 intensify the color 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.190
 and blur it with our brush 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.380
 soft or soft with this brush more 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.740
 small let's apply the same shadow 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.150
 of the depth in the bottom line 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.370
 of our tabs to generate 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.790
 continuity and with the eyeliner 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.190
 let's generate a roughly delineated 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.110
 thick girls do not worry if you do not 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.320
 they get to the first the eyeliner is 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.540
 difficult so let's try the slowest 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 and with small movements and cortitos 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.920
 with the back of our 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.750
 better let's fill any space 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 that we may have stayed this 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.000
 eyeliner has one more point of the bar 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.340
 a thicker 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.340
 and we are going to intensify the black color 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:06.090
 and then we're going to apply our mask 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.700
 as always from root to tip 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.250
 and not forgetting the top of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.730
 our lashes to cover any 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 shadow or residue that may have remained 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.730
 previous 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.849
 we would be ready 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.430
 now we continue with our face 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.950
 modeling brush to accentuate the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.920
 cheekbones from the hair root towards 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 inside the face in movements of s 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.030
 blur always and with little product 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.310
 so that we do not get stained or very 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.310
 recharged the same as bent 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.830
 and now the flush 15 we can do it with 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.810
 the same does not really affect the 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.489
 result 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.489
 and it's always a trade 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.720
 any shadow residue that we 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.459
 it may have been under the eyelid what 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.130
 we can gently remove with the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.000
 little fingers and now the lips are going to 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.590
 increase before the labial so that it does not 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 we face that he is not believed that in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.340
 lips 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.409
 and with a synthetic brush if what 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.799
 they also need what they can do 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:28.849
 straight from the labial tube we're going to 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.849
 fill our lips 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.670
 good girls this is the complete we have 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.670
 finished 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.970
 well that's how the finished look looks 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.010
 I hope you like it 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.530
 they look lovely by the time they finish 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.860
 to use it to go out in the night 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.120
 we always need to use more colors 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.590
 intense that there is less light and that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.180
 there is a result and believes there 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.570
 liked and we will continue like that no more 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.570
