00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 scruffy car and waste 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.150
 money tires wear faster 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.490
 fuel consumption increases and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.480
 depending on the case, it only resolves with 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.859
 technical alignment seems to be tricky but 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.570
 the car is really caranguejÃ£o giving 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:23.070
 to drive sideways the vehicle needs 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 to be well-punished holes worth one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 stronger braking 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.310
 all this messes with the structure of the car 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 the traditional alignment in these cases 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.250
 resolve 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.440
 now if there is a car crash that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 suffered a collision o to shock he did not 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 keep alignment those 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.590
 probably had an impact on this 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 has thrown all this structure into 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 inside that part of the wheel will you 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.030
 You see the fix is that you can 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 O view and all points 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.570
 repaired 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 the suspension frame makes a noise 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.079
 Damn and the owner still complains about the lack 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 stability 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.939
 you could also notice how the wheel is 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.340
 in relation to the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.140
 a case similar to that of Jeffrey 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 hit the curb to avoid a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.960
 head- on collision 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 had heard of germany and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.369
 technician not a foreigner talk to me 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 surprise also the moment that I stayed 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.979
 knowing that it would have a technical alignment 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.040
 did not know 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.600
 I thought it was just walking and driving and 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.560
 make the common alignment on account of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.470
 holes is not 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.140
 the diagnosis takes about 20 minutes 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.329
 and Camila soon discovers a problem in the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.490
 only spars was a repair one 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.829
 unsuccessful attempt to leave this 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.329
 the original measurement again and finished 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.200
 damaging the picture of the suspension of 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.630
 vehicle 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.149
 The path of this car now enters the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.289
 table row the hard line that other 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.289
 vehicle arrived first 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.220
 this alignment table where we 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.509
 we talk about it after the measurement when the 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.759
 The car needs an alignment of 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.959
 structure it comes to the table where it is fixed 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.369
 in 4 points 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:02.770
 this car suffered a frontal crash 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.630
 where those stringers ran to the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.390
 and here had an absorption of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.590
 impact at that point new vehicles today 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.660
 they were developed so that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.620
 had impact absorption points the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.080
 safety of the person inside the vehicle 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.660
 on the table the vehicle is well fixed so that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 technicians can pull and pull the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 parts for the place 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.870
 sometimes the work of the hooks is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.099
 sufficient but it may be necessary to 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.260
 change any part in the cup 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.200
 basic technical alignment costs 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.269
 average of 400 reais but can exceed 2 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.590
 thousand depending on the obstacles that 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.590
 find themselves ahead of 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.709
 it does not repair bumper adjustment 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.049
 ford hood 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.879
 again she goes back to the ramp to 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.409
 make the final alignment measurement 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.239
 for the car to rotate again with 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.159
 security with stability with all 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.900
 structure of the original measures of the 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.610
 factory and already know to hit the car attention 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.310
 after he left the workshop the 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.959
 technical alignment may prevent other 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 problems 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.019
 when a customer is complaining about the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.209
 my car in the past a survey of 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.310
 secure a square a sales survey 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.109
 have any structural or bad problems 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.450
 prepared you see that it is visible that you are 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.370
 twisted or the wheel too deep inside you 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.060
 sees that the car is not aligned that is 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.060
 repairable
