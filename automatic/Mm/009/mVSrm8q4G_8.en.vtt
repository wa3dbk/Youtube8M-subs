hello<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.730> was<00:00:15.269> working<00:00:15.960> with<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.350> stuff

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
hello I was working with this stuff

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.349 
hello I was working with this stuff
which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.859> sponge<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.730> all<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.880> did<00:00:18.000> really

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
which is sponge and all I did really

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.359 
which is sponge and all I did really
with<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.960> dip<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.590> Internet<00:00:20.160> mix

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
with it was dip it in the Internet mix

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759 
with it was dip it in the Internet mix
the<00:00:20.520> ink<00:00:20.670> 50/50<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.480> water<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.500> let<00:00:22.650> it

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the ink 50/50 with water and I let it

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.599 
the ink 50/50 with water and I let it
dry<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> got<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
dry and what I got was this which is a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.339 
dry and what I got was this which is a
flexible<00:00:26.609> conductive<00:00:27.449> sponge<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.170> was

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
flexible conductive sponge and I was

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.529 
flexible conductive sponge and I was
modeling<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.010> over<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:30.029> what<00:00:30.179> I've<00:00:30.300> done

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
modeling that one over so what I've done

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.410 
modeling that one over so what I've done
is<00:00:30.720> I've<00:00:30.869> taken<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.320> shoot<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.890> menu<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.460> piece

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
is I've taken a shoot of a menu a piece

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.720 
is I've taken a shoot of a menu a piece
of<00:00:33.690> kitchen<00:00:34.230> towel<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.950> put<00:00:35.190> one<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.520> top<00:00:35.670> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
of kitchen towel use put one on top of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
of kitchen towel use put one on top of
the<00:00:36.000> other

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.380 

set<00:00:41.220> that<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:03.900 

click<00:00:50.390> one<00:00:50.600> electrode<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:55.360> aluminium

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.300 

usually<00:01:04.600> electrode<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.619> a<00:01:05.650> bit<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.979> sponge<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
usually electrode to a bit of sponge and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.770 
usually electrode to a bit of sponge and
put<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.729> sponge<00:01:09.939> on<00:01:10.210> top<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:12.780> black

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
put the sponge on top there black

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.469 
put the sponge on top there black
believe<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.200> or<00:01:14.350> not<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.799> battery<00:01:15.479> obviously

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
believe it or not is a battery obviously

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.600 
believe it or not is a battery obviously
doesn't<00:01:16.750> work<00:01:16.899> at<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.140> moment<00:01:17.530> to<00:01:18.130> turn<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.460> on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
doesn't work at the moment to turn it on

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.940 
doesn't work at the moment to turn it on
because<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.299> needs<00:01:19.479> some<00:01:19.720> electrolyte<00:01:20.290> so

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
because it needs some electrolyte so

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.160 
because it needs some electrolyte so
what<00:01:21.190> I've<00:01:21.340> got<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:21.549> is<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.390> salt<00:01:22.600> water<00:01:22.659> or

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
what I've got here is just salt water or

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.260 
what I've got here is just salt water or
grease<00:01:23.560> or<00:01:23.680> better<00:01:24.009> when<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:24.670> pour<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:24.970> salt

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
grease or better when you pour the salt

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.980 
grease or better when you pour the salt
water<00:01:25.570> through<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.320> sponge<00:01:30.149> until<00:01:31.149> it<00:01:31.840> wets

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
water through the sponge until it wets

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.080 
water through the sponge until it wets
the<00:01:32.140> paper<00:01:32.470> towel<00:01:32.680> and<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.670> will<00:01:33.880> see

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
the paper towel and you will see

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.450 
the paper towel and you will see
immediately<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:35.020> has<00:01:35.860> jumped<00:01:36.369> up<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:38.460> point

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
immediately that has jumped up to point

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.050 
immediately that has jumped up to point
six<00:01:39.819> eight<00:01:40.030> volts<00:01:44.069> so<00:01:45.069> there<00:01:45.220> we<00:01:45.399> go<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.850> is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
six eight volts so there we go that is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.059 
six eight volts so there we go that is
probably<00:01:46.720> one<00:01:46.929> of<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.140> simplest<00:01:47.470> factories

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
probably one of the simplest factories

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.460 
probably one of the simplest factories
ever

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.740 

the<00:01:52.980> metal<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> battery<00:01:53.820> all-metal<00:01:54.540> air

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the metal a battery all-metal air

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
the metal a battery all-metal air
batteries<00:01:55.230> are<00:01:55.410> actually<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.800> same<00:01:55.830> thing

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
batteries are actually the same thing

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.510 
batteries are actually the same thing
what<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.730> have<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.990> metal<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.680> some<00:01:58.950> kind<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
what you have is a metal of some kind a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.730 
what you have is a metal of some kind a
separator<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.720> stop<00:02:00.900> two<00:02:01.140> things<00:02:01.410> touching

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
separator to stop two things touching

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.600 
separator to stop two things touching
and<00:02:02.130> then<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:05.570> carbon<00:02:06.570> material<00:02:07.200> here<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and then a carbon material here now a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.910 
and then a carbon material here now a
lot<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.149> people<00:02:09.479> are<00:02:09.570> using<00:02:09.750> activated<00:02:10.229> carbon

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
lot of people are using activated carbon

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.890 
lot of people are using activated carbon
and<00:02:11.010> the<00:02:11.130> reason<00:02:11.460> using<00:02:11.670> activated<00:02:12.210> carbon<00:02:12.810> is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and the reason using activated carbon is

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.150 
and the reason using activated carbon is
it<00:02:13.020> conductive<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.680> it's<00:02:13.770> got<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.920> large

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
it conductive and it's got a large

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.860 
it conductive and it's got a large
surface<00:02:14.400> area<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> allows<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.510> passage

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
surface area and it allows the passage

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
surface area and it allows the passage
of<00:02:16.140> air

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of air

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.750 
of air
because<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.300> metal<00:02:18.840> air<00:02:19.230> battery<00:02:19.800> is<00:02:19.980> utilizing

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
because a metal air battery is utilizing

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.940 
because a metal air battery is utilizing
the<00:02:21.030> chemistry<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.720> metal<00:02:22.050> rusting<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the chemistry of that metal rusting so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.950 
the chemistry of that metal rusting so
any<00:02:23.070> metal<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.490> will<00:02:23.820> rust<00:02:24.210> is<00:02:24.630> actually

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
any metal that will rust is actually

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.910 
any metal that will rust is actually
going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.290> work<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:27.920> predominantly

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
going to work here now we predominantly

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
going to work here now we predominantly
use<00:02:29.160> or<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.520> lot<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.970> people<00:02:30.270> are<00:02:30.360> using

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510

forever until you dip it in the sea and
you've<00:03:12.540> suddenly<00:03:12.690> got<00:03:12.959> an<00:03:13.050> emergency<00:03:13.260> battery

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you've suddenly got an emergency battery

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.490 
you've suddenly got an emergency battery
that<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.820> carry<00:03:15.030> around<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.780> and

that you can carry around with you and

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.680 
that you can carry around with you and
use<00:03:16.739> at<00:03:17.040> sea<00:03:17.489> so<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> great<00:03:18.270> thing<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.660> use

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
use at sea so it's a great thing to use

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.500 
use at sea so it's a great thing to use
saltwater<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:20.459> isn't<00:03:20.760> necessarily<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.360> best

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
saltwater it isn't necessarily the best

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.020 
saltwater it isn't necessarily the best
thing<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.810> use<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:22.980> these<00:03:23.190> aluminium

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
thing to use and with these aluminium

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.940 
thing to use and with these aluminium
and<00:03:24.450> battery<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:24.959> what<00:03:25.200> makes<00:03:25.380> a<00:03:25.500> really

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
and battery is what makes a really

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.920 
and battery is what makes a really
really<00:03:26.280> good<00:03:26.580> electrolyte<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.420> potassium

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
really good electrolyte is potassium

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
really good electrolyte is potassium
hydroxide<00:03:28.260> but<00:03:29.010> petanque<00:03:29.430> potassium

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
hydroxide but petanque potassium

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.080 
hydroxide but petanque potassium
hydroxide<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.660> really<00:03:31.200> quite<00:03:31.410> caustic<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.489> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
hydroxide is really quite caustic so you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.370 
hydroxide is really quite caustic so you
have<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.360> be<00:03:33.450> careful<00:03:33.780> in<00:03:33.840> handling<00:03:33.959> it

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
have to be careful in handling it

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.530 
have to be careful in handling it
because<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.950> spit<00:03:35.400> anywhere<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.300> going

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
because you you spit anywhere it's going

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.449

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
electrolyte something like that now this

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.580 
electrolyte something like that now this
one<00:04:10.829> here<00:04:11.390> has<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.420> number<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.900> jobs<00:04:13.170> to<00:04:13.349> pair

stephanie's<00:04:25.169> using<00:04:25.650> carbon<00:04:26.100> fiber<00:04:26.130> as<00:04:26.729> well

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
stephanie's using carbon fiber as well

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.840 
stephanie's using carbon fiber as well
that's<00:04:27.180> going<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.479> be<00:04:27.600> good<00:04:27.840> because<00:04:28.139> it<00:04:28.850> does

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
that's going to be good because it does

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.029 
that's going to be good because it does
all<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.000> those<00:04:30.240> jobs<00:04:30.590> it<00:04:31.590> doesn't<00:04:31.889> have<00:04:31.979> a

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
all of those jobs it doesn't have a

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.490 
all of those jobs it doesn't have a
particularly<00:04:32.520> high<00:04:32.789> surface<00:04:33.539> area<00:04:33.930> but<00:04:34.440> you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
particularly high surface area but you

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.230 
particularly high surface area but you
can<00:04:34.650> actually<00:04:34.740> improve<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.460> surface<00:04:35.610> area<00:04:36.180> of

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
can actually improve the surface area of

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.779 
can actually improve the surface area of
carbon<00:04:36.690> fiber<00:04:36.960> if<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.800> did<00:04:38.070> in<00:04:38.310> hydrochloric

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
carbon fiber if you did in hydrochloric

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.879 
carbon fiber if you did in hydrochloric
acid<00:04:39.090> for<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.300> little<00:04:39.509> bit<00:04:39.660> but<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.259> actually

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
acid for a little bit but we actually

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.520 
acid for a little bit but we actually
met<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.639> fiber<00:04:42.030> instead<00:04:42.960> of<00:04:43.139> being<00:04:43.320> tight

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
met the fiber instead of being tight

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.170 
met the fiber instead of being tight
bundles<00:04:43.979> like<00:04:44.099> that<00:04:44.310> spring<00:04:44.789> out<00:04:44.880> a<00:04:44.910> little

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
bundles like that spring out a little

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.969 
bundles like that spring out a little
bit<00:04:45.419> and<00:04:45.810> because<00:04:46.139> they<00:04:46.259> spring<00:04:46.620> out<00:04:46.740> a<00:04:46.770> little

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
bit and because they spring out a little

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.740 
bit and because they spring out a little
bit<00:04:47.220> he'll<00:04:47.370> get<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.520> much<00:04:47.699> better<00:04:47.880> surface<00:04:48.210> area

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
bit he'll get a much better surface area

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.469 
bit he'll get a much better surface area
so<00:04:49.199> if<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.380> tried<00:04:49.620> our<00:04:50.009> pre<00:04:50.970> etching<00:04:51.330> his

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 
so if you tried our pre etching his

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:53.629 
so if you tried our pre etching his
carbon<00:04:51.840> fiber<00:04:52.080> with<00:04:52.259> hydrochloric<00:04:52.530> acid<00:04:53.160> then

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
carbon fiber with hydrochloric acid then

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.920 
carbon fiber with hydrochloric acid then
it's<00:04:53.880> going<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.030> get<00:04:54.150> a<00:04:54.180> better<00:04:54.330> job<00:04:54.449> and<00:04:54.630> could

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
it's going to get a better job and could

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.170 
it's going to get a better job and could
try<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.289> not<00:04:55.440> trick<00:04:55.710> acid<00:04:56.070> nitric<00:04:56.880> acids

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
try and not trick acid nitric acids

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.749 
try and not trick acid nitric acids
great<00:04:57.449> for<00:04:57.690> cutting<00:04:57.840> carbons<00:04:58.550> you'd<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.699> to

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
great for cutting carbons you'd have to

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.570 
great for cutting carbons you'd have to
be<00:04:59.820> quite<00:05:00.000> careful<00:05:00.030> with<00:05:00.660> that<00:05:00.900> and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
be quite careful with that and

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.650 
be quite careful with that and
experiment<00:05:02.580> for<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.729> time<00:05:02.970> that<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.300> left<00:05:03.539> it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
experiment for the time that you left it

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.330 
experiment for the time that you left it
in<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.810> nitric<00:05:04.229> acid<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.620> concentration<00:05:05.250> of

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
in the nitric acid the concentration of

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.219 
in the nitric acid the concentration of
nitric<00:05:05.610> acid<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.360> any<00:05:06.690> of<00:05:06.840> those<00:05:06.960> kind<00:05:07.199> of

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
nitric acid so any of those kind of

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:08.689 
nitric acid so any of those kind of
strong<00:05:07.470> metal<00:05:07.680> acids<00:05:08.099> are<00:05:08.220> going<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.400> improve

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
strong metal acids are going to improve

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.460 
strong metal acids are going to improve
a<00:05:08.880> carbon<00:05:09.270> fiber<00:05:09.510> because<00:05:09.870> they<00:05:09.990> improve<00:05:10.289> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
a carbon fiber because they improve the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.560 
a carbon fiber because they improve the
area<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.699> that's<00:05:11.940> what<00:05:12.060> you're<00:05:12.180> looking<00:05:12.210> for

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
area and that's what you're looking for

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.480 
area and that's what you're looking for
now<00:05:12.720> what<00:05:12.840> I've<00:05:12.990> done<00:05:13.260> obviously<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.949> taking<00:05:14.430> a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
now what I've done obviously is taking a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.180 
now what I've done obviously is taking a
pre-existing<00:05:15.150> sponge<00:05:15.510> with<00:05:16.199> a<00:05:16.229> high<00:05:16.560> air<00:05:16.949> of

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
pre-existing sponge with a high air of

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.189 
pre-existing sponge with a high air of
you're<00:05:17.310> already<00:05:17.580> then<00:05:17.940> a<00:05:17.970> Kurt<00:05:18.570> of<00:05:18.780> that<00:05:18.930> area

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
you're already then a Kurt of that area

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.469 
you're already then a Kurt of that area
with<00:05:19.409> my<00:05:19.440> conductive<00:05:20.159> ink<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.270> really

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
with my conductive ink and so it really

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.390 
with my conductive ink and so it really
becomes<00:05:21.690> very<00:05:21.960> simple<00:05:22.169> process<00:05:22.889> of<00:05:23.070> taking

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
becomes very simple process of taking

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.010 
becomes very simple process of taking
the<00:05:23.699> sponge<00:05:23.970> dipping<00:05:24.449> it<00:05:24.539> in<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.840> ink

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the sponge dipping it in the ink

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.890 
the sponge dipping it in the ink
learning<00:05:25.740> it<00:05:25.889> dry<00:05:26.159> and<00:05:26.580> suddenly<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.659> have

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
learning it dry and suddenly you have

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.950 
learning it dry and suddenly you have
this<00:05:28.110> an<00:05:29.870> electrode<00:05:30.870> structure<00:05:32.960> sitting

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
this an electrode structure sitting

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.570 
this an electrode structure sitting
there<00:05:34.139> already<00:05:34.680> made<00:05:34.979> for<00:05:35.159> you<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.490> the

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
there already made for you so the

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.640 
there already made for you so the
battery<00:05:35.880> becomes<00:05:36.210> really<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:36.960> piece<00:05:37.229> of<00:05:37.380> cake

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
battery becomes really a piece of cake

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.860 
battery becomes really a piece of cake
yes<00:05:38.039> of<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.310> sheet<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.490> metal<00:05:38.729> some<00:05:39.539> kind<00:05:39.750> of

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
yes of a sheet of metal some kind of

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.960 
yes of a sheet of metal some kind of
metal<00:05:40.139> that<00:05:40.260> will<00:05:40.409> rust<00:05:40.680> aluminium<00:05:41.669> is<00:05:41.760> really

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
metal that will rust aluminium is really

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.730 
metal that will rust aluminium is really
cool<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.389> think<00:05:42.449> it<00:05:42.870> will<00:05:42.960> be<00:05:43.110> better

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
cool I think it will be better

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.550 
cool I think it will be better
I'll<00:05:44.400> add<00:05:44.729> vo<00:05:44.909> care<00:05:45.300> you<00:05:45.840> stick<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.080> separator

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
I'll add vo care you stick a separator

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.040 
I'll add vo care you stick a separator
on<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.919> and<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.789> separator<00:05:48.300> is<00:05:48.479> again<00:05:48.780> a<00:05:48.810> really

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
on it and a separator is again a really

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.719 
on it and a separator is again a really
simple<00:05:49.380> thing<00:05:49.440> but<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.770> kitchen<00:05:50.130> towel<00:05:50.310> will<00:05:50.580> do

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
simple thing but a kitchen towel will do

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:52.640 
simple thing but a kitchen towel will do
it<00:05:50.909> there<00:05:51.300> aren't<00:05:51.479> better<00:05:51.510> separators<00:05:52.409> which

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
it there aren't better separators which

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.770 
it there aren't better separators which
are<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.830> micro<00:05:53.130> porous<00:05:53.570> plastics<00:05:54.570> that

these same principles in them and

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.440 
these same principles in them and
playing<00:06:41.040> around<00:06:41.250> with<00:06:41.550> them<00:06:41.910> is<00:06:42.060> really<00:06:42.270> a

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
playing around with them is really a

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:45.050 
playing around with them is really a
matter<00:06:42.630> of<00:06:42.810> finding<00:06:43.530> somewhere<00:06:44.280> that<00:06:44.460> has<00:06:44.640> the

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
doing it all that sort of stuff I'm

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.480 
doing it all that sort of stuff I'm
safety<00:06:51.720> how<00:06:52.200> safe<00:06:52.500> is<00:06:52.680> it<00:06:52.710> going<00:06:52.950> to<00:06:53.040> be<00:06:53.130> all

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
safety how safe is it going to be all

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.010 
safety how safe is it going to be all
that<00:06:53.550> sort<00:06:54.060> of<00:06:54.150> stuff<00:06:54.390> is<00:06:54.510> going<00:06:54.690> to<00:06:54.750> come<00:06:54.870> into

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
that sort of stuff is going to come into

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.270 
that sort of stuff is going to come into
play<00:06:55.140> when<00:06:55.440> you're<00:06:55.590> locking<00:06:55.740> your<00:06:55.920> batteries

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
play when you're locking your batteries

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.200 
play when you're locking your batteries
but<00:06:56.460> essentially<00:06:56.850> that's<00:06:57.060> it

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.210 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.390 

so<00:07:02.210> some<00:07:02.540> of<00:07:02.570> the<00:07:02.690> problems<00:07:03.110> with<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:03.770> the

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
so some of the problems with it and the

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400 
so some of the problems with it and the
egg<00:07:04.520> that<00:07:04.790> I<00:07:04.850> put<00:07:05.150> onto<00:07:05.480> the<00:07:05.600> sponge<00:07:05.870> isn't

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
egg that I put onto the sponge isn't

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.260 
egg that I put onto the sponge isn't
actually<00:07:06.740> waterproof<00:07:07.100> it's<00:07:07.520> a<00:07:07.580> water<00:07:07.760> soluble

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270 
actually waterproof it's a water soluble

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.330 
actually waterproof it's a water soluble
ink<00:07:08.450> so<00:07:09.050> when<00:07:09.170> we<00:07:09.260> pour<00:07:09.440> the<00:07:09.590> electrolyte<00:07:10.100> on

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
ink so when we pour the electrolyte on

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.550 
ink so when we pour the electrolyte on
which<00:07:10.520> is<00:07:10.670> in<00:07:10.820> case<00:07:11.030> just<00:07:11.300> salt<00:07:11.510> water<00:07:11.780> it<00:07:12.290> does

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
which is in case just salt water it does

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.470 
which is in case just salt water it does
actually<00:07:12.710> wash<00:07:13.070> the<00:07:13.310> ink<00:07:13.490> gradually<00:07:14.150> off<00:07:14.270> the

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:14.480 
actually wash the ink gradually off the

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.850 
actually wash the ink gradually off the
sponge<00:07:14.690> and<00:07:15.080> obviously<00:07:15.380> that's<00:07:15.560> not<00:07:15.710> very

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
sponge and obviously that's not very

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.160 
sponge and obviously that's not very
good<00:07:16.220> now<00:07:16.730> I<00:07:16.760> do<00:07:16.910> have<00:07:17.390> a<00:07:17.420> water<00:07:17.780> proof

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
good now I do have a water proof

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.380 
good now I do have a water proof
conductive<00:07:18.770> ink<00:07:18.980> it's<00:07:19.460> just<00:07:19.760> not<00:07:19.940> ready<00:07:20.210> yet

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.390 
conductive ink it's just not ready yet

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.690 
conductive ink it's just not ready yet
which<00:07:21.020> is<00:07:21.050> one<00:07:21.530> of<00:07:21.650> the<00:07:21.740> real<00:07:21.920> reasons<00:07:21.950> for<00:07:22.550> the

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
which is one of the real reasons for the

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.840 
which is one of the real reasons for the
IndieGoGo<00:07:23.360> campaign<00:07:23.630> is<00:07:24.290> to<00:07:24.470> and<00:07:24.850> develop

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:25.850 
IndieGoGo campaign is to and develop

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.390 
IndieGoGo campaign is to and develop
these<00:07:26.030> inks<00:07:26.630> for<00:07:27.080> all<00:07:27.260> these<00:07:27.470> kind<00:07:27.740> of<00:07:27.860> uses<00:07:28.220> so

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
these inks for all these kind of uses so

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.820 
these inks for all these kind of uses so
I've<00:07:28.700> got<00:07:29.120> a<00:07:29.360> waterproofing<00:07:30.050> developed<00:07:30.680> I

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:30.830 
I've got a waterproofing developed I

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.230
