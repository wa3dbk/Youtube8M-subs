00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.940
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.910
 my new tutorial and indeed it works 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.990
 today about how you use your ps3 controller 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 on your windows pc connects that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.210
 then it is easy to use media 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.010
 then something more complicated there not every one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.900
 game or most games 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.630
 do not support the ps3 controller 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.099
 but only the xbox 360 controller 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 Of course, then go any 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 logitech or other but most 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 support mainly 360 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.940
 I only do that for everyone 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.070
 but you want to recommend you 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 do not buy xbox 360 controllers 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.989
 or the xbox 360 controller 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 on the pc and would rather go to ps3 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.610
 controller use because there also much 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 better with the ps3 controller gets along 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.809
 I can only say as much as that is 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.510
 It is very easy and you too 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 on the one hand a usb cable needs 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.600
 a certain length depending on how 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 wanted to sit near the monitor off the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 is up to you 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.909
 a working ps3 controller i 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.170
 that was so with me, he has it 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.250
 still works on the console 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
 I can not anymore 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 Try it after the program 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.790
 still use it to work there 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.530
 I did not have any ps3 anymore though 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.210
 I still almost a year almost complete 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.020
 new ps3 controller the forest is not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.130
 sell with 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 and that's why I still lie 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.110
 which I am also looking forward to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 example games how to play fifa yes 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 Let's come to the first part 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.880
 probably about how to go to the internet 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:44.640
 need to go to this page www 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.399
 motion injoy dotcoms easy download resp 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.079
 second on the normal pages downloads 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.079
 and then we are already on the side 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:02.969
 and system will do that now too 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 because you can make a difference here 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:11.590
 between 32 bit and between 20 32 bit 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.660
 and 64 bit systems 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.849
 and i have a child of the principle here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.209
 system if in two system have fun 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.300
 again 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.220
 then you have to subject this version 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.190
 we now have 10 64 bit system and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.700
 then we go for 10 and for 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.950
 load and in motion them underneath 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:44.769
 I already have it anyway 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.420
 nice that in motion about it 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.760
 have installed simply and when 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.130
 you did that then that opens 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.410
 Program theme that means then by the way 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.079
 somehow ds3 tool the program what there 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.190
 The motion in the game pad jumps out 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.959
 and to simplify the whole you 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.069
 you just go to language if 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.220
 Do not speak English 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.629
 Mighty are german out of the environment and then 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.549
 but it looks like a lot 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.079
 easier from this no controller 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.660
 therefore not yet included that 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.280
 I should not do that either now 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.299
 should you do it all i will 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.299
 now also do it 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.980
 so now he has this controller here 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.560
 strong on it by shock controller 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.079
 you can also see the ps3 controller users 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.940
 here, however, the manager franz invites you 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.709
 are probably due to lame 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.569
 but you and her are still poor 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.069
 thing these facts have new ones 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.680
 version lick me on the feet 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.599
 this fact still has that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.549
 is installed and only then that 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.810
 you should be shown here then you should 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.169
 but still here in the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.510
 device manager there see here a 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.769
 nice postage pipapo was here you will 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.489
 find only one thing and that in the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.919
 controller 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.139
 click make the witches and then 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.200
 I click on German then write 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:02.829
 you can go back to home and there 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.940
 then you choose here from aix im pott 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.519
 no idea 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.560
 It is an Xbox 360 controller emulator 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.130
 However, her will still be on 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.859
 options and then have something here where her 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.560
 thinks the state wants the deformed 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:20.650
 and l2 and r2 are not yet somehow 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.020
 occupied means, for example, r2 for 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.090
 shoot 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.699
 shooting games in ego or throttle with 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.169
 racing games or sprints in fifa 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.270
 one in the classical class 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.000
 Control style and that's why I should 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:38.560
 here is a stone ax 2 left trigger 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.690
 as these lower keys you take trigger 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.970
 and that's left and right there 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:49.690
 force the led and rheydt trigger bl 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.479
 two electricians and 23 carriers and the 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.259
 rest should already be correct 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:58.840
 be adjusted and then that fits 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.389
 leave page after doing that 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:07.330
 you can take over here too 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:08.229
 make a vibration test and me 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.520
 leave the whole thing now on the table 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.060
 and that you might hear it 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.530
 can and how you hear that works 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.080
 Whole you can still the left and 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.169
 right engine set here the whole 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.659
 still figuring 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.520
 and yes that would be it too 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.060
 the whole of course remains if this 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.919
 minimized phenomenon in the ehinger taste and 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.210
 then works smaller 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.580
 tip still on the edge 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.960
 before you finish this whole I show 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.919
 now also with you that she 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.650
 better explained before her dollar off 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.020
 pull is in the middle of disconnect if 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.150
 It does not do so expensive trawler 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:51.159
 remove continuously after the plug 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.590
 for a new ps3 or if your with 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.509
 he is looking for a room he finds the 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.550
 tradition if that does not notice 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.789
 First, the battery goes from the controller 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.650
 empty after a while and among other things 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:04.000
 costs the whole then also electricity falls 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.669
 Now, for example, just three days 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.620
 mcquaid what hopefully not the case 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.180
 might be because the costs electricity 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.620
 also turns himself into it 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.280
 and my controller is 100 percent 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.930
 loaded 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.400
 no matter how disconnect the controller and 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.500
 attract 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.060
 So it even works nicely 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.110
 is not really looking for it anymore 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.969
 and then disconnect hooters video 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.529
 is now already almost six and a half 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.360
 minutes 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.010
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.540
 if you still have questions you can ask them 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.360
 in the comments 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.740
 important questions are then also calm as 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.350
 private message but I find it only 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:45.790
 which is important otherwise I hope 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:47.410
 that I could help you and yes me 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.180
 of course try more tutorials too 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.740
 I bring everything up possible 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.150
 you'll see a canal then 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.320
 can subscribe to me, for example 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.350
 if you see more of it, as I said 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.810
 I also want and thumb yard 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.900
 rich as a thank you from therefore makes it 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.900
 Well
