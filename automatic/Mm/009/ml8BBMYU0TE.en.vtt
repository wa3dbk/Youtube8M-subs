00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
about the similar computation that we

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.840 
about the similar computation that we
are<00:00:09.349> sponsoring<00:00:09.559> and<00:00:09.950> hosting<00:00:10.280> at<00:00:10.430> the

immediacy<00:00:11.540> this<00:00:12.440> is<00:00:12.560> the<00:00:12.650> robot<00:00:12.800> that<00:00:13.100> we<00:00:13.280> have

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
immediacy this is the robot that we have

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.370 
immediacy this is the robot that we have
developed<00:00:14.060> and<00:00:14.360> brought<00:00:14.540> over<00:00:14.780> here<00:00:15.050> with<00:00:15.200> sub

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.380 
developed and brought over here with sub

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.990 
developed and brought over here with sub
base<00:00:15.620> is<00:00:16.039> used<00:00:16.309> as<00:00:16.490> a<00:00:16.609> create<00:00:17.599> from<00:00:18.470> my<00:00:18.619> robot

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
base is used as a create from my robot

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.950 
base is used as a create from my robot
to<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:20.150> we've<00:00:20.500> attached<00:00:21.500> and<00:00:21.830> I<00:00:22.520> copy<00:00:22.960> would

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
to that we've attached and I copy would

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.609 
to that we've attached and I copy would
that<00:00:24.140> say<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:25.789> club's<00:00:26.029> enough<00:00:26.270> 166<00:00:27.170> megahertz

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
that say the club's enough 166 megahertz

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.099 
that say the club's enough 166 megahertz
we're<00:00:28.310> using<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.789> camera<00:00:29.090> for<00:00:29.720> visual

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
we're using a camera for visual

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.450 
we're using a camera for visual
processing<00:00:30.560> provision<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:33.190> at<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.309> bottom

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
processing provision and at the bottom

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.849 
processing provision and at the bottom
we<00:00:34.699> have<00:00:34.879> I<00:00:35.269> a<00:00:35.300> sensor<00:00:35.809> so<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:35.989> detects<00:00:36.499> color

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
we have I a sensor so that detects color

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.049 
we have I a sensor so that detects color
on<00:00:37.100> the<00:00:37.309> sumo<00:00:38.210> ring<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:39.219> then<00:00:40.219> our<00:00:40.399> 8<00:00:40.609> centers

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
on the sumo ring and then our 8 centers

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.349 
on the sumo ring and then our 8 centers
as<00:00:41.210> well<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.079> these<00:00:42.199> robots<00:00:42.739> will<00:00:43.579> compete<00:00:44.030> on

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
as well so these robots will compete on

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.110 
as well so these robots will compete on
a<00:00:44.389> ring<00:00:44.659> that<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.019> have<00:00:45.289> over<00:00:45.679> here<00:00:45.760> and<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:46.969> let

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
a ring that we have over here and we let

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:56.090 
a ring that we have over here and we let
em<00:00:47.239> push<00:00:47.600> each<00:00:47.870> other<00:00:48.109> out<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.499> the<00:00:48.589> ring

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 

so<00:00:56.579> these<00:00:56.699> robots<00:00:57.149> should<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.390> placed<00:00:57.800> like<00:00:58.800> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so these robots should be placed like so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.420 
so these robots should be placed like so
one<00:00:59.820> here<00:01:00.090> another<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.839> and<00:01:01.160> based<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.309> our

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
one here another here and based on our

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.090 
one here another here and based on our
current<00:01:02.579> CDP<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.290> community<00:01:04.650> technical

preview<00:01:05.309> release<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:06.540> developers<00:01:07.020> are

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
preview release these developers are

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
preview release these developers are
developing<00:01:07.590> software<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.520> compete<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:08.970> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
developing software to compete in this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.870 
developing software to compete in this
game<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.200> idea<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.130> robots<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.580> fight

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
game the idea is the robots will fight

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.149 
game the idea is the robots will fight
like<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> trying<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> push<00:01:13.500> each<00:01:13.680> other<00:01:13.920> out

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
like this trying to push each other out

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
like this trying to push each other out
of<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.640> ring<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> when<00:01:15.539> one<00:01:15.750> goes<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
of the ring and when one goes out of the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.760 
of the ring and when one goes out of the
ring<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> game<00:01:17.340> stops<00:01:17.750> we<00:01:18.750> will<00:01:18.930> run<00:01:19.110> three

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
ring the game stops we will run three

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670 
ring the game stops we will run three
runs<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.940> best<00:01:21.149> will<00:01:21.600> qualify<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
runs and the best will qualify for the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
runs and the best will qualify for the
finals<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.149> will<00:01:24.360> see<00:01:24.960> who<00:01:25.110> wins<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
finals and then we will see who wins the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
finals and then we will see who wins the
the<00:01:26.700> entire<00:01:27.030> event<00:01:27.899> yep<00:01:28.880> wonderful<00:01:30.679> now<00:01:31.679> you
