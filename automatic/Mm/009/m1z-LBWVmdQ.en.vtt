that mount in 95% of the time you cannot
really<00:02:43.239> take<00:02:43.540> them<00:02:43.720> out<00:02:43.900> without<00:02:45.209> having<00:02:46.209> to

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
really take them out without having to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.900 
really take them out without having to
get<00:02:46.690> into<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.560> next<00:02:47.950> step<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.640> will<00:02:48.790> be

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
get into the next step and it will be

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.300 
get into the next step and it will be
cutting<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.420> heads<00:02:49.690> out<00:02:49.900> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.200> Volt's<00:02:51.100> know

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
cutting the heads out of the Volt's know

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.830 
cutting the heads out of the Volt's know
that<00:02:51.549> you<00:02:51.730> will<00:02:51.790> be<00:02:51.940> able<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.390> take<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.690> leave

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
that you will be able to take the leave

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.610 
that you will be able to take the leave
it<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.780> give<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.049> a<00:02:56.110> shot<00:02:56.380> at

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.470 
it out so I'm going to give it a shot at
these<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.070> see<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.370> can<00:02:57.549> get<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
these and see if I can get just the the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.800 
these and see if I can get just the the
bolt<00:02:58.840> out<00:02:59.160> and<00:03:00.160> if<00:03:00.940> not<00:03:01.150> we're<00:03:01.510> just<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.780> to

bolt out and if not we're just going to

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.680 
bolt out and if not we're just going to
get<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.049> dremel<00:03:02.530> with<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> cutting<00:03:03.190> wheel<00:03:03.220> and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
get a dremel with a cutting wheel and

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.670 
get a dremel with a cutting wheel and
or<00:03:05.020> cutting<00:03:05.320> discs<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.360> just<00:03:07.360> can't<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.470> hit

and at the end where we're going to have
53<00:04:14.160> bolts<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.850> there<00:04:15.120> then<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:16.380> need<00:04:16.560> to

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
53 bolts in there then we need to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.060 
53 bolts in there then we need to
eliminate<00:04:18.410> those<00:04:19.410> three<00:04:19.890> right<00:04:20.190> there<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> are

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
eliminate those three right there so are

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.910 
eliminate those three right there so are
we<00:04:23.400> going<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.670> use<00:04:24.270> this<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.870> vice<00:04:25.260> grip<00:04:25.290> and

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
we going to use this a vice grip and

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.080 
we going to use this a vice grip and
just<00:04:26.930> make<00:04:27.930> them<00:04:28.140> come<00:04:28.500> out<00:04:28.680> at<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.760> point

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
just make them come out at that point

you know have to worry about it you just
take<00:04:33.030> them<00:04:33.270> out<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:39.230> pretty<00:04:40.230> much<00:04:40.530> this<00:04:41.400> did

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
take them out and pretty much this did

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.290 
take them out and pretty much this did
you'll<00:04:41.940> be<00:04:42.150> done<00:04:42.450> after<00:04:42.810> that<00:04:43.490> as<00:04:44.490> you<00:04:44.730> can<00:04:44.970> see

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.960 
you'll be done after that as you can see
really<00:04:46.020> cleans<00:04:46.500> out<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.800> look<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:47.610> know<00:04:47.700> be

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
really cleans out the look you know be

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.870 
really cleans out the look you know be
waiting<00:04:48.330> we<00:04:48.630> engine<00:04:49.050> boats<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.640> going

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
waiting we engine boats and it's going

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.390 
waiting we engine boats and it's going
to<00:04:50.970> eliminate<00:04:51.390> the<00:04:51.930> backfiring<00:04:52.620> you<00:04:52.980> get<00:04:53.190> when

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
to eliminate the backfiring you get when

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.610 
to eliminate the backfiring you get when
you<00:04:53.850> get<00:04:53.970> aftermarket<00:04:54.570> parts<00:04:54.840> and<00:04:55.080> that's<00:04:55.440> the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
you get aftermarket parts and that's the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.850 
you get aftermarket parts and that's the
main<00:04:55.950> reason<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.580> take<00:04:56.730> this<00:04:56.940> out

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
main reason to take this out

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.220 
main reason to take this out
eliminating<00:04:59.820> that<00:04:59.970> popping<00:05:00.420> or<00:05:00.540> backfire<00:05:01.020> and

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
eliminating that popping or backfire and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:07.760 
eliminating that popping or backfire and
you<00:05:01.350> get<00:05:02.300> decelerating<00:05:05.390> after<00:05:06.390> that<00:05:06.600> if<00:05:07.320> you

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
you get decelerating after that if you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.290 
you get decelerating after that if you
wanted<00:05:08.340> you<00:05:08.610> could<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:09.300> do<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.230> carp<00:05:10.680> thing

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
wanted you could just do a carp thing

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.570 
wanted you could just do a carp thing
just<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.570> make<00:05:13.380> things<00:05:13.620> even<00:05:13.800> better<00:05:13.950> but

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
just to make things even better but

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.740 
just to make things even better but
pretty<00:05:15.360> much<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:15.510> take<00:05:15.810> those<00:05:15.990> balls<00:05:16.320> out<00:05:16.530> and

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
pretty much you take those balls out and

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.580 
pretty much you take those balls out and
after<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:18.900> you've<00:05:19.110> done<00:05:20.810> comments<00:05:21.810> welcome

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
after that you've done comments welcome
