00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.339
 Hello everyone, today we make a video for 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.519
 a very simple nail art and gel 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:27.489
 own natives 9 simple simple already 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.810
 prepared my tip with the french io 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:41.800
 I made it silver so today I had the d 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:53.350
 silver we hurt then I got it 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:59.320
 a brush along with apple tree the debt of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 black color and let's go then 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.190
 on this side 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:32.530
 the thin full so ok and then them 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.920
 let's do another one a little shorter 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 next to it also here that it joins 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:52.360
 in the corner so the nannies I stay 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:59.040
 doing but good owes me nothing like that 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 always perhaps giving a certain movement 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.190
 I print better on the nail 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 ok 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:15.430
 that way they are out there 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.040
 shot and then you can't see us ok 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:23.980
 11 made will start from the corner is a 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:30.870
 large weight ok then with the spot always with 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:38.980
 black in my face my beautiful dots that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:44.410
 go smaller and smaller and these 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:51.690
 we do great exteriors and then in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:57.630
 increasingly smaller perspective ok 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.630
 let's catalyze 2 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 you have to do it more to recommend 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.530
 I do it fast so you can see 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.120
 because I have to do the video above all 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.820
 here that there is a black 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.620
 I recommend catalizing well well well 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:20.570
 good because uv rays lose fatigue 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.170
 to penetrate they struggle to penetrate the 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.300
 color of dark pigments and I recommend it 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.460
 let it catalyze beautiful beautiful ones 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.610
 beautiful once totaled well well 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:43.720
 well this decoration is very simple 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:43.720
 however, it can be done safely 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.450
 we seal it I'll show you the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:01.540
 result 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:08.060
 here is a tip you can too 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:15.880
 interchange colors do france 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:20.090
 black with silver decoration on one finger e 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.090
 or vice versa so maybe you can 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.500
 make alternate 1 1 silver with decoration 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.620
 black or make 4 of one color and on 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.140
 medium maybe make another color like that 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.270
 it could be even nicer 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.570
 or you can leave them all like this 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.280
 how many to do them only on two fingers like 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.300
 favorite 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:50.110
 this is the final result 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:54.410
 very simple in cute is one thing 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.630
 different from the usual also simple a 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.870
 sometimes can be can be beautiful 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.890
 in short, nothing I greet you and to 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.890
 next video hello
