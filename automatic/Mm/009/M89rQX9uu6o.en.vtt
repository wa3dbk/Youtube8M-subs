I uploaded this video and it really did

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.510 
I uploaded this video and it really did
not<00:02:39.570> meet<00:02:39.900> my<00:02:40.440> expectations<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:41.490> all

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
especially after all the hard work I put

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.280 
especially after all the hard work I put
into<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:43.980> video<00:02:44.400> nothing<00:02:44.760> happened<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
into this video nothing happened but the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.960 
into this video nothing happened but the
beautiful<00:02:46.530> thing<00:02:46.740> about<00:02:46.890> YouTube<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.640> just

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
beautiful thing about YouTube is just

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.910 
beautiful thing about YouTube is just
because<00:02:48.239> if<00:02:48.360> video<00:02:48.660> doesn't<00:02:48.930> go<00:02:49.140> viral<00:02:49.680> just

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because if video doesn't go viral just

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.560 
because if video doesn't go viral just
because<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> video<00:02:50.550> doesn't<00:02:50.760> go<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.450> know

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
because the video doesn't go you know

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.960 
because the video doesn't go you know
get<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> lot<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:51.930> views<00:02:52.290> overnight<00:02:52.970> doesn't

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
get a lot of views overnight doesn't

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.570 
get a lot of views overnight doesn't
mean<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.209> not<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:55.110> in<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.920> future<00:02:56.160> and

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
mean it's not going to in the future and

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030 
mean it's not going to in the future and
that's<00:02:57.330> basically<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:58.260> happened<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.830> me<00:02:59.010> I

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that's basically what happened to me I

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.130 
that's basically what happened to me I
made<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> video<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.600> really<00:03:00.720> didn't<00:03:01.080> get

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
made a video and it really didn't get

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.199 
made a video and it really didn't get
that<00:03:01.320> many<00:03:01.470> views<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.550> first<00:03:02.790> couple<00:03:02.970> of

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
that many views in the first couple of

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.690 
that many views in the first couple of
weeks<00:03:03.270> even<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.870> first<00:03:04.110> couple<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.470> months

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
weeks even the first couple of months

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
weeks even the first couple of months
but<00:03:05.700> sooner<00:03:06.300> or<00:03:06.330> later<00:03:06.480> when<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> surgeries

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
but sooner or later when the surgeries

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.949 
but sooner or later when the surgeries
don't<00:03:08.190> start<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.610> tackle<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.540> made<00:03:09.780> that

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
don't start a tackle and I made that

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.170 
don't start a tackle and I made that
video<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.650> video<00:03:10.920> started<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.700> accumulate

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
video the video started to accumulate

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.259 
video the video started to accumulate
views<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.769> video<00:03:14.100> from<00:03:14.459> two<00:03:14.760> months<00:03:15.000> ago

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
views in that video from two months ago

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.750 
views in that video from two months ago
starting<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.380> very<00:03:16.620> popular<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.519> that's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
starting at very popular and that's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.880 
starting at very popular and that's
something<00:03:18.090> that<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.450> realized<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.110> patients

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
something that I realized that patients

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.490 
something that I realized that patients
really<00:03:20.670> paid<00:03:21.000> off<00:03:21.030> in<00:03:21.269> terms<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.230> video

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
really paid off in terms of that video

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.530 
really paid off in terms of that video
but<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.430> let's<00:03:23.640> start<00:03:23.940> talking<00:03:24.239> about

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
but now let's start talking about

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.090 
but now let's start talking about
something<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:25.080> really<00:03:25.290> really<00:03:25.500> relates<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
something that really really relates to

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.470 
something that really really relates to
the<00:03:26.190> reality<00:03:26.700> check<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.150> was<00:03:27.269> also

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the reality check that I was also

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240 
the reality check that I was also
talking<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.200> there's<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.380> dick<00:03:28.560> conjunction

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
talking about there's a dick conjunction
