just<00:02:08.649> because<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.190> has<00:02:09.370> like<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> 360<00:02:10.540> like

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
just because it has like a 360 like

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.140 
just because it has like a 360 like

than<00:02:14.500> anything<00:02:14.890> I've<00:02:15.100> really<00:02:15.340> seen<00:02:15.520> before

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
than anything I've really seen before

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.720 
than anything I've really seen before
and<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.840> pretty<00:02:17.020> sure<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.590> was<00:02:18.220> never<00:02:18.430> actually

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and I'm pretty sure I was never actually

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.840 
and I'm pretty sure I was never actually
the<00:02:19.090> flood<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> time<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.610> were<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the flood in like the time we were you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.630 
the flood in like the time we were you
playing<00:02:22.060> but<00:02:22.960> I'm<00:02:23.170> guessing<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.370> flood

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
playing but I'm guessing that the flood

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.550 
playing but I'm guessing that the flood
may<00:02:25.150> have<00:02:25.420> some<00:02:25.630> kind<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:25.840> load<00:02:26.110> out<00:02:26.320> or

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
may have some kind of load out or

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.230 
may have some kind of load out or
something<00:02:27.090> when<00:02:28.090> they're<00:02:28.270> spawning<00:02:28.770> because

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
something when they're spawning because

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.570 
something when they're spawning because
this<00:02:31.240> guy<00:02:31.480> willow<00:02:32.080> said<00:02:32.110> has<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> sniper<00:02:33.430> rifle
