00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
working on repetition here and make sure

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.310 
working on repetition here and make sure
you<00:02:14.410> swap<00:02:14.770> out<00:02:14.950> your<00:02:15.100> goalies<00:02:15.520> frequently

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
Ted complexity to this drill you could

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.400 
Ted complexity to this drill you could
put<00:03:29.900> another<00:03:30.170> coach<00:03:30.740> or<00:03:31.070> player<00:03:31.250> at<00:03:31.670> X<00:03:31.910> and

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
actually have a triangular volley making

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.410 
actually have a triangular volley making

keep his eye on the ball at X and that

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.870 
keep his eye on the ball at X and that
