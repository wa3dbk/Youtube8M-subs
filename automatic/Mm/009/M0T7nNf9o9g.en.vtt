we offer diverse courses and everything
to<00:00:17.750> do<00:00:17.900> with<00:00:17.930> plants<00:00:18.670> we<00:00:19.670> have<00:00:19.700> a<00:00:20.180> range<00:00:20.480> of

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
to do with plants we have a range of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.050 
to do with plants we have a range of
programs<00:00:21.050> from<00:00:21.440> agriculture<00:00:22.190> to<00:00:22.430> landscape

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
programs from agriculture to landscape

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.420 
programs from agriculture to landscape
design<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:23.570> really<00:00:24.440> it's<00:00:24.619> all<00:00:24.890> plant<00:00:25.220> based

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
design and really it's all plant based

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.340 
design and really it's all plant based
so<00:00:25.730> it's<00:00:25.940> the<00:00:26.060> microorganisms<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:26.960> affect

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
so it's the microorganisms that affect

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.439 
so it's the microorganisms that affect
plants<00:00:27.830> and<00:00:27.980> then<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.190> breeding<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:29.029> plants

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
plants and then the breeding of plants

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.510 
plants and then the breeding of plants
and<00:00:29.600> really<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.529> placement<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.070> plants<00:00:31.400> in

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
and really the placement of plants in

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.569 
and really the placement of plants in
the<00:00:31.580> landscape<00:00:32.500> my<00:00:33.500> favorite<00:00:33.920> aspect<00:00:34.340> of<00:00:34.519> the

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the landscape my favorite aspect of the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.639 
the landscape my favorite aspect of the
department<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.449> that<00:00:35.479> it's<00:00:35.960> very<00:00:36.440> different

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
department is that it's very different

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
looking at how can we be more

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.590 
looking at how can we be more
sustainable<00:00:46.159> as<00:00:46.609> a<00:00:46.699> society<00:00:47.210> whether<00:00:47.389> it's

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
sustainable as a society whether it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.319 
sustainable as a society whether it's
transportation<00:00:48.460> stormwater<00:00:49.460> management<00:00:49.639> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329
