custom path in PowerPoint we're going to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.560 
custom path in PowerPoint we're going to
animate<00:03:26.520> this<00:03:26.730> soccer<00:03:27.060> ball

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
animate this soccer ball

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.870 
animate this soccer ball
so<00:03:27.990> we'll<00:03:28.140> click<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.620> select<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> then

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
so we'll click it to select it and then

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.610 
so we'll click it to select it and then
move<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.330> mouse<00:03:30.510> over<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> custom

the<00:03:34.860> effect<00:03:35.220> we're<00:03:35.370> adding<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.000> motion<00:03:36.450> path

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
the effect we're adding is a motion path

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.750 
the effect we're adding is a motion path
so<00:03:37.320> we'll<00:03:37.470> select<00:03:37.650> motion<00:03:38.070> path<00:03:38.430> from<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
so we'll select motion path from the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.420 
so we'll select motion path from the
list<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.030> commands<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.660> choose<00:03:40.350> draw<00:03:40.770> custom

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
path the one we're going to select is

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.750 
path the one we're going to select is
scribble<00:03:44.370> which<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.060> an<00:03:45.180> open-ended<00:03:46.020> path

scribble which is an open-ended path

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.340 
scribble which is an open-ended path
after<00:03:47.760> we<00:03:47.850> select<00:03:48.060> scribble<00:03:48.630> you'll<00:03:49.140> note

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
after we select scribble you'll note

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.350 
after we select scribble you'll note
that<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.680> mouse<00:03:49.830> pointer<00:03:49.860> becomes<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.940> pencil

to start the path and then draw down and

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.960 
to start the path and then draw down and
up<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.140> case<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:59.130> create<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.550> simulation
