age group or it's not how fast or strong
you<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.600> finish<00:00:40.079> by<00:00:40.620> having

enough<00:00:41.610> endurance<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.840> I've<00:00:43.050> been<00:00:43.320> able

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
enough endurance because I've been able

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
enough endurance because I've been able
to<00:00:43.649> pass<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> younger<00:00:45.239> guys<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> run

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to pass a lot of younger guys on the run

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
to pass a lot of younger guys on the run
at<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> end<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.190> were<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
at the end because they were all out of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
at the end because they were all out of
gas<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.390> think<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> main<00:00:49.200> reason<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.860> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
gas I think the main reason that I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.389 
gas I think the main reason that I
became<00:00:50.340> popular<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.289> never<00:00:52.500> said<00:00:52.949> no<00:00:53.160> even

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
became popular was I never said no even

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.910 
became popular was I never said no even
if<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.730> seemed<00:00:53.940> impossible<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:55.050> then<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.710> had

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
if it seemed impossible and then you had

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
if it seemed impossible and then you had
to<00:00:56.160> figure<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.670> how<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> heck<00:00:57.570> you're<00:00:57.750> going

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
to figure out how the heck you're going

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.229 
to figure out how the heck you're going
to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.190> time<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.699> had<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.149> this

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to do it and one time I had to put this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.229 
to do it and one time I had to put this
upright<00:01:00.840> piano<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.399> stage<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> was

kind<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.660> high<00:01:03.809> stage<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.799> was

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kind of a high stage and there was

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190 
kind of a high stage and there was
nobody<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.610> help<00:01:05.760> me<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.900> strong

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
nobody there to help me but I was strong

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
nobody there to help me but I was strong
and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:09.110> put<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.320> there<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.770> haven't<00:01:11.670> retired

and I put it up there I haven't retired

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.100 
and I put it up there I haven't retired

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
because we need the money I'm the only

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.469 
because we need the money I'm the only
one<00:01:16.320> working<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.009> family<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> moment

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
one working in my family at the moment

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
one working in my family at the moment

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
later I'm hoping that it's going to be

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
later I'm hoping that it's going to be
later<00:01:22.560> with<00:01:22.770> me<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:23.700> how

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
later with me because I don't know how

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.179 
later with me because I don't know how
much<00:01:23.970> longer<00:01:24.030> I'm<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.680> provide

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
much longer I'm gonna have to provide

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
much longer I'm gonna have to provide
for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> families<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.450> I'll<00:01:27.930> make

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
for the families I think I'll make

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
for the families I think I'll make
myself<00:01:28.439> available<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.880> ninety<00:01:30.270> which

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
myself available what I'm ninety which

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
myself available what I'm ninety which
would<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.650> four<00:01:31.979> years<00:01:32.159> from<00:01:32.430> now

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
would be about four years from now

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.999 
would be about four years from now
because<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.119> turn<00:01:33.420> 86<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> don't<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.890> my

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
because I just turn 86 I don't think my

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.819 
because I just turn 86 I don't think my
age<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:36.119> affected<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.200> quality<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.710> my

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
age has affected the quality of my

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.190 
age has affected the quality of my
cooking<00:01:38.220> pedal<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> may<00:01:39.420> take<00:01:39.990> me<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
cooking pedal but it may take me a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.410 
cooking pedal but it may take me a
little<00:01:40.380> longer<00:01:40.759> it's<00:01:41.759> important<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
little longer it's important to have a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.350 
little longer it's important to have a
positive<00:01:42.869> attitude<00:01:43.290> even<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.340> situation<00:01:45.210> that

positive attitude even if situation that

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.740 
positive attitude even if situation that
you're<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you're in

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.789 
you're in
