show you the homemade rack and made from
a<00:00:05.040> motorcycle<00:00:16.250> okay<00:00:17.250> so<00:00:17.310> we're<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> take

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
a motorcycle okay so we're going to take

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.820 
a motorcycle okay so we're going to take
a<00:00:18.029> look<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> rack<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:19.020> made<00:00:19.140> from<00:00:19.350> my

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
a look at the rack and made from my

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.519 
a look at the rack and made from my
motorcycle<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.630> made<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.050> various

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
motorcycle this was made of various

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.120 
motorcycle this was made of various
metal<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.369> tubing<00:00:23.760> stuff<00:00:24.119> that<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.330> had<00:00:24.510> around

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
metal and tubing stuff that I had around

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.779 
metal and tubing stuff that I had around
this<00:00:26.130> outer<00:00:26.430> perimeter<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.630> frame<00:00:27.960> is

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
this outer perimeter of the frame is

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.519 
this outer perimeter of the frame is
electrical<00:00:29.789> conduit<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.900> half<00:00:31.050> inch<00:00:31.289> or

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
electrical conduit I think half inch or

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.760 
electrical conduit I think half inch or
whatever<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.520> call<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.260> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> also<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
whatever they call it this is also a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.459 
whatever they call it this is also a
conduit<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> rod<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.320> just

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
conduit here this is a rod so it's just

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.400 
conduit here this is a rod so it's just
whatever<00:00:37.739> kind<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.190> stuff<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> had<00:00:38.850> around

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
whatever kind of stuff that I had around

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.930 
whatever kind of stuff that I had around
it<00:00:40.410> was<00:00:40.710> welded<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.590> $89<00:00:43.940> Harbor

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
it was welded up with a $89 Harbor

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.709 
it was welded up with a $89 Harbor
Freight<00:00:45.180> flux<00:00:45.660> core<00:00:45.930> mig<00:00:46.260> welder<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:48.450> was

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
Freight flux core mig welder it was

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
Freight flux core mig welder it was
suited<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> job<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> did<00:00:50.670> fine<00:00:51.949> as<00:00:52.949> far

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
suited for the job so it did fine as far

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
suited for the job so it did fine as far
as<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.520> design<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> rack<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:55.129> supported

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
as the design in the rack it's supported

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.260 
as the design in the rack it's supported
server

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
server

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.689 
server
I<00:00:57.629> guess<00:00:58.410> similar<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.949> lead<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.489> racks

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I guess similar to lead to some racks

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.340 
I guess similar to lead to some racks
that<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.300> had<00:01:00.719> seen

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that I had seen

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
that I had seen
I<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:02.010> just<00:01:02.399> noticed<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:03.170> bolt

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
I actually just noticed this bolt

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
I actually just noticed this bolt
vibrated<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.610> three<00:01:06.479> holes

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
vibrated out but there are three holes

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
vibrated out but there are three holes
along<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.470> support<00:01:08.070> member<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> frame

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
along that support member of the frame

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
along that support member of the frame
so<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.210> just<00:01:09.450> used<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> back<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.070> if

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so I just used the back one of those if

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.550 
so I just used the back one of those if
I<00:01:12.119> were<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.450> do<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> again<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> probably<00:01:13.290> was

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I were to do it again I probably was

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.280 
I were to do it again I probably was
extended<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.369> whole<00:01:14.580> piece<00:01:14.850> along<00:01:15.330> there<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
extended that whole piece along there so

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.219 
extended that whole piece along there so
it<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.920> torsional<00:01:17.990> support<00:01:18.990> for

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
it have a little torsional support for

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.510 
it have a little torsional support for
out<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.290> pretty<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.920> supported

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
out there but it's pretty well supported

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.730 
out there but it's pretty well supported
as<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.810> pretty<00:01:25.110> much<00:01:25.200> hang<00:01:25.500> myself

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
as it is I can pretty much hang myself

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.740 
as it is I can pretty much hang myself
on<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.409> doesn't<00:01:28.409> Bend<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.189> all<00:01:29.369> so

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
on it and it doesn't Bend much at all so

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.569 
on it and it doesn't Bend much at all so
that's<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> front<00:01:31.170> mounting<00:01:31.619> point<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that's the front mounting point and the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
that's the front mounting point and the
back<00:01:32.729> mounting<00:01:33.240> point<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:35.270> right<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
back mounting point is right here and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.399 
back mounting point is right here and
let<00:01:38.159> me<00:01:38.220> show<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:39.000> side<00:01:39.409> from

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
let me show you the other side from

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.969 
let me show you the other side from
underneath<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.140> basically<00:01:43.350> went<00:01:43.860> up

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
underneath here so I basically went up

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.960 
underneath here so I basically went up
to<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.399> rear<00:01:45.360> end<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> frame<00:01:46.110> there<00:01:46.970> where

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
to the rear end of the frame there where

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
to the rear end of the frame there where
that<00:01:48.000> pinches<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> fender<00:01:49.829> bolts<00:01:50.189> on

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that pinches down on the fender bolts on

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.440 
that pinches down on the fender bolts on
and<00:01:50.759> then<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.630> made<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.200> metal<00:01:53.159> plate<00:01:53.939> with

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and then I made that metal plate with

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.109 
and then I made that metal plate with
the<00:01:54.689> two<00:01:55.020> bolts<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> then<00:01:56.640> those

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
the two bolts in it and then those

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.990 
the two bolts in it and then those
pieces<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:57.930> horizontally<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.009> wrought

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
pieces going horizontally is wrought

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
pieces going horizontally is wrought
with<00:02:00.329> threaded<00:02:00.960> holes<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.649> each<00:02:01.799> end<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.399> I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
with threaded holes in each end so I

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.149 
with threaded holes in each end so I
drilled<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> tapped<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:04.439> quarter-twenty

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
drilled and tapped it for quarter-twenty

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.910 
drilled and tapped it for quarter-twenty
bolts<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.969> can

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.240 

there's<00:02:11.920> another<00:02:12.540> plate<00:02:13.540> or<00:02:14.170> whatever<00:02:14.379> that

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
there's another plate or whatever that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.970 
there's another plate or whatever that
extends<00:02:15.910> down<00:02:16.120> from<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.840> rack<00:02:17.379> and<00:02:17.739> that's

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
extends down from the rack and that's

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.170 
extends down from the rack and that's
how<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.310> wilts<00:02:18.580> together

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
how it wilts together

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.449 
how it wilts together
another<00:02:19.629> thing<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:19.989> added<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.709> it<00:02:20.830> was<00:02:21.069> this

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
another thing that added to it was this

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.770 
another thing that added to it was this
tool<00:02:22.150> tube<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.069> was<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.550> piece<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:25.030> metal

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
tool tube so this was a piece of metal

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.809 
tool tube so this was a piece of metal
tubing<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.500> had<00:02:26.739> around<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.370> what<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.580> did

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
tubing that I had around and what I did

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.830 
tubing that I had around and what I did
was<00:02:28.090> add<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.349> these<00:02:29.860> pipe<00:02:30.519> plugs<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.390> ends

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
was add in these pipe plugs to the ends

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.110 
was add in these pipe plugs to the ends
they<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.319> a<00:02:32.349> rubber<00:02:33.310> piece<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> inside

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
they have a rubber piece on the inside

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.750 
they have a rubber piece on the inside
and<00:02:34.720> that<00:02:34.870> as<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.500> two<00:02:35.680> metal<00:02:35.980> pieces<00:02:36.190> squeeze

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
and that as the two metal pieces squeeze

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.940 
and that as the two metal pieces squeeze
the<00:02:37.209> rubber<00:02:37.720> get<00:02:37.989> squished<00:02:38.319> out<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.860> then

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
the rubber get squished out and then

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.020 
the rubber get squished out and then
seals<00:02:39.370> around

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
seals around

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.309 
seals around
so<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:42.310> plugging<00:02:42.880> both<00:02:43.090> atoms<00:02:43.599> right<00:02:44.140> now

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
so that's plugging both atoms right now

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.110 
so that's plugging both atoms right now
ice<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.709> tire<00:02:44.890> irons<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.610> there<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:46.060> not

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
ice and tire irons in there I'm not

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.440 
ice and tire irons in there I'm not
really<00:02:46.560> utilizing<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.459> well<00:02:48.640> we

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
really utilizing it all that well we

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.930 
really utilizing it all that well we
probably<00:02:49.750> should<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.380> put<00:02:50.620> a<00:02:50.650> tire<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
probably should do is put a tire like a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.960 
probably should do is put a tire like a
bicycle<00:02:52.390> tire<00:02:52.569> bump<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.380> there<00:02:53.560> also<00:02:54.549> or

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
bicycle tire bump in there also or

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.150 
bicycle tire bump in there also or
something<00:02:55.329> like<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:56.170> maybe<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.590> two

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
something like that and maybe a two

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.110 
something like that and maybe a two
patch<00:02:57.489> kit<00:02:57.940> I<00:02:58.209> don't<00:02:58.420> know<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.910> that's

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
patch kit I don't know so that's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.900 
patch kit I don't know so that's
basically<00:03:01.660> all<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.470> going<00:03:02.920> on<00:03:03.040> there<00:03:03.370> it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
basically all I have going on there it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.880 
basically all I have going on there it
was<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.420> little<00:03:05.049> bit<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.319> trick<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:05.739> get

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
was a little bit of a trick to get

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.960 
was a little bit of a trick to get
everything<00:03:06.690> get<00:03:07.690> these<00:03:07.989> pieces<00:03:08.829> bent<00:03:09.760> to

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
everything get these pieces bent to

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.160 
everything get these pieces bent to
shape<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.540> used<00:03:11.140> one<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.239> manual<00:03:13.239> conduit

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
shape I used one of the manual conduit

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.500 
shape I used one of the manual conduit
benders<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:15.069> have<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.639> u-shaped<00:03:16.090> hook

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
benders that have just the u-shaped hook

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.319 
benders that have just the u-shaped hook
on<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.870> end<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.380> can<00:03:17.609> bend<00:03:18.609> it<00:03:18.730> over<00:03:19.030> with

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
on the end and you can bend it over with

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.920 
on the end and you can bend it over with
well<00:03:19.660> your<00:03:19.870> foots<00:03:20.109> pressing<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.680> it<00:03:21.630> so<00:03:22.630> it

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
well your foots pressing on it so it

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.680 
well your foots pressing on it so it
took<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.170> few<00:03:23.350> iterations<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:25.600> know

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
took a few iterations of you know

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.240 
took a few iterations of you know
bending<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.319> and<00:03:26.730> laying<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:28.769> on<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:29.950> ground

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.550 

holding<00:03:33.030> out<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.480> bike<00:03:33.660> to<00:03:33.900> finally<00:03:34.320> get

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
holding out to the bike to finally get

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.460 
holding out to the bike to finally get
it<00:03:34.740> to<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.760> right<00:03:35.940> shape

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.820 

and<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.310> didn't<00:03:39.700> make<00:03:39.820> a<00:03:39.850> mistake<00:03:40.830> somewhere

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
and I didn't make a mistake somewhere

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.760 
and I didn't make a mistake somewhere
along<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:43.090> way<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.840> bent<00:03:44.110> it<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.650> a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
along the way and I bent it just a

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.210 
along the way and I bent it just a
little<00:03:44.920> bit<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.250> wrong<00:03:45.400> angle<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> here

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
little bit the wrong angle and so here

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.390 
little bit the wrong angle and so here
there's<00:03:48.490> a<00:03:49.320> weld<00:03:50.320> it<00:03:50.800> kind<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.070> looks<00:03:51.280> like

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
there's a weld it kind of looks like

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.690 
there's a weld it kind of looks like
piece<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.940> bamboo<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.620> cut<00:03:54.070> it<00:03:54.190> there<00:03:54.460> and

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
piece of bamboo but I cut it there and

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.000 
piece of bamboo but I cut it there and
then<00:03:55.210> twisted<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.990> I<00:03:56.200> think<00:03:56.410> it<00:03:56.530> had<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.680> set

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
then twisted it I think it had to set

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.470 
then twisted it I think it had to set
slightly<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.180> wrong<00:03:58.390> angle<00:03:58.920> so<00:04:00.300> yeah<00:04:01.300> overall

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
slightly the wrong angle so yeah overall

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480 
slightly the wrong angle so yeah overall
I'm<00:04:02.020> happy<00:04:02.110> with<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.740> there's<00:04:03.010> nothing

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
I'm happy with it there's nothing

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.670 
I'm happy with it there's nothing
available<00:04:03.670> for<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.600> motorcycle<00:04:04.930> as<00:04:05.410> far<00:04:05.590> as

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
available for this motorcycle as far as

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760 
available for this motorcycle as far as
racks<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:07.570> I<00:04:07.600> kind<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.170> had<00:04:08.320> to<00:04:08.470> do<00:04:08.590> my<00:04:08.740> own

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
racks so I kind of had to do my own

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.640 
racks so I kind of had to do my own
thing<00:04:08.920> if<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.460> want<00:04:09.670> to<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:09.940> a<00:04:09.970> rack<00:04:10.330> on<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.650> I'm

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
thing if I want to have a rack on it I'm

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.760 
thing if I want to have a rack on it I'm
happy<00:04:12.310> with<00:04:12.550> how<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.910> turned<00:04:12.940> out<00:04:13.440> if<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.620> were

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
happy with how it turned out if I were

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.930 
happy with how it turned out if I were
to<00:04:14.980> do<00:04:15.100> it<00:04:15.130> again<00:04:16.380> like<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> said<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.980> was<00:04:18.160> used

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
to do it again like I said it was used

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.900 
to do it again like I said it was used
those<00:04:19.209> three<00:04:19.600> holes<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.370> support<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.549> little

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
those three holes to support it a little

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.570 
those three holes to support it a little
bit<00:04:22.030> better<00:04:22.410> and<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.860> other<00:04:23.980> thing<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.400> would

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
bit better and the other thing I would

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.510 
bit better and the other thing I would
do<00:04:24.730> is<00:04:24.940> make<00:04:25.260> better<00:04:26.260> accommodations<00:04:27.130> for

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
do is make better accommodations for

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.200 
do is make better accommodations for
hanging<00:04:28.480> saddle<00:04:28.930> bags<00:04:29.140> off<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.770> out<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.700> sides

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
hanging saddle bags off it out the sides

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.360 
hanging saddle bags off it out the sides
I<00:04:31.300> know<00:04:31.750> some<00:04:31.960> people<00:04:32.140> do<00:04:32.410> like<00:04:32.680> oval<00:04:34.080> metal

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
I know some people do like oval metal

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.930 
I know some people do like oval metal
rings<00:04:36.370> they're<00:04:37.060> the<00:04:37.630> salvage<00:04:38.560> either<00:04:39.130> connect

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
rings they're the salvage either connect

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.020 
rings they're the salvage either connect
to<00:04:40.120> or<00:04:40.360> just<00:04:40.630> be<00:04:40.780> supported<00:04:41.320> against<00:04:41.890> no<00:04:42.610> you

know<00:04:43.120> I<00:04:43.180> have<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.600> stuff<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.140> can<00:04:44.230> always

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
know I have the stuff so I can always

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.370 
know I have the stuff so I can always
add<00:04:44.890> on<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.520> later<00:04:45.760> but<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.390> just<00:04:46.840> wish<00:04:47.230> I

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
add on to it later but I just wish I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.540 
add on to it later but I just wish I
would<00:04:47.560> have<00:04:47.590> done<00:04:47.770> that<00:04:47.919> right<00:04:48.130> off<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.340> bat

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
would have done that right off the bat

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.700 
would have done that right off the bat
I'll<00:04:49.030> probably<00:04:49.240> have<00:04:49.510> to<00:04:49.660> move<00:04:50.350> the<00:04:50.530> turn

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
I'll probably have to move the turn

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.210 
I'll probably have to move the turn
signals<00:04:51.250> out<00:04:51.640> back<00:04:51.910> next<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.140> tail<00:04:53.950> light

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
signals out back next to the tail light

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.540 
signals out back next to the tail light
too<00:04:54.490> but<00:04:55.030> whatever<00:04:55.990> we'll<00:04:56.230> we'll<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.650> how<00:04:57.010> all

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
too but whatever we'll we'll see how all

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.220 
too but whatever we'll we'll see how all
that<00:04:57.610> comes<00:04:58.090> along<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:59.520> do<00:05:00.520> have<00:05:00.700> this<00:05:00.940> mesh<00:05:01.690> net

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
that comes along I do have this mesh net

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.640 
that comes along I do have this mesh net
that<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.560> typically<00:05:03.280> keep<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:05.169> put

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
that I typically keep on it and I put

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.060 
that I typically keep on it and I put
these<00:05:05.950> little<00:05:06.820> nubs<00:05:07.720> on<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.290> bottom<00:05:08.650> to

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
these little nubs on the bottom to

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.050 
these little nubs on the bottom to
provide<00:05:10.830> somewhere<00:05:11.830> for<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.190> hook<00:05:12.400> again<00:05:12.730> so<00:05:12.970> I

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
provide somewhere for to hook again so I

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.330 
provide somewhere for to hook again so I
can<00:05:13.270> hook<00:05:13.870> it<00:05:14.050> wherever<00:05:14.260> I<00:05:14.470> want<00:05:14.500> along<00:05:15.130> there

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
can hook it wherever I want along there

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.200 
can hook it wherever I want along there
I<00:05:15.370> think<00:05:15.760> I<00:05:15.880> have<00:05:16.000> four<00:05:16.810> nubs<00:05:17.080> along<00:05:17.470> there<00:05:17.770> and

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
I think I have four nubs along there and

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.690 
I think I have four nubs along there and
it's<00:05:19.210> actually<00:05:19.780> the<00:05:20.620> rack<00:05:20.860> isn't<00:05:21.250> quite<00:05:21.490> big

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
it's actually the rack isn't quite big

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.270 
it's actually the rack isn't quite big
enough<00:05:21.730> for<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:23.050> net<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.560> by<00:05:23.710> itself<00:05:24.010> so

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
enough for the net just by itself so

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.070 
enough for the net just by itself so
usually<00:05:24.669> end<00:05:24.790> up<00:05:24.940> looking<00:05:25.300> at<00:05:25.419> down<00:05:25.660> here<00:05:25.690> or

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
usually end up looking at down here or

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.260 
usually end up looking at down here or
something<00:05:26.470> like<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:26.710> when<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.280> release<00:05:28.090> plan

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
something like that when I release plan

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.940 
something like that when I release plan
nothing<00:05:28.540> under<00:05:29.380> the<00:05:29.560> nut<00:05:31.410> so<00:05:32.410> yeah<00:05:32.710> that's

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
nothing under the nut so yeah that's

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.360 
nothing under the nut so yeah that's
basically<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:34.300> rack<00:05:34.540> in<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.870> nutshell<00:05:35.160> if<00:05:36.160> you

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
basically the rack in a nutshell if you

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.240 
basically the rack in a nutshell if you
have<00:05:36.490> a<00:05:36.520> bike<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.480> they<00:05:38.410> don't<00:05:38.620> make<00:05:38.830> racks

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
have a bike that they don't make racks

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.620 
have a bike that they don't make racks
for<00:05:39.550> anymore<00:05:40.030> like<00:05:40.270> this<00:05:40.480> one<00:05:40.950> I<00:05:42.060> guess<00:05:43.060> you

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
for anymore like this one I guess you

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.840 
for anymore like this one I guess you
know<00:05:43.720> give<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.140> a<00:05:44.230> shot<00:05:44.440> even<00:05:45.190> if<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.520> do<00:05:45.640> it's

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
know give it a shot even if you do it's

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.110 
know give it a shot even if you do it's
a<00:05:46.090> fun<00:05:46.600> project<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:47.440> was<00:05:48.220> fairly

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
a fun project it was fairly

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.620 
a fun project it was fairly
time-consuming<00:05:49.510> because

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
time-consuming because

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.620 
time-consuming because
mean<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:51.470> know<00:05:51.850> welding<00:05:52.850> out<00:05:52.970> various<00:05:53.390> pieces

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
mean you know welding out various pieces

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.909 
mean you know welding out various pieces
test-fitting<00:05:54.620> it

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.189 

and<00:05:57.159> then<00:05:58.020> painting<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.169> -<00:06:00.389> I<00:06:01.389> probably<00:06:01.960> had

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
and then painting it - I probably had

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.369 
and then painting it - I probably had
two<00:06:02.469> weekends<00:06:02.979> into<00:06:03.280> it<00:06:03.629> but<00:06:04.629> you<00:06:05.020> know<00:06:05.139> it<00:06:05.259> was

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
two weekends into it but you know it was

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.489 
two weekends into it but you know it was
