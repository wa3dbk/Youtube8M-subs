the year it produces seed heads like the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.850 
the year it produces seed heads like the
triticale<00:00:33.910> we've<00:00:34.570> got<00:00:34.780> kale<00:00:35.079> in<00:00:35.380> here<00:00:35.680> that

triticale we've got kale in here that

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.010 
triticale we've got kale in here that
which<00:00:35.950> produces<00:00:36.490> a<00:00:36.550> seed<00:00:36.850> as<00:00:37.090> well<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.870> that's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
which produces a seed as well and that's

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.530 
which produces a seed as well and that's
all<00:00:38.380> great<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.070> the<00:00:39.550> finches<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.060> a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
all great for the the finches and a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.950 
into here and feed into this this crop
will<00:00:46.840> then<00:00:47.050> go<00:00:47.590> on<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:48.070> year<00:00:48.640> later<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.570> it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
will then go on a year later and it

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.050 
will then go on a year later and it
stands<00:00:50.350> as<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.860> lot<00:00:51.040> taller<00:00:51.340> crop<00:00:51.640> something

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.060 
stands as a lot taller crop something

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.460 
stands as a lot taller crop something
like<00:00:52.210> this<00:00:52.420> that<00:00:52.630> I<00:00:52.660> can<00:00:52.720> show<00:00:52.990> you<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.290> bit

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
like this that I can show you this a bit

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.690 
like this that I can show you this a bit
later<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:57.450> rotated<00:00:58.450> every<00:00:58.660> 2<00:00:59.470> years<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.550> if

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
later it's rotated every 2 years but if

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.670 
later it's rotated every 2 years but if
it<00:01:00.850> lasts<00:01:01.090> long<00:01:01.510> enough<00:01:01.750> we<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:02.140> rotate<00:01:02.320> it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
it lasts long enough we can rotate it

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.640 
it lasts long enough we can rotate it
every<00:01:03.220> third<00:01:03.520> year<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.900> crop<00:01:08.080> was<00:01:08.260> standing

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
every third year the crop was standing

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.120 
every third year the crop was standing
in<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:08.980> this<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.460> called<00:01:09.670> chicory<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.100> a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
in now this is called chicory this is a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.030 
in now this is called chicory this is a
follow-on<00:01:13.030> from<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.630> previous<00:01:14.110> crop<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.800> saw

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
follow-on from the previous crop you saw

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.590 
follow-on from the previous crop you saw
me<00:01:15.220> in<00:01:15.340> which<00:01:15.520> has<00:01:15.670> got<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.940> mustard<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
me in which has got the mustard and

me in which has got the mustard and
there<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.860> triticale<00:01:18.520> Ian<00:01:18.760> that<00:01:19.090> were

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
there and the triticale Ian that were

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.750 
there and the triticale Ian that were
feeding<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:20.110> birds<00:01:20.320> through<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.740> winter<00:01:21.159> so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
feeding the birds through the winter so

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.920 
feeding the birds through the winter so
this<00:01:22.360> was<00:01:22.600> drilled<00:01:23.050> a<00:01:23.440> year<00:01:24.280> last<00:01:24.580> May<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.600> now

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
this was drilled a year last May and now

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.890 
this was drilled a year last May and now
it<00:01:26.350> runs<00:01:26.650> into<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.010> crop<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.460> this<00:01:27.640> height<00:01:27.909> this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
it runs into a crop of this height this

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.260 
it runs into a crop of this height this
produces<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.860> lovely<00:01:30.340> blue<00:01:30.490> flowers<00:01:30.820> which

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
produces the lovely blue flowers which

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.120 
produces the lovely blue flowers which
creates<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.720> bit<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:31.960> seed<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.560> then<00:01:32.979> these

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
creates a bit of seed and then these

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.760 
creates a bit of seed and then these
feed<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> finches<00:01:34.030> later<00:01:34.450> in

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
feed the finches later in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.530 
feed the finches later in

november/december time the idea of this
cooked<00:01:37.870> walkway<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.650> I've<00:01:38.770> done<00:01:38.920> through

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
cooked walkway that I've done through

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.630 
cooked walkway that I've done through
here<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> gray<00:01:41.650> partridges<00:01:42.340> that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
here is for the gray partridges that

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640 
here is for the gray partridges that
have<00:01:42.850> been<00:01:43.060> hopefully<00:01:43.750> been<00:01:43.930> nesting<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.470> here

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
have been hopefully been nesting in here

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.039 
have been hopefully been nesting in here
this<00:01:44.800> year<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:45.940> gives<00:01:46.240> them<00:01:46.330> an<00:01:46.450> area<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
this year this gives them an area of

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.140 
this year this gives them an area of
clean<00:01:47.590> ground<00:01:47.860> for<00:01:48.190> them<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.520> come<00:01:48.700> out<00:01:48.850> and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
clean ground for them to come out and

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.539 
clean ground for them to come out and
dust<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.049> then<00:01:50.500> they<00:01:50.950> can<00:01:51.070> go<00:01:51.190> back<00:01:51.340> into

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
dust on and then they can go back into

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.300 
dust on and then they can go back into
the<00:01:51.760> rough<00:01:51.940> into<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.479> cover<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.080> then<00:01:53.740> that

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
the rough into the cover and then that

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.130 
the rough into the cover and then that
protects<00:01:54.700> them<00:01:54.940> from<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.390> sparrowhawks

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
protects them from the sparrowhawks

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.870 
protects them from the sparrowhawks
a<00:01:56.260> biggest<00:01:56.950> problem<00:01:57.220> with<00:01:57.310> having<00:01:57.430> our<00:01:57.670> grey

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
a biggest problem with having our grey

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.000 
a biggest problem with having our grey
partridges<00:01:58.479> is<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.229> an<00:01:59.350> increase<00:01:59.770> of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
partridges is we have an increase of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.219 
partridges is we have an increase of
sparrowhawks<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:01.000> kestrels<00:02:01.720> and<00:02:01.840> whatever

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
sparrowhawks and kestrels and whatever

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.280 
sparrowhawks and kestrels and whatever
so<00:02:02.650> as<00:02:03.610> we<00:02:03.820> can't<00:02:04.060> control<00:02:04.360> those<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.200> to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
so as we can't control those we have to

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.140 
so as we can't control those we have to
try<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:05.560> make<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.979> habitat<00:02:06.400> as<00:02:06.549> beneficial

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
try and make the habitat as beneficial

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.499 
try and make the habitat as beneficial
for<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.479> grey<00:02:07.630> partridge<00:02:08.110> as<00:02:08.560> we<00:02:08.799> can<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
for the grey partridge as we can this

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.170 
for the grey partridge as we can this
cover<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.049> chicory<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.980> will<00:02:12.219> stop<00:02:12.579> this
