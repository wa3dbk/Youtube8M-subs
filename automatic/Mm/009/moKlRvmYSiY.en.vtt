on the rapture well maybe I can change
your<00:00:19.470> mind<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.510> think<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
your mind on that I think it's a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.800 
your mind on that I think it's a
deception<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.550> theory<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.119> how<00:00:24.480> people

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
deception and a theory on how people

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.920 
deception and a theory on how people
interpret<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.710> Bible<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.939> makes<00:00:27.240> no<00:00:27.330> sense<00:00:27.480> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
interpret the Bible it makes no sense to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.759 
interpret the Bible it makes no sense to
me<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.590> nor<00:00:29.010> ever<00:00:29.250> will<00:00:29.840> what<00:00:30.840> happens<00:00:31.349> to

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
me at all nor ever will what happens to

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.580 
me at all nor ever will what happens to
the<00:00:31.859> plane<00:00:32.189> filled<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.180> families<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the plane filled with families if the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.760 
the plane filled with families if the
pilots<00:00:35.130> both<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.969> raptured<00:00:36.590> okay<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> think

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
pilots both get raptured okay I think

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.940 
pilots both get raptured okay I think
this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> very<00:00:38.670> good<00:00:39.030> question<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this is a very good question and if you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.030 
this is a very good question and if you
watch<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.700> left<00:00:41.969> behind<00:00:42.210> series<00:00:42.620> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
watch the left behind series you know a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
watch the left behind series you know a
major<00:00:44.370> feature<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> there<00:00:45.930> are

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
major feature is that there are

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
major feature is that there are
accidents<00:00:46.350> plane<00:00:47.039> crashes<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.210> on

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
accidents plane crashes and so on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.069 
accidents plane crashes and so on
because<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.590> pilots<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.969> drivers<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
because the pilots or the drivers of the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.459 
because the pilots or the drivers of the
buses<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.800> suddenly<00:00:53.520> raptured<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.350> think<00:00:55.350> if

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
buses are suddenly raptured I think if

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
buses are suddenly raptured I think if
we<00:00:55.620> take<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> look<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.399> scripture<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.270> will<00:00:57.449> see

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
we take a look at scripture we will see

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.310 
we take a look at scripture we will see
that<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.530> necessarily<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> case<00:00:59.699> I

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
that that is not necessarily the case I

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.020 
that that is not necessarily the case I
believe<00:01:01.320> everyone<00:01:01.710> who<00:01:02.070> was<00:01:02.219> raptured<00:01:02.489> will

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
believe everyone who was raptured will

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.800 
believe everyone who was raptured will
be<00:01:03.180> given<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.840> notice<00:01:04.460> beforehand<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.390> Lord

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
be given a notice beforehand by our Lord

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.530 
be given a notice beforehand by our Lord
so<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.710> each<00:01:08.100> person<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.670> get<00:01:09.090> his<00:01:09.360> affairs

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
so that each person can get his affairs

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.890 
so that each person can get his affairs
in<00:01:09.990> order<00:01:10.580> let's<00:01:11.580> look<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.150> Jesus

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in order let's look at how Jesus

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.710 
in order let's look at how Jesus
describes<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.770> rapture<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.369> his<00:01:14.909> parable<00:01:15.540> of
