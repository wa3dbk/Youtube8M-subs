one of the first things I'm going to do
to<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:04.900> because<00:03:05.080> it's<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.350> it's<00:03:05.620> cheap<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> do

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
been have been told it's going to be

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.490 
been have been told it's going to be
about<00:03:36.100> 600<00:03:36.610> pounds<00:03:36.940> for<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.320> because<00:03:38.320> you

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
about 600 pounds for that because you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.400 
about 600 pounds for that because you
need<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.370> get<00:03:39.490> it<00:03:39.580> fitted<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.600> don't<00:03:41.260> think

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
need to get it fitted and I don't think

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.660 
need to get it fitted and I don't think
I'll<00:03:41.560> be<00:03:41.680> able<00:03:41.710> to<00:03:41.860> do<00:03:42.010> it<00:03:42.130> so<00:03:42.250> it's<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> bit<00:03:42.580> of

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
I'll be able to do it so it's a bit of

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.860 
I'll be able to do it so it's a bit of
labor<00:03:42.820> cost<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.300> there<00:03:43.450> as<00:03:43.540> well<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
labor cost in there as well and the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.770 
labor cost in there as well and the
other<00:03:47.350> thing<00:03:47.770> that<00:03:47.800> I<00:03:48.010> like<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.460> do<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:49.270> get<00:03:49.540> the

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
other thing that I like to do is get the

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.170 
other thing that I like to do is get the
license<00:03:50.350> license<00:03:50.860> plate<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.820> put<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.000> on<00:03:52.090> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
license license plate and put it on the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.720 
license license plate and put it on the
side<00:03:52.390> mount<00:03:52.660> right<00:03:52.810> here<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:54.220> there's<00:03:54.550> a<00:03:54.580> bit

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
side mount right here that there's a bit

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.700 
side mount right here that there's a bit
more<00:03:54.850> cost-effective<00:03:55.450> that's<00:03:55.630> about<00:03:55.840> 200

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
more cost-effective that's about 200

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.420 
more cost-effective that's about 200
pounds<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:58.410> I've<00:03:59.410> been<00:03:59.590> weighing<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.950> up<00:04:00.100> I

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
pounds and I've been weighing it up I

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.520 
pounds and I've been weighing it up I
mean<00:04:00.580> what<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:01.390> know<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.780> could<00:04:02.260> get<00:04:02.410> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
mean what you know that I could get the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.600 
mean what you know that I could get the
side<00:04:02.740> mounted<00:04:03.160> plate<00:04:03.400> most<00:04:03.940> quicker<00:04:05.280> but<00:04:06.280> I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
side mounted plate most quicker but I

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.510 
side mounted plate most quicker but I
think<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.450> will<00:04:07.960> wait<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.530> save<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.220> pennies

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
think I will wait and save the pennies

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.220 
think I will wait and save the pennies
and<00:04:09.730> get<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.450> seat<00:04:10.690> because<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:10.960> think<00:04:11.020> that

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
and get the seat because I think that

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.650 
and get the seat because I think that
we'll<00:04:11.320> have<00:04:11.350> more<00:04:11.470> of<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.950> more<00:04:12.670> in<00:04:12.790> effect<00:04:13.180> on

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
we'll have more of a more in effect on

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.860 
we'll have more of a more in effect on
