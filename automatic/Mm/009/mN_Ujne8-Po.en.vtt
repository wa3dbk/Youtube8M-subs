the Meyer

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.160 
the Meyer
now<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.640> Meyer<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> single<00:00:30.630> sword<00:00:30.900> less

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
now the Meyer is a single sword less

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.290 
now the Meyer is a single sword less
than<00:00:31.410> 35<00:00:31.890> damage<00:00:32.309> per<00:00:32.520> hit<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> majority

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
than 35 damage per hit with the majority

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.690 
than 35 damage per hit with the majority
of<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> coming<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.110> slash<00:00:34.410> diamond<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:35.520> also

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of it coming as slash diamond it also

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
of it coming as slash diamond it also
comes<00:00:36.120> with<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> pretty<00:00:36.719> reason<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.290> status

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
comes with a pretty reason for status

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.139 
comes with a pretty reason for status
chance<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.129> 10%

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
chance of 10%

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.299 
chance of 10%
however<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> stat<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:41.040> think

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
however the stat that I really think

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.299 
however the stat that I really think
makes<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.730> weapon<00:00:42.000> awesome<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.440> 1.1

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
makes this weapon awesome is the 1.1

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
makes this weapon awesome is the 1.1
attacks<00:00:44.789> per<00:00:45.000> second<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> weapon<00:00:45.930> comes

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
attacks per second that the weapon comes

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
attacks per second that the weapon comes
with<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.710> standard<00:00:47.280> making<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> fastest

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
with as standard making it the fastest

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.439 
with as standard making it the fastest
attack<00:00:49.379> rate<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> single<00:00:50.969> swords

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
attack rate of any of the single swords

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.900 
attack rate of any of the single swords
in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> game<00:00:52.070> where<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.219> attack<00:00:53.489> speed

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
in the game where this attack speed

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.029 
in the game where this attack speed
really<00:00:54.239> comes<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.750> its<00:00:54.870> own<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really comes into its own is when you

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.709 
really comes into its own is when you
start<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.430> take<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.640> look<00:00:56.760> at<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> stance<00:00:57.480> mods

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
start to take a look at the stance mods

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
start to take a look at the stance mods
for<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> weapons<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.699> fast<00:00:59.969> attack

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
for the weapons and how the fast attack

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.840 
for the weapons and how the fast attack
speed<00:01:00.570> really<00:01:01.140> plays<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.340> strength<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
speed really plays into the strength of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.479 
speed really plays into the strength of
the<00:01:03.270> stances<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.530> there<00:01:04.650> are<00:01:04.769> two<00:01:04.920> stances

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the stances so there are two stances

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
the stances so there are two stances
that<00:01:05.549> are<00:01:05.760> available<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> Meyer<00:01:06.630> Crimson

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
that are available for the Meyer Crimson

horrendously short when compared to the
other<00:01:25.259> stance<00:01:25.700> as<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.909> talked<00:01:27.180> about<00:01:27.420> earlier

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
other stance as I talked about earlier

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
other stance as I talked about earlier
the<00:01:28.500> awesome<00:01:28.979> attack<00:01:29.250> speed<00:01:29.520> means<00:01:29.790> two

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the awesome attack speed means two

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
the awesome attack speed means two
things<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> weapon<00:01:31.079> firstly<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.680> can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
things for the weapon firstly you can

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
things for the weapon firstly you can
put<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.159> sports<00:01:32.520> trike<00:01:32.850> onto<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> weapon<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
put on sports trike onto the weapon and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.960 
not lose a huge amount of that decent
attack<00:01:36.630> speed<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.710> secondly<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.520> lends

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
attack speed and secondly it lends

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.679
