00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 the long-awaited moment has finally arrived and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 I do not mean that he returns to our 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.200
 erasmus girlfriend that sure as well a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.420
 holy while studying outside but that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.250
 finally the witcher 3 comes out after 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.019
 a long wait behind the changes of 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.750
 date and several several the day has arrived 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.000
 and we are going to lie we are very close 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.080
 but very much one thing and not only because 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420
 everything we have seen to date 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 it is amazing that also but because 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.350
 It is also a launch that we are given very 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.330
 good vibrations just need 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 think about the 16 of the times that we 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 will give away for the face as it has to be 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.469
 and what if you cd projekt as you have and then 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.079
 plus two expansions will more so 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.940
 than paying to assure us 30 hours of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.040
 extra game the same as other 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 companies we go but in case he does not 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 you were asking to play 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.690
 widget 3 does not need to have played 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.579
 before the first two titles of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 saga so you can start with this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.719
 directly though if you have played them 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.949
 and you have read the novels 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.309
 you will find children and you will enjoy it more 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.989
 clear but it's not completely necessary 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 but but you have seen the piece of map 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 but what madness is on the map of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.799
 widget 3 so that we get the idea is 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.610
 1.5 times larger than that of gta 5 33 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.100
 bigger than jong's world 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.320
 three times bigger than park 4 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.540
 and 35 times bigger than the sky team 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.100
 that she gives is nothing if this summer does not 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.500
 you can go on vacation by look 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.570
 with me you can piraces some walks 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.200
 the islands sunbathe and show off the torso 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.280
 to get to logan days while you play 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.720
 also that you have all the freedom of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.820
 world to do whatever you please 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.380
 you want to lose a swordship for lope 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.450
 gas that always protecting you and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.520
 dodging and want to go in plan llanero 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.350
 solo 'spin because you go to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.330
 you want to go warn in your box 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.580
 life in the village tavern because what 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.530
 you do that are pixels that nothing happens 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 that your liver will survive what 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.100
 you smell alive is to get into the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.410
 civilian skin because you can take the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.150
 look at the chronicle and how much it leaves 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.979
 how good this widget 3 has in 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.899
 comparison for example with the witcher 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.270
 2 is that the evolution of the difficulty 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.250
 it will be more gradual you do not start to sack every 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.899
 once the opponents are more chung but 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.850
 you are catching the trick while 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.710
 the weapons and the combat modes is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.619
 guys we really appreciate it but 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.390
 the most important the final colophon for 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.340
 what makes you want to spy on this 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.709
 game yes or if I could I went skiing 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.610
 on top of a stuffed unicorn though 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.870
 It is not 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.930
 you can throw whoever you want 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.480
 it is even if you want and you have your 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.160
 we do not like you 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.080
 be happy and do not worry about the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.410
