00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.509
 an interview with one of the beatle s designers 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:27.069
 and the kick off of the presale of decibel 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.279
 last Saturday there is a stentor for tourists with joe spring 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.860
 studios in utrecht completely upside down 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.260
 this edition was all about dion for me, mainly hard steel and at the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.360
 Italian Paul the many musical highlights 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.280
 You can still enjoy it here today because the complete turn is who is online 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.820
 piet toe s.nl and now quickly to the next for this yes on 18 September 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 Jackson Jr. is one of the regular designers of bitos 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.760
 counting bitos is a while over his shoulder and gets to know more about it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.230
 the design process 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.739
 I'm me that a train 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.540
 i work is about working hard working on it in 2006 that i started with 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 for a 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 dts 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 He actually ordered the chair first 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.840
 there I have the parents the spark the flutes campaign image stars dalers 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.180
 and two things get sized 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.990
 that they tackled the first 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 think it was a time to try to get the boy to put out the eod paul for free 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.410
 to create 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.370
 the attack with reason simple means 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.170
 and 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 With certain pressure we are going to create a very interesting kind of visual language 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.870
 if we think that has become a very nice gesture 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.600
 an i am not responsible for the b2s showcase so it must be for it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.950
 ensure that everything 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.050
 on the produced it becomes outside that you thought you were coming from this west 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.070
 certain line 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
 so that very tight after that plan orange 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.630
 the city goes from the competition 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.860
 physically the card 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.990
 traffic from us is still convenient 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.079
 and i am also responsible 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.489
 the btcs campaign images for number of events 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.569
 so wholeheartedly for three years so far 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.679
 tactically cool 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.040
 and on the other 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.569
 events limit abroad 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.730
 i think in of the nice things 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.420
 from a brussels but this one actually stepped very well in advance 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.339
 discuss what we are going to do 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.589
 and put down a global concept 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.870
 and then further elaborate the campaign 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.000
 campaign image 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 to the decoration of the event itself 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.310
 so with hard ps 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.679
 try very much 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.939
 yes to go to the basics it's really about music 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.939
 and just a real statement 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.939
 the oldest part lower 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.639
 but the basis so you have the four teams on very clear who thirteen 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.479
 days employer with colors 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.849
 the and that very hard arrival of coming back to the event itself 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.789
 the city say that to nicer of collaboration close collaboration with 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.319
 know contest 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.609
 the set builders everyone involved 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:18.869
 it's a very good tip 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.549
 Last Saturday was the kick off of the presale for it is he through it 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.249
 village of 2010 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:29.119
 do you want to be sure on August 21 to order through the sound with us? 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.589
 then you quickly draw before it's too late 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:33.489
 retirement the exqi league
