00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
for England and and even as a friend

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.980

lien<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.670> atmosphere<00:02:36.060> was<00:02:36.090> amazing<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
lien the atmosphere was amazing so I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.480 
lien the atmosphere was amazing so I
think<00:02:37.140> when<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.560> comes<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:37.860> world<00:02:38.100> cup<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
think when it comes to a world cup the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.070 
think when it comes to a world cup the
atmosphere<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.240> to<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.390> electric<00:02:39.840> and

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
atmosphere is going to be electric and

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.440 
atmosphere is going to be electric and
so<00:02:40.860> hopefully<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.580> show<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.060> sum<00:02:42.300> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
so hopefully we can show the sum of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.450 
so hopefully we can show the sum of
where<00:02:42.600> they're<00:02:42.720> keeping<00:02:45.770> it's<00:02:46.770> not<00:02:46.890> worth<00:02:47.100> not

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
where they're keeping it's not worth not

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.190
