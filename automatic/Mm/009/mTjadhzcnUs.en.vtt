00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.470
 good i'm sergio save and here we are 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.299
 at the university camilo josÃ© cela with 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.799
 nerea student of activity sciences 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.530
 physical of the sport that will serve us 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.900
 of model for stretches of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.849
 after the marathon we will stretch from the 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.800
 musculature inferior to the superior and 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.450
 from the subsequent to the previous one of this 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.860
 way we favor the venous return and 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.180
 we will have a stretching protocol 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.050
 not to forget any of the groups 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.960
 muscles we will start stretching twin 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.260
 with the leg fully extended the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.059
 sole of the foot resting on the ground 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.280
 we stretch the twin 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.290
 then we will stretch the soleus which is a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.050
 muscle that is closest to 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.760
 the tibia and the fibula also all the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.190
 plant resting on the ground and where before 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.559
 we had placed the tip of the foot 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.440
 we place the heel in this way 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.290
 bringing the knee to the floor 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.990
 we will stretch gm 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.910
 then we will move to stretch muscles 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.030
 hamstring we will start with the biceps 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.560
 femoral leg fully extended and 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.989
 flexion of the lumbar region to 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.820
 perceive the feeling of stretching in 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.030
 the posterior musculature after 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 we will externally rotate the hip 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.729
 for semitendinosus and subsequently 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 we will notice the hip inwards 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.460
 to stretch the semimembranosus 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.860
 we will move to stretch the tensioner of the 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.170
 fascia lata we crossed one leg 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.930
 with respect to the opposite and bending and 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.460
 torsion of the trunk towards the side of the 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.890
 back leg in this way 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.799
 we get to stretch the tensioner of the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.409
 fascia can of the leg that is 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.619
 find in the back plane now 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.720
 we will move to stretch the psoas the two 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.640
 slightly bent legs the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.439
 hip in retroversion and the line of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.890
 shoulders behind the hips to 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:56.299
 stretch the psoas musculature to 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.000
 then we will stretch the adductor the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.060
 two feet in parallel and carrying the weight 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.780
 to locate the stretch in the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.170
 adductor of the companion below 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.599
 we will move to the quadriceps stretch 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.030
 the knee very important when it comes to 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.390
 a muscle and joint that is in a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.610
 flat back to the hip and from behind 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.730
 also of the support leg and the heel 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.250
 goes to the midline of the gluteus and by 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.750
 last we will stretch the pyramid of the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.370
 pelvis 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.140
 for this flexion we will do the leg and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.380
 we will pull the leg towards 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.790
 down to get stretch there the 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.650
 pyramidal of the pelvis 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.420
 remember that each of the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.730
 Stretches should be done 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.920
 for 25 or 30 seconds keeping the 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.109
 position and it is fundamental even if it seems 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.730
 a no-brainer that you perceive the sensation 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:53.069
 of stretching if you do not perceive it 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.069
 it really is not effective is stretching
