the<00:03:13.950> jig<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.400> see<00:03:17.579> how<00:03:17.730> those<00:03:17.910> little

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the jig you can see how those little

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.120 
the jig you can see how those little
windows<00:03:18.359> are<00:03:18.720> going<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.989> give<00:03:19.170> us<00:03:19.470> some<00:03:19.769> areas

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
windows are going to give us some areas

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.780 
windows are going to give us some areas
for<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.459> glue<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.760> squeeze<00:03:21.239> out<00:03:21.510> at<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:23.670> we're

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
for the glue to squeeze out at now we're

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610 
for the glue to squeeze out at now we're
going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.970> wind<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.569> rope<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.139> figure<00:03:25.560> eight

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
pattern make sure you get the loops

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.620 
pattern make sure you get the loops
underneath<00:03:28.980> those<00:03:29.280> nails<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.940> they<00:03:30.090> catch<00:03:30.359> on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
underneath those nails and they catch on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.900 
underneath those nails and they catch on
that<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:34.260> want<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> do<00:03:34.680> two<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.130> three<00:03:35.400> figure
