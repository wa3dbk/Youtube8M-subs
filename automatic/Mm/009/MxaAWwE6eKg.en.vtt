just<00:01:36.430> good<00:01:36.820> enough<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.300> they<00:01:37.420> don't<00:01:37.600> drop<00:01:37.810> out

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990

just good enough so they don't drop out
soon<00:01:38.470> as<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.650> let<00:01:38.770> go<00:01:38.920> of<00:01:38.950> them<00:01:39.479> maybe<00:01:40.479> it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
soon as you let go of them maybe it

you<00:04:29.210> fix<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.900> trailer<00:04:30.169> onto<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.650> tractor<00:04:31.070> it

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
you fix the trailer onto the tractor it

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.070 
you fix the trailer onto the tractor it
is<00:04:31.850> a<00:04:31.880> bit<00:04:32.090> fiddly<00:04:32.300> but<00:04:32.570> once<00:04:32.720> it's<00:04:32.900> pressed

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
is a bit fiddly but once it's pressed

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.070 
is a bit fiddly but once it's pressed
firmly<00:04:33.410> into<00:04:33.680> place<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.130> stays<00:04:34.340> in<00:04:34.550> place<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
firmly into place it stays in place the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.570 
firmly into place it stays in place the
kingpin<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.650> trailer<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:37.160> just<00:04:37.370> drops

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
kingpin of the trailer then just drops

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.540 
kingpin of the trailer then just drops
into<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.000> fifth<00:04:38.300> wheel<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.810> tractor<00:04:39.290> and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
into the fifth wheel on the tractor and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.770 
into the fifth wheel on the tractor and
once<00:04:40.550> it's<00:04:40.729> all<00:04:40.820> joined<00:04:41.090> up<00:04:41.240> is<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:41.419> fairly<00:04:41.690> good

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
once it's all joined up is a fairly good

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.960 
once it's all joined up is a fairly good
connection<00:04:42.440> there's<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.430> good<00:04:43.580> degree<00:04:43.850> of

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
connection there's a good degree of

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.250 
connection there's a good degree of
movement<00:04:44.120> between<00:04:44.450> a<00:04:44.660> tractor<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.200> the

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
right up against the headboard and then

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400 
right up against the headboard and then
as<00:05:07.940> per<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.300> photo<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.720> the<00:05:08.810> model<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.200> put

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
the deck although I'm surprised there's

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.060 
the deck although I'm surprised there's
not<00:05:13.550> more<00:05:13.700> of<00:05:13.940> them<00:05:14.500> then<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.530> can<00:05:15.800> let<00:05:15.950> your

not more of them then you can let your
artistic<00:05:16.400> juices<00:05:17.000> flow<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:17.630> place<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.110> chain

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
artistic juices flow and place the chain

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.140 
artistic juices flow and place the chain
on<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.740> deck<00:05:18.919> in<00:05:19.100> whichever<00:05:19.430> way<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.729> think

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
on the deck in whichever way you think

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.020 
on the deck in whichever way you think
looks<00:05:20.740> interesting

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
looks interesting

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.219 
looks interesting
once<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.210> chains<00:05:23.450> on<00:05:23.630> board<00:05:23.870> you<00:05:23.990> can<00:05:24.110> then

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
once the chains on board you can then

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.200 
once the chains on board you can then
finish<00:05:24.470> off<00:05:24.710> by<00:05:25.039> adding<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.580> remainder<00:05:26.060> of

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
finish off by adding the remainder of

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.560 
finish off by adding the remainder of
the<00:05:26.510> timber<00:05:26.840> box<00:05:27.050> and<00:05:28.150> with<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.270> load<00:05:29.419> on

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
the timber box and with the load on

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.330 
the timber box and with the load on
board<00:05:29.810> it<00:05:29.960> does<00:05:30.110> produce<00:05:30.320> an<00:05:30.710> interesting

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
board it does produce an interesting

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.370 
board it does produce an interesting
looking<00:05:31.610> track<00:05:31.940> but<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.960> trailer<00:05:33.200> is<00:05:33.350> a

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
looking track but the trailer is a

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.960 
looking track but the trailer is a
flatbed<00:05:33.800> so<00:05:33.979> you<00:05:34.070> can<00:05:34.190> put<00:05:34.370> whatever<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.760> like

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
flatbed so you can put whatever you like

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.760 
flatbed so you can put whatever you like
on<00:05:35.180> it<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:35.570> here<00:05:35.810> we'll<00:05:35.960> add<00:05:36.139> a<00:05:36.169> couple<00:05:36.680> of

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
on it so here we'll add a couple of

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.469 
on it so here we'll add a couple of
tower<00:05:37.039> crane<00:05:37.310> sections<00:05:37.760> just<00:05:38.120> for<00:05:38.300> something

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
tower crane sections just for something

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.250 
tower crane sections just for something
different<00:05:38.630> in<00:05:39.760> some<00:05:40.760> way<00:05:40.940> Corgi<00:05:41.360> has<00:05:41.570> as<00:05:41.840> usual

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
different in some way Corgi has as usual

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.050 
different in some way Corgi has as usual
produced<00:05:42.620> a<00:05:42.710> very<00:05:42.860> attractive<00:05:43.160> looking<00:05:43.700> model

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
produced a very attractive looking model

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.969 
produced a very attractive looking model
and<00:05:44.240> although<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.169> is<00:05:45.260> not<00:05:45.380> too<00:05:45.590> much<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:45.889> the

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
and although it is not too much in the

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.040 
and although it is not too much in the
way<00:05:46.099> of<00:05:46.130> working<00:05:46.430> features<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.330> a<00:05:47.570> robustly

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
way of working features it's a robustly

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.960 
way of working features it's a robustly
made<00:05:48.320> model<00:05:48.740> with<00:05:49.039> very<00:05:49.280> good<00:05:49.490> paint<00:05:49.760> and

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
made model with very good paint and

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.210
