budgets<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> iphone<00:01:51.760> left<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.150> right<00:01:52.390> and

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
budgets in the iphone left to right and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.020 
budgets in the iphone left to right and
you<00:01:52.690> accelerate<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.250> screen<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.640> basically

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
you accelerate the screen is basically

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.330 
you accelerate the screen is basically
split<00:01:55.300> have<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.230> left<00:01:56.440> sides<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.740> break<00:01:57.070> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
split have the left sides to break and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.340 
split have the left sides to break and
the<00:01:57.400> right<00:01:57.550> size<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:58.000> accelerate<00:01:58.540> so<00:01:58.660> just<00:01:58.900> to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
the right size to accelerate so just to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.350 
the right size to accelerate so just to
break<00:01:59.590> out<00:01:59.800> put<00:02:00.490> my<00:02:00.610> thumb<00:02:00.880> on<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.030> left<00:02:01.240> side

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
break out put my thumb on the left side

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.090 
break out put my thumb on the left side
into<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.750> celebrator<00:02:02.260> my<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.710> right<00:02:02.860> side
