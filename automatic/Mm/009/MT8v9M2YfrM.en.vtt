00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.500
 good hello everyone in this opportunity 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.990
 I'm going to show you some I'm going to teach 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.320
 how can you visualize networks 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 available 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.040
 surely it has ever happened to them that 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.220
 they are going to open the wireless networks and 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.950
 This little screen comes out, which does not 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.840
 show the available networks 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.220
 this is because a service of the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.600
 windows is in manual mode then what 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 what we have to do in this case of 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.130
 start 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.970
 the option to execute and write service 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.530
 msc let's say accept and what we are going to 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.590
 do in this case is to enter the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.930
 windows services 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.540
 we wait a moment until it opens 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.040
 the window is already the window of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.079
 services 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.870
 let's go to the option 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.120
 what wireless configuration says 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.239
 fast 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.030
 as you see here in the type of start of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.700
 this configuration to america is like 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.710
 the manual start then what we do 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.250
 is to double click 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 and in manual start type we change it 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 automatic 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.280
 we give you started 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.460
 Apply 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 and accept 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 we carry the window 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 and let's see 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.610
 as you see when updating the list of laws 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.910
 already we could links available 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.280
 in this case my laptop connects 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.010
 automatically to the live network that is my 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.230
 access point 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.870
 then as they see in a quick way 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.910
 after enabling the option 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.520
 our to wireless networks 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.520
 available well is this
