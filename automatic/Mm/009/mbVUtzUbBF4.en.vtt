you eat your food your adrenaline goes

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.990 
you eat your food your adrenaline goes
down<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.240> safing<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.380> not<00:01:40.830> viable<00:01:41.220> anymore<00:01:41.580> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
down so safing is not viable anymore and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
down so safing is not viable anymore and
I<00:01:42.450> wasn't<00:01:42.900> saving<00:01:43.080> that<00:01:43.290> much<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.740> video

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
I wasn't saving that much in this video

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.190 
I wasn't saving that much in this video
because<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.880> say<00:01:45.120> if<00:01:45.180> err<00:01:45.420> if<00:01:45.540> anybody<00:01:45.870> saves

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
because if I say if err if anybody saves

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.500 
because if I say if err if anybody saves
then<00:01:46.710> you're<00:01:46.890> not<00:01:46.920> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.550> be<00:01:47.670> able<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.360> get

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
then you're not going to be able to get

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.960 
then you're not going to be able to get
any<00:01:48.660> kills<00:01:48.930> whatsoever<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.700> risk

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
any kills whatsoever so there is risk

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
lose something like that but it really

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.409 
lose something like that but it really
doesn't<00:03:03.870> make<00:03:04.049> much<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.439> difference

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
doesn't make much of a difference

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.759 
doesn't make much of a difference
remember<00:03:06.419> that<00:03:06.569> there<00:03:06.719> are<00:03:06.870> no<00:03:07.049> skulls<00:03:07.439> and

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
remember that there are no skulls and

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.250 
remember that there are no skulls and
you<00:03:08.129> have<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> protect<00:03:08.700> items<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:10.049> can<00:03:10.139> only

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
you have to protect items you can only

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.780 
you have to protect items you can only
protect<00:03:10.530> one<00:03:10.739> item<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.310> would<00:03:11.609> probably

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
protect one item so that would probably

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.149 
protect one item so that would probably
be<00:03:11.939> your<00:03:12.180> weapon<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:13.680> bring<00:03:13.859> your<00:03:13.980> fire
