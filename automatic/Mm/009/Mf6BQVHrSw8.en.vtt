00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.770 

I've<00:00:02.040> developed<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.879> technique<00:00:03.300> for<00:00:03.720> building

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
I've developed a technique for building

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.230 
I've developed a technique for building
really<00:00:04.440> nice<00:00:04.680> poseable<00:00:05.400> hands<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
really nice poseable hands for the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.740 
really nice poseable hands for the
project<00:00:06.629> puppets<00:00:07.080> simple<00:00:07.470> series<00:00:07.830> patterns

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
project puppets simple series patterns

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.450 
project puppets simple series patterns
this<00:00:09.750> would<00:00:09.960> also<00:00:10.110> work<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> forma<00:00:11.130> series

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
this would also work on the forma series

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.400 
this would also work on the forma series
patterns<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.480> cut<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> main<00:00:13.049> palm

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
patterns you just cut the main palm

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.650 
patterns you just cut the main palm
piece<00:00:13.830> out<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.160> foam<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.639> build<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.330> fingers

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
piece out of foam and build the fingers

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.359 
piece out of foam and build the fingers
according<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.440> hand<00:00:16.680> pattern<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.340> that

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
according to the hand pattern for that

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.210 
according to the hand pattern for that
series<00:00:17.910> here<00:00:18.900> I've<00:00:19.020> sketched<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.770> palm

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
series here I've sketched a a palm

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.000 
series here I've sketched a a palm
pattern<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.000> indicated<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> locations<00:00:22.769> for

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
pattern and indicated the locations for

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.349 
pattern and indicated the locations for
the<00:00:23.100> fingers<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.789> wrist

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
the fingers and the wrist

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.839 
the fingers and the wrist
I<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:25.140> get<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> piece<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> half-inch<00:00:26.460> craft

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
I then get a piece of half-inch craft

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.029 
I then get a piece of half-inch craft
foam<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.930> case<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> found<00:00:28.590> some<00:00:28.859> really

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
foam in this case I found some really

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.730 
foam in this case I found some really
cheap<00:00:29.429> garden<00:00:29.970> pads<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.480> Michaels<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.619> I'm

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
cheap garden pads at Michaels so I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.000 
cheap garden pads at Michaels so I'm
using<00:00:31.980> one<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> those<00:00:33.200> there's<00:00:34.200> two<00:00:34.410> sides<00:00:34.649> one

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
using one of those there's two sides one

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.799 
using one of those there's two sides one
smooth<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.000> one's<00:00:36.149> rough<00:00:37.010> textured<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.809> it's

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
smooth and one's rough textured and it's

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.030 
smooth and one's rough textured and it's
dense<00:00:40.290> firm<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.399> very<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.149> lightweight<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
dense firm but very very lightweight I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.850 
dense firm but very very lightweight I
transfer<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.160> pattern<00:00:44.610> onto<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.510> foam<00:00:45.860> using

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
transfer the pattern onto the foam using

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
transfer the pattern onto the foam using
a<00:00:47.100> sharpie<00:00:47.520> marker<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:49.399> I<00:00:50.399> will<00:00:50.730> indicate<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
a sharpie marker and I will indicate the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.229 
a sharpie marker and I will indicate the
location<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> each<00:00:53.129> digit<00:00:53.520> on<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.199> pattern

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
location of each digit on the pattern

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.310 
location of each digit on the pattern
you'll<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.449> where<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> comes<00:00:58.020> into<00:00:58.230> play

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you'll see where this comes into play

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.039 
you'll see where this comes into play
when<00:00:58.770> you're<00:00:58.920> placing<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.120> wire<00:01:01.129> I<00:01:03.049> also

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
when you're placing the the wire I also

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.500 
when you're placing the the wire I also
indicate<00:01:04.470> whether<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.159> left<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
indicate whether it's the left or the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.770 
indicate whether it's the left or the
right<00:01:06.540> hand<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:08.670> course<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.330> flip<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
right hand of course you just flip the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.140 
right hand of course you just flip the
pattern<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.100> opposite<00:01:11.520> hand<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.910 

trace<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.360> pattern<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.869> as<00:01:16.080> well

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.500 

once<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> patterns<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.060> foam<00:01:24.240> I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
once the patterns down on the foam I

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.590 
once the patterns down on the foam I
will<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.110> exacto<00:01:25.650> knife<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.600> start

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
will take an exacto knife and start

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
will take an exacto knife and start
cutting<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.960> shapes<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.440> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.770> foam<00:01:29.220> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
cutting the shapes out of the foam it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.820 
cutting the shapes out of the foam it's
it's<00:01:30.240> pretty<00:01:30.540> dense<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.200> little<00:01:31.409> bit<00:01:31.530> hard<00:01:31.740> to

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
it's pretty dense a little bit hard to

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's pretty dense a little bit hard to
cut<00:01:32.479> it's<00:01:33.479> best<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> start<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> nice<00:01:34.560> sharp

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
cut it's best to start with a nice sharp

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
cut it's best to start with a nice sharp
blade<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.369> eat<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.580> your<00:01:38.729> blades<00:01:39.060> quite

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
blade it will eat up your blades quite

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.520 
blade it will eat up your blades quite
quickly

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
quickly

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
quickly
like<00:01:41.040> most<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.580> phone<00:01:41.759> products<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.420> we

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
like most of the phone products that we

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.200 
like most of the phone products that we
cut<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.259> does<00:01:43.560> chew<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.340> our<00:01:44.909> tools

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
cut out it does chew up our our tools

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.749 
cut out it does chew up our our tools
then<00:01:46.020> I'll<00:01:46.140> finalize<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.890> edges<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> pair

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
then I'll finalize the edges with a pair

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.040 
then I'll finalize the edges with a pair
of<00:01:47.790> scissors<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.210> trimming<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
of scissors just trimming it and

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.370 
of scissors just trimming it and
rounding<00:01:49.440> it<00:01:50.450> once<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.659> finished<00:01:51.840> with<00:01:52.110> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
rounding it once I'm finished with that

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.300 
rounding it once I'm finished with that
I<00:01:53.899> go<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.200> next<00:01:55.410> part<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.979> found<00:01:56.160> this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I go to the next part I found this

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.270 
I go to the next part I found this
flexible<00:01:56.880> garden<00:01:57.390> tie<00:01:57.690> I<00:01:58.080> believe<00:01:58.830> I<00:01:58.860> found<00:01:58.950> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
flexible garden tie I believe I found it

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370 
flexible garden tie I believe I found it
at<00:01:59.399> Target<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.910> was<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.240> cheap<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:01.170> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
at Target it was really cheap it's a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
at Target it was really cheap it's a
wire<00:02:01.710> coated<00:02:02.190> with<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.690> rubber<00:02:03.690> silicone

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
wire coated with a rubber silicone

wire coated with a rubber silicone
rubber<00:02:05.039> very<00:02:05.610> soft<00:02:06.240> flexible<00:02:06.780> coating<00:02:07.380> and

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
rubber very soft flexible coating and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.090 
rubber very soft flexible coating and
I've<00:02:08.789> bend<00:02:09.530> digits.i<00:02:10.530> shapes<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:12.920> cut<00:02:13.920> them

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
I've bend digits.i shapes and cut them

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:24.929 
I've bend digits.i shapes and cut them
out<00:02:14.600> for<00:02:15.600> each<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> digits<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.890> hand

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:24.939 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.050 

next<00:02:25.939> I<00:02:26.060> take<00:02:26.269> a<00:02:26.299> piece<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.840> stiff<00:02:27.739> wire<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.970> I

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
next I take a piece of stiff wire and I

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.470 
next I take a piece of stiff wire and I
use<00:02:29.299> that<00:02:29.510> to<00:02:29.930> poke<00:02:30.530> holes<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:31.159> the<00:02:31.700> proper

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
use that to poke holes in the proper

size piece and you need to work the wire
a<00:02:39.110> little<00:02:39.560> bit<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:40.010> make<00:02:40.430> sure<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.879> holes

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
a little bit to make sure that the holes

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.990 
a little bit to make sure that the holes
are<00:02:41.180> big<00:02:41.360> enough<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.989> take<00:02:42.409> the<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:43.489> digit

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
wires that you'd cut out previously you

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.890 
wires that you'd cut out previously you
start<00:02:51.709> inserting<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.670> wires<00:02:53.090> into<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.720> holes

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
start inserting the wires into the holes

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.800 
start inserting the wires into the holes
and<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:55.310> want<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.579> make<00:02:55.730> sure<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.269> they<00:02:56.629> will

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and you want to make sure that they will

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.550 
and you want to make sure that they will
fit<00:02:57.200> properly<00:02:57.620> with<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.250> fabric<00:02:58.879> pattern<00:02:59.560> so

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
fit properly with the fabric pattern so

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.580 
fit properly with the fabric pattern so
once<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.040> get<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.400> seated<00:03:01.730> I'll<00:03:02.349> grab<00:03:03.349> the

project puppet pattern and make sure

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.839 
project puppet pattern and make sure
that<00:03:06.139> I<00:03:06.349> have<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.739> wire<00:03:06.920> insert<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.579> far

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
that I have the wire insert it far

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.119 
that I have the wire insert it far
enough<00:03:08.030> into<00:03:08.299> the<00:03:08.389> hand<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.709> that<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:09.889> won't<00:03:10.010> be

saw fingers to fill out the fabric and I

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.370 
saw fingers to fill out the fabric and I
use<00:04:16.790> insulation<00:04:17.630> foam<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:18.170> about<00:04:18.350> a

lengthwise in this foam it works really

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:51.310 
lengthwise in this foam it works really
well<00:04:31.340> once<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:31.880> get<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.480> hang<00:04:32.510> of<00:04:32.870> it

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.110 

once<00:04:52.320> each<00:04:52.500> digit<00:04:52.950> is<00:04:53.070> rap<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.550> peel<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.940> paper

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
once each digit is rap I peel the paper

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.900 
once each digit is rap I peel the paper
backing<00:04:54.270> off<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:55.230> I<00:04:55.680> squeeze<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.400> foam<00:04:56.610> down

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
backing off and I squeeze the foam down

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.670 
backing off and I squeeze the foam down
around<00:04:57.240> each<00:04:57.480> wire<00:04:58.460> making<00:04:59.460> sure<00:04:59.730> it's<00:04:59.850> secure

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
around each wire making sure it's secure

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.380 
around each wire making sure it's secure
it<00:05:01.680> only<00:05:01.860> needs<00:05:02.100> to<00:05:02.190> remain<00:05:02.550> in<00:05:02.730> place<00:05:02.880> for<00:05:03.000> the

it only needs to remain in place for the
next<00:05:03.660> couple<00:05:03.870> of<00:05:04.110> couple<00:05:04.590> of<00:05:04.620> minutes<00:05:04.950> you'll

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
next couple of couple of minutes you'll

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:16.790 
next couple of couple of minutes you'll
see<00:05:05.700> as<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:07.500> insert<00:05:07.920> it<00:05:07.950> into<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.580> fabric<00:05:15.800> I've

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
see as I insert it into the fabric I've

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.280 
see as I insert it into the fabric I've
left<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.820> fabric<00:05:18.270> open<00:05:18.630> at<00:05:18.720> the<00:05:18.840> wrist

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
left the fabric open at the wrist

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.140 
left the fabric open at the wrist
I<00:05:19.440> haven't<00:05:19.950> sewn<00:05:20.160> beyond<00:05:20.460> that<00:05:20.640> point<00:05:20.850> and

to finalize the look of the hand I will

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.460 
to finalize the look of the hand I will
grab<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.680> little<00:05:59.070> bit<00:05:59.220> of<00:05:59.570> polyfill<00:06:00.570> fiberfill

least it is for me I like the way that

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.450 
least it is for me I like the way that
looks<00:06:12.840> it<00:06:13.050> helps<00:06:13.350> differentiate<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:14.190> front

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
looks it helps differentiate the front

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.390 
looks it helps differentiate the front
from<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:14.910> back<00:06:15.000> of<00:06:15.360> the<00:06:15.479> hand<00:06:16.160> just<00:06:17.160> tuck<00:06:17.370> that
