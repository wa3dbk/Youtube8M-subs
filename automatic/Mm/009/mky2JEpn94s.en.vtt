France about six weeks ago and my love
of<00:00:53.609> sweet<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.940> ER<00:00:54.179> which<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.569> so<00:00:54.719> noisy

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
of sweet for ER which is so noisy

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.919 
of sweet for ER which is so noisy
actually<00:00:55.409> need<00:00:55.499> to<00:00:55.620> wear<00:00:55.769> earplugs<00:00:56.010> to

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
actually need to wear earplugs to

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.899 
actually need to wear earplugs to
protect<00:00:57.929> myself<00:00:58.109> from<00:00:58.350> ear<00:00:58.620> damage<00:00:58.859> but<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
protect myself from ear damage but I

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.369 
protect myself from ear damage but I
tend<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> use<00:01:00.569> these<00:01:00.690> instead<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.229> I<00:01:01.260> can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
tend to use these instead because I can

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.259 
tend to use these instead because I can
listen<00:01:01.499> to<00:01:01.679> music<00:01:01.769> at<00:01:02.069> the<00:01:02.159> same<00:01:02.339> time<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.179> the

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
listen to music at the same time and the

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.290 
listen to music at the same time and the
same<00:01:03.300> noise<00:01:04.229> isolation<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.550> if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.120> prefer

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
same noise isolation and if you prefer

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.540 
same noise isolation and if you prefer
is<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.050> good<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.370> bother

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
is so good that I don't actually bother

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.070 
is so good that I don't actually bother
with<00:01:08.670> ear<00:01:08.850> plugs<00:01:09.000> she<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.450> pop<00:01:09.630> these<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
with ear plugs she just pop these and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
with ear plugs she just pop these and
fit<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.409> properly<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.460> maybe<00:01:11.700> takes<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
fit them properly which maybe takes a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
fit them properly which maybe takes a
couple<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.360> minutes<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> first<00:01:12.960> time<00:01:13.200> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
couple of minutes the first time I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.649 
couple of minutes the first time I'm
actually<00:01:14.189> using<00:01:14.460> comply<00:01:14.969> films<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> these

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
actually using comply films on these

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.030 
actually using comply films on these
because<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.259> bear<00:01:16.439> forms<00:01:16.829> and<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
because there are bear forms and the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.679 
because there are bear forms and the
stuff<00:01:17.280> their<00:01:17.490> sheer<00:01:17.820> supply<00:01:18.149> why<00:01:18.420> they<00:01:18.540> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
stuff their sheer supply why they don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.630 
stuff their sheer supply why they don't
supply<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.170> comply<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> box<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.399> don't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
supply it with comply in the box I don't

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520 
supply it with comply in the box I don't
know<00:01:20.969> and<00:01:21.270> that's<00:01:21.990> probably<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.350> only

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
know and that's probably the only

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.130 
know and that's probably the only
downside<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.509> quake<00:01:24.689> cool<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.960> well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
downside to but the quake cool as well

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.230 
downside to but the quake cool as well
cos<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.469> clear<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.000> see

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
cos are clear so you can actually see

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.240 
cos are clear so you can actually see
into<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> mechanism<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> headphone<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
into the mechanism of the headphone and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
into the mechanism of the headphone and
also<00:01:29.640> as<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.479> clip<00:01:30.689> here<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:30.960> quite

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
also as this little clip here so quite

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.709 
also as this little clip here so quite
often<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> biggest<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
often that you know the biggest kind of

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.840 
often that you know the biggest kind of
Friel<00:01:33.960> t<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.409> headphone<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
Friel t with the headphone it's the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.840 
Friel t with the headphone it's the
cable<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> cable<00:01:37.409> gets<00:01:37.439> damaged<00:01:38.070> your

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
cable so if the cable gets damaged your

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
cable so if the cable gets damaged your
headphones<00:01:39.149> break<00:01:39.479> what<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.899> do<00:01:40.049> well<00:01:40.259> now

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
headphones break what you do well now

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.139 
headphones break what you do well now

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
share of actually figured out is more

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.359 
share of actually figured out is more
far<00:01:42.390> far<00:01:42.689> cheaper<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.229> replace<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.859> headphone

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
far far cheaper to replace a headphone

far far cheaper to replace a headphone

really<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.869> high-quality<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.619> you'd

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
really really high-quality as you'd

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
really really high-quality as you'd
