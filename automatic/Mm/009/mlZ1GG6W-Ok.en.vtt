00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
entire braiding process much easier now

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.729 
entire braiding process much easier now
I'm<00:00:32.009> going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> create<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.300> interesting

modification of a Dutch place I take a

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400 
modification of a Dutch place I take a
thin<00:00:37.890> section<00:00:38.130> of<00:00:38.490> hair<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:39.170> next<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> my

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
thin section of hair right next to my

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.810 
thin section of hair right next to my
face<00:00:42.230> it's<00:00:43.230> quite<00:00:43.470> short<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> doesn't

face it's quite short but it doesn't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.740 
face it's quite short but it doesn't
really<00:00:45.030> matter<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:47.160> split<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.700> into<00:00:48.300> three

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
really matter and I split it into three

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.010 
really matter and I split it into three
strands<00:00:49.220> so<00:00:50.220> I<00:00:50.400> have<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.730> Swiss<00:00:51.060> strands<00:00:51.600> then

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
strands so I have my Swiss strands then

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.710 
strands so I have my Swiss strands then
I<00:00:52.290> start<00:00:52.710> creating<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.520> Dutch<00:00:53.700> braid<00:00:53.970> so<00:00:54.540> I

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
I start creating a Dutch braid so I

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.180 
I start creating a Dutch braid so I
bring<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.230> outermost<00:00:55.739> strand<00:00:56.450> under<00:00:57.450> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
bring the outermost strand under the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.020 
bring the outermost strand under the
middle<00:00:59.190> one

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
middle one

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.139 
middle one
I<00:01:00.170> bring<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.380> leftmost<00:01:01.680> strand<00:01:02.040> under<00:01:02.790> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I bring the leftmost strand under the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.109 
I bring the leftmost strand under the
middle<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:04.040> now<00:01:05.040> again<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.700> bring<00:01:05.759> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
middle one now again I bring this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.330 
middle one now again I bring this
rightmost<00:01:06.420> strand<00:01:06.869> under<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.770> middle<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
rightmost strand under the middle one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.749 
rightmost strand under the middle one
you<00:01:09.179> can<00:01:09.359> see<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.020> middle<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.679> at<00:01:11.579> this

you can see it in the middle and at this

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.239 
you can see it in the middle and at this
point<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.329> want<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.630> section<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.350> very<00:01:13.740> thin

00:01:14.239 --> 00:01:14.249 
point I want to section a very thin

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:18.289 
point I want to section a very thin
strand<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.909> hair<00:01:15.560> as<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.740> lies<00:01:17.009> right<00:01:17.609> above<00:01:18.030> my

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
strand of hair as it lies right above my

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.730 
strand of hair as it lies right above my
braid<00:01:18.649> and<00:01:19.649> I<00:01:19.979> add<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.789> middle<00:01:21.060> strand

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
braid and I add it to the middle strand

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
braid and I add it to the middle strand
after<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.249> bring<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> leftmost<00:01:23.969> strand

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
after that I bring the leftmost strand

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.260 
after that I bring the leftmost strand
under<00:01:24.749> the<00:01:25.020> middle<00:01:25.229> one<00:01:25.560> without<00:01:26.369> adding<00:01:27.060> any

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
under the middle one without adding any

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.649 
under the middle one without adding any
hair<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.959> trend<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:29.189> as<00:01:29.429> I<00:01:29.639> bring<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
hair to this trend but as I bring the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.699 
hair to this trend but as I bring the
top<00:01:30.959> strands<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.590> hair<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.729> middle<00:01:33.709> again

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:34.709 
top strands of hair in the middle again

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.679 
top strands of hair in the middle again
I<00:01:34.920> section<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.639> very<00:01:35.969> thin<00:01:36.709> strand<00:01:37.709> of<00:01:37.889> hair<00:01:38.689> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
I section a very thin strand of hair and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.399 
I section a very thin strand of hair and
I<00:01:40.170> add<00:01:40.709> it<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.880> middle<00:01:42.119> strands<00:01:42.929> apart

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
I add it to the middle strands apart

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.609 
I add it to the middle strands apart
now<00:01:45.010> I<00:01:45.070> want<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:45.549> direct<00:01:46.020> migrate<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.350> this

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
now I want to direct migrate in this

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.530 
now I want to direct migrate in this
direction<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:48.490> should<00:01:48.549> go<00:01:48.939> almost

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
direction it should go almost

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.700 
direction it should go almost
horizontally<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:51.580> repeat<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:53.020> steps<00:01:53.350> many

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
horizontally so I repeat the steps many

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
horizontally so I repeat the steps many
times<00:01:56.399> till<00:01:57.399> our<00:01:57.790> braid<00:01:58.299> is<00:01:58.899> long<00:01:59.259> enough<00:01:59.590> I

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
times till our braid is long enough I

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.050 
times till our braid is long enough I
want<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.270> be<00:02:01.390> adding<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.920> thin<00:02:03.369> sections<00:02:03.909> of

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
want to be adding very thin sections of

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.469 
want to be adding very thin sections of
hair<00:02:04.619> because<00:02:05.619> I<00:02:05.770> want<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.070> keep<00:02:06.430> as<00:02:06.670> much<00:02:07.119> hair

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
hair because I want to keep as much hair

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.699 
hair because I want to keep as much hair
as<00:02:07.690> possible<00:02:08.009> left<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.429> section<00:02:10.709> now

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
as possible left in this section now

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.280 
as possible left in this section now
comes<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:12.250> most<00:02:12.430> important<00:02:13.000> step<00:02:13.330> when<00:02:14.080> this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
comes the most important step when this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.090 
comes the most important step when this
braid<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.950> already<00:02:15.430> long<00:02:15.730> enough<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:17.350> wrap

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
braid is already long enough I can wrap

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.430 
braid is already long enough I can wrap
it<00:02:18.540> around<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:20.080> remaining<00:02:20.560> hair<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:22.170> make<00:02:23.170> sure

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it around the remaining hair I make sure

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.780 
it around the remaining hair I make sure
that<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:23.769> all<00:02:23.980> together<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.100> agreement

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that it's all together so agreement

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.759 
that it's all together so agreement
under<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:29.590> hair<00:02:30.810> make<00:02:31.810> sure<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.530> keep

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
under this hair make sure that I keep

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.130 
under this hair make sure that I keep
