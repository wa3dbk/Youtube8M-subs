another way to fix a run-on sentence is
after<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.689> complete<00:01:31.290> idea<00:01:31.850> use<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> comma<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
after your complete idea use a comma and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.179 
after your complete idea use a comma and
then<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> space<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.079> then<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.920> use<00:01:38.159> a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
then we have a space and then we use a

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.700 
then we have a space and then we use a
special<00:01:38.640> word<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.630> use<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.369> or

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
special word we can use and but so or or

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.120 
special word we can use and but so or or
okay<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.979> again<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.049> bad<00:01:49.350> example<00:01:49.979> I

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
okay so again here is the bad example I

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.569 
okay so again here is the bad example I
called<00:01:50.670> my<00:01:50.939> mother<00:01:51.149> she<00:01:51.720> was<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:52.140> home<00:01:52.579> well
