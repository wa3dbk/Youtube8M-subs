same features as the sidekick LX that we

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.060 
same features as the sidekick LX that we
recently<00:04:23.850> reviewed<00:04:24.500> however<00:04:25.500> one<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.800> the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
recently reviewed however one of the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.740 
recently reviewed however one of the
things<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.610> we've<00:04:26.760> noticed<00:04:26.790> is<00:04:27.480> that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
things that we've noticed is that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.770 
things that we've noticed is that
because<00:04:28.169> of<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.770> smaller<00:04:29.100> size<00:04:29.270> in<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.600> end

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
because of the smaller size in the end

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.440 
because of the smaller size in the end
we<00:04:31.080> were<00:04:31.230> much<00:04:31.500> more<00:04:31.710> satisfied<00:04:32.550> when<00:04:33.210> using

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
we were much more satisfied when using

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.129 
we were much more satisfied when using
the<00:04:33.840> slide<00:04:34.139> than<00:04:34.530> when<00:04:34.710> using<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.460> LX<00:04:36.139> maybe

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
the slide than when using the LX maybe

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.980 
the slide than when using the LX maybe
it's<00:04:37.350> because<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.950> reminded<00:04:38.490> us<00:04:38.669> of<00:04:38.990> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
it's because it reminded us of the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.980 
it's because it reminded us of the
sidekicks<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.010> old<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.730> were<00:04:41.850> easy<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.630> hold

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
sidekicks of old that were easy to hold

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.640 
sidekicks of old that were easy to hold
in<00:04:43.169> your<00:04:43.200> hand<00:04:43.560> or<00:04:43.860> maybe<00:04:44.790> it's<00:04:45.060> just<00:04:45.389> because

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
in your hand or maybe it's just because

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.260 
in your hand or maybe it's just because
with<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> smaller<00:04:47.190> screen<00:04:47.639> and<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.940> smaller

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
with the smaller screen and the smaller

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.110 
with the smaller screen and the smaller
size<00:04:48.630> we<00:04:48.960> didn't<00:04:49.260> expect<00:04:49.740> as<00:04:49.980> much<00:04:50.160> from<00:04:50.610> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
size we didn't expect as much from the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.600 
size we didn't expect as much from the
slide<00:04:51.450> we<00:04:52.200> were<00:04:52.320> very<00:04:52.560> happy<00:04:52.860> with<00:04:53.130> this<00:04:53.340> and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
slide we were very happy with this and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.659 
slide we were very happy with this and
would<00:04:54.389> easily<00:04:54.990> recommend<00:04:55.350> upgrading<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:56.520> this

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
would easily recommend upgrading to this

would easily recommend upgrading to this
