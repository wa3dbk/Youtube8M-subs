scene<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.670> cut<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> inside<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
scene now you can cut out the inside of

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.299 
scene now you can cut out the inside of
the<00:00:29.400> stencil<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.140> actually<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.740> stencil<00:00:31.980> is

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
the stencil and actually this stencil is

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
the stencil and actually this stencil is
great<00:00:32.640> because<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> negative<00:00:33.930> as

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
great because you get the negative as

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.280 
great because you get the negative as
well<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.719> using<00:00:37.079> you

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
well but I'm not going to be using you

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
well but I'm not going to be using you
can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.559> there<00:00:37.680> are<00:00:37.800> trees<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.219> well<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
can see there are trees as well as the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.319 
can see there are trees as well as the
sin<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.350> snow<00:00:40.559> banks<00:00:40.950> I'll<00:00:41.460> be<00:00:41.969> using<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
sin and the snow banks I'll be using the

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.260 
sin and the snow banks I'll be using the
stencil<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.140> draw<00:00:43.410> my<00:00:44.040> snow<00:00:44.730> banks<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
stencil just to draw my snow banks and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.479 
stencil just to draw my snow banks and
I'm<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.780> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> stencil<00:00:46.770> with

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
I'm not going to use the stencil with

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450 
I'm not going to use the stencil with
any<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.480> stenciling<00:00:48.960> techniques<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.340> I'll

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
any of the stenciling techniques so I'll

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
any of the stenciling techniques so I'll
just<00:00:50.670> draw<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.300> lines<00:00:51.660> there<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> piece<00:00:52.980> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
just draw the lines there on a piece of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.270 
just draw the lines there on a piece of
white<00:00:53.370> cardstock<00:00:53.879> using<00:00:54.539> my<00:00:54.840> pencil<00:00:55.140> once<00:00:56.039> I'm

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
white cardstock using my pencil once I'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.479 
white cardstock using my pencil once I'm
happy<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.899> placement<00:00:58.140> I'll<00:00:58.620> just<00:00:58.859> draw

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
happy with the placement I'll just draw

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.469 
happy with the placement I'll just draw
the<00:00:59.550> line<00:00:59.960> and<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:02.699> I'll<00:01:04.309> flip<00:01:05.309> over<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.970> I'll

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the line and now I'll flip over and I'll

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.469 
the line and now I'll flip over and I'll
do<00:01:06.720> another<00:01:07.110> line<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.310> only<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:09.210> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
do another line just with only one of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.280 
do another line just with only one of
the<00:01:10.320> stencils<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.570> then<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.869> use<00:01:13.080> my

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
the stencils and then I can use my

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
the stencils and then I can use my
scissors<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.310> cut<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:17.570> using

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
scissors and cut them out so I using

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.300 
scissors and cut them out so I using
this<00:01:18.900> technique<00:01:19.320> I'll<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.650> able<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> create<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this technique I'll be able to create a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.840 
this technique I'll be able to create a
scene<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.479> card<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.729> actually<00:01:23.729> add

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
scene for my card and actually add

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.539 
scene for my card and actually add
dimension<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> see<00:01:25.650> how<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> end<00:01:26.369> up

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
dimension so you can see how I end up

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.600 
dimension so you can see how I end up
with<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.360> pieces<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:28.380> are<00:01:28.590> actually<00:01:29.189> made

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
with two pieces which are actually made

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.710 
with two pieces which are actually made
out<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.299> stencil<00:01:30.570> I'm<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:32.420> chopping<00:01:33.420> out

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
out of the stencil I'm just chopping out

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.690 
out of the stencil I'm just chopping out
a<00:01:33.750> part<00:01:34.650> from<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> bottom<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:36.150> piece<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
a part from the bottom of that piece and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.210 
a part from the bottom of that piece and
for<00:01:38.700> my<00:01:38.909> card<00:01:39.180> I'll<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.689> creating<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.890> standard

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
for my card I'll be creating a standard

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.620 
for my card I'll be creating a standard
card<00:01:41.490> that's<00:01:41.700> four<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> quarter<00:01:42.180> by<00:01:42.360> five

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
card that's four and a quarter by five

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.380 
card that's four and a quarter by five
and<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.899> half<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.320> I'll<00:01:43.860> cover<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.090> back

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
and a half and I'll cover up the back

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.370 
and a half and I'll cover up the back
with<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.979> patterned<00:01:47.369> paper<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:48.030> is

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
with this patterned paper which is

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.520 
with this patterned paper which is
blueish<00:01:50.240> now<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> haven't<00:01:51.689> created<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.290> card

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
blueish now I haven't created the card

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.190 
blueish now I haven't created the card
yet<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.880> white<00:01:54.090> card<00:01:54.119> stock<00:01:54.810> but

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
yet this is just a white card stock but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.459 
yet this is just a white card stock but
just<00:01:55.439> because<00:01:55.740> my<00:01:55.860> paper<00:01:56.990> patterned<00:01:57.990> paper<00:01:58.200> is

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
just because my paper patterned paper is

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.889 
just because my paper patterned paper is
very<00:01:58.710> thin<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.219> decided<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.240> stick<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.689> top

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
very thin I decided to stick it on top

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.730 
very thin I decided to stick it on top
of<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.259> card<00:02:01.649> stock<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.250> make<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.700> more

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
of a card stock just to make it more

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
of a card stock just to make it more
thicker<00:02:04.759> so<00:02:05.759> I'll<00:02:06.119> try<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.399> do<00:02:08.399> understand<00:02:09.330> how

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thicker so I'll try to do understand how

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.229 
thicker so I'll try to do understand how
these<00:02:09.810> two<00:02:10.530> pieces<00:02:10.739> go<00:02:11.099> it's<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
these two pieces go it's kind of a

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.630 
these two pieces go it's kind of a
puzzle<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
puzzle here so

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.920 
puzzle here so
I'm<00:02:13.850> following<00:02:14.630> my<00:02:14.660> stencil<00:02:15.500> there<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.930> where

gun and make sure that the ink is nice
and<00:03:21.470> dry<00:03:21.790> I'm<00:03:22.790> doing<00:03:23.150> that<00:03:23.329> because<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.840> am<00:03:24.500> both

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and dry I'm doing that because I am both

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.990

later<00:03:25.340> on<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.470> you'll<00:03:27.470> see<00:03:27.680> what<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.920> mean<00:03:28.070> now

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
later on and you'll see what I mean now

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.289 
later on and you'll see what I mean now
the<00:03:29.540> idea<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.320> make<00:03:30.530> these<00:03:30.820> trees<00:03:31.820> as<00:03:32.060> if

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
the idea is to make these trees as if

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.020 
the idea is to make these trees as if
they<00:03:32.870> were<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.500> snow<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.370> I'll<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.730> using

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
they were in the snow so I'll be using

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.420 
they were in the snow so I'll be using
this<00:03:35.150> whoa<00:03:35.570> embossing<00:03:36.170> pen<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.799> well<00:03:37.070> as<00:03:37.280> my

this whoa embossing pen as well as my
white<00:03:37.670> embossing<00:03:38.060> powder<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.840> add<00:03:39.680> some<00:03:40.010> snow

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
white embossing powder and add some snow

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.819 
white embossing powder and add some snow
on<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.760> trees<00:03:40.940> here<00:03:41.329> is<00:03:41.450> how<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:42.019> works<00:03:42.350> I'm

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
on the trees here is how it works I'm

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.270 
on the trees here is how it works I'm
using<00:03:43.100> my<00:03:43.310> embossing<00:03:43.610> pen<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.239> add<00:03:45.010> some<00:03:46.010> ink

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
using my embossing pen and add some ink

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.490 
using my embossing pen and add some ink
here<00:03:46.670> and<00:03:46.880> there<00:03:47.060> you<00:03:47.480> don't<00:03:47.720> have<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.110> be<00:03:48.260> neat

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
here and there you don't have to be neat

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.979 
here and there you don't have to be neat
after<00:03:49.040> all<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.459> snow<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:50.000> trees<00:03:50.360> is<00:03:50.510> not<00:03:50.540> neat

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
after all the snow on trees is not neat

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.880 
after all the snow on trees is not neat
it's<00:03:51.230> totally<00:03:51.709> random<00:03:51.970> so<00:03:52.970> I'm<00:03:53.510> now<00:03:54.410> going<00:03:54.470> to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
it's totally random so I'm now going to

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.100 
it's totally random so I'm now going to
add<00:03:55.070> my<00:03:55.489> embossing<00:03:55.730> powder<00:03:56.150> flip<00:03:56.959> it<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:59.110> now

I<00:04:00.350> think<00:04:00.680> it<00:04:00.799> looks<00:04:01.040> nice<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.549> can<00:04:01.970> also<00:04:02.470> work<00:04:03.470> it

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
I think it looks nice I can also work it

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.770 
I think it looks nice I can also work it
out<00:04:03.890> with<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.850> nice<00:04:06.040> soft<00:04:07.040> brush<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.730> once<00:04:08.600> I'm
