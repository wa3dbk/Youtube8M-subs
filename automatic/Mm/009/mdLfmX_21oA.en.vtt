00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.930
 Y 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.050
 man is erasmo malacara eri 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.050
 founder of eri aviation daily 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.050
 or the one that also friends welcome to 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.880
 another video more than r 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.580
 serious today have the opportunity to 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.130
 explore the piper systems a bit 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.890
 navajo and aitor and jane the classic 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.690
 tomahawk and the idea generate here is to be able 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.900
 describe to you the systems that 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.580
 make up this machine is necessary for 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.059
 the design of the plane that everything is very 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.650
 compact for two things one that weighs that 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.229
 be light on the plane that is not very 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.479
 heavy and two that is very compact to 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.690
 can accommodate the machine in the fuselage 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.890
 of the plane there is that there is a way 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.050
 specific in which this machine has been 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.910
 designed and you will be able to see it in 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.070
 a moment together with the systems of 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.979
 plane and one of the reasons my friends 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.840
 who designed this machine is able to 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.550
 put in the confined area that 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.380
 corresponds the fuselage if they are given 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.080
 you realize we do not have much space 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 to put the machine as the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.869
 cars cars we have many 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.729
 spaces or we can put the systems 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.070
 many very tall very tall boys 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.040
 but on this plane or in any type 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.560
 of airplane due to the design of the fuselage 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.990
 you have to make the machine very compact 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.750
 you can realize or achieve 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.070
 putting the opposite cylinders and 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.950
 you are going to realize how the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.480
 cylinders are opposite each other not 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.090
 it's like in the cars that are up 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.220
 down in ve or online 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.820
 here the main reason are opposite 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.040
 is that the machine weighs less produces the 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.679
 as much power as possible and occupy the lowest 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.910
 possible space other things that you 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.300
 they will be able to be account about these 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.270
 slots here this is to cool the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.430
 machine the machine is cooled by air 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.290
 the air comes here opposite it travels to 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.410
 through the heads the cylinders and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.770
 it cools the cylinders on the planes not 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.870
 We have water cooling system 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.060
 because we are always fighting 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.370
 the weight on the plane if we had a 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.070
 radiator and water lines and water in 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.900
 yes it is very heavy are the airplanes these 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.520
 They have been designed to be cooled 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.400
 with air 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.380
 here where the propeller is tied to 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.810
 motor by means of some screws 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.300
 specials and here you go to see the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.570
 belt that moves the alternator to 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.730
 produce electricity on the plane itself 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.850
 all the rest is just a piece of 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.670
 iron the blog where the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.140
 cylinders the bottom part you are going 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.780
 find the heating system 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.210
 of the plane the plane uses the same 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.940
 heat of the machine mixed with air 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.430
 cool to be able to produce heating 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.490
 in cold weather at the bottom 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.340
 they will find where the air enters 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:21.430
 carburetor to mix with the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.320
 gasoline and be able to produce power in the 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.480
 engine this part of here can see the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.330
 alternator which is the way the plane 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.730
 charges the electricity battery and the 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.950
 exhaust system very similar to the system 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.490
 of the cars we use 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.800
 us at home in this part are 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.060
 the fuel induction system 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.520
 and once it is mixed with the 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.410
 carburetor and gasoline passes here to the 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.600
 cylinders where the explosion 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.630
 where combustion occurs and it's like 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.390
 the power is going to realize that 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.580
 we have two spark plugs for each cylinder one 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.500
 in the bottom part and another the part of 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.780
 up is a little bit hard to see the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.080
 part of up with the reason is power 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.680
 have one more fuel burn and come 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.480
 more regular are to build schemes with 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.840
 the spark plug like that would burn in a way not 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.850
 regulate that helps the burning of 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.980
 fuel the other reason why 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.200
 we have two spark plugs in each cylinder is 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.420
 security is given us one of the spark plugs the 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.830
 another one is still working and we 're going to see you 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.990
 that each of the spark plugs is 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.330
 connected to a magneto are going to be able 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 tell my friends that we have two 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.020
 Hoses is a little hard to see 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.660
 here two sailors who are the ones 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.390
 they produce the spark mockery for the spark plugs 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.630
 the reason why we have two is to be able 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.450
 give a better burn in the combustion 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.740
 of the engine and also safety is given to us 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.490
 one of the sailors-- we have other 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.630
 sailors and each man has one is 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.850
 connected to each of the cylinders 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.289
 separately you can decompose a 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.259
 magneto and the other 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.029
 as producing spark that can go 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.249
 all the electrical system of the plane the 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:02.889
 battery the alternator and we can still 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:04.270
 continue to produce power because the 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.319
 spark of goods separated from the system 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.999
 electric plane is a 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.919
 security feature this kind of 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.879
 aircraft goes the battery goes away the 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.949
 alternator goes to all system 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:14.559
 electric the plane does not turn off because the 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.300
 spark comes out of the magnos another thing that 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:19.270
 we have here is a base a system this 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.159
 It is a vacuum cleaner that sucks the air 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.869
 to be able to make the instruments of 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.639
 wrapped 18,000 revolutions per minute 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:27.189
 and it's how we learn to control the 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.830
 plane has to be suction so that it does not 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.379
 between because if it were pressure if this 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.059
 send will send air to the system 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.699
 I would send oil and pollutants too 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:39.430
 just do suctioned and out 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.659
 here in that way it is anticipated that there will be no 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.449
 no contaminant within the 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.189
 instruments within the systems and in 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.779
 the bottom part you can see the 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:51.219
 machine stiles that are four and 

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:53.649
 you are going to see here a kind of 

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:55.569
 radiator but it's not water is oil 

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:58.180
 because we use the same oil of the 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.620
 machine to cool and cool the 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.310
 One- time machine are the machine in 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.890
 reality 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.560
 with air and with oil a combination the 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.470
 mix of the two and here in the part of 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.390
 down we have how the engine is 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.390
 sharp with the air frame mullions 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.160
 from the plane to the body of the plane the part 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.590
 below is formed by the train of 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:20.710
 landing and this in itself is what 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.840
 makes up the power systems of 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.640
 engine and how you can realize 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.870
 my enemies the battery is confined 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.550
 in this area too, which is what 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.230
 produces the electricity that we invite 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.970
 to start the engine in this 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.040
 part is the rod for 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.680
 Check the oil and it's how we get the 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.090
 oil levels and in the part of 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.500
 back is a little hidden so that 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.360
 you see that medium is the filter 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.740
 of oil which is what guarantees that the 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.840
 oil is pure and that does not have 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.760
 any kind of pollution that could 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.010
 damage the machine you realize 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.630
 the area is completely confined 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.390
 is designed in that way to avoid 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.980
 weight and avoid also space for here 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.560
 my friends have it as you can 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.990
 realize is a very design 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.460
 smart through the years always 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.340
 we had to be fighting in 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.830
 against the weight and size on the plane 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.150
 the machine has to be light produce 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.370
 lots of power 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.340
 of being confined there they have it this is 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:17.260
 the engine power systems of 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:19.840
 a foot story known as that of the 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.220
 insurance and two caixabank skiffs in 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.610
 action are we see you next 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.610
 chance 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.180
 and
