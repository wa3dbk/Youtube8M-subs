00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.950
 Today, Harley's helpers show their their normal 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.390
 front under 2 inches but new font forest Ines Mayer a fact 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:14.020
 in order to have already new dress already downloaded and 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.480
 Aalen from the case of me who was already worried about used 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.909
 It is important that we do not 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.009
 as an incident so 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.669
 Since when 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:26.000
 four genes the same 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.849
 that also miraculous power to incident 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.970
 now would have to over here then 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.690
 and that was the Yates fund 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.020
 that would be logical 5 here 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 under it blushed pale blablabla 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.429
 so raging does not have to know him the name text is here 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.520
 yes I can do two fields now yes I have to here now 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.170
 Oyster percent 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.800
 she shapes ext 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.080
 Enter 5 6 4 89 here but it is always important that you now this 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
 Font gut a filter that we what is there 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.810
 this name is 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.370
 Keith League 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.530
 Guess a Stoic Wolter 1 Optics 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 around 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.110
 that was gone 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 in the 10 to be clarified wearing this name 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.770
 Now that I'm working on the menu, the Wulff Institute is working for 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.840
 that will soon be and not for 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.160
 what happens before the game but next to the game itself 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.720
 2 through the times with 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.950
 o'connor find the most delicate 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.880
 In order to use we do not have to take advantage of warnings 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.080
 Why 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.280
 Now make some the question quite simply Eichert 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.380
 engages also the writing CS today which he produces Fischer TTF 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.950
 Sense to the ground 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.890
 Reto FÃ¶llmi who would now have Bayer 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.360
 then these little symbols would have the ways, such as the weapons 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.400
 or the monastery's A minor op and so on 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.860
 there would be only the declaration 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.900
 compressed the ears of the files 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.460
 For example, I used to bawl about ESL TV "Where is the mistake? 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.150
 have and have installed this incident 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.670
 the squad who did not use the signing as just for the sake of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.830
 Example at 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.719
 I think time was then the EP 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.660
 We know Jati Tomboy, yes 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.299
 That's why Bomb has been destroyed 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.039
 that's why Mea 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.299
 Change icons but always must partner 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.169
 I have done that too 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.439
 now i can adjust the size i want her to have Jarmoc 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.439
 Metzingen the canal and bug Lisbon 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.139
 Ott 200 or so 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.429
 They also made four of them 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.239
 "That may have to stay that way 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.239
 Volvo the whole agreement and leaves me completely pure 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.520
 The whole lists ask for a bit more effort later percent associated 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.959
 as a leading place of the incident 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.679
 6 there too 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.119
 it may not have to explain much for our minute or so 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.279
 but see now we have completely new incident down here 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.649
 around 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.939
 a now of course is the problem around 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.869
 the positioning of the corker gives it something else to trulli 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:18.729
 ten go 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.569
 and you do not have to 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.709
 So those are probably new ones to customize these different elements 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.729
 that is set to set or otherwise 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.889
 As I said it would be a bit more effort than it looks like though 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.049
 there are synonymous Mirror 2 2 0 Summit will show how everything in all 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.419
 yes Frieser front consequences as sees 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.729
 Visitor in Capital also saw the total fast 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.869
 im therefore only pay attention 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:48.959
 this is the name 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.409
 the rat though he is the script of the Muslims and I named the Hero 5 - 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.779
 Lemgo is standing 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.809
 yes, for example, at the CS was just as current is the luckless 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.409
 registered 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.380
 4 yes counter-strike source 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.479
 as an example Norbert counter-strike source 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.959
 that is synonymous there were six going on the file but actually means yes 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:11.199
 CS before 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.759
 yes, therefore, always use the name of the it and Shared reports 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.969
 around 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.169
 yes that 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.039
 changing who the incident is 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.330
 relatively easy like the floor 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.180
 I think forces as well as the whole can be reproduced on everything yes 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.469
 So here could apply wherever you want 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.330
 maybe just give me my stuff out 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.780
 of course, he has to make sure that she only works here with the funds 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.309
 from 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.550
 At some point there will be a second section here 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.379
 then turns down hole 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.770
 where I'm already in there bristle but almost only 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.590
 that work here economy 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.819
 and 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.999
 then Baur will display animals so far from the eventual liability of Ozzy as well so far 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.409
 good show
