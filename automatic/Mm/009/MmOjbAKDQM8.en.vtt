going<00:02:10.959> after<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.440> food<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.220> you're<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:12.700> of

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
going after that food so you're kind of

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.820 
going after that food so you're kind of
giving<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.120> FDA<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.510> little<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.500> leash

here<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.580> fiddle<00:02:16.390> around<00:02:16.599> because<00:02:17.019> you<00:02:17.140> want

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
here to fiddle around because you want

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.170 
here to fiddle around because you want
it<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.470> ultimately<00:02:17.980> come<00:02:18.280> back<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.849> people

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180

that it wouldn't happen but I mean
that's<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.319> for<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.769> world<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.459> we<00:02:24.549> live<00:02:24.730> in

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that's all for the world that we live in

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.059 
that's all for the world that we live in
and<00:02:25.000> as<00:02:25.480> far<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:25.959> like<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.379> money<00:02:26.890> is

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069

believe<00:02:34.360> in<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.599> personal<00:02:34.989> responsibility

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
believe in the personal responsibility

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.319 
believe in the personal responsibility
thing<00:02:35.680> but<00:02:35.860> if<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.190> many<00:02:36.519> people<00:02:37.030> are

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
thing but if this many people are

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.809 
thing but if this many people are
getting<00:02:37.510> duped<00:02:37.959> perhaps<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.769> FDA<00:02:39.099> needs<00:02:39.489> to

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
getting duped perhaps the FDA needs to

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.420 
getting duped perhaps the FDA needs to
do<00:02:40.209> something<00:02:40.450> more<00:02:40.840> more<00:02:41.769> transparent<00:02:42.340> to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
do something more more transparent to

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.339 
do something more more transparent to
raise<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.790> standards<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:43.420> hurt<00:02:43.900> you<00:02:44.140> you

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
point five situation just simply because

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.690 
point five situation just simply because
of<00:02:55.359> the<00:02:55.540> quantity<00:02:55.959> of<00:02:55.989> mass<00:02:56.500> production<00:02:56.739> that

of the quantity of mass production that

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.080 
of the quantity of mass production that
you<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.359> allow<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.599> just<00:02:59.290> margin<00:02:59.890> of

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
you have to allow that just margin of

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.640 
you have to allow that just margin of
toxicity<00:03:01.090> even<00:03:01.810> your<00:03:01.959> there's<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.410> certain

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
toxicity even your there's a certain

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.170 
toxicity even your there's a certain
amount<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.980> bone<00:03:03.160> that's<00:03:03.459> allowed<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.790> be<00:03:04.000> in

amount of bone that's allowed to be in

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.880 
amount of bone that's allowed to be in

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
the McDonald's weenie and stuff because

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.080 
the McDonald's weenie and stuff because
because<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.250> just<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.489> volume<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.030> they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
because of just the volume and so they

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.190 
because of just the volume and so they
have<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.269> permit<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.540> but<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.959> am

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
have to permit that but what I am

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.289 
have to permit that but what I am
shocked<00:03:08.530> by<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:08.799> just<00:03:09.190> how<00:03:09.340> low<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.970> bar<00:03:10.000> has

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
shocked by is just how low the bar has

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.030 
shocked by is just how low the bar has
been<00:03:10.329> set<00:03:10.510> whereas<00:03:11.079> like<00:03:11.230> all<00:03:11.440> natural<00:03:11.889> is<00:03:12.010> not

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
been set whereas like all natural is not

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.220
