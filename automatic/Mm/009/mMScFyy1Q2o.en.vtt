00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.430
 Yes No 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.430
 it escapes me 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.530
 soon 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.620
 hello kate thanks for inviting us to 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.850
 take a tour of the lighthouse really be with 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.460
 volkswagen advice 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.470
 I'm happy but where m is only my I 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.570
 unfortunately he could not and emma said 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.590
 something of a blanket but i don't think of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.960
 have understood very well 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.930
 well then let's go go ice cream by 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.090
 andrea we go this place was a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.220
 meeting of pirates who knows how many times 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.190
 they went up this ladder and this 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.030
 What is strange that I had never done 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.550
 first case 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.379
 who knows if there is something inside but I don't 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.760
 I have no idea but the hand in there is not there 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 I don't even pay for it 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.420
 I will do a map much more than one 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.010
 map 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.080
 I think they left it here 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.360
 deliberate if it could be one 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.640
 discovery of historical importance and who knows 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.710
 could make us discover a treasure there 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.750
 you think that would happen if we carried 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.870
 to the pirate treasure at the york museum 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.290
 city 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.410
 so 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 would be great look there is an ex 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.040
 on the map must be the point where 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.900
 the treasure is hidden 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.410
 come from the top of the hole we will make one 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.410
 perfect view 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.300
 the aip is approaching a group of rocks 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.370
 see look that way 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.040
 could be those maybe yes though 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.200
 I am far from the truth we would need one 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 car or a boat or or 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.070
 a hot air balloon 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.790
 I certainly said it because watching it is here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.060
 there a hot air balloon we go bye bye 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.920
 stefani my friends and I were there 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.810
 asking if you could not take us to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.110
 take a ride on your hot air balloon no 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.960
 joke 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.119
 of course I bring you magnificent for a 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.979
 moment we believed it but where it is 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.370
 over andrea I'm surprised 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:20.940
 or not well it seems that now the surprise 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:25.019
 voted him andrea is beautiful 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 up here already I don't even care 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.989
 more than treasure but I wouldn't be like that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.080
 sure 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.940
 and in regards to this they seem to him 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.530
 just the right ones to be able to 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.280
 get off with the balloon 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.470
 no problem courage let us hurry 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.959
 so we 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.610
 must be near these rocks not 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.860
 I'm looking forward to finding the treasure 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.709
 now we close all eyes there 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.709
 will drive the instinct I love surprises 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.940
 surprise we put that map 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.959
 to the lighthouse to make you come to the stupid 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.819
 what a surprise 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.000
 I would say that so there is no 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.760
 darling no but there is a great cake one 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.769
 cake but I'm hungry for a while 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.470
 picnic together with the best friends of the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.489
 world as a treasure and a precious one of 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.609
 this is a very great idea, namely the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.870
 maximum for so little then that 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.709
 what are we waiting for 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.709
 launch
