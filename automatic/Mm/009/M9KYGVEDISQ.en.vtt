basically a very clean substrate when

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
basically a very clean substrate when
you<00:00:38.129> get<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.610> zoom<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:38.969> brand<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.450> really

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you get the zoom in brand I really

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.930 
you get the zoom in brand I really
trusted<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.680> there's<00:00:41.190> not<00:00:41.370> gonna<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.640> any

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
trusted that there's not gonna be any

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.319 
trusted that there's not gonna be any
extra<00:00:42.390> hitchhikers<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> or<00:00:44.090> anything<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
extra hitchhikers in it or anything that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
extra hitchhikers in it or anything that
you<00:00:45.600> don't<00:00:45.930> want<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.469> your<00:00:46.500> reptile<00:00:47.100> enclosure

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you don't want in your reptile enclosure

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.959 
you don't want in your reptile enclosure
so<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.390> isn't<00:00:48.600> all<00:00:49.020> natural<00:00:49.789> Aspen<00:00:50.789> bedding

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so this isn't all natural Aspen bedding

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
so this isn't all natural Aspen bedding
the<00:00:51.300> zoomit<00:00:51.629> Aspen<00:00:52.079> bedding<00:00:52.199> obviously<00:00:52.800> it's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the zoomit Aspen bedding obviously it's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.090 
the zoomit Aspen bedding obviously it's
made<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.910> know<00:00:54.030> tree<00:00:54.840> aspen<00:00:55.559> tree<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
made from you know tree aspen tree and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
made from you know tree aspen tree and
basically<00:00:58.100> it's<00:00:59.100> 100%<00:00:59.989> Aspen<00:01:00.989> shavings

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
basically it's 100% Aspen shavings

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.680 
basically it's 100% Aspen shavings
there's<00:01:01.649> nothing<00:01:02.010> else<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.660> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
there's nothing else in here so what I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.590 
there's nothing else in here so what I
like<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.290> also<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.189> dusty

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
like about it also is it's not dusty

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
like about it also is it's not dusty
some<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> substrates<00:01:07.710> out<00:01:07.890> there<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
some of the substrates out there that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
some of the substrates out there that
you<00:01:08.369> work<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.750> dusty

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you work with are really really dusty

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.010 
you work with are really really dusty
and<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.890> tends<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.460> be<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> less

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and this tends to be one of the less

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.249 
and this tends to be one of the less
dusty<00:01:13.830> types<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.760> bedding<00:01:15.000> won't<00:01:15.840> discolor

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
dusty types of bedding won't discolor

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.679 
dusty types of bedding won't discolor
your<00:01:16.530> reptile<00:01:16.920> obviously<00:01:17.610> there's<00:01:18.180> no<00:01:18.479> dyes

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
your reptile obviously there's no dyes

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.800 
your reptile obviously there's no dyes
in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> air<00:01:19.259> there's<00:01:19.500> nothing<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.220> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
in the air there's nothing like that so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.710 
in the air there's nothing like that so
what<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> also<00:01:22.110> think<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.680> great<00:01:23.040> about<00:01:23.720> Aspen

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
what I also think is great about Aspen

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.550 
what I also think is great about Aspen
is<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> low<00:01:26.549> oil<00:01:26.990> wood<00:01:27.990> product<00:01:28.439> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
is that it's a low oil wood product and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.050 
is that it's a low oil wood product and
what<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.829> mean<00:01:28.860> by<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> some

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
what do I mean by that some of some

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.499 
what do I mean by that some of some
types<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.630> woods<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:31.110> heavy<00:01:31.500> oils<00:01:32.180> like<00:01:33.180> cedar

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
types of woods are heavy oils like cedar

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
types of woods are heavy oils like cedar
which<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.200> obviously<00:01:34.650> wouldn't<00:01:34.920> use<00:01:35.250> with

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
which you obviously wouldn't use with

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.649 
which you obviously wouldn't use with
reptiles<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.299> could<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.420> dangerous

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
reptiles because it could be dangerous

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.679 
reptiles because it could be dangerous
to<00:01:36.900> them<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.799> given<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.790> low<00:01:39.210> oil

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
to them but given that it's a low oil

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
to them but given that it's a low oil
product<00:01:41.420> your<00:01:42.420> reptiles<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.409> much<00:01:43.979> less

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
product your reptiles are much less

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
product your reptiles are much less
likely<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.759> develop<00:01:45.149> any<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
likely to develop any kind of

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
likely to develop any kind of
respiratory<00:01:46.470> issue<00:01:46.979> or<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:48.210> reptiles<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
respiratory issue or for reptiles that

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.649 
respiratory issue or for reptiles that
are<00:01:49.049> sensitive<00:01:49.649> or<00:01:49.950> even<00:01:50.850> small<00:01:51.180> animals

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
are sensitive or even small animals

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.149 
are sensitive or even small animals
because<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> great<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.070> small

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
because this is great to use for small

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.940 
because this is great to use for small
animals<00:01:53.490> too

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
animals too

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.200 
animals too
it's<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.700> bother<00:01:56.820> their

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it's not going to bother their

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's not going to bother their
respiratory<00:01:57.810> system<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.740> really

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
respiratory system so that's really

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
respiratory system so that's really
really<00:01:59.399> important<00:01:59.880> I'm<00:02:00.030> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.570> just<00:02:00.780> tell

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
really important I'm going to just tell

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.690 
really important I'm going to just tell
you<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> biodegradable<00:02:02.310> product

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
you that it is a biodegradable product

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.920 
you that it is a biodegradable product
so<00:02:02.790> as<00:02:02.820> soon<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.299> done<00:02:03.329> with<00:02:03.630> it
