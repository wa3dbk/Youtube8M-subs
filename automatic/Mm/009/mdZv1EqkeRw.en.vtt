 Today we look at this 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:15.000
 solar charger 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:20.039
 it is 5 volts 1 amp output means the second 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 exit him two he has two mean means 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.099
 i.e. a small flashlight 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.540
 here if we press the flashlight twice 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:39.329
 Well, turn off the flashlight so maybe you can 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 something to highlight something small 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:46.020
 you have one charge indicator now 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.030
 the stick went out it means three sticks 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.360
 charge left here means there is a 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.989
 it has one usb port 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.020
 there is 2 yusb port it is waterproof 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.660
 all about rubber 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.790
 rubberized you can drop it this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.049
 here is the charging from the usb port just 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.430
 not a regular cell phone case 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:19.770
 power supply means bundled with it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:26.729
 It goes that the very charge itself is not something that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:31.740
 cord to charge the little ring and here's another 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:37.829
 several adapters for this 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 charging is mini usb usual for iphone 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.409
 for some other phone 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.399
 nokia 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.380
 and this is all included 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.860
 that device is called this way 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.329
 village Solyar charger 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 in such a box it came to us not from China 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:07.649
 then there are such stubs 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 not completely fit well and the second 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.650
 also fixed that is, the water will not fall 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.239
 here and even in poor light here 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.380
 notice is happening now 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.180
 charging here is poor lighting 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.769
 all the same, the charge goes, that is, in the sun 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.440
 Charging in general will be more powerful than hell 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:41.790
 Well, let's charge something for example 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:50.099
 cell phone stick in it stick in 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:56.280
 trite soup new phone that's started 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:03:04.920
 charging well that's the way it will be 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:07.459
 charge well here the display shows 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.829
 as far as now 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.430
 battery charge is inside this 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.890
 batteries 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.489
 that is, it can charge like 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.760
 from sunlight or daylight and 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.370
 continue 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.370
 charge transfer to cell phone 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.709
 Well, that's probably all 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:37.530
 rubberized case small comfortable 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:41.450
 that is, in fact it is in size 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.450
 me in the hands of iphone 4 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.440
 Well, here are the dimensions themselves 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:54.150
 small little more 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:59.700
 iphone 4 but here 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:02.250
 everything is so small here is a reviewer yes 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.299
 that's when when I turn it off but 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.750
 look i pulled out of it 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:13.609
 charging these buttons here now 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:18.150
 will go out and it will go to sleep 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:21.440
 it's going to be a little bit of time here 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.610
 It is well suited to solar panels. 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.949
 that's good sensitive here and he 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.550
 switched to a state of charge although he even 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.199
 when returning 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.500
 the phone charge still continues 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:42.479
 charging the mod and just continues 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:47.300
 to charge it means i click on 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:52.590
 button we look how charged 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:55.620
 battery yes here we press again and he 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.690
 before I almost forgot this here 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.430
 waterproof device 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.229
 but not waterproof therefore during 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.240
 wet environment can use 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.760
 somewhere 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.599
 some raw places in nature on 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.979
 hunting 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:17.729
 where the socket you will not find 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:20.460
 so you can take it to the mountains or there 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:23.330
 where do you rest where there is no electricity with 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.789
 using such a thing you can charge 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.380
 phone mp3 player 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.340
 portable devices 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.400
 I even stuck an ipad 4 into it 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.250
 it charges but i think its batteries don't 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.940
 enough to charge the ipad because 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:46.830
 there are only 5 ampere hours and the ipad has 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:49.770
 there in my over 10 10 ampere hours there 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.169
 eleventh something here 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.240
 and now pay attention now i'm 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:58.669
 I will close the solar battery 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.260
 slowly with your hand and the indicator goes out 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.260
 I open not Qatar lights up 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:17.430
 it can be seen but not Qatar went out and now it falls 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.560
 The light is not illuminated here by me 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:25.080
 poor lighting even with bad 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:28.430
 lighting it is already charging here all 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.430
 Thank you for your attention, good luck
