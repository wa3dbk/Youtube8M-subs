00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
calling the coward is not because I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.020 
calling the coward is not because I
think<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.109> professional<00:00:46.730> prizefighter<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.940 
just there's a lot of details to be
worked<00:01:49.830> out<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.960> they<00:01:51.960> may<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.140> 15<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.740> think

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
worked out and they may be 15 I think

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.170 
worked out and they may be 15 I think
he's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> little<00:01:53.250> bit<00:01:53.370> sooner<00:01:53.610> than<00:01:53.700> me

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
he's a little bit sooner than me

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
he's a little bit sooner than me
man<00:01:54.540> he<00:01:54.660> had<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> cut<00:01:55.260> in<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.470> last<00:01:55.740> fight

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
man he had that cut in that last fight

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
man he had that cut in that last fight
and<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.790> heal<00:01:56.940> properly<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and we want that to heal properly and

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.130 
and we want that to heal properly and
you<00:01:58.410> know<00:01:58.610> we're<00:01:59.610> looking<00:01:59.640> forward<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.840> June

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you know we're looking forward to a June

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.820 
you know we're looking forward to a June
date<00:02:01.410> but<00:02:01.650> I<00:02:02.190> think<00:02:03.080> realistically<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.650> big

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
date but I think realistically the big

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.950 
date but I think realistically the big
fight<00:02:05.010> we<00:02:05.190> would<00:02:05.730> have<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.150> spend<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.900> time

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
fight we would have to spend more time

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
fight we would have to spend more time
promoting<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.650> fight<00:02:07.830> I<00:02:08.090> don't<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.270> that's

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
promoting the fight I don't think that's

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.740 
promoting the fight I don't think that's
something<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:10.019> we<00:02:10.469> wanna<00:02:10.829> rush<00:02:11.359> let's<00:02:12.359> get

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
something that we wanna rush let's get

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.750

but I can't you know
I<00:03:23.489> gather<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.090> average<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.540> 85<00:03:24.840> punched

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
I gather the average is 85 punched

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.020 
I gather the average is 85 punched
around<00:03:25.410> Pacquiao<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.100> Mayweather<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
around Pacquiao and Mayweather the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.300 
around Pacquiao and Mayweather the
average<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.390> 15<00:03:27.810> plus<00:03:27.989> around<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.590> think<00:03:29.160> will

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
average is 15 plus around I think will

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.650 
average is 15 plus around I think will
overwhelm<00:03:29.730> him<00:03:29.910> at<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.269> end

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
overwhelm him at the end

think America really needs a good
heavyweight<00:04:50.720> right<00:04:50.960> now<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:52.160> know<00:04:52.280> we're

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
heavyweight right now and you know we're

basketball and football and other sports

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.490 
basketball and football and other sports
and<00:04:55.610> so<00:04:55.790> forth<00:04:56.030> but<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.360> thing<00:04:56.540> is<00:04:56.570> we<00:04:57.230> do<00:04:57.380> need

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.090 
a good halfway to dominate a good
American<00:04:59.450> heavyweight<00:04:59.720> and<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.440> think<00:05:00.980> that

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
American heavyweight and I think that

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.040 
American heavyweight and I think that
would<00:05:01.250> be<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.550> key<00:05:01.730> to<00:05:01.940> bringing<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.960> bringing

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
would be the key to bringing it bringing

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.350 
would be the key to bringing it bringing
boxing<00:05:03.560> back<00:05:03.710> in<00:05:03.890> America<00:05:04.340> will<00:05:04.970> bond<00:05:05.180> could

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.580 
boxing back in America will bond could
be<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.510> good<00:05:05.690> heavyweight<00:05:06.169> even<00:05:06.410> though<00:05:06.500> he's
