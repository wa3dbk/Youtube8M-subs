applications in the car so some of the
applications<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.549> are<00:01:38.759> mashing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
applications we have here are mashing

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.390 
applications we have here are mashing
the<00:01:39.509> existing<00:01:39.990> navigation<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> parking

the existing navigation with a parking

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.429 
the existing navigation with a parking
application<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> car<00:01:42.869> knows<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.350> you

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
application so the car knows where you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
application so the car knows where you
are<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.799> network<00:01:44.130> knows<00:01:44.369> where<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> are<00:01:44.729> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
are the network knows where you are and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
are the network knows where you are and
then<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.420> can<00:01:45.450> mash<00:01:45.780> up<00:01:46.020> third-party

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
then we can mash up third-party

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.889 
then we can mash up third-party
