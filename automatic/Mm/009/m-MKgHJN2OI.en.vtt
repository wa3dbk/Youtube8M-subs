system<00:03:26.250> let<00:03:26.640> me<00:03:26.730> tell<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> how<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.240> works

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
system let me tell you how it works

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.930 
system let me tell you how it works
let's<00:03:28.170> say<00:03:28.350> for<00:03:28.590> example<00:03:29.070> you're<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.280> 2nd<00:03:29.850> gear

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
let's say for example you're in 2nd gear

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.000 
let's say for example you're in 2nd gear
the<00:03:30.390> other<00:03:30.570> clutch<00:03:30.930> actually<00:03:31.440> priest<00:03:31.740> likes

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
the other clutch actually priest likes

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.130 
the other clutch actually priest likes
3rd<00:03:32.370> gear<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.240> shifts<00:03:33.570> between<00:03:33.720> gears

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
3rd gear so the shifts between gears

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.080 
3rd gear so the shifts between gears
exact<00:03:34.560> click<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.130> instant<00:03:35.370> there's

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
exact click it's that instant there's

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.090 
exact click it's that instant there's
absolutely<00:03:36.480> no<00:03:36.690> friction<00:03:37.290> loss<00:03:37.440> between<00:03:37.890> gear

absolutely no friction loss between gear

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.070 
absolutely no friction loss between gear
shift<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.970> not<00:03:39.090> only<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:39.600> get<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.810> Sport

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
shift but not only that we get the Sport

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.960 
shift but not only that we get the Sport
Plus<00:03:40.230> mode<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.160> this<00:03:41.340> does<00:03:41.580> it<00:03:41.790> actually

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
Plus mode and what this does it actually

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.940 
Plus mode and what this does it actually
sharpens<00:03:42.570> up<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.840> gear<00:03:43.020> shift<00:03:43.320> that<00:03:43.650> much

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
sharpens up the gear shift that much

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.400 
sharpens up the gear shift that much
more<00:03:44.220> few<00:03:44.670> other<00:03:44.790> features<00:03:45.240> we<00:03:45.420> get<00:03:45.540> PSM<00:03:46.170> or

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
you also get a very dynamic ride as well

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.620 
you also get a very dynamic ride as well
then<00:04:10.680> we<00:04:10.770> get<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:11.010> spark<00:04:11.310> chrono<00:04:11.610> package<00:04:11.760> now
