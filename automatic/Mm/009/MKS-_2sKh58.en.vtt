00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the the retina version in the case so

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.940 
the the retina version in the case so
one<00:01:27.750> thing<00:01:27.900> i<00:01:28.020> was<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> bit<00:01:28.409> skeptical<00:01:28.770> about

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
one thing i was a bit skeptical about

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.359 
one thing i was a bit skeptical about
was<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> fastening<00:01:30.479> system<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:32.159> case

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
was the fastening system of of the case

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
was the fastening system of of the case
which<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.850> literally<00:01:33.329> just<00:01:33.509> place<00:01:34.380> this

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
which is literally just place this

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.210 
which is literally just place this
leather<00:01:34.890> flap<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.579> there<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.740> that's<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
leather flap in there and that's it so

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.120 
leather flap in there and that's it so
this<00:01:38.369> case<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:38.939> perfect<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.130> if

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
this case if we perfect for you if

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
this case if we perfect for you if
you're<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.820> business<00:01:42.000> trips<00:01:42.420> or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
you're going out of business trips or

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
you're going out of business trips or
you<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.229> want<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.500> carry<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> very

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you just don't want to carry a very

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
you just don't want to carry a very
bulky<00:01:44.430> case<00:01:44.759> around<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> one<00:01:45.810> thing<00:01:45.960> i

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
bulky case around with you one thing i

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.840 
bulky case around with you one thing i
would<00:01:46.079> say<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.920> doesn't<00:01:47.159> have<00:01:47.280> any<00:01:47.520> pockets

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
would say is it doesn't have any pockets

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.170 
would say is it doesn't have any pockets
on<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.210> back<00:01:49.040> on<00:01:50.040> either<00:01:50.310> side<00:01:50.640> or<00:01:50.820> even<00:01:51.090> on

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
on the back on either side or even on

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.240 
on the back on either side or even on
the<00:01:51.270> interior<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> fighting<00:01:52.619> system<00:01:52.890> i

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the interior but the fighting system i

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.639 
the interior but the fighting system i
think<00:01:53.490> works<00:01:53.700> quite<00:01:54.060> well<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.470> turn

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
think works quite well so you can turn

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.950 
think works quite well so you can turn
