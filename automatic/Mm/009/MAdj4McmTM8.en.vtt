00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
so much more than the t5 so I mean the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.649 
so much more than the t5 so I mean the
tea<00:01:34.140> flies<00:01:34.439> were<00:01:34.710> clean<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
tea flies were clean but this just has a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
tea flies were clean but this just has a
little<00:01:37.110> edge<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:40.770> looks<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.369> clear

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
little edge over it just looks so clear

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.460 
little edge over it just looks so clear
and<00:01:42.240> crisp<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> tank<00:01:44.960> as<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.320> see

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and crisp now in the tank as you can see

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.910 
and crisp now in the tank as you can see
on<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> back<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.840> front<00:01:49.170> actually<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on the back of or the front actually of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.389 
on the back of or the front actually of
the<00:01:51.470> over<00:01:52.759> overflow<00:01:54.439> the<00:01:55.439> shimmer<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the over overflow the shimmer that's on

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.260 
the over overflow the shimmer that's on
there<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.020> I'm<00:01:58.020> trying<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.740> scroll<00:01:59.270> from

side<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> side<00:02:00.899> here<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.729> hopefully<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:03.689> picks

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
side to side here so hopefully it picks

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.320 
side to side here so hopefully it picks

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
see we were able to get it hung with

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.490 
see we were able to get it hung with
only<00:03:09.870> using<00:03:10.500> two<00:03:10.920> holes<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.540> no<00:03:12.780> patch<00:03:13.110> work

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
only using two holes so no patch work

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.090 
only using two holes so no patch work
has<00:03:13.800> been<00:03:14.100> done<00:03:15.019> we<00:03:16.019> got<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.410> hung<00:03:16.620> straight

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
has been done we got it hung straight

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.500 
has been done we got it hung straight
the<00:03:17.640> first<00:03:17.970> time<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:20.070> rule<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.579> thumb<00:03:20.880> as<00:03:21.209> far

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the first time the rule of thumb as far

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.430 
the first time the rule of thumb as far
as<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.870> concerned<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:23.780> measure<00:03:24.780> measure

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
as that is concerned is measure measure

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.979 
as that is concerned is measure measure
measure<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:27.410> cut<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.680> drill<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:30.299> time<00:03:30.600> and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
measure and cut and drill one time and

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.920 
measure and cut and drill one time and
so<00:03:31.320> we<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:31.739> made<00:03:32.040> sure<00:03:32.579> that<00:03:33.030> we<00:03:33.180> were<00:03:33.360> doing

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
so we just made sure that we were doing

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.430 
so we just made sure that we were doing
so<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.310> kept<00:03:35.579> up<00:03:35.790> with<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:36.540> these

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so and that we kept up with it but these

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.090 
so and that we kept up with it but these
things<00:03:37.860> are<00:03:39.200> they're<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.410> awesome<00:03:40.620> right

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
things are they're just awesome right

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.000 
things are they're just awesome right
now<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.930> mean<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:42.959> can't<00:03:43.440> say<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.040> enough<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
now I mean I can't say it enough now I

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
now I mean I can't say it enough now I
know<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.660> first<00:03:48.900> day<00:03:50.030> but

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
know that this is just the first day but

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.780 
know that this is just the first day but
um<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.720> will<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.500> keeping<00:03:52.650> an<00:03:52.920> eye<00:03:53.040> out<00:03:53.070> on<00:03:53.610> my

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
um I will be keeping an eye out on my

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.520 
um I will be keeping an eye out on my
corals<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.510> see<00:03:54.690> how<00:03:54.870> they're<00:03:55.079> doing<00:03:55.560> and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
corals to see how they're doing and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.410 
corals to see how they're doing and
because<00:03:58.530> right<00:03:58.560> now<00:03:59.010> I<00:03:59.340> am<00:03:59.549> running<00:03:59.820> them<00:04:00.180> at

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
because right now I am running them at

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.199 
because right now I am running them at
this<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.590> high<00:04:01.769> point<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.459> day<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.880> hope

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
this is the high point of the day I hope

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.240 
this is the high point of the day I hope
that<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.720> I'll<00:04:03.840> be<00:04:04.049> able<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.350> see<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:04.829> I<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.220> a

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
that and I'll be able to see if I have a

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.319 
that and I'll be able to see if I have a
program<00:04:05.940> correctly<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:07.380> fade<00:04:08.100> in<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.030> out

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
program correctly to fade in and out

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.340 
program correctly to fade in and out
it's<00:04:10.109> like<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.320> sunrise<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.670> in<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.150> midday<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
it's like a sunrise in a in a midday and

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.920 
it's like a sunrise in a in a midday and
a<00:04:13.560> sunset<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.519> then<00:04:14.700> into<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.329> moonlights

and<00:04:16.289> then<00:04:16.530> into<00:04:16.950> an<00:04:17.130> off<00:04:17.370> period<00:04:18.090> um<00:04:18.830> whether

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
and then into an off period um whether

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.120 
and then into an off period um whether
it<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.130> totally<00:04:20.549> off<00:04:21.140> but<00:04:22.140> I'll<00:04:22.590> be<00:04:22.740> keeping<00:04:22.890> an

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
it is totally off but I'll be keeping an

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.220 
it is totally off but I'll be keeping an
eye<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:23.789> this

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
eye on it and this

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.120 
eye on it and this
is<00:04:24.290> the<00:04:24.500> high<00:04:24.970> midday<00:04:26.080> that<00:04:27.080> we're<00:04:27.650> looking<00:04:27.830> at

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
right now and these are only at 50% all

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.820 
right now and these are only at 50% all
channels<00:04:33.350> at<00:04:33.590> 100%<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.630> intensity<00:04:36.590> or

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
channels at 100% but the intensity or

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.540 
channels at 100% but the intensity or
the<00:04:36.890> brightness<00:04:37.880> is<00:04:38.090> only<00:04:38.570> at<00:04:38.930> 50%<00:04:39.560> right<00:04:40.340> now

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
the brightness is only at 50% right now

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.280 
the brightness is only at 50% right now
and<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:42.700> plenty<00:04:43.700> bright<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.420> there<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:44.990> I
