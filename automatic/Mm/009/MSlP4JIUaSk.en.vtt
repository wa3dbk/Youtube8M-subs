00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.550 
time this life's not about us either
it's<00:04:13.790> about<00:04:13.970> him<00:04:14.269> and<00:04:14.299> glorifying<00:04:14.930> him<00:04:15.230> and

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
it's about him and glorifying him and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.930 
it's about him and glorifying him and
sometimes<00:04:16.280> we<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.519> have<00:04:16.609> to<00:04:16.789> have<00:04:16.910> that

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
sometimes we just have to have that

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.340 
sometimes we just have to have that
perspective<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.810> we're<00:04:17.989> doing<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.289> for

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
perspective that we're doing this for

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.069 
perspective that we're doing this for
him<00:04:18.680> not<00:04:18.889> for<00:04:19.070> ourselves<00:04:19.190> or<00:04:19.609> anybody<00:04:19.880> else<00:04:20.079> so

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
him not for ourselves or anybody else so

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.480 
him not for ourselves or anybody else so
I<00:04:21.109> would<00:04:21.229> just<00:04:21.350> say<00:04:21.470> don't<00:04:21.500> give<00:04:21.829> up<00:04:21.949> hope<00:04:22.160> keep

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
I would just say don't give up hope keep

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.460 
I would just say don't give up hope keep
walking<00:04:22.850> it<00:04:22.970> out<00:04:23.060> walking<00:04:23.539> with<00:04:23.660> Him<00:04:23.870> one<00:04:24.350> day

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
walking it out walking with Him one day

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.000 
walking it out walking with Him one day
at<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.650> time<00:04:24.680> it's<00:04:25.639> awesome
