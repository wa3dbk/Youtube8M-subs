00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.780
 the citizens 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:11.899
 clients 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:15.190
 I have to become more popular every year 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.810
 in 2013 at least 217 million copies were sold 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.349
 write 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:22.130
 percent more 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.580
 and the year before and that makes it last year in 2013 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.910
 more than it is only positive 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.499
 ns has been sold 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.190
 what are you doing temporarily but do you think yes I don't know who they are 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.630
 you have to look at it 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.960
 what I am going to help very conscious choice has to do with the format of your works 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.589
 do you want a small screen 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:43.720
 with a large screen 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.030
 on a large screen the smallest and that's starting girl the 7th of June and all the big ones 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.740
 tablets 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.720
 that we were just too late today with the end of 2008 working for aa gent 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.510
 choose a small screen 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.310
 at the same time some big advantage that something like that is no longer 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.360
 is like standing and you can easily take it prepared for example 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 He is also a lot cheaper once in a while so as a big surprise 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 large screens are because of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.160
 targeted information is less easy to carry 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.640
 and they are also often more expensive than the small ones 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.890
 variants 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.050
 but well it's a lot of advantages to it 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.290
 so you can easily 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.490
 the fine 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.979
 watch a good movie how the tablet you can easily documents in this time 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.950
 view the tabloids and you can also easily view a document that I also put on one 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.440
 big screen 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.240
 the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.830
 If you have a high time there is a big success that should be said for the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.659
 next important 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.640
 this one has 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
 how are you 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.360
 that is why we had to go just like with a normal PC via the operating system 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.290
 term can rutte be able to make the three choices 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.340
 enjoy 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 eimert from medium-bargain 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.360
 and by it is currently the most used operating system and ever 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.030
 Made by Moreno has one big advantage 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.380
 what a kolder operating system is the meaning 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.500
 that you do a lot more with adjusting 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.710
 also in and around cruijff multitasking and that means you have more than a year 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.590
 be able to do it at the same time 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.790
 in the meantime the chairman has known this to work on nu.nl 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.069
 but there is none that is the most important advantage 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 and because they are often cheaper 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.059
 and each very popular operating system is armins of and hop 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.910
 the major advantage thereof 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.930
 is that the site is user friendly even children of 4 who can 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.179
 easily handle it 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:39.239
 the 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.339
 ajax not on each other unlike what one does by itself during out 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.619
 and the big advantage is that everything is just that much more work 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.819
 finally comes the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.139
 and also her own fairy tale 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.249
 By far the largest selection there is one specially made 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.439
 be limited 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:03.290
 making the thousands I suggest hundreds of thousands 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:06.039
 we also look at the boy 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.189
 he tries with his generally a lot more expensive wallander films 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.739
 just like on the pc microsoft an operating system 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.969
 for you per day 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.219
 windows 8 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.529
 windows 8 and windows 8 rodeerkerk exactly the same on the pc 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.270
 like having you 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.650
 And the big advantage is that you simply run your programs on your PC 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.770
 also adorned you can turn further you wear is actually just on 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.079
 full PC with you 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.189
 they did that behind he was on both your computer as if you have to do further 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.460
 with this response after the metro lehouck that means 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.679
 large areas 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.939
 easy to operate and ex who are specially made folks to have that 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.349
 there is a disadvantage to a loan and that is that we are currently in debt 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.269
 sir microsoft still very few clubs obtain sir intends to much 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.939
 watch hd movies when you are traveling to simply enjoy lots of games 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:03.879
 to install 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.879
 the training needed and if the discharge from the hospital 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.409
 then you actually have two options or you buy a temporary one like 16 gigabytes 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.009
 on 32 gigabytes of storage 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:19.369
 that is a fairly pricey option or you buy a further one with for example 16 

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:24.460
 gigabyte of memory and with the ability to insert the micro sd card 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.340
 to carry those micro sd cards 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.410
 that is a lot cheaper than that other option and the handy thing that we read that you 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:32.820
 exchange these 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.710
 and so is 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.949
 owner of the unlimited number of tickets and the 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:38.999
 feature films or series 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.219
 and then the question when should you have it on the internet 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.309
 a user who will have to use that especially during or in the 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:52.099
 train or in hotels that is actually not enough for a thief version vwea 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.590
 depending on it then you should pay close attention to the following 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.719
 on the death are often a logo on a 3g or 4g logo 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.360
 I see a 4G stand that means you are the fastest way out of it 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.510
 trick 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.620
 with my ankle you still have to 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.889
 take out a matching subscription 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.900
 and then something brief about the price 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.569
 we have more than 60 available 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.839
 to approximately 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.169
 900 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.789
 the difference lies mainly in the quality and the build quality of the tablet 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.680
 the speed and the screen 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.330
 jol maybe 60 euros is a great time for you, it certainly doesn't close 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.759
 from 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.639
 cameras tell that both at the rear and at the front 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.650
 of a very questionable quality 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.870
 Cameras on cell phones are generally much better such as 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.319
 displayed 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.319
 to take beautiful pictures with 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.300
 unio can mean it there with we make sure you buy a bigger one 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.909
 the second derkje 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.980
 in summary what you should pay attention to 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.940
 if you are going to purchase a third well now the first choice that should make how 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.180
 it doesn't seem to be bigger 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.139
 I think I have a small one that could easily take over the 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.689
 size and drugs so I can watch movies very easily 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.800
 then the next one is also important, namely wanting to steal three whole 

00:06:11.799 --> 00:06:15.139
 positively you go for the most used and you go for it 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.909
 user-friendly he points out van der pol or he might be for the 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.089
 complete computer experience of windows 8 and then you actually have the most important 

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.889
 made choices and you can focus on the extras 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.479
 I think that's important 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.400
 but perhaps the most important choice has been heard 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.779
 how much money i get the chance to implement 

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:37.300
 essential for success 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.330
 the 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.050
 supporters
