00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.800
 hello girls today we are going to see the tape 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.420
 moldable from cris the inah that is a 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.490
 tape that many times you will see in the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.549
 borough that put it to polish the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.580
 necklines and armholes and when we go to 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.220
 haberdashery we ask for it you can 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.820
 never has it closed because in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.490
 coarse but no, we do not find it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.700
 luckily in textile week we have been 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 the two to see if we find it at the end 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.660
 yes you have found the tape and you the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 I'll teach 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.870
 good here in the vulgar comes for buoy 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.620
 I told you to polish the necklines 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.570
 and the armholes so that they do not give 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 because as it is fabric that is cut 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.909
 the bid is quite easily in all 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.339
 what is fabric has cut to 10 there is 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.650
 to be very careful when cutting it and 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.760
 also when working with him because 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.769
 immediately an armhole goes wild 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.010
 he stays put and stays pretty 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.829
 zero 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.860
 so check here to see how says 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.869
 you have to put it thermos fix the tape 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 moldable fiselina on the edges 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.250
 of the back of the fabric so that 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.380
 the edge of the chain of the tape 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.799
 It is above the seamline 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.720
 marked chain, so if you are wearing a 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.130
 thread forming a truck that I'm going to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.690
 teach look here we have several 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.080
 measurements we have 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.260
 this is 13 millimeters that you will see 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.110
 that carries a chain and this is what 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.470
 does the reinforcement this is what reinforces 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.550
 so that the tissue does not give up 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.980
 another one of 8 of 8 millimeters and this one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.760
 which also leads as a thread 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.250
 tensioners 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.740
 that you can also see what the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.290
 same function these tapes carry a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.730
 glue that sticks with the iron is 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.040
 is placing with the iron and now you 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.000
 I will explain and then we also have another 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.750
 which is for coats, a rope 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.270
 a little bit thicker as you can 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 watch 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.010
 because you do not notice very well is the 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.939
 glue but yes it takes a glue 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.569
 If you look here at the neckline and the 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.060
 I have stuck 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.850
 and the way to put it is very simple 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 we take the tape 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.840
 we put it on the wrong side of the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.250
 We put the glue with the back of the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.180
 cloth 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.620
 and taps where you go sewing me 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.850
 here I have the sewing in a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.740
 centimeter 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.900
 a centimeter then the chain that 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.110
 match and isolated 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.620
 and to taps with the iron we're going 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.210
 putting is not you throw away because it will yield 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.700
 goes 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.140
 this is what you need to go with 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.820
 we will keep it tapping 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.790
 after we will join the pieces we will put 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.730
 the view and it will look very good we have 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.520
 very good finishes I liked it 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.800
 very much when we did not have this tape 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.790
 Well what you could do if you do not have it 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:22.410
 is to put on reinforcement what is 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.220
 the clues the views and the neckline 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.900
 armholes with interlining 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.010
 and other people what they do is also 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.800
 cut strips to the interlining bias and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.240
 put one and put a posture that would 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.200
 the same as the chain we had 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.390
 and nothing as I hope you like it knows 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.630
 that we have a moldable tape of 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.780
 fiselina and you'll tell me to see how 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.780
 they kiss you all until the next
