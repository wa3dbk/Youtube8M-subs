00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 halli hello people and sincerely 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.839
 welcome to a new snapshot 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.250
 review had just 13 to 13 w24 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.670
 has appeared fresh is what is today 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.379
 newly arrived as first come 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.500
 Not to be seen directly here but it is 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.810
 it historical pacs system came to it 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.990
 that is the old texture pack system 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.070
 that is still small tecdax but here 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 that was at least except texture 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.270
 pack system and through the rhetorical 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.780
 pacs system is replaced in principle 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.219
 again as at 15 as the one 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 format have changed from the text already 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.050
 packages only now new to come 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.750
 is that I believe the music files 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.960
 make specks in your own resort 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.649
 can one can the text files like from 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.750
 The End 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.660
 after the final fight the change 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 you can always synonymous language files 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.930
 change in it and you can do more things 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.479
 make as in the old texture pack system 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.430
 I 've just seen my texture pack 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.010
 also converted to the new format 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.049
 because there was in the snapshot for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.290
 converter where you have old text 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.000
 can format the new system and as 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.439
 second came a new game 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 tool here game room to date circle 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.540
 and one falls now theoretically 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.450
 actually stand still sun 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.180
 and do not move anymore 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.290
 euro vj it looks like that's how it moves you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
 can not get any further now 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.610
 So make an endless day or one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.979
 endless night so you freeze in principle 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.810
 the time like this game rest 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.060
 as it was before and will be available here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.409
 still in changelog wings 1 may as 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.850
 any things were added to that 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.829
 I have not done that yet 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 can recognize 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.850
 because you have the video right after that 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.549
 release comes out and therefore I know that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.890
 also not what exactly what is meant 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.869
 but the new one is if you can 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.040
 already know and the video is later 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.380
 then that could be very happy in the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.670
 Write comments 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.840
 and then a few bugs became again 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.879
 gefixed for example in psv 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.280
 The mobs were keystone at night and 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.920
 understood software so that me eg 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.090
 then always noticed and have 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.709
 a few other things you guys 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.050
 can also look in the changelog 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.209
 I have also been fixed 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.069
 and that was it in principle again for 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.459
 this week i hope we see each other 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.760
 next week neither and yes then until 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.760
